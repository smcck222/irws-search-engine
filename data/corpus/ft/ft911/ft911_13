FORGET Paul Gascoigne and any of soccer's other heroes: when Martin
Bangemann takes to the field, grown men quake.
Bulky Bangemann wears the distinctive blue shirt with 12 yellow stars of the
European Commission. With his goal of an open internal market in sight, this
fleet-footed right-winger has never seemed shy of tackling the protectionist
defence.
In Strasbourg yesterday, the commissioner resumed the toughest match of them
all: taking on the Union of European Football Associations (Uefa) over the
vexed questions of player contracts and discrimination against foreign
players.
But some members of the European Parliament fear the Commission's star
striker may be about to bottle out.
So far, it emerged, the scores are about equal.
Bangemann has just nudged through a 'gentleman's agreement' with Uefa
reinforcing the principle that all professionals are free to leave for
another club at the end of their contracts.
According to Euro-lawyers, that should mean an end to continental clubs'
attempts to extract transfer fees from former players' new clubs.
However, it may not end the lucrative market for top players.
Commission officials said there would still be a case for the new employer
compensating the old for the cost of grooming a young Pele into an
international superstar. Still, they described the agreement as the first
step towards a standard contract between clubs and professional players.
Uefa and the Commission have also exchanged pennants on another deal, under
which national associations will have to allow each first division team to
field at least three foreigners and two 'acclimatised' foreigners in
domestic league matches from the 1992 season onwards. That will be a blow to
Germany - Bangemann's home side - which restricts its clubs to two
non-nationals each.
But as football-mad MEPs are keen to point out, the new Uefa principles are
still offside according to the Treaty of Rome's rules on circulation of
professionals and non-discrimination.
As Brian Simpson, Labour MEP for Cheshire East, notes: 'That means Liverpool
could be down to Peter Beardsley and John Barnes in a European match.'
Simpson, a qualified referee, wants Bangemann to go further and press for
complete non-discrimination.
'I have a British passport and so does Ian Rush (Liverpool's Welsh
international): for him to be treated as a foreigner in his own country is
absurd.'
But Bangemann seems resigned to the fact that when it comes to soccer, most
players know how to stretch the rules.
'Professional football is commerce,' he observes.

FT  19 APR 91 / Jobless tops 2m after biggest ever monthly rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Britain passed the 2m mark in March with the biggest monthly
increase on record, unleashing fierce criticism of the government a
fortnight ahead of the local elections.
The Department of Employment's announcement that seasonally-adjusted
unemployment rose by 113,000 to 2.1m last month led to heated clashes in the
House of Commons over the government's economic record and renewed
speculation about the timing of the general election.
The record rise pushed up the unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent, from 7 per
cent in February. Unemployment has risen for 12 consecutive months and by
almost half a million since the rise began.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said: 'Mr Major's classless
society is now a jobless society for over 2m unemployed.'
Separate figures deepened the gloom as the government announced the biggest
fall in manufacturing output for three years. Between January and February,
output declined by 1.6 per cent. Officials said the rate of decline was
increasing and there was no sign of the recession reaching a trough.
Opposition parties called for further cuts in interest rates which were
echoed in private by some Conservative MPs. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, however, told the Commons that cuts would depend on further
falls in the inflation rate.
Figures published yesterday also showed that average earnings across the
whole economy rose 9 1/4 per cent in the year to February - compared with an
annual rise of 9 1/2 per cent to January. Smaller bonuses and a drop in
overtime hours worked had produced the drop, officials said. It would be
hasty to attribute it to an easing in inflationary wage settlements.
Mr Major's close advisers insist that an unexpectedly good result in the May
local elections could yet persuade him to seek a new mandate in June.
However, yesterday's figures, which confirmed that the brunt of the jobless
rise is being felt in Conservative-held seats in south-east England,
reinforced the view of most ministers that the autumn now looks the earliest
possible general election date.
There has been the first substantial rise in service sector unemployment -
concentrated in the south-east - since 1982, with a rise of 82,000 in the
last quarter of 1990.
With any improvement in the employment outlook likely to lag the expected
upturn in the economy later in the year, some senior colleagues believe that
the prime minister would do better to wait until next year before calling an
election.
Labour plans an intensive campaign to taunt Mr Major for his refusal to call
a summer poll, using it to reinforce its charge that the prime minister is a
'ditherer'. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, called Mr Major the 'prime
minister of unemployment'.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said the UK unemployment rate
was lower than the European Community average of an estimated 8.5 per cent
last month.
As the government was 'clearly winning the battle against inflation,' there
would be a return to employment growth, he said.
For the short-term, however, most economists expect unemployment to rise for
another year. The employment department said the underlying trend - based on
the rate over the three months to March - had risen to 83,500 a month.
On an unadjusted basis, the jobless total increased by 97,000 to 2.1m.

FT  19 APR 91 / Gorbachev fails to settle Kurile islands dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SOVIET UNION and Japan failed last night to reconcile differences dating
from 1945.
Soviet hopes that Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, on his first trip
to Japan, might secure a new source of aid for his ailing economy ended in
disappointment in spite of late-night efforts and no fewer than six summit
meetings with Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister.
A joint communique, signed with ceremony at midnight, did no more than
commit the two parties to further talks on the territorial dispute over the
four Kurile islands, or Northern Territories, which has plagued relations
since the Second World War.
Despite repeated efforts, Mr Kaifu failed to win any acknowledgment of
Japan's claim to the Soviet-held territory. The main concession was the
Soviets' explicit recognition - for the first time since 1956 - of the
existence of the territorial issue.
The Soviet side also agreed to reduce the number of troops on the islands
(the Japanese had asked for their removal), to allow Japanese visits to the
islands without visas and start mutual economic activities there.
At a press conference early today the Soviet leader said the two sides could
feel more confident about a breakthrough in the future, 'but everything is
ahead of us.'
Mr Gorbachev and Mr Kaifu held six sessions totalling more than 10 hours
devoted to the issue, which Mr Gorbachev later described as the toughest he
had had for some time.
Mr Kaifu, in a press conference, said he hoped that after 45 years of
waiting, talks which would lead to a peace treaty would now be accelerated.
The territorial dispute has blocked the signing of a Second World War peace
treaty.
It became apparent even before the communique that the hope invested in the
meeting had been excessively optimistic. The Soviet desperation for aid and
technological help bred an expectation that a 'sale' of the islands might
yield at least Dollars 20bn. On the Japanese side, hopes were fanned by
politicians who wished to make their mark on history with a settlement.
Domestic constraints on Mr Gorbachev, including military opposition to
concessions, did not allow him to go as far as many thought he might.
The Soviet leader leaves today for a one-day visit to South Korea and talks
with President Roh Tae Woo.

FT  19 APR 91 / BSkyB acts to resolve row over high quality television
pictures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SKY Broadcasting could be transmitting higher quality pictures for
reception on wide screen television sets by the end of the year under a
proposal before the European Commission.
The move could end a potentially serious row over European television
standards and represent a big step towards eventual adoption of a system
under which high definition television would be provided throughout Europe.
This would help free movement of production equipment, television sets and
programmes.
A current European Community directive requires all satellite broadcasters
to use the Mac system which provides better pictures than those from other
television transmission systems.
BSkyB - formed last year from the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting
and Sky Television - avoids the Mac requirement by transmitting from Astra,
which is a telecommunications rather than a television satellite.
The proposal being discussed with the Commission envisages BSkyB
broadcasting simultaneously in its existing Pal system and in a Mac system
called D2-Mac, but only if the Commission pays the additional cost - of more
than Pounds 5m a channel a year.
The D2-Mac system was created as a half-way house to European high
definition television, which is expected to be introduced in the mid-1990s.
A directive is under discussion which could impose D2-Mac on all satellite
broadcasters, a move favoured by some EC governments.
If D2-Mac became the satellite standard, Pal could be phased out for
satellite use over three-seven years, rendering much European satellite
reception equipment obsolete.
BSkyB says it is prepared to broadcast first one and then the second of its
movie channels in the new wider screen format using D2-Mac. If there was
enough demand the sports channel could also be broadcast in the format.
Agreement by BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the
Financial Times, has a significant stake, to broadcast in D2-Mac would
provide a big boost to Europe's efforts to create its own advanced
television system.
The enhanced standard suffered a serious blow when BSB merged with Sky. BSB
had
used D-Mac, a British variation of D2-Mac, but the merged organisation made
clear it would broadcast in Pal. Its decision had represented a setback to
the prospects for the Mac system.
EC telecommunications ministers meet on June 3 to decide on the new
satellite broadcasting directive to succeed the one expiring at the end of
the year. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the technology commissioner, has said
new legislation should be combined with a consensus approach to resolving
the standards issue.
Simultaneous D2-Mac and Pal transmission by BSkyB, one of Europe's largest
satellite broadcasters, would mean that confrontation with the Commission
could be avoided.
British-based television makers threw their weight behind the drive to
create a single European satellite standard. Lord Chapple, president of the
British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers' Association, expressed
support for D2-Mac, in effect withdrawing the manufacturers' backing for
D-Mac, which has been used only in the UK.

FT  19 APR 91 / Shake-up at Treasury as Burns succeeds Middleton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR ruffled Whitehall's establishment feathers yesterday with the
announcement that Sir Terence Burns is to replace Sir Peter Middleton as the
permanent secretary to the Treasury.
The appointment, triggered by Sir Peter's decision to switch to the private
sector as a deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, signals the accession of a
relative outsider to perhaps the most important job in Whitehall.
Sir Terence has been in the Treasury since 1980 as the government's chief
economic adviser but became a permanent civil servant only two years ago
with his appointment as a second permanent secretary.
He now takes a post which formally ranks second to Sir Robin Butler, the
cabinet secretary, but in many respects carries equal influence.
The 47-year-old Sir Terence, a down-to-earth northerner who shares Mr
Major's passion for soccer, has been closely associated with the
government's economic policies since helping to frame the Medium Term
Financial Strategy in 1980.
His appointment was pressed by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, against the
established convention that the job should have gone to a long-serving
Whitehall insider.
The Treasury expectation was that Sir Peter's replacement would be Mr Nigel
Wickes, senior official responsible for overseas affairs.
Mr Wickes is one of three second permanent secretaries - essentially
deputies to Sir Peter.
Mr Lamont, who has already upset Treasury traditionalists by choosing a
relatively junior 30-year-old as his private secretary, insisted that Sir
Terence was the best man for the job. That judgment was backed by Mr Major
who established a close relationship with Sir Terence during his own
chancellorship.
Mr Major earlier showed his willingness to bypass Whitehall's carefully
built promotions ladder when he appointed Mr Gus O'Donnell, a Treasury
economist, as his Downing Street press officer.
One minister with close contacts with the Treasury said last night: 'There
will be plenty of elegant noses put out of joint, but this is the new
regime.'
Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, was told of the promotion in advance
because of Sir Terence's long association with the present government.
It is thought that Mr Smith, who has met Sir Terence on several occasions
and is known to like him, took the view that the new permanent secretary
would accept Whitehall conventions and be happy to serve a Labour
chancellor.
One Labour official said: 'He has never advertised any political connection
with the Tories.'
The 57-year-old Sir Peter, whose move to Barclays will be delayed until
November under the rules for outside appointments for civil servants, has
been permanent secretary since 1983.
On becoming third deputy chairman at Barclays, Sir Peter will take over one
of the banks' toughest jobs. He is scheduled to become chairman of the
bank's capital markets and investment banking operations.
He will succeed Sir Martin Jacomb, the barrister brought in by Barclays in
1985 to mastermind the creation of its investment banking operations,
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, at the time of the Big Bang reforms in the City.
Sir Terence was told about his new job at the Treasury on Tuesday evening.
He was said last night to be 'delighted' by the appointment.
He was first appointed to the Treasury by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the former
chancellor, from a career in research and economics consultancy at the
London Business School.
Until his appointment Sir Terence had never met Mrs Margaret Thatcher but
the two were subsequently said to have got on well.
Sir Terence has a reputation as a pragmatist in the area of economic theory,
willing to change his mind when the occasion demands.
In the late 1970s, he argued against Britain joining the European exchange
rate mechanism, but in more recent years he has been a staunch advocate
within the government of British entry - which took place in October last
year.
Sir Terence, a season-ticket holder at Queens Park Rangers, the London
football club, relaxes on the golf course and by playing the recorder. He
will receive a salary of Pounds 96,210, a Pounds 20,000 increase on his
current pay.
The Treasury is not appointing a successor to Sir Terence for the time
being. The post of economic adviser will be filled on a temporary basis by
Ms Rachel Lomax, Sir Terence's deputy.
The unexpected resignation was announced yesterday of Mr Howard Macdonald,
chairman and chief executive of NatWest Investment Bank, the troubled
subsidiary of National Westminster Bank. Page 24

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (6): Passion cooling rapidly -
Supply and demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PASSION for business parks which drove builders and occupiers into a
frenzy during the prosperous years is cooling rapidly. The affair clearly
developed too far and too fast. Companies are no longer so impatient to rush
out of crowded town centres into gleaming glass boxes on greenfield sites,
and developers have to think again about wooing them with vast numbers of
new buildings.
That might be a blessing in disguise as there were always going to be more
parks than the market could bear, even during a a surge in business. For
some it is too late for a change of direction. They planned the wrong
buildings or put the right ones in the wrong place, assuming that tenants
would take what they were offered as long as it looked like a business park.
It will be hard to fill this space, let alone achieve rents required to meet
land prices which soared over Pounds 1m an acre in some over-heated parts of
the south.
Not every park is a potential disaster; in fact, the best are racking up
rents comparable with neighbouring town centres. Nor has demand completely
disappeared; tenants are merely taking longer to make up their minds. More
than 10m sq ft was absorbed in 1990, but this was down by 20 per cent on the
previous year and less than 1.5m sq ft has been taken up so far in 1991,
according to the business space database compiled by Applied Property
Research.
Unfortunately this slowdown has coincided with an unstoppable surge of
development which saw completions almost double to 15m sq ft in 1990 and
provide for another 13.5m sq ft this year. Little new is being started
without a pre-let but the cumulative stock is equivalent to more than 18
months' supply at present take-up rates, says APR.
Gross figures hide wide variations in quality. 'We have been searching -
along with other agents - for new buildings required by Nissan and Smith
Kline and keep coming back to the same ones,' says Roger Saper at Jones Lang
Wootton. 'There is very little around in the 100,000 sq ft bracket worth
considering.'
Sometimes the buildings cannot be faulted but are in locations which cannot
compete for town centre tenants because of poor communications or amenities.
Jonathan Walters of Hunting Gate Developments points to office buildings on
industrial sites 'masquerading as business parks' which would remain unlet
for a considerable time even when the economy recovers. His own project, the
760,000 sq ft Shire Park in Welwyn Garden City, had proven the importance of
careful planning and location, he says, drawing names such as Digital and
ICI.
Only about a dozen schemes are true business parks, and they are due to
provide around 15m sq ft within five years, 6m of which has already been
taken, according to James Donald of Strutt &amp; Parker. A similar amount is in
the planning pipeline and will take 10 years to feed through. 'Demand for
true parks will continue to exceed supply for the foreseeable future,' he
says.
But what happens to the 'false' parks. Lesser schemes could be forced to
revert to warehousing and industry, even though office prices were paid for
the land. The economics may not always be too steep a problem, says Mr
Saper, as rents for warehousing west of London have grown into double
figures. 'But there is still a lot of pain to be disclosed following
imprudent purchases during the boom,' adds Mr Walters. Forced or not, a move
away from pure offices would bring a welcome return to the distinction with
industry/warehousing parks which was lost in the fervour of the property
boom. APR says 70 per cent of the buildings now being constructed are pure
offices, most of them concentrated in the south-east.
However, difficulties may be in store for even the most successful office
parks. Some sprang from the relaxation of planning regulations in 1987 which
enabled flexible-use buildings to be provided for high-tech companies
needing a combination of offices, storage and production space. As values
soar over Pounds 30 a sq ft, those tenants will be considering the sense of
paying such high rents for non-office space. A new surge of relocation off
these parks could be in store as rent reviews come up, say Fiona Denby and
Ian Scott at Fletcher King. They see an opportunity for re-emergence of the
high-office shed - once dubbed mid-tech but now labelled more accurately as
'flex-tech'.
These provide up to 50 per cent office content at the front but a shed with
six-metre eaves and roller doors behind. The flexible use conforms to
original intentions in the planning changes but rents are closer to industry
than offices. For instance, at Slough Estates' Winnersh Triangle in Reading
and Burton Property's City Park in Welwyn, costs are around 60 per cent of
equivalent office space.
One danger is reverting too far. Denby and Scott emphasise the need to
maintain advances made in parking provision, landscaping and building
materials since the days of the bog-standard trading estate. Future
large-scale business centres - dubbed 'fourth generation' parks - will
probably have to provide a mix of pure office and multi-use facilities,
separated into sub-parks but sharing similar communal amenities and
low-density sites.
Some flexibility is already being built into parks such as Aztec West, near
Bristol, where Arlington has recognised the need for smaller office
buildings. Set around courtyards and lakes with wine bars, leisure clubs and
cafes, the aim is to provide an intimacy redolent of the town centre. The
fact that tenants are willing to pay town-centre rents of Pounds 16.75 a sq
ft shows the success of such innovations.
The popularity of business parks seems assured. Some big deals are in the
pipeline, particularly in the pharmaceutical, food and drink sectors, which
are gearing up for the single European market. Almost 40 per cent of park
tenants are planning to expand and a queue of others ready to move in, says
Andrew Jackson of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. Spectacular figures for
potential overall supply become almost irrelevant, as they take no account
of widely varying quality. Usually it is only experienced developers such as
Speyhawk, Trafalgar House and Arlington who can provide the standards
necessary to attract employers.
'The landscaping, leisure clubs and shopping are not just for decoration.
Companies need them to sell the idea of relocation to employees used to city
centre facilities,' says Peter Mantle of Jones Lang Wootton. That is why
designers harp on about a minimum size for these parks; only the big ones
can afford this sort of service. The rest may be better off looking for a
different sort of customer.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (7): Eyes on the environment -
Planning is becoming more sophisticated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF the increase in awareness of the environment and the more
forceful lobbies of the conservation bodies, developers of business parks
are still casting their eyes over green field sites. However, that said,
many of the proposals put forward in the prosperous years of the 1980s are
never likely to succeed.
Developers in the 90s, however, know that they must take a hard look at
environmental issues and put forward packages to planning authorities which
offer real benefits to the community in general and, in some cases, specific
benefits to special interest groups.
Awareness of the environment is not all that is required. The approach of
developers seeking to build on green belt sites is becoming much more
sophisticated and considered, says Nicholas Taylor of solicitors Berwin
Leighton. Rather than take on the government through the traditional appeal
procedure, with the offer of planning gains which in some cases amount to
little more than bribery, developers are seeking to have land taken out of
the green belt through the new local plans.
This is particularly so when it comes to 'brown field' sites which, though
actually in the green belt are polluted in one way or another. Stockley
Park, a former rubbish tip transformed into what is arguably one of the best
true business parks in Europe, is an example of this type of site.
The Rutland Group's Bedfont Lakes, just south of terminal four at Heathrow
is another. Although lying within the designated green belt it had been
worked for minerals for 60 years and the resulting excavations filled,
causing the inevitable risks of carbon dioxide and methane gases.
The planning process at Bedfont Lakes provides, says Mr Taylor, a
particularly good example of the new 'balance sheet approach'. Begun before
the introduction of the Environment Protection Act 1990 which enforces
stringent measures on owners of old landfill sites to clean them up, this
initially involved wide consultation with the local community and the local
authority, the London Borough of Hounslow. Mr Ian McDonald of Roger Tym and
Partners, who was the coordinator of Rutland's professional team, says that
in all such cases the starting point is to discover what the local authority
is trying to do; then to check the balance between the land lost from the
green belt and the resulting benefits to the community.
Over the past few years public consultation has become de rigueur for
promoters of large-scale developments, regardless of whether they are in or
out of the green belt. However good the proposals, says Mr McDonald, there
are bound to be those who will always be opposed just for the sake of it.
But even after a full and serious debate, he says, it comes down to Can they
believe you? Is the developer really able to deliver all that is being
promised?
The Bedfont Lakes development will include 188 acres of attractive green
belt land laid out for recreation and sport, including fishing,
horse-riding, birdwatching and nature conservation. The 17 acres of
non-conforming industry will be removed, there will be seven acres set aside
for housing and various measures will be taken to improve the traffic.
To pay for all this the Rutland is developing 800,000 sq ft of high quality
offices in a 33-acre business park and a further 200,000 sq ft of industrial
space on a separate site. The first phase of the office park has been sold
to a joint venture between IBM and MEPC which is developing 343,000 sqft of
offices - of which IBM itself will occupy 185,000 sq ft - on 18 acres. The
seven buildings, designed around a formal landscaped square, are due for
completion next year.
There remains, however, according to Ms Diane May of Jones Laing Wootton, a
strong presumption against business park development on green belt sites in
the south-east although planners are more likely to listen to proposals on
sites where new development will not only replace existing non-conforming
users but also provide further benefits.
Ms May cites the Clayform/Maple Oak development at White Waltham, a 33-acre
site adjoining the airfield. The new development will replace an old
industrial estate and, in addition, the developers will construct a new road
to the A4 and a new railway bridge.
Present government policy is perceived to be one of leaving it to the locals
via their local plans. However, in some areas the Department of the
Environment is nudging local authorities into designating areas for business
parks in their unitary plans. A case in point is Birmingham where the DOE
issued a circular (PRO 10) putting forward strategic guidance for the West
Midlands. In essence the circular stated that further sites for business
parks should be released at the right time, that is when Arlington's
successful 148-acre Birmingham Business Park next to the National Exhibition
Centre and the M42 and the M6 has reached capacity.
The site, which has already attracted a number of Blue chip occupiers, has
planning for some 2.5m sq ft.
The DOE's circular has spawned several competing proposals which have been
the subject of a lengthy public inquiry. All the sites are located close to
the M42 motorway. The five main sites are located in the green belt but only
one, that of Blythe Valley Park, west of junction 4 in Solihull, has been
designated as a business park site by the local authority. And this site,
being put forward by Speyhawk with Solihull Council, with Arlington and
Tarmac's Partway South East Site, south of junction 3, are thought to be the
front runners. Other contenders are Shirley Farm Estates with a site south
of junction 4, RM.
Douglas's Weatheroak Park north west of junction 3 and Edmonds' site on the
A435 south of junction 3.
How many of the sites will get the go-ahead and when is not clear. The
triggerpoint for the timing of the release of the next site is likely to be
when Birmingham Business Park is 75 per cent full. Opinions vary on when
this point is likely to be reached but there is a feeling that this should
happen in about three years. If this estimate proves correct, there is a
case to be made for one of the sites being released straight away. The
drawing up of master plans and the putting in place of the considerable
infrastructure required before a construction start can be made on a true
business park development could easily take three years.
The West Midlands is aware of its need to attract high-calibre employers if
it is to recover from the erosion of its traditional industrial base. To do
that it has to offer organisations the right kind of working environment in
the right areas well served with communications.
The West Midlands is not alone. Other regions are becoming aware of the
necessity of attracting new employment opportunities. In Manchester, AMEC
Properties and the Scottish Life Assurance Co have linked up with the
Universities of Manchester and Salford, UMlST and Manchester Polytechnic to
promote a development at Davenport Green which would provide European
headquarters buildings for three large international companies. On a
350-acre site - with 260 acres of parkland maintained in agricultural and
recreational use is located alongside the M56 and within five minutes of
Manchester International Airport.
Public consultation is now under way. The balance sheet is being drawn up.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (4): Expectations far too great -
Why tenants become dissatisfied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO COMPANIES get the business parks they deserve, or should developers be
responsible for ensuring that their business park tenants remain satisfied?
This philosophical issue is raised by research carried out last year by
Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. The surveyors interviewed 140 companies,
occupying 3.6m sq ft or 15 per cent of all space taken up on business parks
since 1987. And first impressions are that occupiers have only themselves to
blame if they are dissatisfied with their choice.
'Occupier satisfaction is inversely proportional,' the surveyors concluded,
'to the weight attached by would-be occupiers to the various attributes . .
. at the time the decision . . . is made.
'When selecting between competing schemes, occupiers place considerable
emphasis on location, accessibility, environment and image. As a result
these attributes have generally proved satisfactory. In contrast inadequate
attention is given to . . . the size of the scheme or . . . the
dissatisfaction in later years.'
But if it is true that tenants are at fault in regarding real estate matters
of secondary importance, the developer - by definition a specialist in
property - must be better placed than the incoming general manager of, say,
a software business, to spot or avoid the ominous list of problems ranging
from leaking windows to poor insulation or prohibitive running costs.
Yet, it would be no fairer to place the onus for customer dissatisfaction on
the developer. He too, in some respects, can be a victim of the pressures
which led to the growth of out-of-town business parks during the 80s. As
Debenham notes, it was somewhat naive to extol the virtues of an out-of-town
location without providing for or addressing its notable drawbacks.
Car parking and a better environment are not everything. Rural locations can
mean isolation: poor public transport and back-up facilities, few neighbours
and only a few staff nearby. These problems have been under-estimated: from
government anxious to alleviate the problems of congestion in the main
cities, to local planners eager to promote their own districts.
If developers cannot be held solely responsible for creating business parks
in poor locations, neither should they bear all the blame for occupiers'
dissatisfaction with their buildings and amenities after a few years. Some
of this dissatisfaction springs from increased expectations and the changing
nature of industry's needs.
Demand for air conditioning and suspended ceilings, for instance, has been
so swift and widespread that it is not surprising that some developments
have been caught out. It will be a sign of the maturity of business parks as
an idea when enough of them exist to offer a range of specifications so that
occupiers can move from one set of premises or from one park to another as
their needs change.
Meanwhile, occupiers will continue to complain about the lack of such
amenities as their expectations rise and they begin to think they should be
offered as standard. That is just a fact of life and all the developer can
hope to achieve is to run constantly just behind the demand.
The occupier must take responsibility, however, for demanding the level or
specification which he can reasonably predict that his business will need.
After all, just as the property specialist knows more about insulation and
window seals, so the business manager should know what services he needs.
Complaints about the lack of amenities in the park itself rather than within
individual premises are frequent; and here responsibility should probably be
shared. Genus, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary, is well satisfied on the
whole with its new headquarters on 87-acre Crewe Business Park in
Derbyshire, but Dr John Craven, its managing director, does confess to a
feeling of isolation. Genus and Barclays Bank are the only two companies to
be actually on site.
It is probable that Genus would have been better to wait until the park was
in a later phase of its development. For their part the joint local
authority developers should probably have addressed the question of on-site
facilities at an earlier stage. Only now, for instance, are they talking to
Holiday Inn about an hotel which will provide restaurant services to local
workers as well as to hotel guests.
Another area where responsibility should be shared is traffic planning. Most
companies which consider moving to a business park do so, at least in part,
because of the traffic congestion in traditional town centres. But it is no
use having good car parking and service roads on a business park which then
deposits its inhabitants directly on to one of the more arid stretches of
the M25 with no choice but to join the traffic jams.
Debenham believes that access to public transport is bound to become an
important issue. Some would say that that time has arrived, but most
developers still regard business parks as a by-product of the age of the
car. Even an enlightened business park developer, such as Trafalgar House,
still believes that business parks and car parks go hand in hand.
That attitude, if it continues, will severely limit the progress of business
parks as an alternative to town centre locations, since there will be fewer
and fewer sites (particularly in the congested south-east) which do not lead
to traffic jams.
Traffic planning is an issue on which occupiers and developers must unite;
for, combined, they would form a powerful lobby which could force local
planners to improve transport communications.
At a different level, communications between occupiers and developers could
also improve the level of satisfaction in future business parks. Debenham's
study quite rightly pinpoints the developer's ignorance of users' needs as
one of the causes of dissatisfaction. Are developers right, for instance, to
place too much emphasis on providing bespoke premises, a feature in nearly
all marketing today?
Debenham's research suggests that occupiers are, on the whole, no more but
no less happy in off-the-peg properties whether fully fitted or finished
just to shell and core standard. Few businesses seem to know this fact about
themselves in advance. Detailed talks with the developer at a very early
stage could prevent a significant source of future dissatisfaction.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (5): Bridging the generation gap -
More ambitious schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE concept and definition of business parks has evolved rapidly since the
reflective buildings of the late 70s and early 80s. Then, the term 'business
park' was applied to almost any group of buildings at a density of around
18,000 sq ft to the acre with some kind of landscaping and better than
average provision of parking.
Now, the new 'true' business parks are unlikely to be sited on less than 100
acres and will include many additional facilities for the occupants and the
local community.
Early parks, in out of town locations, were unable to compete with town
centres in terms of places to eat, drink, shop and all the other amenities.
In addition, there were few attempts to offer accommodation for
professionals such as solicitors and accountants, let alone workplace
nurseries and creches, health clubs or hotels.
The new generation of business parks - dubbed the 'fourth generation parks'
by some - will offer a full range of ancillary facilities alongside top
quality and flexible buildings.
The 650-acre Kings Hill project at West MaIling, Kent, is one of the
most-often cited 'fourth generation' business parks. Its US developer, Rouse
and Associates, already has more than 200 business buildings housing 4,000
tenants under its belt on the other side of the Atlantic.
Very low density - only 12,500 sq ft will be built on each acre - the
emphasis at Kings Hill will be on quality; of both buildings and the
environment.
Rouse is now at work on the first phase of B1 space. Total space after a
10-year development programme will run to some 3.8m sq ft.
This first phase of some 150,000 sq ft will include a US-style 'flex'
building of between 30,000 sq ft and 40,000 sq ft. A 'flex' building is
single-storey, finished to shell and core and capable of multi-occupation by
a group of users ranging from light production to full office use.
Each occupier has their own front door. It is, says Mr. Roger Saper of Jones
Lang Wootton, a 'bit like a cucumber - it can be sliced up in any
combination.'
Kings Hill will also include housing and on-site amenities of many types,
sporting, recreational and perhaps even educational - there is already a
link-up in hand between an American college and local educational
establishments which would establish a facility offering a broad range of
courses.
Arlington's Solent Business Park forms an integral part of the Whitely local
plan and could also be considered a 'fourth generation' park, according to
Mr Ian Warboys of Strutt and Parker. This is because it is at the hub of
what is becoming a substantial new community.
Equidistant from Southampton and Portsmouth on the M27 motorway the park
runs to 145 acres with a further 50 acres for subsequent development. Among
various amenities are a hotel and it is adjoined by a variety of housing -
from five- to six-bedroom 'executive' homes down to two-bedroom terraced
houses.
The local plan also designates adjacent areas for schools, a golf course,
woodland, a sportsground and nature reserves.
Another park to fit the 'fourth generation' tag is the development of the
former 320-acre airfield and race track at Brooklands near Weybridge in
Surrey by Trafalgar House jointly with British Aerospace. Here, planning has
been obtained for 750,000 sq ft of B1 space on the first 50 acres. Amenity
elements of the development will include a supermarket and hotel and 25
acres has been set aside for housing.
However, some consider that it is wrong to classify business parks by
generation - or by when they just happened to be built.
Some parks have evolved with the changes that have taken place in demand
patterns, architecture and the thinking of the planners over the past 10
years.
Arlington's Aztec West at junction 16 of the M5 six miles from Bristol ranks
as one of the largest, most developed business parks in Europe. On 157
acres, more than 1.1m sq ft has already been built and another 350,000 sq ft
is under construction. A further 20 acres are available for expansion.
Aztec West (The A-Z of Technology) was a bold concept when ESN started
building in 1980. It was a first generation flagship. Then came the second
generation with its mixed use or 'fudged to confuse the planners' -
'high-tech' buildings. The third generation was born wIth the introduction
of the B1-use class in 1987. Examples of all of these phases of evolution
are to be seen at Aztec West which was acquired by Arlington in 1987. But
the park also now offers a 90-bedroom hotel, shops, restaurants, a public
house, an exhibition area and other communal facilities housed in the
central Aztec Centre. Landscaping is first class and there are large housing
projects at nearby Bradley Stoke.
Intensive and meticulous on-site management including post occupancy
evaluation of occupiers' levels of satisfaction and on-going needs are also
necessary for the smooth running of a big business park. Arlington has an
on-site team at all its business parks and makes a point of keeping close to
its end users. Aztec West, then, one of the pioneers of business parks -
although launched as a 'science park' - can justifiably claim to have made a
smooth transition from the first generation into the fourth.
There is unlikely to be a rush to begin new fourth generation parks. These
very large projects are likely to take 10 years to build.
And the amount of front-end investment in obtaining planning, drawing up the
master plan and putting in the vast amount of infrastructure required before
building can start at all is, says Mr John Heawood of Debenham Tewson and
Chinnocks, 'mind-blowing'. Economic prospects over the next decade are
uncertain and there are very few players with the necessary financial
muscle.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (3): Buyer's market for tenants -
Reasons for relocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to a study by the London Chamber of Commerce, published last
month, more companies than ever before are planning to relocate some of
their activities away from central London. Of 150 companies polled, more
than 40 per cent claimed to be considering a move and most are preparing to
quit the south-east, with the south-west, the Midlands and the north being
the main destinations.
If the results of the chamber's survey do not square with the findings of
property professionals who continue to report that three-quarters of all
moves are to nearby locations, they do confirm relocation activity has eased
up.
John Heawood of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, which regularly monitors
company moves, confirms that 'it is no longer just high-tech companies which
see the possibilities of operating outside an urban environment. More and
more traditional in-town businesses are also considering a move.'
The key word for the present, however, may be 'considering'. All-in costs of
moving add up to Pounds 10,000 per employee, according to the CBI (not to
mention the disruption and nervous wear and tear on employees and
directors). So, many recession-hit businesses are proceeding with caution.
Tenants are also aware that they are in a buyer's market. Every sector of
the property market is oversupplied - none more so than the business parks
which became so fashionable in the late 80s as planning restrictions on user
classes were eased. Statistics produced by APR, the property monitoring
group, suggest that as much as 190m sq ft of B1 space in business parks may
be in the planning pipeline.
Fortunately for the stability of the market, little more than a fraction of
this will be built. Buying an option on a piece of farmland is the easy
part; paying for the infrastructure and facilities to transform that into
the makings of a true business park is quite a different matter, especially
now that tenants are no longer satisfied with what amount to no more than
'industrial estates with trees'.
Already that message is being heard. There have been few business park
developments started in the past quarter and the emphasis is distinctly on
quality with top drawer trading groups such as Arlington, Trafalgar House
and Speyhawk offering high levels of specification and maximum flexibility.
For the competition is certainly keen, not just from other business park
developers but from hard-pressed inner-city schemes as well. Business park
developers will not soon forget the recent relocation decision by Texaco
which had outgrown its Knightsbridge headquarters. Having looked at Bristol,
Swindon and then Reading as possible alternatives, Texaco was eventually
wooed by the low rents and sophisticated services at Canary Wharf.
Texaco's decision lifts the veil on the true priorities of companies which
need to move during a recession. A green environment may be desirable, but a
commercially suitable location offering cost savings will win hands down.
This principle applies even where the chosen site does qualify as an
eco-sensitive business park, such as the one at Crewe developed by the
district and county authorities. Last autumn the Milk Marketing Board chose
to relocate its animal breeding and farm management subsidiary, Genus, from
London to Crewe in Derbyshire.
Six months later Genus managing director, John Craven, is pretty satisfied
with the outcome. But although the 87-acre park has received much media
praise for its landscaping and environment-friendly design, these factors
are not the source of Mr Craven's contentment.
Genus looked at 30 different sites in the west of the country between
Bristol and Manchester and close to the M5 or M6 for access to the main
dairy farming areas. Crewe won primarily because of its pool of skilled but
cheap administrative labour.
Crewe's superb access to transport - not just rail, but motorway and airport
links are close by - was also a prime factor. But with only three occupiers
on the site so far, Mr Craven admits to feeling 'fairly isolated'. Matters
improved when Barclays opened a cashpoint and a Holiday Inn will increase
facilities further. 'The landscaping is nice to have,' he says, 'but it is
really just a bonus.'
Ambience in a broader sense does count, however, in the choice of location.
Crewe and Nantwich council is adamant that a true business park must be
large enough to generate its own sense of place - a minimum of 50 acres. It
is certainly true that this feeling is sadly lacking from the proliferation
of developments around Heathrow (and consequently cheek by jowl to the M25's
traffic nightmare). Brian McCombie, managing director of Trafalgar House's
business parks subsidiary, dismisses these as 'suburban industrial estates'.
And they are certainly failing to attract tenants, whereas THBP's
redevelopment of Brooklands adding offices, a Tesco super store and an hotel
to its historical attractions, looks a winner.
Mr McCombie, whose next application will be for a business park at Waltham
Abbey, is aware that even a 'Brooklands' ambience is not enough. 'There must
be good facilities for staff either on-site or within lunchtime striking
distance and flexibility over leases and provision of buildings.'

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (2): New vocabulary of building -
European prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPERS usually wince at the prospect of crossing national boundaries.
They are a home-loving bunch, skilled in the black arts of untangling red
tape and anticipating the wants of local customers. Why try to compete under
different rules in a new language for customers you don't understand?
But boundaries are dissolving in Europe. They already have dissolved for
many leading tenants, who expect a suitably international service from their
landlords and agents. A nagging background noise has also thrown doubts on
the safety of staying tucked up at home: the sound of business hitting the
bottom of the barrel. When the UK market is as flat as a millpond, the
challenge of learning a new language seems much less severe. But business
park developers will have to absorb more than a few phrase books to make a
success in mainland Europe. They must adjust to a whole new vocabulary of
building.
Previous invasions were marred by an irritating attitude of taking
civilisation to the natives. Full air-conditioning was mandatory for office
blocks, for instance, no matter what locals felt. The fact that tenants
turned their collective noses up at such extravagance taught a few expensive
lessons. This time around there should be fewer mistakes. The British still
profess to offer a better product - but quickly emphasise the importance of
bending it to local needs.
'We are entering a market part way through an evolution from industrial
estate to high-quality office park,' says Peter Mantle of Jones Lang Wootton
 -a polite way of saying the continentals have yet to catch up with the UK.
International groups such as IBM want the sort of space they get at home,
but it would be a disaster to just superimpose US and UK forms without
reference to local traditions, he adds.
Even the multinationals are changing their spots, however. John Worthington
of architects DEGW, deeply involved in Spain and France for UK and local
developers, says: 'Ten years ago they would have demanded the same building
in every country. Now they recognise that local people work in these places
and their needs must be recognised.' In Sweden and Germany, for instance,
staff expect a high degree of control over their work environment. In other
words they demand the power to open a window and let in fresh air rather
than endure the contraints of central air-conditioning.
What goes under buildings seems to be as important as the people who work in
them. The Italians and Spanish are passionately attached to their cars - but
they do not want them cluttering up the place when not in use. That is why
London &amp; Edinburgh Trust is building underground space for close to 800
vehicles at its 400,000 sq ft business park next to Milan airport.
This sort of idiosyncrasy raises building densities, however, making it
harder to export the idea of low site cover and high-quality landscaping.
And continental parks are already more dense than their UK counterparts.
France, for instance, claims to lead the market with futuristic
'technopoles' such as the group of 11 science centres covering more than
2,000 acres around the southern town of Montpellier, but a more typical
scheme is much further down the evolutionary scale.
Low-rise, low specification buildings normally cover 35 per cent of a site,
leaving only 15 per cent for impressive landscaping after providing roads
and parking. This is the exact opposite of a UK park, according to Mr
Worthington, with its low site cover and multi-storey buildings.
The Germans, on the other hand, build densely because planners set maximum
plot ratios of 1:1 or 1.5:1, which generate land values only justified by
high-rise office centres. Tenants are therefore less interested in
landscaping than the quality of a building, says Andrew Burt of JLW. They
carry that attitude around Europe, so a massive amount of work is going on
to determine which companies are looking to move and what they are looking
for.
A good environment might be unimportant to Germans, for instance, but is
crucial to 90 per cent of Italians, according to a study by Applied Property
Research. Like the British, Dutch and French, they also demand good housing
and shops, while the Germans differ again, says APR, placing more emphasis
on location near markets. One surprising fact is that links with
universities and quality of life come low down the list of priorities.
This learning process is not just geared to UK developers. DEGW is designing
for continental developers, while JLW is working up a 1.3m sq ft park in
Barcelona for the Germany company Grupo Dorn. But a market leader such as
Arlington believes it has the advantage of being able to integrate new
lessons about tenant priorities with the successful UK formula of prime
locations, good design, flexible tenure and on-going management control.
Phil Alexander, chief executive of new European subsidiary ASE, is already
looking after schemes in France, Spain and Italy. He also has his eyes on
eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The company's reputation has gone
before it, gaining a role to 'internationalise' the 2m sq ft high-rise
office park planned outside Milan by SNAM and Cogefar-Torno. Pre-lets would
be important here - mainly to Italians - but so would sales to the 'blue
chip' multi-nationals targetting this important European growth centre.
Arlington has a head start because most big names already have buildings on
the developer's UK parks. That advantage could also be useful in eastern
Europe, with the company offering to provide the same sort of space they
have at home - bent to local needs, of course.
Stuart Lipton's Stanhope Properties will hope for the same transfer of
loyalties from Stockley Park, the 1.5m sq ft scheme near Heathrow which has
set the pace for UK development and scooped a hatful of awards. He is set to
open its first European office later this year, and has chosen Berlin with
an obvious eye on the east.
'The crucial thing is to ensure that development is demand-led rather than
property-led,' says Mr Mantle. If UK companies can manage that through more
sophisticated research and concentration on tenant needs, the potential for
expansion into a growing market is incalculable. If not, they face a bleak
future, locked into an increasingly marginalised island off the European
coast while others reap the rewards.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (1): Facing up to a harsher world -
After a decade of hectic development, growth of the property market's
youngest sector has been badly stunted. While there are signs of a
broadening interest in business parks, tenants are becoming more
discriminating

THE youngest sector of the UK property market is going through a baptism of
fire. After being nurtured by the relaxed planning controls, buoyant demand
and easy money of the second half of the 1980s, business parks have now
stumbled into some of the harshest conditions for the property industry in
living memory.
The market still shows promise but its growth has been badly stunted. Gone
are the careless days at the end of the 1980s, when business parks were
planned at the rate of four a week, even though it would take 30 years to
fill them all.
Over the past year, developers have struggled to fill their buildings, while
some who paid inflated prices for their land have gone bankrupt.
Many of the planned developments will not be built, although plenty of new
projects are in the pipeline. Last year nearly twice as many out-of-centre
schemes were completed as in the year before, according to Applied Property
Research (APR).
This year it forecasts a 10 per cent drop in completions to 13.5m sq ft of
completions, while next year it reckons that some 9.6m sq ft will be
completed.
While supply has been building up, the recession and the Gulf war have taken
their toll on demand.
Just over 10m sq ft was taken up last year, down 21 per cent on 1989. So far
this year, 1.4m sq ft has been taken up, leading APR to estimate a total
take-up of 9m sq ft for the year.
The demand figures, although weak, suggest that business parks have managed
to appeal to a broadening audience. Last year, the most enthusiastic
newcomers to business parks were the telecommunication industry, government
services - which are relocating out of London to reduce costs - insurance,
electronics and computers. This year, food and drink industries are tipped
to be important space takers.
The result is that there are enough business parks to satisfy demand for 18
months and enough land with planning permission to last for decades,
according to APR.
However, the picture is clouded by large variations in quality and location.
Agents report that choice is relatively limited in some regions and,
moreover, that well-designed, well-located office parks are still attracting
reasonable demand.
For the best schemes, rents are rivalling, if not outstripping the city
centres. That said, it is unquestionably a tenant's market and few places
are entirely immune from the slump which dragged down overall office rents
by about 7 per cent last year.
As the property industry grapples with oversupply, the marketing advantages
of business parks are being closely scrutinised by tenants offered cut-price
rents to stay in town.
The quality of the working environment and good car parking provisions is
often bait enough for tenants used to cramped, congested city centres.
However, Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks reckons that the problems of business
parks have been underestimated by nearly everyone involved. 'Car parking and
a better environment are not everything,' it says.
'Rural locations can mean isolation: poor public transport and back-up
facilities, few neighbours and only a shallow pool of staff nearby.'
Some of these criticisms are inescapable, but the business park industry
would argue that its best schemes are trying to address some of the
complaints.
The evolution of business parks has been a rapid affair, producing a large
discrepancy between the concept and quality of different schemes.
The original goal of UK business parks, which were modelled on US schemes
such as Silicon Valley in California, was to give industrial companies a new
standard of space and environment. In reality, these turned out to be
slightly more appealing than average industrial estates.
High-tech developments were introduced in the early 1980s for computer-based
industries that did not need or want to separate offices, production and
warehouses. These second generation schemes were larger than their
predecessors and more likely to be out-of-the-town centres and in the green
belt.
As most of these scheme were agreed outside the existing planning controls,
there was an increasing demand to clarify the planning rules. In the 1985
White Paper, Lifting the Burden, the government said it would deregulate
planning legislation and, as part of this process, review the Use Classes
Order 1972 to cater for high-tech development.
The resulting introduction of the new business activity use (B1) in 1987 had
a decisive impact on the growth and nature of the business park market.
Between 1979 and 1981, under 250,000 sq ft of space was completed on
business parks, while between 1982 and 1986 the market grew gradually so
that just under 3m sq ft of space was completed in 1986. The new planning
rules were so eagerly received that by the end of 1988 more than 10m sq ft
of new B1 space was coming forward for completion in 1989. 'At timesit
appears that every farmer with land near a motorway junction was seeking to
develop a B1 business park,' says APR.
The change in planning rules also fundamentally changed the nature of
business parks.
The 'third generation' of business parks were office campus schemes for
corporate headquarters as developers discarded the original concept of
allowing high-technology companies to perform all its functions under one
roof.
The 'B1 effect' has produced a tendency for developers to think exclusively
in terms of maximising land values through office development to the
exclusion of mixed use and industrial buildings and this new phenomenon is
transforming the mixed use business parks of the 1980s into the office parks
of the 1990s,' says APR. In 1988, offices were 32 per cent of the total
market compared with 79 per cent in 1991.
The bonanza clearly got out of hand. Many schemes were ill thought out and
badly located. Clearly, some may have to revert to warehousing and
industrial schemes, even though office prices were paid for the land.
What is more difficult to predict is where business parks go from here. The
definition of a business park is increasingly blurred thanks to its changing
role, the introduction of new terms such as Stockley's 'mid-urban' park at
Chiswick, and the tendency of developers to borrow the label for any clutch
of new suburban buildings surrounded by a few trees.
The fourth generation schemes, meaning a business park that covers hundreds,
if not thousands, of acres with leisure facilities and housing, are limited
to one or two examples and some intensive lobbying of planning ministers.
There is not even any clear consensus on which types of schemes are the most
successful.
It has long been assumed by the industry that if a business park is to
compete with the town centres, it must be large enough to offer a
restaurant, a health club, a creche, a hotel and even shops.
In spite of the logic in this argument, the facts do not back up the
industry's hunch. Good quality small schemes get taken up just as well as
good quality large ones, according to APR, which has examined the relative
take-up of schemes larger than 50 acres and the rest. 'It is our view that
size of schemes has only a marginal impact on the size of lettings to be
accommodated,' it says.
Nonetheless, the bare statistics should not invite complacency about schemes
which do not offer attractive amenities for employees. When the economy
emerges from recession, employers' choice of new premises will have to
reflect their anxiety to win and keep good staff.

FT  19 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Investors remain cautious on equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON STOCKS were squeezed yesterday between a New York market struggling
around new highs and a growing lack of enthusiasm for buying UK stocks at
current levels. Equity volume improved but with Wall Street battling to hold
on to the Dow 3,000 range as it entered the new session the UK market closed
on the downside. The reduction in the US trade deficit for February had
little effect on the London market, which was taking its cue from Wall
Street's reaction.
Share prices closed above the day's lows, however, after Mr Norman Lamont,
UK chancellor of the exchequer, reiterated his confidence in an upturn in
the UK economy during the second half of the year. His statement followed
disclosure that March unemployment figures for the UK showed the sharpest
monthly rise for 20 years, and indicated strong recessionary pressure on the
British economy.
Equities opened higher in response to Wall Street's move above Dow 3,000
overnight. But the day's high, a gain of 8.5 on the Footsie, was reached
very early and prices soon began to melt away in the absence of
institutional support. The UK employment data was unhelpful, but it was
uncertainty about the outlook for Wall Street that unsettled London in early
afternoon, turning the market down by ten Footsie points. In the event Wall
Street looked uncertain in early trade, and showed a fall of a couple of
points on the Dowas London closed for the day.
At its final reading the FT-SE Index was 6.6 off at 2,538.4, some seven
points below its all-time peak. Seaq volume increased smartly after Mr
Lamont's encouraging statement to record a total of 798.1m shares for the
session, compared with only 481.1m on the previous day.
London Stock Exchange data confirmed that daily retail volume in equities
has fallen this week, with Tuesday's session recording only Pounds 805.9m.
This is an unsettling development for UK securities houses - some have been
forced to make further cuts in staff levels despite recovery in average
daily retail turnover to above the Pounds 1bn figure.
There were further indications yesterday of uncertainty about the near-term
outlook for the UK market. Both Samuel Montagu and Nomura Research Institute
Europe expressed concern about the outlook for sterling. Montagu predicted
that sterling would 'plunge' this summer on prospects of a general election
in the UK, weakness in the German mark and domestic pressures for lower
interest rates. Nomura Research was more cautious, commenting merely that
this week's trend insterling indicated a possiblefurther erosion in its
value.
The market took aboard a Pounds 128m bid in the brewery sector, but the much
bigger bid said to be overhanging the market failed to materialise
yesterday. Speculation of a takeover move on a grand scale continued to
circulate, however.
The rights issue calendar, too, continued to produce only minor moves in the
shape of cash calls yesterday for a further Pounds 187m from Slough Estates
and David S. Smith, the packaging group.
Despite Wall Street's strength overnight the international blue chips
recorded mixed changes. Oil stocks remained unsettled as crude oil prices
churned around the Dollars 19 a barrel mark. North Sea exploration stocks,
which are more directly influenced by crude oil prices, also weakened
yesterday.

FT  19 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy demand for ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI led international stocks higher as the dollar strengthened against
sterling and Mr Richard Wyatt at County NatWest put the stock into its Top
30 - a grouping regularly favoured by institutions.
County bases its buy recommendation on the view that 'world economic growth
has now reached the bottom of the trough and will be rebounding strongly by
1991 Q4.' Trading volume was a heavy 3.7m as the shares climbed 35 at one
point. They closed a net 32 to the good at 1100p.
Both Fisons and SmithKline Beecham continued to improve, the former on hopes
that its asthma drug Tilade would at last get approval from the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and the latter in the wake of recent
presentations to analysts. One analyst said that the talk of Tilade approval
was 'more than just a nod and a wink'. Fisons rose 7 to 488p (up 18 1/2 over
two sessions) and SmithKline added 11 at 842p.
Racal again active
There was no let up in takeover speculation surrounding the Racal 'twins',
although a Racal director was reported as saying there had been no bid
approaches for Racal Telecom.
There was talk that one of the big international telecom groups was about to
buy a big stake in Racal Telecom from Racal Electronics, or that a full
takeover bid for Racal Electronics was being prepared.
Hutchison Whampoa, the US 'baby Bells' as well as Mannesman and other
European groups, were being spoken of as likely candidates, as was Cable &amp;
Wireless. Racal Telecom shares rose 3 to 396p, while Electronics managed a
minor improvement at 242p.
Mr John E Clarke at Daiwa issued buy notes on both stocks but emphasised
that Electronics was the cheapest way into Racal Telecom, because of its 80
per cent stake. Mr Clarke attached only a 30 per cent probability to a full
bid and said he believed a cash injection, in exchange for a minority stake,
was more likely.
Small brewers busy
Second line brewers seethed with takeover talk after Boddington bid for
Devenish. The seven for ten share swap proposed values each Devenish share
at 233p, and the company at Pounds 128m.
It was described by one analyst as 'a cheeky offer at the bottom of the
market at a price considerably below asset value.' The shares reflected the
view in early trading as Boddington fell to 152p and Devenish rose to 235p.
They reversed their relative motion in later trading, however. Boddington
ended 6 down on balance at 157p and Devenish closed up 12 at 232p. Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken said Boddington was a buy because if the bid succeeded the
enlarged group would have sound prospects and if it failed the company would
be in play.
The two beer companies have been linked before - they were in merger talks
last year and last week Devenish sold its 3.8 per cent holding in
Boddington. There were suggestions earlier in the month that Boddington
itself might be a target for a bid from Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley (unchanged at
503p) and traders theorised that yesterday's move might have been an attempt
to stave of such a takeover attempt.
Analysts inclined to the view that any successful bid for Devenish would
have to be at 265p-270p. Much of the decision-making power is in the hands
of Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), an investment trust half owned by
Whitbread. It has 21.9 per cent of Boddington (Whitbread itself owns 5.9 per
cent) and 15 per cent of Devenish.
Wickes placing
One of the heaviest individual turnover stocks was Wickes, the building
materials, distribution and retailing group, after Hillsdown disposed of its
near-19 per cent stake in the company.
Hillsdown said it had sold 50.48m shares for Pounds 27.4m, to SG Warburg,
equivalent to 54.25p a share. The Seaq delayed ticker confirmed this and a
similar series of trades carried out at 55p a share showed up a short while
afterwards, indicating a profit of Pounds 378,561 on the deal. Hillsdown
said Warburg had placed the shares with a number of institutions.
Wickes was unperturbed by the placing and closed at 60p. Turnover was 100m.
Hillsdown edged up to 262p.
A large sell order overnight left Glaxo 16 lower at 1084p and it was
Wellcome's turn to suffer from worries over drug patents. A US company, Barr
Laboratories, said it had applied to the FDA for permission to make a
generic equivalent of Wellcome's Aids treatment AZT. Mr Robin Gilbert at
James Capel expressed his confidence in the reliability of Wellcome's
patents, but the shares slid 15 to 534p.
Buy notes issued by County NatWest and UBS Philips &amp; Drew prompted heavy
trade in the power generators. National closed 2 1/2 up at 136p on 15m and
PowerGen held at 137p on 10m.
Specialists reported plenty of evidence that institutions had been selling
the Water Package (10 lower at Pounds 3120) and buying the constituent
stocks. Trading in the Package is expected to cease by the end of July, when
the remaining packages will be unwound.
Shares in Gardiner Group, the wholesale distributor of electronic security
and surveillance equipment, were unmoved at 63 1/2 p as Scantronic placed
its 16.1 per cent stake at 58p. Hoare Govett, Gardiner's broker. sold the
shares to a number of institutions. Hoare placed a similar amount of
Gardiner for Automated Security six weeks ago at a price of 51p. Scantronic
was unmoved at 85p.
Microfocus' scintillating performance since the start of the year, when the
stock was trading around 700p, was maintained with the shares closing
another 112 up at 1945p.
Bass bucked the trend with an improvement of 13 to 978p as traders became
convinced that any rump of stock from the rights issue would be small. A big
buyer of Whitbread early in the day pushed the shares up 7 to 486p. A line
of Scottish and Newcastle depressed its price 9 to 375p.
Steelmaker Henry Barrett weakened after revealing awful first-half profits
of Pounds 0.3m, compared with Pounds 6.5m for the same period last year. The
new chief executive still expects full-year profits to reach Pounds 5m, and
his confidence was reflected in maintenance of the interim dividend payment,
but the market was not consoled and the shares fell 10 to 89p.
Negative analysis in the wake of the second rights issue within a year
continued to harm Morgan Crucible. Light selling, said dealers, found buyers
extremely reluctant and the shares reacted to end 10 down at 238p. The
nil-paid stock lost 7 to 13p premium.
Improved annual results, which included a sharply increased dividend, lifted
USM-listed motor distributor Mid-States 9 to 68p.
Traders said that terms of a convertible preference issue from Slough
Estates were so good that investors bought the stock to be able to take them
up. The shares rose 9 to 253p amid predictions that they would fall when
they went ex rights on May 15.
Blue Circle surprised the market by not announcing a rights issue and
declaring it would not have one this year. The shares dropped 6 to 254p on
4.6m, however, as analysts took on board the company's cautionary noises
about the outlook in 1991. Robert Fleming cut its current year forecast to
Pounds 160m to allow for a much higher interest charge.
Heavy trading at the close in Saatchi and Saatchi fully paid (106m) and
Ossory Estates (20m) looked like the placing of the rumps of recent rights
issues.

FT  19 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a quiet session in the derivatives sector as investors assessed the
implications of the latest unemployment figures from the UK against the
background of Wall Street's latest burst of strength. An early gain in the
FT-SE June futures contract helped equities very briefly but the contract
soon fell from the day's best and trading volume quietened down.
By the end of the session, the premium on the futures contract had shrunk to
only 28 points against the underlying cash price, virtually eliminating the
premium against the Fair Value calculation which allows for dividend flows
and carrying costs.
Traders commented that London investors, already feeling less certain about
the outlook for UK equities over the short term, are now also unsure Wall
Street's underlying strength. In addition, some uncertainties over the
outlook for sterling were voiced by securities analysts in London yesterday.
The Traded Options market also had a poor trading session. Some interest was
shown in the Euro FT-SE contract and two London houses traded heavily in the
British Telecom option.
There was some activity in Land Securities and in Asda where matched trades
were operated. Elsewhere, however, the sector lacked features.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amev, Ahold and Fokker - announced plans for new American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) programmes this month, bolstering the direct presence of Dutch
companies on US stockmarkets.
Ahold, the big Dutch food retailer, already had an ADR programme, but it
deepened its commitment by listing the ADRs on Nasdaq on April 8. Fokker,
the airplane builder, and Amev, the insurance company, are newcomers to
ADRs. Trading in Fokker's ADRs began on the over-the-counter market this
month, with Amev scheduled to follow in June.
The moves, while unveiled almost simultaneously, are part of a wider, more
gradual rise in the use of ADRs among Dutch companies since the early 1980s.
The nearly identical timing of Amev, Ahold and Fokker is due more to the
release of pent-up demand following the end of the Gulf War than to any
special factors which make ADR programmes more attractive, bankers say.
There are now 23 Dutch companies with ADR programmes, putting the
Netherlands in second place in Europe after the UK and just ahead of Sweden.
Because of their small home market Dutch companies have traditionally used
ADRs to widen their shareholder base. ADRs enable US investors to invest in
foreign companies and at the same time to receive dividend cheques in
dollars.
Apart from the usual reasons, Ahold, which recently acquired its fourth
major US supermarket chain, said it decided to launch a full ADR programme
to make it easier for its 55,000 US employees to invest in the company.
Fokker and Amev wanted to meet growing US demand for their shares. None of
the three has immediate plans to raise fresh capital through ADRs.
'Many US institutional investors are obliged to invest only in
dollar-denominated shares. The ADRs allow us to tap a potentially large
number of shareholders,' says Mr Peter Glasbeek, Fokker's assistant
treasurer.
Most well-known Dutch companies, ranging from Philips to Heineken, already
have ADR programmes of different sorts, varying from unsponsored programmes
to full listings on one of the US stock exchanges.
Mr Robert Murray, head of the ADR department at JP Morgan in New York, which
is the depositary institution for the three latest programmes and for well
over half of all Dutch ADRs, says at least six other Dutch companies are
considering ADR transactions. DSM, the chemicals group, has already said
that it may launch a programme later this year.
One possible consequence of launching ADRs is that trading in the US can
affect the level of a company's share price on the home market. For example,
nearly half of shares in Reuters, the UK-based financial information group,
are held in the form of ADRs, which sometimes means that the share price is
determined in New York rather than London.
This is not yet true of any Dutch company, though the potential exists. 'If
a programme is very successful, you're going to see trading in the US which
could have an impact on the market value in Holland,' Mr Murray says.
But he adds that foreign stock markets exert influences over share prices in
other countries in any case, and an ADR programme merely makes that link
more visible.
Ahold's move to the Nasdaq market helped boost its share price in Amsterdam,
at least temporarily, for two reasons. Strong initial demand in the US led
to buying of Ahold's Dutch shares for repackaging as ADRs. The company's US
roadshows also kindled interest in the Dutch-listed shares from
institutional investors who are able to invest in Ahold in guilders.
On April 8, the first day of Nasdaq trading, Ahold's shares rose by Fl 2.70
(Dollars 1.42) to Fl 86, extending increases sparked by its recent
acquisition of Tops Markets, a New York-based supermarket chain, and by the
rise of the dollar. Its shares later fell back, partly due to the
resignation of a top executive in the Netherlands. They closed yesterday at
Fl 83.90, up 30 cents on the day.

FT  19 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sandoz opens share register to
foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE issues steered bourses yesterday. Predictions of a further,
although reduced, fall in German company profits in 1991 vied with
unsatisfactory 1990 results in France, and the opening of Sandoz's share
register to foreigners in Switzerland, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was faced with a forecast of lower 1991 German corporate profits
from Degab, Deutsche Bank's investment research arm; a Bundesbank decision
to hold interest rates; and a BASF board meeting which held the annual
dividend rate at DM13 a share.
It was a little depressed by Degab, which expects a fall of 1 per cent this
year after one of 5 per cent in 1990. This will be followed by a rise of 8
per cent in 1992 . However, it sees the fall concentrated in the automotive,
chemical and steel industries.
Cars and chemicals are heavily weighted in the DAX index, which closed 10.07
lower at 1,613.76 yesterday after a fall of 1.46 to 684.55 in the FAZ at
midsession. The interest rate decision did not surprise dealers but the BASF
dividend lifted the chemical company's shares, from a day's low of DM246.50
before the news to a close of DM251.30, up 60 pfg on the day. Turnover fell
from DM8.2bn to DM7bn
Mr Michael Geiger, an analyst with County NatWest in London, said that
County expects an increase in German corporate earnings this year and next,
to take the German market p/e down from 14.3, through 13.7 to 12.6. Degab
expects banking, a very big sector, to rise by 11 per cent this year; County
expects a far bigger improvement on the grounds that the banks will not have
to repeat provisions against bond portfolio losses on anything like the same
scale this year.
Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction company, rose DM3 to DM900 after news
of a deep discount rights issue yesterday. Mr Geiger said that the company
would benefit from the new equity, and that the market had absorbed similar
issues in 1989 and 1990.
ZURICH concentrated on Sandoz, the chemical company, which announced the
opening of its registered shares to foreigners, a stock split and a rights
issue. The registered shares jumped SFr675 to SFr11,025, while the bearers
fell SFr550 to SFr11,350 on the loss of their availability advantage over
the registered stock. The Credit Suisse index closed 2.6 lower at 555.6.
PARIS had a busy start with about FFr500m traded in the first hour,
concentrated on BNP, Michelin and Peugeot. Receding hopes for lower interest
rates, weaker bonds and concern that the market was about to run into a
spate of rights issues pushed the CAC 40 index 13.71 lower to 1,185.74 in
turnover estimated at about FFr2.5bn.
BNP was the day's biggest loser, falling FFr40.40 or 14.4 per cent to
FFr240.50 and was the day's second most active stock with 542,425 shares
exchanged. The sell-off was prompted by surprisingly bad 1990 results, and a
dividend cut.
Accor, the hotel group, dropped FFr21 or 2.6 per cent to FFr800 on fears of
a rights issue. The group denied a report that it planned to increase its
stake in the Belgian travel firm Wagons-Lits. Accor also postponed for
several days a financial news conference planned for yesterday.
In the motor sector, Peugeot rose FFr8 FFr546 on volume of 183,750 shares.
The market was relieved that the drop in the car maker's earnings coincided
with earlier warnings from its chairman.
STOCKHOLM fell on higher domestic interest rates and concerns about the
impending first quarter reporting season. The Affarsvarlden index eased 1.2
to 1,087.9 in relatively high turnover of SKr406m after SKr302m.
Electrolux free b shares fell SKr5 to SKr224 following a negative report on
the company in a Swedish business magazine on Wednesday.
MILAN continued to focus on the insurance and banking sectors. The Comit
index rose 3.77 to 598.70.
Generali rose L600 to L37,940 and hit L38,350 after hours while in the
banking sector, Mediobanca closed at L15,980, up L200. Telecoms were also in
the limelight. Stet jumped L28 to L2,376 and Sirti was up L90 to L12,890.
Elsewhere, Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, recouped L35
to L2,645 after its recent weakness.
AMSTERDAM closed weaker ahead of the expiry of April series options and
index futures today. The CBS general tendency index eased 0.5 to 96.8.
Chemical group DSM closed down Fl 4.00 at Fl 112.40 after going ex-dividend
of Fl 5.00 and paper maker KNP ended Fl 2.50 down at Fl 53.90, ex-dividend
of Fl 2.50.
Nedlloyd was 50 cents higher at Fl 53.80 after reporting a 1990 net loss in
line with its own forecast at Fl 148.2m.
MADRID picked up slightly in the afternoon session but still showed a small
loss at the end of a dull day. The general index closed at 283.91, 0.20 down
overall but slightly up from the close of pit trading.
HELSINKI fell another 1.7 per cent in moderate trade, blaming profit-taking
as the Hex index fell 19.0 to 1124.1 after a 14.7 point decline on
Wednesday.

interest rate standstill

<TEXT>
SHARE prices fell for the first time in six days, despite the overnight
record close on Wall Street, as investors waited for the March money supply
figures, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 181.47 to 26,798.90 on index-linked selling and
profit-taking, after a high of 27,042.90 and a low of 26,699.67. Volume fell
to 400m shares from 480m, with institutional investors disappointed by the
central bank's decision to maintain high short-term rates.
Declines outnumbered advances by 727 to 250 with 180 unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost 17.27 to 2,011.55 and in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.02 to 1524.10. Traders said that sentiment had
not changed drastically. Mr Fujio Katayama at CS First Boston said that some
institutions were realising profits, but added that he thought the downside
would be limited.
The electrical sector, popular on Wednesday, fell back with Pioneer down Y10
to Y5,040 and Sony by Y110 to Y6,680. Large-capital issues fell as Mr
Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, ruled out the possibility
of an easing in monetary policy. Nippon Steel lost Y7 to Y482 and Mitsubishi
Heavy declined Y10 to Y785.
Financials lost ground on poor interest rate prospects, with Industrial Bank
of Japan Y170 lower at Y3,650 and Fuji Bank retreating Y80 to Y2,630.
Non-life insurances were also weak with Tokio Marine &amp; Fire losing Y40 to
Y1,350.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical lost Y90 to Y2,230 on reports that earnings for the
previous business year are expected to fall for the first time in eight
years. Other drug makers followed with Yamanouchi down Y10 to Y3,020 and
Dainippon Y20 to Y2,250.
Chiyoda, the plant engineer, was the most active issue of the day, climbing
Y20 to Y3,020. Investors liked reports that the company had agreed to supply
a Czech engineering company with de-sulphurising equipment.
Nippon Yakin Kogyo, the stainless steel maker, rose Y45 to Y1,030 on buying
by a big Japanese securities house which is promoting the stainless steel
theme. The brokers have been trying to boost activity by recommending
'theme' stocks, but traders said that institutional investors were not
interested in taking positions at current levels.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 80.14 to 30,075.98 on volume 44.3m shares.
Constructions and textiles lost ground, while some high-technology stocks
were firm on the rally on Wall Street. Omron, the electronic component
maker, rose Y30 to Y2,350. Traders said that investors who had bought its
Eurodollar-denominated warrant bonds, launched last week, were trying to
raise the price.
Sanoyas Hishino Meisho, the shipbuilder, rose Y60 to Y1,920 on strong
earnings projections, thanks to strong sales of its playground equipment.
Roundup
NEW HIGHS for 1991 were almost commonplace yesterday, with Australia, New
Zealand, Taiwan and Thailand all building on Wall Street's rally and
breaking new ground.
NEW ZEALAND extended its rally as falling domestic interest rates helped
fuel bullish sentiment. The Barclays index closed 21.64 or 1.5 per cent to
1,480.37. The index has now climbed by 11.4 per cent in the last three
weeks. Turnover, inflated by a cross-trade of 40m shares in Magnum, a
brewing and grocery group, jumped from NZDollars 35.7m to NZDollars 146.2m.
Brierley Investments said that it was selling its 17 per cent stake, 50.6m
shares in Magnum, retaining a half-share in a separate 54.1-per cent stake
in Magnum through an existing joint venture with Asia Pacific Breweries of
Singapore.
Brierley rose 2 cents to NZDollars 1.11 in volume of 7.2m shares, while
Magnum fell 7 cents to NZDollars 2.73 in volume of 40.1m shares.
AUSTRALIA broke through 1,500 on the All Ordinaries index which closed 22.5
or 1.5 per cent higher at 1,513.1, its highest close since September and its
sixth consecutive rise. Brokers noted active Asian buying as turnover rose
from ADollars 237m to ADollars 320m.
TAIWAN saw a peaceful ending, by local standards, to a 15-hour opposition
demonstration demanding political reform. The weighted index rose 239.05 or
4.4 per cent to 5,690.11 as turnover rose from TDollars 58.7bn to TDollars
78.9bn.
BANGKOK heard that five big banks were cutting a percentage point off
interest rates and traded in heavy turnover of 5.52bn baht, particularly in
property shares, as the SET index cracked the key 900 resistance level to
close 14.23 higher at 904.69.
MANILA closed higher in spite of continued profit-taking, which ate up much
of the session's early gains. The composite index rose 10.43 to 1,091.36.
HONG KONG made moderate progress, the Hang Seng index rising 12.25 to
3,699.26. SEOUL, still dejected, saw the composite index 6.66 lower at
625.89, its tenth decline in the last eleven sessions.

FT  19 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in the February US trade deficit led to modest selling of the
dollar, but the currency finished higher on the day after the German
Bundesbank failed to raise official interest rates at yesterday's council
meeting.
Fading expectations of an early easing of the US Federal Reserve's monetary
stance also helped push the dollar higher. This followed denials by
officials in Washington that Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, is struggling to maintain his authority over monetary policy.
It had been suggested that Mr Greenspan was forced to delay a cut in
interest rates because of resistance by members of the Federal Open Market
Committee who are still worried about inflation.
February's trade figures were the best for over seven years. The deficit
fell to Dollars 5.33bn from a revised Dollars 7.16bn in January, but they
pointed towards a weak economy and did not help the dollar. US exports fell
2.4 per cent in February and it was only because imports fell by 6.4 per
cent that the trade figures were so good. The volume of oil imports declined
by 14.9 per cent reflecting, a run down in US industrial activity.
At the London close the dollar had climbed to DM1.6880 from DM1.6725; to
Y136.70 from Y136.35; to SFr1.4415 from SFr1.4270; and to FFr5.7000 from
FFr5.6550. Its index rose to 65.1 from 64.6.
Speculation about a rise in German interest rates was mainly confined to
overseas markets. This accounted for the calm reception in Frankfurt to the
Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged and also for the selling of
the D-Mark following the news.
Lack of change in German rates turned attention back towards the gloomy
economic prospects for the country as a result of unification and to concern
about a possible power struggle in the Soviet Union.
The D-Mark lost ground in the European exchange rate mechanism and also
weakened against the Japanese yen. It fell to Y81.00 from 81.50 in London,
after failing to break through resistance at Y82.00 earlier in Tokyo.
Sterling fell against the dollar, but was firm in the ERM. There was no
obvious reaction to a larger than expected rise in March UK unemployment or
to a surprising drop in manufacturing output. The monthly rise in
unemployment was the biggest for 20 years, and although total industrial
production rose 1.6 per cent in February, manufacturing output fell 1.6 per
cent. This encouraged speculation about a further easing of UK monetary
policy, but was not reflected in the pound's performance.
Sterling fell 1 cent to Dollars 1.7720. It also declined to Y242.25 from
Y243.00, but rose to DM2.9900 from DM2.9800; to FFr10.1000 from FFr10.0775;
and to SFr2.5550 from SFr2.5425. The pound's index gained 0.1 to 93.0.

FT  19 APR 91 / Money Markets: No German move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged at yesterday's council
meeting. Speculation that the central bank might increase rates followed
last week's rise in the Bundesbank's fixed rate at a tender for securities
repurchase agreements, but talk about higher rates was mainly confined to
the foreign exchanges and overseas markets.
There was no further tightening at this week's tender and traders on the
Frankfurt money market were always sceptical that the council meeting would
agree to increase either the discount or Lombard rates.
Frankfurt call money was steady at 8.80 per cent yesterday in quiet trading.
Credit conditions were comfortable, but tax payments are tending to drain
liquidity at present.
In London short-term interest rates maintained a downward course, but the
longer end of the market was slightly firmer. Three-month sterling interbank
eased to 11 13/16 -11 from 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent, while 12-month money
rose to 11 7/16 -11 5/16 from 11 3/8 -11 1/4 per cent.
Short-sterling futures traded in a narrow range on Liffe. June delivery
opened firmer at 88.69 and touched a peak of 88.72, before closing at 88.68
compared with 88.67 previously.
Day-to-day credit remained in reasonably comfortable supply on the London
cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds
350m, but revised this to Pounds 300m at noon and then back to Pounds 350m
in the afternoon. Help of Pounds 288m was provided.
The authorities did not operate in the market until after lunch, when Pounds
288m bills were bought outright, by way of Pounds 24m bank bills in band 1
at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 264m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per
cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 495m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 60m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds
200m to liquidity and bank balances above target of Pounds 5m.
In Amsterdam the Dutch Central Bank left its money market rate for special
advances at 8.70 per cent when offering seven-day liquidity to the banking
system.
A tender for the funds will be held today to offset Fl 4.2bn draining from
the market as an earlier facility expires.

FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: American citrus producers set
up network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITRUS producing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as
the US, yesterday set up an inter-regional network to promote the exchange
of expertise and information to improve citrus production.
The 23 countries aim to conduct joint research programmes in areas such as
pest control, the development of disease-resistant strains and the climatic
adaptation of different varieties of citrus. They will also circulate
information on plantings, harvests, exports and world demand which they hope
will guide producers in their marketing and investment decisions.
The network was formed at a meeting in Santiago sponsored by the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Mr Kerry Mulherin, deputy director of
FAO's commodities and trade division, believes there are signs that
surpluses are emerging in the production of certain citrus fruits.
'Expansion plans could aggravate the situation,' says Mr Mulherin, 'which is
why it is so important to have up-to-date information to allow countries to
assess their production strategies.'
The network will compile a list of experts to help countries improve
techniques in plant propagation, production methods, disease control and
post-harvest handling.
FAO says the network 'could effectively use the limited manpower and
finances available to address critical unsolved problems of citrus
production in the region'.
The countries in the network produce more than half of the world's annual
citrus production of some 65m tonnes. They are also responsible for 24 per
cent of worldwide fresh citrus exports and 70 per cent of processed exports.
The members are adamant that the group will not be a precursor to a trade
pact. Mr Mulherin said: 'We want to encourage co-operation at the technical
level, which is far easier to achieve than at the trade level.
'The general mood in the world today is not in favour of trade cartels.' The
Brazil delegation, however, argued that the group should tackle trade
barriers within and outside the region.
'The US imposes Dollars 540 (Pounds 301) of taxes and tariffs on every tonne
of Brazilian citrus juice that reaches Florida,' said Mr Jose Carlos
Goncalves, president of the Association of Brazilian Fruit Juice Industries.
'This amounts to 58 per cent of the fob value of citrus juice before it
leaves the port of Santos.' Mr Goncalves added that the European Community
slaps a 19 per cent tariff on Brazilian citrus exports.
As the world's biggest citrus exporter, Brazil will be co-ordinating the
network's economic and trade groups. Mr Goncalves says Brazil intends to
work towards opening new markets and reducing tariff barriers.
The US, with the greatest expertise in citrus production, will co-ordinate
the network's research and technology transfer.

FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: US agriculture secretary
'optimistic' on EC reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDWARD Madigan, the new US agriculture secretary, has expressed
'optimism' about the outlook for agriculture policy reform measures in the
EC.
In a congressional testimony this week, he said preliminary reports
indicated that it might be 'some time' before reforms emerged.
However, the reform effort had led to 'a more constructive attitude on the
part of the EC negotiators' in the Uruguay Round.
On the domestic front, the secretary predicted that US farm exports would
decline in the 1991 fiscal year to Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.6bn) from some
Dollars 40bn last year.
This was partly due to increased production abroad. He also pointed to
potential reductions in imports in large markets such as the Soviet Union.
The sector's balance sheet is showing a healthy improvement. Farmland values
rose by about 3 per cent in 1990, after showing moderate increases in the
three preceding years.
Total farm debt fell from Dollars 193bn in 1983 to Dollars 134bn. As a
result the debt-to-asset ratio stood at 16 per cent in 1990, lower than it
was in 1980 and substantially lower than the 23.9 per cent level in 1984.
Although some producers were still experiencing threats to their farms, the
sector as a whole had recovered from the severe stresses of the 1980s, the
secretary said.
Commodity prices are expected to be only slightly lower than last year.
Stocks of wheat and dairy products are expected to rise.
Livestock and poultry output is climbing, but market conditions are likely
to remain favourable for hog and cattle producers.
Farm income is likely to be 'relatively stable' in 1991 with net cash income
forecast in the Dollars 53bn-Dollars 58bn range, compared to Dollars 58bn in
1990.
Net farm income may drop slightly to the Dollars 42-Dollars 47bn level as a
result of lower crop prices and higher input costs.

EC FISHERIES ministers yesterday deferred until July getting to grips with

fast-dwindling stocks of white fish in the North Sea. They did, however,
agree to set up a community-wide statistical register to monitor the
quantities of fish landed by each member state.
It was the third failure to reach a compromise on increasing net mesh sizes,
in order to allow immature cod and haddock, in particular, to escape, since
last November.
Last November, the commission presented independent scientific evidence to
support its claim that more than 90 per cent of fish stocks in the North
Atlantic were being over-fished.
It also presented a paper claiming that there was 40 per cent over-capacity
in the EC fleet and called for conservation measures.
Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister, confirmed that Britain was going
ahead with its own conservation measures. From July all boats over 400
horsepower will be obliged to have a 90mm square mesh panel in their nets.
Mr Curry argued that 'these unilateral measures need to be communitised'.
More than a third of the UK's North Sea and west of Scotland fleet have
opted to use 110mm/100mm square mesh nets.
This is in exchange for a waiver on the measure ministers agreed last
December, requiring vessels in those areas of the North Sea with a
concentration of immature cod to tie up in port for eight consecutive days
each month. Part of the Danish fleet has also opted for this trade-off.
Commission officials, ministers and fishermen's organisations all agree that
considerable cheating has gone on. If, at the end of the year, catches are
little affected by the supposedly wider nets, fishermen's main objection to
the measure - that their incomes would be slashed - will carry little weight
and the commission's hand could be strengthened.
Fishermen's leaders lobbying yesterday's meeting expressed frustration at
the piecemeal introduction of measures consequent on ministers' failure to
reach agreement. Mr Willie Hay, president of the Scottish Fishermen's
federation, said: 'We all agree there is a need for conservation measures,
and we should agree them and apply them to the whole community fleet.'
The commission has suspended negotiations with Namibia to reach an agreement
on fishing rights. Mr Manuel Marin, EC fisheries commissioner, blamed the
south-west African country's seizure of five Spanish vessels for illegally
fishing in its waters.
The talks were at a low ebb because of what one commission official said was
Namibia's failure to come up with 'a reasonable offer' on rights.
Spanish officials at yesterday's meeting said their authorities had opened
proceedings against 12 vessels from Spain for illegal fishing in the South
Atlantic.

FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Squeeze on zinc at LME is over,
say traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORST of the extreme squeeze on the London Metal Exchange zinc market is
over, traders suggested last night, but some fears remain that the upheaval
may have damaged the LME's image and drive zinc prices down to unnecessarily
low levels.
The issue is important because the LME became the dominant basis for world
zinc pricing last year when nearly all the North American zinc producers
switched to using the exchange as a reference point for contract
discussions. Most big producers elsewhere in the world switched in 1989.
Yesterday the premium to borrow zinc for immediate delivery for one day,
which soared to more than Dollars 100 a tonne during on Monday afternoon,
fluctuated between zero and Dollars 8 a tonne.
This was well below the Dollars 20 a day maximum informally agreed between
the LME executive and Metallgesellschaft, the German group which, with
associates, controls most of the physical metal available for April
delivery. MG's LME ring dealing subsidiary and its clients undertook to keep
the market liquid by making metal available at reasonable cost.
After the cost of borrowing zinc for a day collapsed to zero, there was talk
among traders that a deal may have been done outside the market by MG and
the main investment fund victim of the squeeze, said to be the
Californian-based Mint Fund, which is 50-per-cent-owned by ED &amp; F. Man, the
London trade house.
An official said MG's trading subsidiary had not been involved in any such
arrangement but he could not speak for other companies in the MG group.
Some zinc market users said the LME executive should have taken formal
action to limit the daily premium to Dollars 20 a tonne, rather than relying
on diplomatic pressure.
Producers expressed concern that the high price of metal for immediate
delivery had encouraged a flood of zinc into LME warehouses. The arrival of
nearly 15,000 tonnes was reported on Tuesday, taking LME stocks to 83,125
tonnes, little short of the highest level for seven years.
Zinc for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,215.50 a tonne,
down Dollars 67, while three-month metal was down Dollars 28 at Dollars
1,162.
This meant that the backwardation (premium for cash metal over forward
prices) narrowed to Dollars 53.50 a tonne having been as high as Dollars
240.

FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Canadian magnesium smelter
closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALBERTA magnesium smelter with capacity for 12,000 tonnes of metal a year
and a cost of nearly CDollars 200m (Pounds 97m), has been shut only six
months after start-up.
The plant used technology based on a British process to produce high-purity
magnesium metal from magnesite ore. This involved a one-step reduction
process claimed to be more efficient than technology used by the world's
biggest producers, Norsk Hydro and Dow Chemical.
Magnesium metal is used in die-casting and construction components, as an
alloying agent in aluminium and as a de-sulphurising agent in steelmaking.
The western world used about 253,000 tonnes last year, produced by Norsk in
Norway and Canada, Dow in Texas, and also by Aluminum Company of America
(Alcoa) and Magnesium Corporation of America.
The recession and low activity in the car industry pushed prices down from
Dollars 1.60 a pound to about Dollars 1.10, roughly in line with aluminium.
The Magcan plant, near Calgary, never produced more than 10 tonnes daily.
Alberta Natural Gas, a US-owned pipeline company, invested CDollars 64m in
the project and the Alberta government lent CDollars 103m. ANG owned 54 per
cent and Magnesium International (Canada), 46 per cent. ANG has now written
off its investment.
Alcoa was originally associated with Magcan but dropped out before
construction began, saying it wanted to concentrate investment on its
aluminium smelters. In 1990, ANG moved in hoping to diversify its pipeline
business.
Industry sources say Magcan produced high-purity metal for the alloy market
but the process was new and it misjudged the time required for start-up. The
drop in magnesium prices, high interest rates and a high Canadian dollar,
worsened the situation.
Mr William Demcoe, ANG vice-president, said the new plant did not produce
enough metal to approach break-even and his company had no choice but to
close it.
Norsk Hydro opened a Dollars 500m smelter near Montreal late in 1989 with a
yearly capacity of 40,000 tonnes.

FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Loud clash over tin rights - A
Brazilian courtroom battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A stuffy courtroom in the jungle town of Porto Velho last week, Justice
of the Peace Adamar Maciel presided over a case described as 'Brazil's
big-time mineral companies try to oust small-time miners from gigantic tin
reserve'.
The fight was over the mining rights to Bom Futuro, one of the biggest tin
reserves in the world. Its outcome could alter international tin prices. The
question is whether the mine will remain in the hands of the 'little guys',
poverty-stricken fortune hunters with no regard for international supply, or
the large mineral concerns which would control output to boost prices on the
world markets.
The battle is between the Garimpeiros' Production Union and Ebesa, a company
held by a conglomerate of big oil companies. Paranapanema, the mineral
giant, has a 49 per cent stake in the group, which aims to take control of
the area. If it succeeds, Brazil's tin production would drop sharply.
On April 9, the judge decided the miners' union would need to show more
evidence to support its claims to the area. Paranapanema prematurely crowed
victory. 'Bom Futuro is ours,' said Mr Samuel Hanan, a director at the
company.
The miners' union vowed to continue the battle. 'We have a duty to defend
our interests against monopolistic and corrupt forces,' said Mr Dirceu
Almeida, the union's lawyer.
Mr Hanan is counting on victory to lift sagging tin prices. 'I predict that
with the demise of Brazil's small-time miners, tin prices will hit Dollars
6,200 by 1992,' he said. He bases his claim on a prediction that tin
consumption will exceed output this year by about 23,000 tonnes.
Ebesa has been trying to kick Bom Futuro's garimpeiros out for
three-and-a-half years, but the miners have stayed put. Now, Ebesa's luck
may be turning, not because of any legal success, but because of changing
circumstances. From a peak of 20,000, Bom Futuro's garimpeiros now number
less than 1,000.
Market observers say that with the price of tin at its lowest level in real
terms since the Second World War, many garimpeiros have simply decided it is
no longer worthwhile to mine it.
Second, the differential between Brazil's official and black market exchange
rates has narrowed, from 100 per cent last year to about 10 per cent. The
change has deprived the garimpeiros of the huge exchange rate profits they
previously made on smuggling.
Finally, it has become increasingly difficult for small-time miners to work
Bom Futuro. Three years ago, garimpeiros were pulling the metal out of
reserves two to three metres below the surface. Now, most of the tin
reserves lie some 12 to 15 metres deep.
The Brazilian government has also done its part in pushing out the miners.
The garimpeiros' lack of concern for the environment provided welcome
ammunition.
'The garimpeiros cut down trees and pollute the rivers indiscriminately,'
said Mr Carlos Borba, economist at the minerals division of the ministry of
infrastructure.
Paranapanema's Mr Hanan also said the miners only succeed in extracting 50
per cent of the metal from the rock, whereas the company can take out 85 per
cent.
The government last year enacted two new laws to give the garimpeiros a
shove. First, none of the tin production from Bom Futuro could be ex-ported.
As Brazil consumes little tin domestically, that gave the miners no legal
market.
Second, the government required that any tin leaving Brazil must be
accompanied by certificates of origin, which has curbed smuggling.
Bom Futuro's output is already well down. In 1990, the mine produced 17,000
tonnes of tin, compared with 32,000 in its heyday. As Ebesa tightens its
grip on the area, that level may fall even further.

FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA gold producer suggests ways
to stimulate price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DEMAND-LED solution to the debilitating profit squeeze on South Africa's
gold industry was proposed yesterday by the country's main gold producer.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division at Anglo American,
said that a doubling of gold consumption for jewellery over the next four
years was 'the only way out' of a stagnant gold price.
He calculated that if jewellery consumption doubled from current levels of
about 1,800 tonnes a year to 3,600 tonnes, with 400 tonnes added for
industrial purposes, and assuming world production of about 2,000 tonnes per
annum, there was a prospect of demand being double supply. World demand for
jewellery grew by about 300 tonnes in both 1988 and 1989.
Mr Sunter said the industry was by looking at itself only as a producer. He
said it should pay closer attention to the customer. 'We are going to have
to promote ourselves out of trouble,' he said.
He suggested that the levies gold producers pay to the World Gold Council,
the international agency which promotes the consumption of gold, should be
increased, perhaps being linked to the gold price.
A tightening of the world gold market would encourage central banks to hold
on to their gold, said Mr Sunter.
Mr Sunter highlighted action on the supply side to improve the industry's
outlook: Curbing cost escalation - Anglo American wants to keep its costs
per kg of gold produced flat for two years.
Better use of technology, such as higher speed transport underground,
cutting ore rather than blasting it and improving metallurgical recoveries.
Improving remuneration systems with reward more closely based on
contribution.
Better management systems, with key decisions taken at the mine, not at head
office.
The trend towards area contribution accounting, treating each shaft as a
profit centre.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Japan loosens up on sale of
third world loans - How Tokyo's banks are under pressure to lift their
capital ratios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks in Europe and the US have been selling third world loan assets for
years, while Japanese banks have held tight. Now with their capital ratios
under pressure from the Basle international guidelines and with a discreet
nod from the Ministry of Finance, the portfolios are loosening. Japanese
banks are now important sellers of third world loans.
Japanese bankers play down the scale of their selling so far, saying there
is no uniform strategy, but admit that they are likely to step it up.
Mr Ryuichi Kato, chairman of the Nagoya-based Tokai Bank, said: 'In the
future, Japanese banks will have to think about the possible selling of
their credits like the European and American banks have done.' One
motivation, he said, would be to keep up capital ratios in the face of the
international bank capital guidelines.
Significant disposals of assets by Japanese banks emerged towards the close
of the last financial year, which ended March 31. Selling assets for cash is
one way to improve capital ratios. In addition, selling the bonds created by
Mexico's restructuring deal with banks last March enabled them to emerge
with a profit, because the bonds have risen sharply from the depressed price
at which they were first booked last year.
Officials from the Ministry of Finance say they do not mind Japanese banks
selling. There is one proviso, they say: that it doesn't produce a
disorderly market or damage the financial standing of the country concerned.
This appears to confirm Japanese bankers' assessments that the scale of
selling will be modest.
Japanese banks are the second-largest national group of bank creditors to
the less-developed countries (LDCs), after the US banks. For much of the
1980s, Japanese banks were new lenders in most of Latin America's debt
restructurings, while other banks - the so-called 'free-riders' - stayed
out. Their share of the outstanding debt also grew as other banks reduced
their portfolios, while the Japanese banks stood fast.
More recently though, the importance of the LDC debt issue to the banks has
begun to decline. The decline of the dollar against the yen has meant that
in yen terms, the absolute size of the dollar-denominated third world loan
portfolios has declined. Third world loans now make up only 1 per cent of
the loans of Japanese city, trust and long-term credit banks.
At the end of last September, the face value of third world loans held by
these banks amounted to Y3,528.4bn - nearly Dollars 26bn at current exchange
rates - of which the city banks accounted for the largest share: Y2,508bn.
This compares with the estimated Dollars 60bn held by US banks and to the
estimated stock of bank debt of roughly Dollars 400bn.
But not all the fall is due to yen appreciation. Since 1987 Japanese banks
have transferred assets to a Cayman Island shell company, called the
Japanese Bankers' Association. For example, some bonds Venezuelan debt
restructurings were transferred into the company, in which Japanese banks
own preferred shares based on the proportion of the assets that they
transfer into it.
However, Japanese bankers are uncomfortable about disclosing how much they
have transferred into the JBA, which they say does not itself sell assets
into the secondary market.
The reason for their discomfort is that it smacks of special tax concessions
available to banks and not to other types of companies.
The debt has also been reduced by the so-called 'Brady' restructurings in
which concessional bonds were exchanged for loans. All Japanese bank lenders
to Mexico and Venezuela swapped their old loans for concessional bonds.
The reason that the Japanese banks have been slower than most in selling
their loans, apart from their MoF-encouraged innate conservatism, was the
low level of reserves they had built up.
Building a cushion against loan losses is expensive for Japanese banks. To
do it they must sell assets from their hidden reserves - usually shares held
in Japanese companies.
In doing so, they must pay tax on their gains at one of the highest
corporate tax rates in the world. (For most restructuring countries, only 1
per cent is transferable into reserves tax free. For a minority, such as
Nicaragua or Peru, which have not made any payments to banks for three years
or more, a 50 per cent tax free reserve is allowed - in effect a write-off.)
This means the banks have to sell shares worth more than double the reserve
they establish. However, there is a tax break when a write-off is taken - so
the banks' reserves effectively cover more than double the actual reserve
level.
The Ministry of Finance for the first time this year has allowed banks to
set the reserve level they wish against their third world loans, lifting a
ceiling of 25 per cent that was previously in place. Most banks have moved
reserves to the 30 per cent level - an effective ratio of 70 per cent
because of the tax rules.
Tokai Bank's Mr Kato points out that the banks have asked the government to
allow tax-free reserving for all restructuring countries. The problem for
banks, according to other senior Japanese bankers, is that while, under
current tax rules, the banks are satisfactorily reserved against loss of
capital, they are not reserved against the build up of interest arrears. 'So
we have to suffer for the portion of interest that is not paid,' said one.
Sales of assets and the prospect for more are important enough for a dozen
or so of the largest secondary market dealers in LDC assets to have set up
some kind of operation in Tokyo.
So far, only one Japanese bank has established its own debt trading group:
the Bank of Tokyo, whose operation is based in New York.
Other Japanese banks are said to have considered similar moves but have not
yet taken the plunge.
Debt traders in Tokyo say they do not envisage Tokyo developing soon into
the two-way market now evident in London and New York. When Japanese banks
are in the market, they are sellers - although strong competition among
traders in Tokyo is such that the prices they obtain are generally keen.
There is an irony in the emergence of Japanese bank selling of LDC assets.
The banks are ridding themselves of their Latin American assets just as
investment institutions worldwide - and even the cautious Japanese - are
beginning to develop a selective interest in the region, at least in those
parts of it now enjoying economic success, such as Chile and Mexico.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: London Options Market aims to
widen retail appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Traded Options Market is introducing a series of improvements
designed to enhance the market's appeal to retail investors, write Tracy
Corrigan and Jim McCallum.
LTOM is planning firm price quotations on screen for retail orders of up to
10 contracts (10,000 shares) and a 'trade ticker' providing volume as well
as price information. The changes were targeted by a special committee
report by the LTOM Divisional Board, following a survey of broking houses
and private customers.
LTOM derives only 30 per cent of its business from retail investors,
compared with about 70 per cent at other options exchanges such as the
Chicago Board of Exchange and the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam,
according to Mr Geoffrey Chamberlain, LTOM's chairman. Retail business on
LTOM declined in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash.
Mr Chamberlain underlined the importance of retail investors in enabling
market-makers to balance their activities, since institutions often sell
calls to hedge their share holdings, while individual investors tend to be
buyers of calls. The issue of cost, considered a deterrent for investors,
has not been specifically addressed.
After the Big Bang reforms of 1986, share dealing commissions fell for large
customers but they remain unchanged for smaller investors. On an options
trade of up to Pounds 5,000, an individual investor will pay 5 per cent (2
1/2 per cent to buy and the same to sell).
The number of options dealers who will offer a service to small investors
has fallen. Mr Paul Hilton, options analyst at James Capel, says 'private
client operations have become very expensive to run'.
Consequently costs are only likely to fall if volume picks up.
High clearing fees also discourage investors. A fee per contract of between
Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.50 is charged by brokers for clearing through the
London Clearing House (Loch). Some brokers say this could be reduced to 25p
per contract. The Pounds 12 fee which is paid to Loch for margin purposes
when options are sold by investors is also widely criticised as a barrier to
small investors.
LTOM also plans to promote the use of the Public Limit Order Board, which
allows clients to place orders for execution at specific prices. Currently,
this accounts for less than 2 per cent of volume.
The exchange also plans to discuss with retail outlets such as banks and
building societies the setting up of execution facilities for clients.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Spain eases withholding tax
refunds to foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH Treasury is preparing new rules to facilitate the quick
repayment of a 25 per cent withholding tax on government bonds bought by
foreign investors.
Mr Manuel Conthe, the chief of the Treasury, said yesterday the new
regulations would mean non-resident bond holders would be paid back their
withholding tax within one or two days. The tax was effectively abolished at
the beginning of this year but repayments are cumbersome.
'The idea is that the foreign investor will not even notice that the tax has
been withheld,' he said. At present, foreign bond holders have to go through
a cumbersome procedure to claim the tax back after cashing in their coupons.
Proof of non-residence has to be obtained from the tax authority in their
country of residence and posted to Madrid. Return of the tax can take
months.
Mr Conthe said the new procedure, currently being worked out with the Bank
of Spain, would enable the Bank automatically to refund withheld amounts to
non-residents as soon as it received its list of debt holders. This could
take one to two days. Since April 1987 the Bank of Spain has run a book
entry system to provide information, clearing and custody services for
Treasury instruments.
He said it was impossible to abolish the tax as domestic investors would
still have to pay it. The Treasury, he said, wanted to make the new system
as watertight as possible to prevent local investors from buying bonds
through foreign institutions to escape the tax as well.
He said the move had been prompted by a sudden surge of foreign interest
this year in Spain's three and five-year bonds. In the expectation of
further interest rate falls in Spain, the value of bonds held by foreigners
has tripled this year to Dollars 12bn.
Mr Conthe said the measure would probably be introduced in June, when the
Treasury also plans to launch a new instrument - mainly for domestic
investors - to replace its low yield Pagares del Tesoro (promissory notes)
which have been used to draw untaxed income into the system.
Interest in the pagares has fallen off sharply in the last two years and Mr
Conthe said they would be replaced by Special Public Debt. This would yield
2 per cent (the pagares yield about 5 per cent) and mature over 6 years.
Their advantage is that holders would be guaranteed protection from the tax
authority.
Madrid has been loathe to declare a tax amnesty on black market money in
circulation in Spain, which some estimates put as high as Dollars 40bn.
Although the Special Public Debt instrument is not expected to attract much
interest, it is the closest the government has come to compromising with
opposition calls for a general amnesty.

THE LAURENTIAN Bank's plan to buy part of Standard Trustco for around
CDollars 55m (USDollars 47.8m) has run into opposition.
Several institutional lenders to Standard Trustco, saying they are owed
CDollars 100m, have asked the courts in Ontario to appoint a receiver so
they can take control of the company.
The receiver would operate Standard Trustco and negotiate the sale of assets
with any bidders, including Laurentian Bank.
Standard Trustco is in default on loan payments to 25 creditors, including
Bank of Tokyo Canada and Swiss Bank Corporation.
Laurentian Bank, based in Montreal, proposed taking over part of Standard
Trustco's operating subsidiary, Standard Trust, with deposits of CDollars
1.2bn and more than 30 branches. But this was conditional on approval of the
lenders, who now object to the terms. The trust company is financed
separately.
Standard Trustco is 48 per cent held by Roman Corporation, the holding
company of the late Canadian mining magnate, Stephen Roman. It also controls
Denison Mines, a big Canadian uranium producer also facing financial
problems.
BEAR Stearns has issued Dollars 150m of non-callable senior notes due April
15, 1998, the US investment bank said. The 9 1/8 per cent notes were priced
at 99.58 to yield 9.207 per cent or 130 basis points over Treasuries.

pinch after early spree - The trends behind this week's results from the
leading store chains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japanese retailers' earnings last year showed the benefits of a consumer
spending spree that began last spring but was tempered by the onset of the
Gulf crisis and by more general fears of a domestic economic slowdown.
Intense competition among supermarkets and convenience chains, many of which
have ambitious expansion plans, has cut margins for some operators, and
while results announced this week are generally favourable, profit growth is
expected to be slower in the current year.
Ito-Yokado, the Japanese supermarket operator, reported an 11.4 per cent
increase in pre-tax profit to Y88.8bn (Dollars 651m) for the year ended
February 1991 as consumer demand, particularly for foodstuffs, pushed sales
higher.
The company, which has just taken control of the financially troubled
Southland Corporation of the US, reported that total sales rose 7.7 per cent
to Y1,355bn, with an 11.6 per cent sales increase in foodstuffs, 6.6 per
cent in women's clothing, and 3.3 per cent in household-related goods.
Southland Corporation runs the Seven-Eleven convenience store chain in the
US, while Seven-Eleven Japan is a member of the Ito-Yokado group and
reported a 26.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y66.97bn.
The Japanese convenience store chain, which plans to increase its network by
320 stores to 4,648, is expecting a pre-tax profit this year of Y75.7bn.
Ito-Yokado, which has the best recent earnings record among the supermarket
operators, expects that a slowdown in the domestic economy will hinder sales
growth. However, the company announced that capital spending would be
increased by 62.7 per cent this year to Y76bn, with most of the money
devoted to renovation of existing outlets.
Sales this year are expected to be Y1,432bn, a 5.7 per cent increase, with a
pre-tax profit of Y92bn, up 3.7 per cent. This reflects concern in the
industry that the lower than expected Japanese wage gains announced after
the annual spring bargaining ritual will depress consumption this year.
Seiyu, another leading supermarket operator and member of the Seibu Saison
group, reported a 4.4 per cent increase in sales to 1,048bn, and a 10.3 per
cent increase in pre-tax profit at Y10.3bn. For the current year the company
expects sales of Y1,100bn, and a pre-tax profit of Y15.5bn.
FamilyMart, a convenience store chain that is also a Seibu Saison group
member, reported a 26.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y13.71 on a
32.2 per cent increase in sales to Y60.3bn.
The company said that a new point-of-sale stock monitoring system had led to
a 0.3 per cent improvement in the ratio of gross profit to sales.
For the year ending February 1992, FamilyMart expects a pre-tax profit of
Y16.8bn on sales of Y72.7bn.
Two retailers with large shareholdings held by the predatory and now
financially-troubled Shuwa Corporation yesterday reported sharp falls in
pre-tax profit. Nagasakiya reported a 45.8 per cent decrease to Y3.98bn,
while Chujitsuya announced a 16.9 per cent fall to Y5.59bn.
Nagasakiya's sales rose 0.7 per cent to Y409.2bn, but the company's profits
suffered because of a large fire at a store in western Japan, which reduced
gross profit by Y1.4bn and also prompted a Y600m increase in disaster
protection provisions.
The company, of which Shuwa owns 17.6 per cent, said earnings were also
affected by an unusually warm winter that reduced demand for warm clothing,
and by advertising restraint exercised in the wake of the blaze. This year,
the company expects a slight increase in pre-tax profit to Y4.4bn on sales
of Y440bn.
Shuwa accumulated stakes in a range of Japanese retailers for the claimed
purpose of restructuring the industry, though the company's stock and
property excesses have forced it to use several of the holdings as
collateral on loans from another supermarket operator, Daiei.
Chujitsuya, in which Shuwa has a 34 per cent stake that Daiei is apparently
keen to purchase, said profits fell because of a heavier interest payment
burden and despite a 4.2 per cent increase in sales to Y315.47bn.
The supermarket chain operator expects sales to reach Y328.6bn in the year
to end February, and that pre-tax profit will be virtually unchanged at
Y5.6bn.

IN ANOTHER sign of the technological advance of Japanese industry,
Mitsubishi Electric, a leading Japanese electronics group, and Westinghouse
of the US have revised a 70 year-old cross-licensing agreement.
Under the old arrangement, Westinghouse passed to Mitsubishi information
about a very wide range of its products, including turbines, electrical
motors and consumer appliances, for which Mitsubishi paid Y500m (USDollars
3.7m) a year in royalties. 'Westinghouse was our teacher,' said Mitsubishi
Electric yesterday.
The new agreement casts the two companies as equal partners.

jobs

ANGLO American, South Africa's largest mining house and the world's largest
gold producer, yesterday announced that 12,500 jobs would be lost at its
mines as a result of the depressed state of the industry.
Freegold, the world's largest mine, is to cut its 100,000 labour complement
by 8,000 and Vaal Reefs will cut 4,500 jobs from a current total of 49,600.
Last year Freegold announced 7,800 job losses.
The rationalisation at both mines stems from the need to curtail uneconomic
activities. Neither mines expect gold production levels to be affected as
they will be focusing on higher grades in the balance of their operations.
Announcing the March quarterly gold mining results, Mr Clem Sunter, chairman
of the gold and uranium division, said: 'We had to take some very tough
decisions . . . We hope that by so doing we will enable the division to
weather whatever further hard times face us.'
Mr Lionel Hewitt, executive director, described Freegold's performance,
which saw after-tax profit rise from R102.9m to R134.6m (Dollars 49.5m), as
'extremely pleasing'. Explaining the rationalisation, however, he noted that
the mine had posted a 52 per cent decrease, from R346m to R167.4m, in
available profit in the year to March.
He also pointed out that the north section of the mine had made a R10m loss
in the quarter, after capital expenditure.
Vaal Reefs suffered the effects of a slow recovery from the Christmas period
to record lower gold production. Combined with higher costs, this saw
profits from gold fall by 29.5 per cent to R124.4m.
Mr Hewitt said unexpectedly good grades in the south of the Western Deep
Levels mine saw gold production rise 2.6 per cent in the quarter. A R9.5m
jump in tax, however, left after-tax profits lower at R83.1m, against
R89.4m.

<TEXT>
STRUGGLING to maintain earnings in the face of falling aluminium prices,
Australia's Comalco has increased sackings and cutbacks at its huge Boyne
Island smelter on the central Queensland coast.
Comalco also has deferred a ADollars 1bn (Dollars 780m) expansion of its
plant following the stalling in negotiations with the state government over
the purchase of the nearby Gladstone power station which supplies power to
the smelter.
A subsidiary of resource group CRA, Comalco's net profit fell 33 per cent to
ADollars 181m for 1990 and the company expects a further deterioration in
earnings this year.
Comalco partly blames the recession in Australia for the downturn, but the
international aluminium price fall over the last three years has taken the
biggest toll on earnings.

liquidation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Renouf Properties have placed it in liquidation after efforts
to restructure its debts failed. The company is a subsidiary of Renouf
Corporation, the merchant bank.
Mr Andrew Strange, Renouf Properties' chairman, said no agreement could be
reached with bankers on a scheme of agreement to allow the company to meet
ongoing obligations. He said Coopers &amp; Lybrand had been appointed
provisional liquidator.
In February, the company reported a NZDollars 4.9m (USDollars 2.9m) loss for
the six months to December, and said its future was dependent on the outcome
of negotiations with the banks.
It had been unable to pay mortgage obligations since late in 1990 and had
failed to find a buyer for a portfolio of properties.
Mr Strange said a provisional liquidator had been appointed since the
company had no debenture holders who could initiate a receivership.
The banks held mortgages secured against individual properties and sales of
these were now a matter for the banks and the liquidator.
At December 31, Renouf Properties had borrowings of NZDollars 67m, equal to
59.7 per cent of total assets. The last published balance sheet valued the
company's 16 properties at NZDollars 112m.
Mr Strange said the liquidation should be seen in the context of the serious
problems which had beset the property sector since the 1987 share market
crash.

demand
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOW demand for cars and appliances slashed first-quarter results at Inland
Steel Industries, the large Chicago-based steelmaker.
The company reported a Dollars 40m net loss, or Dollars 1.50 per share, for
the first quarter, against net income of Dollars 18.7m, or 37 cents, a year
ago. The loss came on a 16 per cent decline in sales to Dollars 832.7m from
Dollars 992.5m a year ago.
Mr Frank Luerssen, chairman and chief executive, said the market for their
principal products - sheets and bar steels used in consumer durables - was
weak. Mr Luerssen, who was pessimistic about the near-term prospects of
recovery, said he saw no indication of a US economic rebound in Inland's
second-quarter order book.
Quarterly shipments by the wholly-owned integrated steel subsidiary, Inland
Steel Company, were the lowest in 20 years. Shipments fell during the first
three months by 19 per cent, to 937,000 tons, while sales plummetted 20 per
cent to Dollars 437.9m.
Lower-priced product mixes, start-up costs for its new high-technology steel
plant I/N Tek, a joint venture with Nippon Steel, and a 50-cents-per-hour
rise in steel workers' wages all helped to push down Inland's results.
The company's service division of materials distribution centres reported a
profit of Dollars 5.9m, but this was down from Dollars 9.8m a year ago.
For all of last year, Inland suffered a net loss of Dollars 20.6m, or
Dollars 1.41 per share, its first full-year loss since 1985.

Dollars 66.4m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TEXTRON, the US aerospace and financial services group, yesterday reported
static profits for the first quarter of 1991. It made Dollars 66.4m after
tax, compared with Dollars 66.2m in the same period a year earlier.
Sales in the quarter to the end of March rose modestly, from Dollars 1.88bn
to Dollars 1.91bn, while earnings per share progressed slightly to 76 cents,
against 73 cents. With the earnings figure roughly in line with analysts'
expectations, the shares eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 31.
Textron said both the Bell helicopter and financial services divisions fared
well, but its commercial products division was hit by the slump in 'consumer
confidence'.
The financial services operations made Dollars 80.9m, against Dollars 71.4m,
while helicopters turned in Dollars 37.8m, against Dollars 16.5m. The
commercial products side, by contrast, slumped from Dollars 46.8m to Dollars
20.5m.
Part of the shortfall was related to the unhappy saga of Textron's
acquisition of Avdel, the UK fasteners group, in 1989. Due to Federal Trade
Commission opposition to the merger, Textron has never been able to
consolidate Avdel's profits, although it has dividend income from the UK
business to the parent company.
In the first quarter of 1991, however, this income amounted to only Dollars
200,000, compared with Dollars 6.1m in 1990. Avdel made profits of Dollars
22m before tax last year.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Polaroid hit by slump in sales
of instant film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLUMP in sales of instant film contributed to a near-halving in Polaroid's
first-quarter earnings.
Net income slid to Dollars 16.4m, or 13 cents a share, from Dollars 31.8m,
or 43 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose fractionally to Dollars 441.2m, with
a 10 per cent rise in international shipments being largely offset by weak
demand in the US. Operating profits, which fell by 24 per cent, were also
hit by higher marketing expenses.
The recession, as well as the slump in tourism earlier this year,
contributed to the fall-off in film sales. Polaroid said retailers were
keeping low inventories.
On the other hand, there was a substantial - though unspecified - rise in
shipments of cameras, conventional film and videotape.
The popularity of cameras was helped by an aggressive campaign to promote
the company's One-Stop Flash cameras, which sell for under Dollars 30
apiece. The company expects higher camera sales will be followed by stronger
orders for instant film.
Polaroid cut its long-term debt by 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars
504.2m, and interest expense fell to Dollars 15.8m from Dollars 21.5m.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Manville in asbestos trust
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANVILLE, the Denver-based industrial products group, has begun setting
aside a portion of its profits to settle thousands of claims by victims of
its previous involvement in the asbestos business.
Manville's first-quarter earnings include an Dollars 8.1m 'profit- sharing'
charge earmarked for the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, one of
two agencies formed to handle the asbestos poisoning claims.
One of the conditions for Manville's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
1988 was a commitment to set aside 20 per cent of earnings for the personal
injury trust. The payments will begin in 1992, but are based on the previous
year's earnings. The other trust deals with property damage claims.
Despite the profit - sharing charge, Manville, whose business is now centred
on paper and packaging products, building materials, industrial fibre glass
and minerals, lifted net income to Dollars 35m, or 26 cents a share, in the
first quarter, from Dollars 24.9m, or 18 cents, a year earlier.
The improvement was entirely due, however, to receipt of about Dollars 40m
in settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Net sales slipped to Dollars
495.7m from Dollars 518m, and operating income was down to Dollars 41.6m
from Dollars 65.5m. The building products business was especially hard hit.
The Manville personal injury trust was set up in 1988 with about Dollars
2.5bn in assets. However it ran out of cash early last year after settling
claims more quickly than expected and finding itself deluged with
applications for relief from about 170,000 victims.
The trust's immediate problems were relieved in November with a refinancing
agreement involving the trust converting Manville preferred shares into
common stock, thereby entitling it to special dividends.
A new compensation system means that the most seriously ill asbestos victims
now have priority in the settlement of their claims. A ceiling has also been
placed on fees for claimants' lawyers.

SMITH Corona, the US typewriter manufacturer 48 per cent-owned by Hanson
group of the UK, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings. The
company made Dollars 3.8m after tax, compared with Dollars 6.1m in the same

This leaves net income for the first nine months of the financial year
virtually halved at Dollars 17.3m from Dollars 34.4m.
The group, badly hit over the past 18 months by falling demand and strong
pricing pressures, suggested it was pleased. 'The weak consumer spending
environment as well as the ongoing product mix shift favouring lower-priced
models continues to affect sales and earnings,' said Mr Lee Thompson,
chairman.
At the operating profit level, Smith Corona reported Dollars 5.2m against
Dollars 11.1m, while sales slipped from Dollars 110.6m to Dollars 80.9m.

It alleges fraudulent activity, accuses First Executive's management of

First Executive had an abnormally high proportion of its portfolio in junk,

PFIZER, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
improvement in first-quarter net income on a 20 per cent rise in sales,
after stripping out discontinued operations from the 1990 results.
Including extraordinary items, Pfizer's net income in the first three months
of 1991 rose 6 per cent to Dollars 267.4m, or 79 cents a share, from Dollars
251.9m, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Earnings per share have been restated
to reflect a two-for-one stock split in January.
In the 1990 quarter, the sale of the DeKalb Pfizer Genetics seed business
contributed Dollars 39m in pre-tax income.
Sales in the quarter rose 14 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.48bn,
led by growth in Pfizer's health care operations. During the quarter, Pfizer
spent Dollars 172.6m on research and development, up 28 per cent from the
first three months of 1990.
Sales from Pfizer's health care business climbed 22 per cent in the 1991
quarter, and sales from Pfizer's animal health operations rose 11 per cent.
However, consumer product sales rose a more modest 8 per cent, and
underlying sales from specialty chemicals and minerals improved by only 1
per cent.
Although there are still worries about litigation over Pfizer's Shiley heart
valve, analysts are bullish about its new product portfolio, which includes
the cardiovascular drug, Procardia XL, and Diflucan for AIDS-related fungal
infections.
Mr Edmund Pratt, chairman and chief executive, said Procardia XL and
Diflucan contributed Dollars 260m in sales in the quarter and Norvasc and
Cardura, two new cardiovascular drugs, Dollars 36m.
Schering-Plough, THe New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals and health care
products group, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 173.2m, or 79 cents
a share, from Dollars 150.4m, 66 cents a share, a year earlier, writes
Bernard Simon in New York.
Sales rose to Dollars 949.3m from Dollars 865.1m, despite the sale last July
of the Maybelline cosmetics business.
Mr Robert Luciano, chairman, predicted that earnings per share would climb
by between 18 and 20 per cent for 1991.
The company attributed the growth in US pharmaceutical sales to solid demand
for its anti-cancer, anti-infective and respiratory products.

holding fall to 10%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT, France's largest car group which also includes Citroen, yesterday
displayed its greater resilience to recession than some competitors, by
announcing a 10.1 per cent decline in profits last year.
Net earnings fell to FFr9.2bn (Dollars 1.64bn) last year, from FFr10.3bn in
1989, marking the end of five straight years of growth. Turnover rose by 4.6
per cent to FFr159.9bn from FFr152.9bn over the same period, while net
profit margins shrank slightly to 5.8 per cent from 6.7 per cent.
That is a much smaller decline and shows wider margins than Renault, the
group's state-owned rival, which recently reported an 87 per cent drop in
profits, reflecting its higher borrowings and greater exposure to the
depressed truck market.
However, Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot's chairman, said the group had missed
several targets in a 'stormy' year, and confessed pessimism over the advance
of Japanese competition and the general outlook for the European car market.
'European markets, which were in general on a gently climbing slope in the
first four or five months of 1990, then went into a moderate slowdown which
was expected before the Gulf crisis, while the end of the year was
characterised by a steep drop in registrations, notably in November and
December,' he said.
European car demand fell by 4.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year,
against the same period of 1990, and was heading for an overall average
decline of 5 per cent for the full year, Mr Calvet estimated. Peugeot's
European market share rose slightly to 12.9 per cent, below its 13 per cent
target. Production was roughly unchanged at 2.2m vehicles - 1.4m Peugeot and
812,000 Citroen - while sales volumes fell slightly to 2.19m last year from
2.2m vehicles in 1989. Foreign sales accounted for more than 58 per cent of
unit volumes, slightly more than the 56.9 per cent in 1989.
Peugeot's break-even point, meanwhile, rose from annual sales of 1.12m
vehicles to 1.5m, reflecting pressure on margins and irregular production
flows. Productivity rose by 5.2 per cent, again below target, said Mr
Calvet.
Group debts rose from FFr1.9bn to FFr8.3bn last year.

KINNEVIK, the Swedish communications group, and Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK
will start a private telecommunications network to compete against Sweden's
national agency, Televerket.
The new network, Tele2, will be aimed initially at business customers.
Kinnevik last year sold 40 per cent of Tele2's predecessor Comvik Skyport to
Cable &amp; Wireless for SKr100m (Dollars 16.5m).
Tele2, which will start this autumn, has signed a 25-year agreement to use
fibre optical cable networks that have been laid alongside Sweden's main
railway lines.
But Tele2's access to households has been blocked since it has to rent use
of the system operated by Televerket, which is demanding a prohibitively
high fee, according to Mr David Johannesson, Kinnevik president.
Tele2 hopes for annual revenues of SKr1bn by the year 2000, which would
still make it much smaller than Televerket, which had sales of SKr31bn in
1990.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: French banks lift bad debt
provision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CREDIT Agricole and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), France's two largest
banks, yesterday reported sharp increases in provisions for bad debts last
year.
Credit Agricole, the co-operative farmers' bank which leads the French
industry, yesterday unveiled a 3.9 per cent rise in annual net profits to
FFr4.7bn (Dollars 839m) after a 25 per cent rise in provisions to FFr11.9bn.
Net profits at state-owned BNP, by contrast, plunged. They more than halved
to FFr1.6bn, after a 6.3 per cent rise in provisions to FFr7bn, qualified by
Mr Rene Thomas, the chairman, as a 'disappointing' result.
BNP's operating profits fell by 14 per cent from FFr11.2bn in 1989 to
FFr9.6bn last year, mainly dragged down by the mainstream French banking
activities, while overseas operations held their earnings steady, said the
group.
It attributed the drop to a movement of customers' savings away from bank
deposits towards investment funds, higher bad debts for both private and
corporate borrowers and interest payment delays on sovereign loans.
Lending rose by 14.4 per cent, while deposits and funds under management
rose by 15.4 per cent to FFr556bn.
A strike at the start of the year cost BNP FFr600m, on top of which came the
FFr1bn cost of winding up the Banque Internationale de l'Afrique
Occidentale, which BNP placed in liquidation last June. BNP also had to make
a FFr773m sovereign risk provision on the loan book of Banque Arabe et
Internationale d'Investissement, (BAII) after taking control of BAII last
May.
However, shareholders' funds increased sharply during the year, by FFr12.5bn
to FFr41.3bn, thanks to capital increases and acquisitions of shareholdings
in Pechiney, the state controlled aluminium group and UAP, the state
insurer.
Shareholders' funds at Credit Agricole rose by 13.8 per cent to FFr77.7bn,
making it the world's third largest bank. Operating profits rose at the same
time by 4.1 per cent, to FFr17.9bn from FFr17.2bn, proof of vitality in a
difficult market, maintained Mr Philippe Jaffre, managing director of Caisse
Nationale de Credit Agricole, the bank's central organisation.
Total loans outstanding rose by 12 per cent to FFr937bn from FFr837bn.
The bank made FFr174bn of new loans last year, of which FFr32.4bn went to
farmers, FFr81.9bn for house purchases and FFr17.4bn to corporate customers.
Deposits, meanwhile, rose by 14.6 per cent to FFr885bn, from FFr772bn,
reflecting a 1.5 percentage point increase in the bank's share of the market
for new savings in France, to 13.5 per cent.

FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Share swappers at halfway house
/ A look at tentative link-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility of a share swap between Credit Lyonnais, the French
state-controlled high street bank, and Commerzbank, Germany's third largest
bank, was first mooted by Mr Walter Seipp, chief executive of the German
bank in 1987.
However, the attempt to reinforce links was put on ice when the French
socialists returned to power in 1988.
With the climate now changed, Credit Lyonnais, he hopes, will take a roughly
10 per cent stake in Commerzbank, with the Germans buying some 7 per cent of
the significantly larger French entity. But Mr Seipp must worry that with
his agreement dotted and crossed, awaiting only its coveted official seal,
the French government may in fact give priority to a larger, if apparently
less advanced, deal.
This is the arrangement between BNP, the largest state-controlled bank and
Dresdner, Germany's second financial institution.
The two have been working together under an agreement formalised in 1989 by
appointing a director to each others' supervisory boards. Now, a share
exchange, of perhaps 7 per cent each way, is in prospect.
But why - assuming both deals come to fruition - a cross-shareholding in the
first place? Is it merely the strategy of those who cannot, or cannot afford
to buy?
Certainly Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank that has bought aggressively
in other parts of Europe and has loudly shunned the halfway house of share
swaps, has so far failed to find an eligible candidate in France.
Dresdner Bank has secured control of the Paris bond and derivatives
specialist Banque Internationale de Placement, but it is not the size of
venture to which the German house aspires.
Meanwhile, Barclays Bank snapped up the private bank Merck Finck in Germany
last year, merely demonstrating in the process how rare such opportunities
are - with full service banks essentially not for sale in the closely-knit
and soundly solid domestic market. Hence the share swaps.
At the same time, as Mr Stephen Lewis, banking analyst at Salomon in London
points out, 'a cross-shareholding per se does nothing for the development of
business'. With most analysts regarding all parties relatively immune from
predatory advances, hence rejecting a primarily defensive rationale, the
search is on for concrete advantages.
There has been a degree of basic co-operation already. Most recently, Credit
Lyonnais and Commerzbank, whose association goes back 20 years, combined
forces in the UK with Commerzbank providing a German desk in CL Securities.
BNP and Dresdner, meanwhile, last year set up a venture in Hungary, with
plans too in Prague.
All the banks are coy as to specific plans for togetherness in the future.
However, one obvious plus would be the capital boost. Credit Lyonnais for
example has expanded fast recently.
As regards sharing the retail branch network, it is difficult to see large
dividends. Commerzbank, which has exchanged shares with another Europartner,
Banco Hispano Americano, is able to arrange useful facilities for German
tourists in Spain. But the Franco-German fit is not so neat.
The main advantages will therefore accrue from commercial business though
Dresdner sounds interested in the global reach of possible links with BNP
extending thorough Asia and North America. Both groupings cite eastern
Europe - where the Germans see a political advantage in a partner helping
staunch any nascent imperialism charges. Sharing the risks as well as the
rewards could in the early stages be attractive.
Further along, the very different styles of the partners may grate - Credit
Lyonnais has paid handsomely for its expansion. Later both German banks will
also have to decide how they react to the possibly inconvenient wishes of
their partners' principal shareholder.
Meanwhile, should the French government drag its feet now, both German banks
can console themselves that the emergent east German market is boosting
their savings base and hence future profits far faster than could the fruits
of French partnerships, at least for the foreseeable future.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tie Rack throttled by US side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIE RACK, the specialist retailer, is moving to tighten its grip on its
loss-making US operations in the face of a plunge in pre-tax profits.
In the 53 weeks to February 3, profits tumbled to Pounds 51,000 compared
with Pounds 1.76m for the previous 52 weeks. Turnover was down 8 per cent to
Pounds 53.8m (Pounds 58.6m) while operating profits fell 36 per cent to
Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 3.22m).
The reorganisation of the US operations, where operating losses increased to
Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.19m), is aimed at bringing it directly under UK
supervision in the hope that this will help stem the losses there and
improve overall profitability.
Commenting on the results, Mr Roy Bishko, the chairman who led Tie Rack's
rapid expansion in the late 1980s, admitted that the group had over-extended
itself after going public.
In most of its main markets it was faced with sluggish consumer activity.
The difficulties of its US operations, which have been in loss for the three
years that the group has been in that market, were exacerbated by local
management problems and the weak dollar.
The group is closing its US warehouse, handling distribution directly from
the UK and bringing the US shops under direct UK control. Administration is
being merged with the Canadian operation.
UK business was also hurt by the economic downturn and the impact of the
Gulf war, which reduced sales volume at airport shops by 20 per cent in the
first months of this year. Turnover in the UK declined to Pounds 33.69m
(Pounds 36.37m) and operating profits fell to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 4.24m). In
the UK the company was further plagued by problems with certain franchisees.
The lower profits figure included an exceptional item of Pounds 444,000
relating to debts of its franchisees. The group has had to terminate its
contracts with eight franchisees where trading had deteriorated to the
extent that payments for stocks were not being made.
Buoyant business in France helped European turnover rise to Pounds 4.72m
(Pounds 4.5m). Operating profit, however, fell to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds
1.26m).
The group has made efforts to control costs and cash by reducing borrowings
by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.3m, capital expenditure by 77 per cent to Pounds
900,000 and stock holdings by 17 per cent to Pounds 10.8m.
Losses per share were 1.88p (2.42p earnings). The final dividend is passed
(0.285p), making nil (0.75p) for the year.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Adverse exchange rates check advance at
Whatman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits growth at Whatman, the specialist paper and filtration
equipment maker, slowed to 7 per cent during 1990.
Profits came to Pounds 11.02m (Pounds 10.28m), achieved on reduced turnover
of Pounds 44.58m (Pounds 47.86m).
The company said the slowdown was partly attributable to adverse exchange
rate movements and a reduction in turnover attributable to the disposal of
the Whatman Air Filtration business.
In spite of recession in the group's main markets, sales increased in all
regions, except the UK, by an average of 9 per cent.
Profits were particularly affected by a 20 per cent increase in marketing
and product development. Capital expenditure exceeded Pounds 10m and
acquisitions Pounds 500,000.
The company said this benefited the Laboratory division's mail-order
business, while improvements to plant and new product development
capabilities in the US strengthened the Filter Systems side, which extended
its range of air purification units and achieved notable sales growth in
Japan and France.
A significant increase in sales of advanced papers buoyed the Speciality
Products division, where costs were temporarily increased by the design of a
new paper machine, which should lift future capacity by a third.
On earnings per share up from 30.74p to 33.1p, the final dividend is 5.25p
for a total of 7.75p (6.25p). The shares rose 3p on the day, closing at
453p.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa ahead but warns on outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVELOCK EUROPA, the shopfitting group where institutional shareholders
insisted on the installation of a new chairman and chief executive in 1989,
substantially increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.5m in 1990.
But Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, warned of a falling order book in a 'cold
and unhelpful climate' for shopfitting. That would have an adverse effect on
profits in the first half of 1991 although there should be an improvement in
the second six months.
Sir Lewis said he now regarded Havelock as having been restored to health
under Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive. Pre-tax profit compared with Pounds
312,000 for the 36 weeks to December 31 1989, and Pounds 52,000 in the prior
full year.
He said that Havelock's customers, which include retail groups such as Boots
and Marks and Spencer as well as TSB in the financial services sector, had
proved more resilient than the average. The group benefited from a reduction
in borrowings from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 1.15m over the year.
Although the order book finished 1990 at a strong level it had not been
fully maintained since then, and there was some pressure on margins.
The Havelock Technical Services subsidiary was closed during the year which
meant an extraordinary provision of Pounds 352,000.
Mr Balfour said Havelock aimed to become the market leader in large
department store fitting. It wanted to reduce its seasonal profit variations
by expanding further into fitting financial services premises and expected
shortly to announce co-operation with NCR, which makes self-service banking
equipment.
Group sales in 1990 were Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 32.79m). Earnings per share
came to 5.8p (1.6p) and the final dividend is 2.1p for a total of 3.6p
(2.5p).

Scruttons, which operates port, shipping, engineering and other service
businesses, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 1.87m in
1990.
Mr Richard Gardiner-Hill, chairman, regarded the result as satisfactory
against a background of temporary problems related to the London terminal
business.
The three service divisions increased profits.
In the current year the group had started well, and again higher profits
were expected in the service divisions.
Turnover rose to Pounds 22.72m (Pounds 19.66m).
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 336,000 relating to repairs at
the Victoria Deep Water Terminal. It will be wholly or partly out of action
until September.
The shares are traded on a matched bargain basis. Earnings were 28.7p
(36.1p) and the dividend is again 15p.

Exceptional charges held back pre-tax profits of Cradley Group, the
lithographic printer, to Pounds 710,000 in the half year ended December 31
1990, against Pounds 759,000.
Before exceptionals profits rose 61 per cent to Pounds 1.03m on turnover
ahead 48 per cent to Pounds 14.42m. The results were much in line with the
second half of last year when investment plans began to come on stream, said
Mr Donald Jordan, chairman.
Exceptional charges comprised: bad debt provision Pounds 281,000 (Pounds
130,000) and reorganisations costs Pounds 69,000 (nil), less surplus on sale
of assets Pounds 34,000 (Pounds 251,000). Mr Jordan said there had been
substantial closures of magazine titles and a consequential increase in bad
debts.
The restructuring in South Wales had been completed. Management of the
Hertfordshire company had been restructured although much needed to be done
to obtain an adequate return.
Earnings per share came to 1.4p (1.6p).

Molyneux Estates showed an increased loss, from Pounds 149,000 to Pounds
267,000, in the half-year ended December 24 1990.
Mr David Lewis, chairman, said that the figure took into account rising
income receivable and also a deficit of Pounds 191,000 (Pounds 59,000)
within the Overgate Centre associate, pending substantial rent reviews and
new lettings. These were expected to begin coming through in the next
financial year.
In a reference to finance, Mr Lewis said total direct and indirect
indebtedness currently amounted to Pounds 18.7m at an annual cost of about
Pounds 2.46m. Current net rent receivable, including Overgate and rent
reviews from March 25, was estimated at Pounds 2.31m annually, and the
current rental value was put at Pounds 3.5m arising from reviews and
reversions between 1991 and 1994.
Turnover rose to Pounds 909,000 (Pounds 613,000) and losses per share came
to 1.47p (0.82p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WILTON GROUP, involved both in investing and dealing in property and shares
and in specialist restoration stonemasonry, has launched a recommended offer
for Cowan de Groot.
At the same time Wilton also announced a decline into losses of Pounds 1.08m
(profits Pounds 822,000) for 1990, on turnover of Pounds 4.26m (Pounds
5.24m).
Wilton already owns 7.4m ordinary shares (29.3 per cent) in the toys,
electrical components, hardware and household goods company and is offering
six new ordinary shares for every Cowan ordinary, valuing each Cowan at 15p
and the whole company at Pounds 3.8m.
It is also offering one new 11 per cent cumulative preference share for each
Cowan 10.5 per cent cumulative preference share.
In 1990 interest payable and similar charges reduced Wilton's pre-tax line
by Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 452,000) and losses per share emerged at 0.26p
(earnings 0.16p).
Mr Michael Buckley, chairman, said that a main factor in the decline in
profitability was Wilton's investment in Cowan. A takeover was a 'practical
commercial solution,' given that so much of Wilton's management resources
had been spent on Cowan's affairs.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Rights issue benefits lift Albert Fisher to
Pounds 45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT FISHER Group, the acquisitive fresh produce distributor and food
processor, reported a 47 per cent advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
30.53m to Pounds 44.98m, for the six months to end-February.
Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements and acquisitions, underlying
profit growth was just over 15 per cent.
At the earnings per share level, the rise was held back to 13 per cent at
5.18p (4.59p); the interim dividend is up 17 per cent to 1.75p (1.5p).
The group's shares fell 5p to 115p on the announcement, although analysts
said there was no disappointment with the numbers. Sentiment towards the
shares has been affected recently by the sudden departure of Mr Keith
Brackpool, who headed the North American operations. His departure followed
the revelation that he personally owed Polly Peck International, the failed
trading group, over Dollars 10m relating to a share deal done by a company
he ran.
Mr Tony Millar, executive chairman, said the group was looking for a new
chief executive for the US business.
The figures benefited from interest receivable of Pounds 9.85m (Pounds
80,000) following the Pounds 180m rights issue launched just before
Christmas 1989. The group has net cash of Pounds 65m, but this is expected
to be spent over the second half.
Europe was the best performing area for the group with Germany and the
Netherlands providing good growth. Fresh produce operating profits rose 22
per cent to Pounds 6.5m and food processing and distribution was up 42 per
cent to Pounds 18.5m.
North American profits fell, in sterling terms, from Pounds 12m to Pounds
10.1m as recession and the Gulf War hit the food service business, which
includes catering for hotels and airlines.
The group took a Pounds 3.7m write down after tax on its 24.2 per cent stake
in Pacific Agricultural Holdings. PAH owns land in Cadiz, California, with
its own water supply which was to be developed for growing produce, but for
which there are now different plans.
COMMENT
Albert Fisher has suffered its share of bear raider inspired rumours but the
Brackpool incident has to be put down as a mistake by the company. Sentiment
has turned against the stock, not because Mr Brackpool was thought vital to
the group, more that Mr Millar's judgment in hiring him has been called into
question. There is also some concern that a large acquisition is coming,
though Mr Millar retains his reputation for not overpaying. These fears do
not remove the underlying argument for Fisher that the fresh produce market
is one of the fastest growing areas in the food industry, but is still
highly fragmented. The group should make Pounds 93m pre-tax (Pounds 74.4m)
for the full year, giving a prospective p/e of 10.6 and a yield of 4.5 per
cent if the full year dividend rises 15 per cent. The rating has come down
from the group's glory days, but the shares may remain under a cloud yet a
while.

DAVID S Smith, the largest paper-maker in the UK, yesterday launched a

The issue, on a 1-for-4 basis at 295p, was well received by the stock market

The issue was accompanied by a forecast of pre-tax profits of not less than
Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 26.4m) for the year to end-April, much in line with
analysts' expectations. The company also promised a final dividend of 6.75p
(6.5p) to give a total of 9.5p (9.25p).
The Kemsley mill was bought for Pounds 10.6m in 1989 and since then the
group has spent Pounds 40m upgrading and increasing the capacity of two
paper machines there. Smith had always said the purchase was a long-term
investment which would take some years to pay off.
Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, who is leaving the company at the end
of this month, said that so far the investment had been funded from
cashflow, despite poor trading conditions. However, it now seemed a good
moment to raise equity capital to refinance it.
A further Pounds 24m is expected to be spent on the mill, to bring capacity
up to 350,000 tonnes a year compared to 170,000 at the time of acquisition.
The total cost of the mill will be substantially less than it would have
cost to build the same capacity from scratch.
After repaying debt of Pounds 37.7m, the group will be left with some cash.
Mr Peter Williams, Mr Brewster's replacement at Smith, said other divisions
were looking to expand both organically and by acquisition. Mr Brewster said
these businesses had been somewhat held back because of the heavy investment
at Kemsley.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Kwik Save acquires 42 Gateway stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, the discount food retailer, yesterday announced the Pounds 26.5m
acquisition of 42 Gateway Foodmarkets from Isosceles, the group formed to
buy-out the complete chain in a Pounds 2.1bn leveraged buy-out in 1989.
The price paid for the shops, based in the north-east, is more than double
their estimated net asset value of Pounds 12m.
Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, defended the premium on the grounds
that it would have normally taken up to seven years to have bought so many
new shops in communities where Kwik Save does not have a significant
presence.
He was also pleased to have 'taken out a competitor.'
It marks the first sizeable acquisition since Kwik Save bought the Victor
Value stores in February 1989.
Isosceles had indicated last year that it would keep its Gateway stores in
the north-east after a deal to sell 81 outlets to Wm Low for Pounds 212m
fell through.
However, Isosceles said yesterday that it had only wanted to keep the larger
northern stores and was delighted to have sold the 'smaller, older ones' to
Kwik Save.
The acquisition brings the total number of Kwik Save shops to more than 700.
Mr Seabrook said the company, which is opening one new store a week, was
looking for more buying opportunities in the Midlands and south-east.
A further Pounds 7m has been put aside for the year to install computer
scanning and to convert 32 of the stores into Kwik Save outlets and 12 into
the Lateshopper format. They will be absorbed into the network over the next
two months.
A Gallop opinion poll commissioned by the company showed that the shopper
was most concerned by the location and the price of goods in stores.
All of the acquired Gateway stores were trading profitably.
Borrowings were used to fund the acquisition resulting in gearing in single
figures. Goodwill is to be written off to revenue reserves.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Henry Barrett plummets by 96% to Pounds
272,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM PROFITS at the Henry Barrett Group, the steel and industrial
products company that grew rapidly in the 1980s through acquisitions,
plummetted 96 per cent as it was hit by the sharp downturn in the UK
construction industry.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to February 28 fell from Pounds 6.46m to
Pounds 272,000, on turnover down to Pounds 57.43m (Pounds 67.8m). The
profits fall compares with a 96 per cent increase in the previous half year
on turnover ahead 75 per cent.
Mr James Barrett, chief executive, said the group had been hit by a sharp
decline in turnover and profit margins, particularly in the steel buildings
division, where a 29 per cent fall in turnover was the largest among all
divisions.
As the economic climate in the UK deteriorated, profit margins for the
industry fell in line with a 30 per cent decline in the selling price of
buildings. The group's design and build business was especially hard hit and
while productivity was significantly improved this could not completely
offset the fall in profit margins.
Lindapter International, a manufacturer of proprietary industrial
fastenings, the steel services division and BNL, which markets thermoplastic
bearing technology, were the only businesses that were profitable.
The group has adopted a strategy of disposing of non-core businesses in an
attempt to reduce gearing to the 31 per cent level recorded in the previous
financial year. Gearing at the half-year was 74 per cent.
At the end of March, it sold its Lurmark spray nozzle manufacturing business
for Pounds 3.25m - Pounds 1m over book value - and is currently in talks on
another possible disposal. The sale of Lurmark reduced gearing to 62 per
cent.
There has been an improvement in order books in the second half with the Don
Reynolds curtain walling business currently enjoying a record order book in
excess of Pounds 12m.
'We fundamentally believe that the worst is over,' Mr Barrett said. While
the group saw a downturn it has been able to increase market share
reflecting weaker positions of competitors. He, nevertheless, conceded that
the group would not vigorously contest analysts' revised forecasts of Pounds
3m to Pounds 5m for the full year.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Diversified Sage grows 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVEMENT, from 31.3 per cent to 33.1 per cent, in operating margins
pushed Sage Group, the Newcastle-based computing services company, to record
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.02m in the six months to March 31.
The 29 per cent increase from Pounds 2.34m came on sales up 17 per cent from
Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 7.8m. Earnings per share rose 24 per cent to 11.98p
(9.65p). The interim dividend is raised 15 per cent to 2.7p (2.35p).
The company, whose core business is the provision of low-cost accountancy
software for small firms, is benefiting from its diversification into
networking software, while recurrent revenues from software maintenance,
computer stationery, consumables and training have reached 33 per cent of
total sales.
Mr David Goldman, chairman, said the company had increased its share of the
accounting software market from 39 per cent by volume in February 1990 to 55
per cent this year.
Networking products were selling well in Europe, although the US subsidiary,
while more than doubling sales, suffered a slight loss.
Sage is paying Dollars 18m (Pounds 10m) for DacEasy, a loss-making US
accounting software company, and on the basis of good first quarter results
believes it will contribute both to sales and pre-tax profits this year.
While Mr Goldman was cautious about second-half results he said that sales
in the first few months of the year had become noticeably more consistent.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Wm Low shrugs off consumer spending decline
with 9% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer, yesterday announced an 9 per cent
increase, from Pounds 10.49m to Pounds 11.42m, in pre-tax profits for the 28
weeks to March 16.
Mr James Millar, chairman and chief executive, said that operating profit
had been maintained at Pounds 11m despite only one new store opening and
additional costs in distribution and information technology.
The downturn in consumer spending had hit the small older stores but had
only had a marginal effect in the majority of its outlets, he said.
The Pounds 37.9m rights issue last December helped eliminate borrowings and
net interest receivable totalled Pounds 403,000 (payable Pounds 590,000). Mr
Millar said the results showed how crucial the rights issue had been in
funding the group's development programme. 'Our decision to be one of the
first companies to tap the market for cash - criticised by some at the time
 -has been vindicated,' he said.
Mr Millar said the group was only interested in expanding through organic
growth. It had made two abortive attempts to expand through acquisition,
including a plan to buy Gateway's northern stores from Isosceles, some of
which were sold to Kwik Save yesterday for Pounds 26.5m.
Low is using the cash raised from the rights issue to open more stores over
the next two years. It has a large schedule of committed new openings which
will add at least 155,000 sq ft by September 1992.
The group incurred significant additional costs from the setting up of the
new multi-temperature Livingston depot, which was recently brought on
stream, and the programme to upgrade the information systems. This affected
the operating margin which fell from last year's 6 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
The group expects trading to remain static during the remainder of the year.
Turnover rose to Pounds 198.45m (Pounds 185.05m) and fully diluted earnings
per share edged up to 13.5p, compared to 12.86p. The interim dividend is
raised to 2.7p (2.5p).

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Banco Bilbao director quits Hambros' board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ENRIQUE Mas Montanes, the director representing Banco Bilbao Vizcaya on
the board of Hambros, the London merchant banking group, has resigned.
BBV has owned 5.6 per cent of Hambros since 1986, the stake intended to be
part of a network of relationships among European banks. But Mr Chips
Keswick, Hambros' vice-chairman, said yesterday that ties with BBV had
'languished' because of other preoccupations at the Spanish bank. He
stressed that relations were still cordial.
It is expected that BBV will now move to sell its Hambros stake, though it
has not commented on its intentions.
Last week Baltica, the Danish insurance concern, sold its 14 per cent
interest in Hambros, whose two main shareholders are now Istituto San Paolo
di Torino, the Italian bank, with 14 per cent, and GRE, the UK insurance
company, with 10 per cent.
Although some of the stakes were taken up for defensive reasons, the
emergence of the single European market in the late 1980s gave a greater
logic to cross-border ties and international banking business; but analysts
have increasingly questioned the value to Hambros of its shareholding
relationships, and the distancing of BBV will add to the impression that
their impact on profits is small.

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: C&amp;S asks for share suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL &amp; Sheerwood, the engineering and property development group headed
by Mr Robert Maxwell, the media magnate, has asked for a temporary
suspension of its shares, pending an acquisition announcement. The shares
were suspended yesterday at 3 1/4 p.
The announcement came as C&amp;S reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 2.94m (Pounds 2.55m) for 1990. It also announced that it
was withdrawing from its property development businesses.
The suspension of the shares was described by Charterhouse Bank, its
financial adviser, as 'entirely a precautionary move and not on the back of
any rumour or speculation.'
The rise in profits, achieved in spite of the adverse economic climate in
the UK, came on the strength of the group's exports to continental Europe,
which constitute 70 per cent of turnover. The entire turnover, up 6.6 per
cent to Pounds 53.17m (Pounds 49.87m), and the bulk of the profits, came
from the engineering division, where profits rose 53 per cent to Pounds 3m
(Pounds 1.95m).
Mr Maxwell said the ability of the group's engineering companies to maintain
profits depended to a large extent on the level of demand in other EC
countries.
The property division suffered from the downturn in the UK commercial
property market and was not able to make any external property sales at
acceptable prices, he said. The decision to cease property development
activities came in the wake of a substantially lower property profits of
Pounds 134,000 (Pounds 714,000).
Earnings per share increased to 0.62p (0.54p) and a final dividend of 0.01p
is recommended making a total of 0.2p (0.1p).

ANGLO-PARK plans to merge with fellow property group St James Estates via an
agreed offer of 19 new ordinary shares for every 20 St James ordinary not
already held.
Anglo-Park acquired a 21.9 per cent stake in St James in recent weeks and
the offer is for the remaining equity.
It also announced yesterday that its losses jumped to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds
68,000) in the first-half to December 31.
The deficit was swelled by provisions of Pounds 518,000 against book values
of developed and investment properties and a further Pounds 115,000 written
off against revaluation reserves.
Damage was also inflicted by a provision of Pounds 342,000 against the
investment in St James. This is related to a write-down of the value of the
latter's property in Oxford Street, London, following a professional
valuation. The matter is the subject of litigation.
The interim dividend is cut to 0.5p (2p) on losses per share of 12.6p
(0.7p).
Turnover fell to Pounds 247,000 (Pounds 610,000) and gross profit came to
Pounds 3,000 (Pounds 165,000).
For the year St James incurred a loss of Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds
3.15m.

95m at Littlewoods
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LITTLEWOODS Organisation, the privately-owned retail and football pools
group, yesterday raised pre-tax profits by 46 per cent from Pounds 64.9m to
Pounds 94.8m in 1990.
This increase came in spite of only a marginal gain in turnover from Pounds
2.26bn to Pounds 2.37bn.
Pre-tax profits for the company's retail divisions rose from Pounds 73.2m to
Pounds 83.6m on sales rising by just over 3 per cent to Pounds 1.73bn.
Profits from the pools operations, however, were only up to Pounds 17.3m
last year from Pounds 17.1m in 1989.
Littlewoods is still undecided about the future of its mail-order operations
which achieved trading profits last year of Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 51.7m) on
sales of Pounds 933m (Pounds 957m).
Mr Desmond Pitcher, chief executive, said yesterday that no negotiations
were currently taking place for the sale of the division. An approach for
the mail-order operations had been made to the company earlier this year but
the Pounds 400m offer had fallen 'significantly short' of Littlewoods'
asking price.
Littlewoods had asked Kleinwort Benson to advise it on the possible sale of
the mail-order business.
Mr Pitcher said that a possible sale was only being considered 'to ensure
that adequate funds are available to expand the rest of the company's
activities'. The Moores family, which controls the company, is determined
that Littlewoods should remain privately owned and consequently is having to
seek finance through the sale of some assets.
If no buyer is found for the mail-order division, then 'other avenues of
financing our growth' would be explored, said Mr Pitcher.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALKER GREENBANK, the commercial wallcoverings group, brought forward the
announcement of a near-12 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to help its
defence against a challenge from its largest shareholder.
Aubin, the Jersey-based holder of 27.4 per cent of the equity, has
requisitioned an EGM for April 26 which will consider the appointment of
five non-executive direc-tors.
Walker has described the move as an attempt 'to take control on the cheap.'
Its share price gained another 1p yesterday to close at 70p, giving a market
value of Pounds 64m.
In the year to February 2 1991, taxable profit rose to Pounds 7.96m (Pounds
7.12m) although an important factor was a switch from Pounds 2.52m interest
paid to Pounds 1.07m received.
The group's disposal programme helped turn net debt of Pounds 18.4m into
Pounds 5.7m cash. Turnover fell to Pounds 75.34m (Pounds 127.27m).
Walker's change of tack, which involved the sale of 18 businesses in 18
months for just over Pounds 30m, followed the puncturing of Sir Anthony
Jolliffe's efforts to build up a conglomerate. 'Accounting irregularities'
were discovered at the Alkar shop-fitting subsidiary in 1988 and the shares
shed about 40 per cent of their value.
Aubin started buying in mid-1989, when the price range was 100p to 133p. The
October crash brought it down to a low of 44p. By the end of the year Aubin,
which has admitted that it originally hoped to make an agreed bid, had just
over 8 per cent.
Aubin wrote to shareholders earlier this week criticising Walker's
management for rebuffing potential offerors, selling businesses for
questionable prices, having the wrong approach to European distribution and
moving 'upstream' into manufacturing.
It said the proposed independent non-executive directors would 'provide an
effective review of and challenge to management's performance.'
Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive of Walker since February last year,
said the UK recession had affected sales at the core wallcoverings business,
which saw pre-tax profit slip to Pounds 7.41m (Pounds 7.59m). A signs
business that had been taken off the market fell back to Pounds 538,000.
Head office expenses were more than halved at Pounds 352,000.
The sale of loss-making businesses meant that a non-core loss of Pounds
1.21m was replaced by a Pounds 354,000 profit; but the previous year's
Pounds 820,000 profit from disposals was not repeated. Losses and provisions
relating to sold businesses produced an extraordinary charge of Pounds
899,000.
Since the year-end, Walker's cash has been spent on buying Bryant, one of
its suppliers, which will cost up to Pounds 9.3m. Mr Wightman said profit
from that business would be more than double the interest lost.
Earnings per share rose to 5.55p (5.1p). An increased final dividend of 1.9p
makes a total of 3.1p (2.75p).

FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Lep advances 22% to Pounds 29.4m -
Accounting changes have marked impact on profits for the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP GROUP, the distribution, property and security services company,
achieved a 22 per cent increase, from Pounds 24.09m to Pounds 29.4m, in
pre-tax profits for 1990.
Mr John Read, chairman, said that there was scope for further improvement
but it was a creditable performance.
Trading since the year-end had been below expectations, but he remained
'cautiously optimistic' on prospects.
The results were affected by a change in accounting for the discount on a
seven-year bond issued in 1988 by St Paul's Vista, Lep's vehicle which owns
Swiss Bank House in the City of London. This is now being amortised through
the profit and loss account. The effect in 1990 was to depress pre-tax
profits by about Pounds 1.63m and earnings per share by 0.8p.
Against this, a switch in 1990 to average exchange rates had a positive
impact on the pre-tax line amounting to Pounds 1.13m and on earnings to
0.9p.
Operating profits from distribution, which comprises freight forwarding and
automotive activities, moved ahead to Pounds 23.26m (Pounds 13.9m). Mr Read
said some Pounds 4m of that arose from an acquisition in Germany.
He said National Guardian, the US-based electronic security business,
achieved a 14 per cent rise in dollar terms but, owing to the weakening US
currency, sterling operating profits were curbed to Pounds 25.74m (Pounds
24.77m). The company made 31 acquisitions during the year. Property produced
operating profits of Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 10.5m).
Gearing was 188 per cent at the year-end. However, that included some Pounds
79m of non-recourse debt relating to St Paul's Vista, taken onto the balance
sheet after changes introduced in the 1989 Companies Act. Taking that out,
it was about 120 per cent.
Earnings rose to 16.5p (13.7p). The final dividend is lifted to 5p for a 7p
(6p) total.
COMMENT
The Pounds 1.6m bond amortisation charge came as a surprise to Lep followers
yesterday, but even stripping that out these results were seen as just a
touch disappointing. Freight forwarding looks, on the face of it, to have
put in a strong performance but much of the organic growth is really
turnround. That said, Lep would appear to have come through a difficult
period in fairly good shape. This year, factoring in the gains that the
dollar has already made, the assumption that there will be a start to
economic recovery in the US and the UK and distribution activity in the Gulf
will pick up, the company's pre-tax profits should edge a bit higher to
about Pounds 32m. Given the progressive dividend policy, and assuming
investors can live with the gearing, the shares look modestly rated on a
prospective p/e of about 8.5. The trouble is the 27 per cent stake owned by
ADT will confuse the issue until the state of Mr Michael Ashcroft's affairs
becomes clearer.

FT  19 APR 91 / Slough Estates makes Pounds 138m cash call to reduce gearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOUGH Estates, the UK's biggest industrial property company, yesterday
announced a rights issue to raise Pounds 137.7m aimed at repairing the
damage inflicted on its balance sheet by the sharp fall in property values.
The announcement that 141m convertible preference shares would be issued at
100p each sent the shares 9p higher to 253p. The stock market has been
speculating about a rights issue from Slough for some months.
The rights issue would reduce Slough's year-end debt from Pounds 825m to
Pounds 687m, cutting its gearing from 76 per cent to 56 per cent.
Mr Joseph Harding, administrative director, said that although the company
did not envisage any short-term problems with its gearing, it might have
risked breaching bank guarantees if the steep fall in property values
continued. Rather than be forced to raise money from its shareholders, the
company preferred to choose its timing, he said.
In addition, the company said that the rights issue would allow it to take
advantage of the depressed market and acquire properties on attractive
terms. However, nothing was planned at present.
The rights issue follows the announcement last month of a 19 per cent fall
in shareholders' diluted net assets, putting them at just below the value of
end-1988. At the time, chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs said he could not recall a
worse property market.
The company said yesterday: 'The current downturn in the property market,
involving both a virtual standstill in institutional investment and a
significant slowdown in letting activity, has been more severe than
generally expected.'
The convertible preference shares are being issued on a one-for-two basis
which, assuming conversion, is equivalent to about one new share for every
5.4 ordinary shares held. The new shares will have a fixed cumulative
preferential dividend of 8.25p (net) a year.
The rights issue has been underwritten by SG Warburg and the brokers are SG
Warburg Securities.
During the past few years, Slough has increased the development programme in
its Pounds 1.8bn portfolio and included a greater office and retail content.
It has also increased its overseas developments, particularly in North
America and Australia, although 71 per cent of its portfolio is in the UK.

FT  19 APR 91 / Sandoz yields on foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDOZ, the large Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said yesterday
that it would open all its shares to foreign investors. At the same time, it
announced a capital restructuring and a one-for-20 rights issue to raise
SFr400m (Pounds 157.8m).
Mr Victor Bischoff, head of group finance, said proceeds from the
'shareholder-friendly' rights issue would be added to Sandoz's net cash
reserves of SFr1.2bn. The company was looking at several possible
acquisitions.
At present, only Swiss residents can buy Sandoz-registered shares, which
account for 70 per cent of the company's issued capital and 87 per cent of
its voting rights. Foreigners are restricted to 'bearer shares' and
non-voting 'participation certificates'.
From May 16 anyone will be allowed to buy any of the three classes of
equity. But Sandoz will maintain the restriction that no shareholder may own
more than 2 per cent of the capital.
In abolishing the traditional Swiss rule that prevents foreigners owning
registered shares, Sandoz is following the lead set by Nestle in 1988. Some
other industrial companies, including Ciba-Geigy, the big chemical group,
have already done so.
Mr Serge Ledermann, head of Swiss research at Lombard, Odier, the Geneva
bank, welcomed the trend. 'It should help to raise the capitalisation of the
Swiss market,' he said. But he pointed out that the banking and insurance
sectors had not made similar moves.
Sandoz registered shares jumped by SFr675 to SFr11,025 on the Zurich bourse
yesterday, in anticipation of foreign buying. Bearer shares fell by SFr550
to SFr11,350 and participation certificates dropped by SFr140 to SFr2,160.
Under the terms of the capital restructuring, both registered and bearer
shares will be split 5:1. Holders will receive five new shares of the same
type for every single old share.
At the same time, they will have the right to subscribe SFr1,100 to receive
one additional new share for every four old shares.
Participation certificates will not be split, although their nominal value
will be changed to bring them into line with new shares. Holders can
subscribe SFr1,100 to receive one new certificate for every 20 old ones.

FT  19 APR 91 / Italy's Triple-A rating faces downgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY, one of the biggest borrowers in the international capital markets,
has had its top Triple-A debt rating placed under review for a possible
lowering by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency.
Moody's said a downgrading would affect about Dollars 22.2bn (Pounds 12.5bn)
of foreign currency debt.
It said yesterday: 'The large Italian deficits have contributed to raising
the level of public sector debt to a point that is now slightly higher than
gross domestic product . . . and reflects the continuous growth of public
expenditures'.
The servicing of this debt imposed a serious constraint on economic policy
and was leading to a greater use of financing from external sources, the
agency said. The review will take two months.
If Italy is downgraded, any Italian company with a Triple-A rating will also
be downgraded. Moody's has placed the debt ratings of state-controlled
Cariplo, IMI and Crediop under review also.
It added that Italy's failure to deal with the burden of its accumulated
imbalances could impair the government's stated goal of stable integration
in the European Community.
The Triple-A rating is not only a matter of national pride but is
significant to many investors and would increase Italy's cost of raising
funds in foreign markets.

FT  19 APR 91 / Boddington bids Pounds 127.7m for Devenish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON, the pubs, hotels and health-care group, yesterday launched a
Pounds 127.7m hostile takeover bid for JA Devenish, the West Country brewer,
aimed at merging the two businesses into 'a powerful independent force in
drinks retailing'.
If the move were successful, Boddington would add 400 pubs to its 490,
giving it increased buying power and a strong base for further expansion.
Pub retailing contributes more than 80 per cent to the trading profits of
each company.
Devenish, which last week sold its 4 per cent stake in Boddington, rejected
the offer as 'unwelcome and wholly inadequate.'
Boddington is offering 10 new ordinary shares for every seven Devenish
shares, valuing each Devenish share at about 233p. There is a full cash
alternative of 210p per Devenish share as well as a convertible offer.
Boddington said that the offer had been accepted by Mr TJ Hedderson, a
former Devenish director, and his family, for their 3.3 per cent holding.
Devenish shares closed yesterday at 232p, up 12p. Boddington's shares fell
6p, closing at 157p.
Devenish, which reported an almost 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 11.26m last year, has since restructured its management and is
reviewing its brewing business. Its brewery in Redruth, Cornwall, lost
Pounds 200,000 last year.
It has been operating well below capacity because of problems in developing
Devenish's Newquay Steam beer as a national brand.
Mr Denis Cassidy, Boddington's chairman, said that this strategy was now
discredited. Devenish had 'wasted millions of pounds of shareholders' money
on ill-judged investments in brewing and brand development', he said.
Boddington, which sold its breweries and beer brands to Whitbread for Pounds
50m two years ago, would dispose of Devenish's brewery if the bid succeeded.
The benefits of Boddington's exit from brewing were reflected in a 23.6 per
cent rise in profits to Pounds 20m last year, he said. The 1990s would
provide 'excellent opportunities' for specialist pub retailers and the
combination of the Boddington estate, mainly in north-west England, and
Devenish's West Country pubs would yield benefits of scale.
Mr John Clark, deputy chairman of Devenish, said that the bid would be
strongly resisted. The offer reflected neither Devenish's current value nor
its future prospects, he said.

FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Boddington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About the only good thing to be said for Boddington's bid for Devenish is
that it has a certain symmetry to it. Each group wants the other's pubs and
neither wants the businesses attached. Boddington proposes to get rid of the
Devenish brewery, which probably means closing it. Devenish sounds on the
point of making the same decision itself. There may or may not be a case for
merger. There seems little reason for Boddington's shareholders to stump up
a premium for control.
The central difficulty is that one group of pubs is in Manchester and the
other is in the West Country. It is hard to see any savings other than
through the bulk buying of beer, which scarcely seems enough to recover the
premium. The market is meanwhile awash with some 3,500 of the least
desirable pubs in the UK, all being sold by the big brewers to comply with
government orders. From Boddington's viewpoint, Devenish represents nothing
more than a portfolio of more attractive pubs which can be bought with
shareholders' money. Since its opening offer of 210p represents less than
the pubs are worth, there is no incentive for Devenish's shareholders to
accept. If Boddington offers much more, there is no reason for its own
shareholders to accept the deal either.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough always needed a rights issue to relieve its balance sheet - the
question was when and how much. In the event a convertible looks the
sensible way to limit dilution, though the terms had to be generous and the
Pounds 137m proceeds may not suffice for the longer term. The immediate
effect is to cut gearing to a little over 50 per cent, a figure which could
edge back above 60 per cent this year without asset sales. From the market's
point of view the important thing is that the waiting is over. But the
shares will only prosper with signs that the bottom has been reached in the
industrial property cycle.

FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Circle has certainly displayed some nifty financial footwork of late.
The net interest charge on Pounds 260m of net debt was a mere Pounds 1.1m
last year, thanks mainly to round tripping on transatlantic interest rates
and the benefit of a one-off tax rebate. Gearing is comfortable even when
the convertible capital bonds are treated as debt, and with cash flow
running strongly the company can be justly satisfied with its performance at
this stage in the cycle.
The immediate difficulty for investors is getting the timing of the upturn
right. It comes as no surprise to hear that profits will slide further this
year; but bulls of the stock will be disappointed that the board was not
prepared to forecast recovery before mid 1992. UK cement did well to claw
back market share in the second half, but there is still a question mark
over how far the 7 per cent price increase will stick. Hopes for the home
products side must be tempered by the group's strong exposure to the
commercial property market.
In the longer term, much will depend on the calibre of the management. Blue
Circle's recent acquisition record is hardly inspired, even if Birmid
finally looks to have been sorted out. Latest evidence - an excellent five
month result from Ceramica Dolomite and disappointing figures from Aalborg -
is mixed. At least there was no speculative rights issue with yesterday's
results. Investors ought to look carefully at the intended target when a
cash call comes.

FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Trusthouse Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trusthouse Forte has clearly been wondering how to restore its reputation.
Last year's trading performance was somewhat better than expected, even if
earnings were slightly worse. For trading profits from the hotels division
to fall by only 5 per cent was impressive and occupancy rates are recovering
steadily. But this was not enough to reverse the downward drift of its
shares, which in relative terms are where they were five years ago.
The group is shortly to begin a branding exercise on its hotel chains,
suggesting that even after the success of the Crest acquisition, it has
finally recognised its domestic limitations. But while THF might improve its
act at the detailed level, it is too early to say that long-standing
strategic questions have been answered by the Pounds 700m invested over the
last three years. The recent deal with Repsol in Spain will eventually
strengthen THF's continental portfolio, but it is still feeble compared with
that of Queens Moat.
It is small comfort to know the Gulf profits effect was only Pounds 12m in
December and January. The figure could be as much as Pounds 30m for
February-March, so this year will not be one to remember. The group could
conceivably make Pounds 175m before tax, putting the shares at 268p on a
demanding rating of 16. As with so many other stocks, the market is looking
two years out, where the rating is more tolerable assuming a profits bounce
to Pounds 220m. But on the evidence so far, Ladbroke and Queens Moat are
better recovery plays.

FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: The rising cost of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,538.4 (-6.6)
In the usual heartless way of the markets, yesterday's headline figure of 2m
unemployed in the UK might have been received as good news. But the market
is also a political animal. Not only is a perilous figure of 2.5m now on the
cards by the year end; an unnerving 43 per cent of the last month's new
jobless also came in the Tory territories of London and the south-east.
Taken with yesterday's reported sharp drop in industrial output, the figures
are suggesting that the recession is worse than imagined. About the only
bright spot was the 9 1/4 per cent rise in average earnings, the lowest
figure for more than a year. At the same time, the 12.1 per cent rise in
unit labour costs was a sharp reminder of how slow inflationary pressures
are to respond to economic downturn. There can be little doubt that the
mechanism will work eventually; with unemployment rising at an average of
about 100,000 a month and headline inflation plunging, wage inflation ought
to be coming down sharply in the near future. The worry is rather the degree
of pain it takes to achieve the desired effect. It is scarcely a good omen
for the behaviour of the UK economy under the still untested disciplines of
the ERM.

Sir, It was reported in the FT that the EC software directive may be in
jeopardy ('Brussels fears for software directive', April 17). This directive
was described as aiming to extend copyright laws to computer software.
This is not quite accurate. In several member states, including the UK,
software is already protected by national copyright law.
The directive will require all member states to, inter alia, bring in
national legislation to protect computer software by copyright law.
Depending on the final form of the directive, the UK may need to amend the

FT  19 APR 91 / BR approaches the market junction: Divide and sell - British
Rail's operations will be segmented before they go to the private sector /
How might it be done?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatising British Rail was never going to be easy. This week's news that
BR's call on government funds had soared 60 per cent beyond budget to Pounds
1bn in the year to March 1991 served to remind would-be purchasers of BR's
unappealing financial qualities. Reinforcing the message is the threat of
industrial action lurking behind the rail unions' rejection of BR's 6.5 per
cent pay offer.
Yet those who thought the pressure for a sell-off would ease when Mrs
Thatcher resigned were wrong. Mr John Major has made it clear that BR's
privatisation has moved up the political agenda. If the Conservatives win
the next election, the necessary legislation will be sought early in the
next parliament.
Whatever Mr Major's reasons for pressing ahead with BR's sale, he is not in
it for the money. Although the balance-sheet value of BR's assets has been
put at Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn, the main concern of buyers will be the
railways' earnings potential, particularly if strings are attached to asset
disposals: so BR's poor financial performance is likely to produce an
equally poor price.
A better reason is that, for the first time since nationalisation in 1948,
the railway industry has entered an era of growth. Increasing road and air
corridor congestion has brought the need for heavy new investment in rail
infrastructure which public ownership is ill-equipped to meet.
As long as BR is owned by the state, its borrowing counts as public
borrowing and is fixed in the context of competing demands from other
government services. As Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, complained in February,
however badly needed or potentially profitable a rail project may be - if
the money needed to undertake it exceeds Treasury limits, it cannot go
ahead.
A second good reason for privatisation is the widespread feeling that it
would sharpen BR's management and marketing. In spite of attempts to induce
a more customer-oriented attitude at BR, operational expediency still tends
to triumph over customer care, as with the frequent closure of restaurant
and buffet cars long before train journeys end.
Suggesting why BR should be privatised is easier than deciding how. The
ministerial group studying the problem - Mr Roger Freeman from the Transport
Department, Mr John Redwood from Trade and Industry and Mr Francis Maude
from the Treasury - is far from reaching conclusions.
One option which has been ruled out, however, is selling BR off as a single
company. Although attractive for its simplicity, this would substitute a
private monopoly for a public one; and the company would remain beholden to
the state in perpetuity because of the large subsidies it would need for the
operation of the Regional Railways services, many of which will never run at
a profit.
Equally unlikely is the notion of splitting the network into units based on
the existing regions - western, southern, London Midland and the rest. This
would still leave the new companies drawing off state subsidies for their
loss-making services, and would lead to an illogical fragmentation of the
marketing and operation of BR's InterCity, Railfreight and European
passenger services.
A more attractive variant of this idea is the one advanced by the Centre for
Policy Studies. This would carve BR into about 12 companies based on 'route
segments' such as the old London &amp; North Western Railway network running
from London Euston to Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow.
The virtue of this proposal is that it recognises the traffic flows which
formed the rationale for the railways' construction. There would also be
competition between rival routes to some places, such as Scotland.
This solution, however, still does not solve the problem of subsidies; and
although the fragmentation of the network would be along more logical lines
than under the regional plan, it could also discourage the evolution of
national and international services.
One solution which overcomes these objections is the one advocated by the
Adam Smith Institute. This would see BR's track, signalling and stations
hived off to a separate track authority, leaving BR owning just the trains.
BR would then be split and sold off, after which its parts would compete in
the private sector with anyone else who wanted to enter the market as a
train operator.
One of the attractions of this option is the opportunity it would create for
competition. As with airports and airways, stations and tracks would be
available on equal terms to any operator who wished to use them. The
problems associated with fragmentation of the network would be avoided. And
loss-making regional services could be put out to tender on a line-by-line
basis, with 10-year franchises going to the companies which wanted the
smallest subsidy to run them.
However, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, is opposed to this
solution. He believes it would create a big and dangerous monopoly. Track
costs account for roughly 45 per cent of the costs of running a rail
service, he says. How could any company operate sensibly with such a high
proportion of its costs controlled by a monopoly supplier?
The track authority, whether public or privately owned, would have little
incentive to operate efficiently. Any decision to update the infrastructure
would present formidable problems: for example, modern signalling and
automatic train protection systems could not be introduced without parallel
investment in improved trains.
Mr Rifkind prefers a less radical and more workable solution. He believes BR
should be split along the lines of its existing business sectors (InterCity,
Railfreight, Regional Railways, Network SouthEast and Parcels) and
privatised piecemeal.
Two important components of this plan would be, first, that no sector or
company would be permitted to exercise a monopoly over the use of its
tracks; and second, that track costs would have to be identified separately
from running costs under the supervision of a regulatory body, so that all
track users would be free to compete on an equal footing.
Once these pre-conditions had been achieved, the first candidate for
privatisation would be the profitable Railfreight division. Owning little
track of its own, it would be mainly a train operator, running its services
over BR's tracks and paying BR the same track fee as any other
private-sector freight train operators which cared to compete.
Next most likely candidate would be InterCity, which has also made modest
profits recently. This would probably be sold as a complete operation
comprising trains, stations and mainline tracks, though it could be
sub-divided into route segments. Its own trains would continue to dominate
the network, but other would-be express train operators would be free to
enter the market on equal terms, paying InterCity a fee for use of its
tracks.
If and when Network SouthEast became profitable (the target for ending
subsidies is 1992-93, although that looks like slipping) it could be
privatised as a single entity or split into northern, southern, and eastern
sectors. Alternatively, it could be divided further into independent lines
such as the London Tilbury &amp; Southend and the London Brighton &amp; South Coast
railways.
Mr Rifkind does not envisage much competition between different operators'
trains on Network SouthEast. Constraints on track capacity would not allow
it. But dividing the network into sub-groups would allow the performance of
different operators to be compared.
Finally the loss-making regional lines, as under the track authority option,
would be put out to tender on a line-by-line basis, with the companies
requiring the lowest subsidies getting the franchises to operate the tracks
and trains.
The weakness of the Rifkind scenario, as with some of the others, lies in
its fragmentation of the track network. International freight distributors
in the north, faced with the task of negotiating track paths with a regional
railway operator, InterCity, a Network SouthEast operator and Eurotunnel
before even reaching the Continent, might well conclude that road transport
offered an easier solution.
But possibly the bigger hurdle is the political one. Mr Rifkind might have
ruled out the track authority option, but many on the Conservative right are
wedded to it. The final arbiter will be Cabinet: meanwhile the lobbying can
only grow more fierce as the options begin to crystallise.

FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: The price of placing another tax on property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BML COULSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am surprised that such a level-headed newspaper as yours should be
advocating introducing capital gains tax on owner-occupied housing (Leader,
April 16).
Apart from the political unpopularity of such a tax there are other
complications.
Such a tax would be index-linked. It would also have to recognise the total
cost of the property. The price paid to a seller for a property is mostly
not the total ultimate cost of the property to the buyer; it would be
inequitable if the often enormous cost of financing the purchase was not
included. If it was omitted you would be taxing an illusory gain.
At the same time there would have to be allowance made for maintaining the
property's fabric, an escalating cost in the case of old houses.
Since the price of a house may often be affected by the quality of the
decoration and permanent fixtures, any improvements on that side would have
to be allowed also. After all this it is doubtful that much gain would be
left to tax.
But you give the game away when you say that there would have to be
roll-over relief. Of course, without such relief people would stop moving
house which could lead to the owner-occupied market becoming as sticky as
the rented market has become.
On the other hand, roll-over relief would complicate the decision on moving
to a smaller property. Well-off movers would tend to go for smaller houses
at the top end pushing prices there up in order to use up their relief.
Those less well-off seeking, perhaps in their declining years, to release
some equity to fund their retirement by trading down would be penalised by
having to pay CGT and would seek to maximise their sale price in
compensation.
I would suggest that the introduction of CGT on housing, if it was equitably
structured, would raise little, cost a great deal to collect and be
irrelevant.
If the structure was inequitable it might raise a lot of revenue, but it
would be more unpopular than the poll tax and lead to serious distortions in
the housing market, with absolutely no guarantee that it would have any
effect on house price inflation. In short, a poor idea.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PB LIVESEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the proposed software directive refers to the struggle
between computer groups, large and small (April 17). There has been total
disregard of the opinions of most interested parties, namely computer users
in business, education and government (both local and central). If the
directive is approved, it will increase costs and restrict the flexibility
of most computer users in the UK and Europe.
The MEPs who condemn the lobbying should ask why it is taking place. Users,
such as ourselves, who have substantial investment in technology were not
consulted by the DTI or the Commission before the 'compromise was thrashed
out' in December. If we had been consulted, we would have made it clear that
it is unworkable and in conflict with the competition objectives of the
Commission. It is essential that either the amendments are adopted or the
Council of Ministers does not approve the unamended version.

Sir, Mr Russell's point about the UK insurance industry's approach to the EC
and 1992 (April 12) is well taken. I have returned to the UK after working
in Belgium for 15 years. Although I have a maximum no claims bonus I was
hard-pressed to find a UK insurer to allow me to maintain it.
Town and Country building society made me feel like a criminal when I asked
to open an account because I did not have 'residence in the UK for the last
three years'. Natwest Bank, where I regularly cash my Eurocheques, cannot
decide whether I have to go to the main counter or to the 'foreign till'.
The cheques are, of course, drawn in sterling]

FT  19 APR 91 / Opportunity Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a rich treasure of jobs for the girls and boys in Labour's new
policy statement. Perhaps that is why it is called Opportunity Britain. New
organisations abound. Here are just a few: Skills UK, for training; a
network of Technology Trusts, for you know what; a National Investment Bank,
for heaven knows what; new English regional development agencies, to make up
for the Scots having one; a Quality Commission for the health service; a
sensible new Education Standards Council . . . and I have only just begun.
It is, however, premature to start putting your name down. First we must ask
two questions. Will they be in a position to do any of it? If so, when?
Not this year, unless Mr John Major is silly enough to call an election
without first being sure that he can win. No one is calling Mr Major silly
this week, after his quiet persistence on havens for the Kurds has paid off
so well. So talk of a June or October contest only makes sense if you assume
that the opinion polls will be running strongly in the government's favour
at the time. If so, the election will be called this year - but by
definition Labour will not then be so favourably placed as it thinks it is
today.
Well then, perhaps next year, because the government cannot hang on beyond
June 1992. I have no more idea than you do of how the polls and portents
will look 12 months from now, but it seems probable that inflation and
interest rates will be down, the community charge will be de-fanged, and the
climb out of the recession will be under way. Against that the government is
likely to face a mounting budget deficit  - Pounds 15bn is a figure that has
floated around the Treasury - and a consequent need to borrow that will make
tax cuts difficult to justify. Meanwhile unemployment is likely to have
risen to the 3m mark or thereabouts, which cannot help the Tories.
It is this uncertainty that keeps Labour buoyant. Perhaps they can win
handsomely, they tell themselves; if not that then perhaps just a tiny
majority? On current trends it is easier to see the Tories losing their
overall majority - that is, looking for a deal, or allowing Labour to make a
deal, in a hung parliament. The difference is important. Anything short of a
victory with a convincing majority would mean that Mr Neil Kinnock would at
best have to cling to power by his fingertips for a year or so in the hope
of winning properly after that.
Right. Now we can go back to Labour's blueprint. How much could be put into
practice in the circumstance most realistically imaginable - a House of
Commons in which every vote would be a cliff-hanger? Not much - and a great
deal. Matters that require big new set-piece bills, like a Scottish
assembly, or nudging opted-out schools back into local authority control, or
changing competition policy, would struggle for parliamentary time. Getting
them through would be difficult. But ministerial fief, such as adjusting the
national curriculum, would be far easier.
This is where the Conservatives may come to regret some of their own
legislative and administrative habits. So much of the Thatcherite legacy is
in the form of enabling acts - laws enabling ministers to do much as they
please, often through delegated legislation - that Labour could travel a
long way using the Thatcher legal inheritance. This applies to most areas of
government, including the health service reorganisation, some of the
arrangements for industry regulatory bodies and even the proposals to
establish a partnership in industry.
Every shadow minister is working on ways to implement the huge programme
announced on Tuesday without troubling the House of Commons over-much; some
are being assisted by the permanent secretaries of what they hope will be
their future departments. It is not Mr Major's style to stop this. Under his
gentlemanly regime ministers are reverting to the practice of checking new
appointments to official boards and committees with their Labour
counterparts. Some of the latter hopefully read this as a sign that the
Tories are reconciled to opposition. Others, perhaps with their feet closer
to the ground, plan for every contingency.
For example, the shadow minister responsible for water, Mrs Anne Taylor, is
in intermittent discussion with the industry itself. They tend to return her
calls fastest when the Labour lead in the opinion polls is highest. A
northern woman blessed with common sense and an effective relationship with
Mr Kinnock, Mrs Taylor is evidently set fair for further promotion. She is
clear about what she could do without needing a parliamentary bill. The
water industry regulator would receive fresh instructions on costs passed
through, 'excess pricing', and the like. She points to the very sub-clauses
in the Water Act that would enable her to issue such orders to Mr Ian Byatt,
the director-general of the Office of Water Services.
All of the above is some compensation for probably not being able to buy
back the water companies since that would require a strong Labour majority,
the establishment of regional authorities, and a willingness to divert
perhaps Pounds 30bn to buy water shares and invest in new plant. Even just
purchasing control for, say, a third of that would be an absurd priority for
Labour, although Mrs Taylor argues that regional pension funds might do the
job.
There is plenty that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow industry secretary, could
do at the stroke of a ministerial pen. The national investment bank could be
established by the Bank of England under existing rules. The technology
trusts could be set up as informal organisations. How would they be paid
for? The Tories have provided a convenient method. There is a technology
budget in the Department of Industry, and the preferred practice is to let
out contracts to non-governmental bodies. I am sure that Mr Brown would be
delighted to pick up and use this Conservative device for Labour purposes.
It is a piquant prospect, probably the most that he can aspire to short of a
political miracle.

Sir, It was amazing to see David Butler using words such as 'distort' and
'aberrations' to describe local government election results that deviated
from a uniform national swing (April 11). These elections are not national
opinion polls; nor are they designed to select MPs. They are to elect local
councillors.
People do not always vote the same way in local elections as they do in a
general election; at least a fifth vary their vote. Local issues, such as
the poll tax and standards of service, can produce very different swings in
different areas.
These variations are not aberrations or distortions. A uniform national
swing in such elections would be an aberration.

the efflux from cooling towers looks like Black Country smoke and reinforces

FT  19 APR 91 / Pragmatic outsider on the inside track: The UK Treasury's
new boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr John Major were looking for someone to symbolise his ideal of a
classless Britain, he would need to go no further than Sir Terence Burns,
his new permanent secretary to the Treasury.
Sir Terence is nothing like central casting's ideal of a top Whitehall
mandarin. Instead he is a courteous, down to earth northerner, who retains
more than a trace of a Geordie accent despite working in London for more
than 25 years. But to typecast him simply as a northern lad made good would
be to ignore the powerful influence that he has had over economic policy
making in Britain since first becoming chief economic adviser to the
Treasury in 1980. It would also belittle the Treasury's special place in
Whitehall as a department where merit makes it to the top.
Sir Peter Middleton, the outgoing permanent secretary, was himself an
example of the Treasury's meritocratic culture, having started out in life,
like Sir Terence, as a northern grammar school boy. But whereas Sir Peter
has always appeared the archetypal eminence grise, Sir Terence has eschewed
patrician ways.
Only 47 years old, he appears a man without 'side,' as they say in the
north. He seems happiest when talking about golf, the performance of Queens
Park Rangers football club, which he supports, or music.
It is a genuine performance but is often used to deflect questioners from
finding out too much about his views on economic policy. For Sir Terence is
discreet. As yesterday's news shows, he is also ambitious. And he has shown
a remarkable capacity to escape blame for the economic policy mistakes of
the past 10 years.
His arrival at the Treasury 11 years ago caused genuine surprise. As an
economist of strong monetarist leanings, he was recruited in 1980 by the
then recently-elected conservative government from the London Business
School, where he had risen to be both a professor and director of its Centre
for Economic Forecasting.
He quickly made his mark in Great George Street by helping to devise the
medium term financial strategy, which marked the end of attempts to fine
tune the economy through fiscal changes. The subsequent evolution of the
strategy from one based on monetary targeting, through various permutations
of monetarism to one based on sterling's membership of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System is evidence of a pragmatic
approach.
He has always laid stress on the importance of controlling inflation. This
raises one awkward question: what was he doing in between 1986 and 1988 when
the seeds of the late inflationary upsurge in the UK economy were being
sown?
It was quite easy for outsiders to sense that Sir Peter Middleton was deeply
unhappy with the course of events. Sir Terence was more cryptic.
If he felt discomfort in the latter years of Mr Nigel Lawson's
chancellorship, he hardly showed it. Indeed, in May 1989, after having been
the government's chief economic adviser for nearly 10 years on short term
contracts, he finally became a professional civil servant.
Mr Lawson's resignation and Mr Major's appointment as chancellor in October
1989 gave his career a new lease of life. He quickly became an admirer of
the new chancellor, and was heard shortly after Mr Lawson's departure to say
that he thought Mr Major 'had real star qualities'.
Sir Terence also appeared to revel in the greater freedom that he enjoyed
under a minister with less experience and economic expertise.
By the time Mr Major became prime minister, it was clear that Sir Terence
was one of his close advisers. 'He listens a lot to Terry,' one of Mr
Major's advisers said at the time.
At first sight next month's jump from chief economic adviser to permanent
secretary looks a big one. He will be in charge of 3,000 people and be the
chancellor's senior adviser on macro-economic policy.
But as the government's chief economic adviser, Sir Terence has been no
ivory tower economist. He has been head of the government economic services
since 1980 and sits on all management committees in the Treasury. His role
in policy making and departmental management has been of increasing
importance, almost as if he had been preparing himself for the top Treasury
job.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE should be no satis-faction that the Japanese-Soviet summit ended in
its mostly predictable stalemate. That the full normalisation of relations
should still be hung up on a niggling 45-year-old territorial dispute is a
sad commentary on the lack of political will and strength displayed by the
two governments.
To describe the summit, the first between the two countries in Tokyo since
the war, as a complete failure is perhaps a little extreme. There was more
intense negotiation about the Kurile islands than ever before. Presumably
any remaining mutual illusions about respective positions have been swept
away. The Soviet Union did say it was willing to start withdrawing some
troops from them. And at least Moscow has acknowledged publicly that the
territorial dispute exists, which the Japanese claimed had not been the case
since 1956, and then only partially.
But there was no settlement, hence no peace treaty, and hence no flood of
Japanese aid and technical assistance to the distressed Soviet economy. For
this last reason alone, the Soviet Union is the larger immediate loser,
since it never approached the summit with what might have been a
conventional Cold War aim of prising Japan loose from its US alliance. The
fact that President Mikhail Gorbachev will not be going home with his
pockets stuffed with yen will not make his domestic political burdens any
lighter, though signing away the Kuriles might not have helped either.
Collective failure
The failure to go all the way should not be ascribed to the two men alone.
Neither Mr Gorbachev nor Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the prime minister of Japan, is a
master in his own house. The Soviet leader is hemmed in by Mr Boris Yeltsin,
in whose Russian federation the disputed islands are situated, and by a
Soviet military as yet unpersuaded by the virtues of arms control and
strategic redeployments in Asia.
Mr Kaifu's problem stems not only from his own political weakness inside the
ruling Liberal Democratic party. He leads the government of a country
disinclined to become more friendly towards, or even to invest more heavily
in, the Soviet Union. Japanese companies, for the most part, have made it
clear that they consider the Soviet economy to be a black hole down which it
would be imprudent to pour investment. Their voices count with their
government.
Uncertain policy
In fact it is perfectly possible to argue that Japan does not know exactly
what it does want in terms of foreign policy these days, other than to
adhere closely to the alliance with the US. This explains the dusty
reception given to Mr Gorbachev's most creative proposal, the convening of
an Asian security conference comprising Japan, the Soviet Union, the US,
China and India.
This was construed by the Japanese as an attempt principally to undermine
the US military presence in the region and hence Japanese national security.
There are elements in the Japanese Foreign Ministry and elsewhere who
correctly believe the time is near to explore regional security issues in a
way which does not necessarily involve the re-emergence of an independent
and offensive Japanese military capability. However, their case is weakened
by the patent political uncertainty surrounding the future direction of the
Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent China.
Nevertheless, in the longer run, Asian security cannot remain on the back
burner. The conventional view is that the Soviet Union would need to settle
European and superpower arms relations first before turning to Asia, but
that assumes a largely military definition of the term 'security'.
As an economic power, Japan should know better than most that security
should not be so narrowly defined. Indeed, the US probably would like Japan
to assume greater policy and regional burdens that play to its economic
strengths without sacrificing its military relationship with the US. The
Tokyo summit provided an opportunity to start this ball rolling and it is to
be regretted that it was not grasped.

FT  19 APR 91 / Into the deep end in the City: The latest change in
Barclays' top echelon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The game of musical chairs that has kept the directors of Barclays Bank busy
in recent weeks has taken its most significant turn with the arrival of Sir
Peter Middleton.
The man from the Treasury is to be thrown headlong into running the group's
nascent markets and investment banking division, being formed out of
Barclays' own treasury operations and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment
subsidiary created at the time of Big Bang in 1986.
Investment banking has been a graveyard for many illustrious careers in
London in recent years - a point reiterated yesterday with the departure of
Mr Howard Macdonald as chairman and chief executive of NatWest Investment
Bank.
Sir Martin Jacomb, 61, who will make way for Sir Peter at the start of
November, has largely managed to avoid the graveyard. By common consent,
BZW, whose creation he masterminded, has been one of the more successful
integrated investment banks in London.
That judgment is relative, though. It scarcely makes it an unqualified
success. BZW made only Pounds 5m profit last year, after disastrous losses
in its equity division. By any normal test of performance, its first four
years seem a very expensive mistake for Barclays. Rather than a success, the
best that can be said for it is that BZW has not been as big a failure as
others.
A year ago it was Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, who was being tipped
as the next boss of BZW. Mr Lawson joined the bank as a consultant, working
two days a week, at about the same time that Sir Martin Jacomb's initial
five-year contract with BZW expired.
As it was, Sir Martin agreed a further contract with no end date specified.
Colleagues now say that he was persuaded to stay to oversee the creation of
Barclays' new markets and investment banking division, and that his
departure should come as no surprise. Mr Lawson himself gave up his BZW
consultancy work a month ago, citing the need to spend more time writing his
memoirs.
In the increasingly crowded boardroom at Barclays, meanwhile, Sir Peter will
sit alongside Sir Martin and Mr Lawson, both of whom will remain directors
of the parent. He will become the third deputy chairman on the board -
alongside Sir Martin and Mr Andrew Buxton. Mr Buxton was made a deputy
chairman only two days ago.
These changes come at a time when Barclays is still trying to fill the gap
on its board left by Mr Brian Pearse, its finance director, who departed to
become chief executive at rival Midland Bank in a surprise move last month.
Mr Pearse's shoes are being filled temporarily by Mr Humphrey Norrington,
who was himself elevated to the position of vice-chairman this week. A
full-time replacement is expected.
Sir Peter's arrival has already prompted suggestions that, in the longer
term, he is seen as a successor to the bank's chairman, Sir John Quinton,
who is 61.
But Barclays is keen to stop the game of musical chairs at this point. 'The
issue of succession does not arise,' the bank said. 'Sir John will continue
for several years yet.'

International airports are designated by a three-figure code which you can
always spot on baggage tags. The code for Heathrow, for example, is LHR,
Hong Kong HKG, and Singapore is SIN, although Bangkok would probably be more
appropriate.
Ironically, the code for Diyarbakir airport in southern Turkey near the
Iraqi border, where flights carrying food and clothes for Kurdish refugees
have been landing, is DIY.
Last Friday, a British Airways Boeing 757 with volunteers and 21 tonnes of
supplies for the refugees landed at Diyarbakir. There was confusion at the
airport where several other aircraft were already sitting on the tarmac
waiting to be unloaded. The BA crew indulged in a little DIY by unloading
the aircraft themselves.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that Helmut Kohl is tired of office has been rife in Bonn since
the chancellor last week unexpectedly confirmed that he regards interior
minister Wolfgang Schauble as his heir apparent.
Schauble, confined to a wheelchair after an attack by a deranged gunman in
October, has made a plucky job of coming to terms with his disability. Still
more important, he is probably the most intelligent man in the cabinet.
Bonn insiders have long known that Kohl had selected Schauble as a possible
successor, and the chancellor's support for Schauble seems even to have
strengthened after the attempt on his life. One Kohl adviser said a few
months ago that had it not been for the shooting, Schauble would have been a
contender to take over perhaps in only two years' time. As it is the most
likely moment for the succession was in the next legislature period starting
in 1995, he said.
What has surprised observers is that Kohl has chosen the present period of
political turbulence - caused by the economic crisis in eastern Germany - to
make his deliberations public. Kohl's ruminations, delivered on the eve of
regional elections in his home state of Rhineland-Palatinate, may have been
partly tactical - to show the party and the nation that he knows he is not
indispensable. Even though Kohl is certainly not enjoying his job as much as
he did last year, things will have to get much worse before he thinks
seriously of giving up.

The luckless Sir Derek may be the target of a personal vendetta, but Royal
is one of those big and poorly managed financial institutions which packs
its board with heavy-weight figures. Sir John Cuckney, Royal's
well-connected chairman, could have used yesterday's annual general meeting
to justify the various reappointments to his board. The fact that he didn't

The curriculum vitae of South Africa's new ambassador in London, Kent Durr,
portrays an envoy of some distinction.
He has not only been minister of trade, industry and tourism, an
underwriting member of Lloyd's, and managing director of a successful
property company. He was among the top 12 students when he qualified for the
Chartered Institute of Estate Agents. What's more, he holds an 'illuminated
scroll and citation' from the South African institute of same to mark his
contribution to the property industry.
Such attainments, the CV adds, have earned him a place in Who's Who in the
World and Men of Achievement, 1980-89. His recreations include
mountaineering, yachting, gardening, and reading (particularly history)  -
'wide and diverse interests held together by his enormous energy.'
A further distinction somehow omitted from the list is that 49-year-old Durr
was one of only two English speakers in his country's otherwise Afrikaans
cabinet. But that, I'm assured, does not mean Pretoria has downgraded the
London embassy.

<TEXT>
The reshuffles at the top of the investment banking arms of Barclays and
National Westminster Bank may look exciting, but they are just another round
in an expensive game of musical chairs. It is far from clear why a couple of
ex-Treasury mandarins should be any better than anyone else at investment
banking.
Strip away the public relations and here are a couple of businesses which
have not been doing at all well. Because of the problems over the Blue Arrow
affair, NatWest Investment Bank has looked most vulnerable. But Barclays'
BZW has not done all that much better. It has been obvious for some time
that it was going to have to look outside for a successor to Sir Martin
Jacomb, if Barclays insisted on trying to keep up with the big boys.
The suddenness of the departure of NatWest's Howard Macdonald is more
surprising. He was always regarded as a stopgap but no one expected him to
go this quickly. Given his undoubted credentials as an oil man, he should at
least have been allowed to retain a seat on the main NatWest board. The
argument that there were no vacancies, because NatWest's new chairman Lord
Alexander wants to reduce the size of his board, does not sound convincing.
Coming after last month's abrupt departure of the chairman of the
loss-making NatWest Bancorp, it seems to indicate a more ruthless streak at
the top of Britain's most comfortable clearing bank. This is not before
time. But there is still plenty of deadwood left near the top of the core
clearing bank, my Lord.
As for the idea of bringing ex-civil servants into the top management
positions, the case to date is far from encouraging. Midland Bank is the
prime example of a bank that has tried this route and failed. It says
something about the paucity of good management in the clearing banks, and
their traditional deference to Treasury civil servants, that the experiment
is being tried yet again.

FT  19 APR 91 / Arts: Otello - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER

<TEXT>
It is 27 years since Solti last conducted at the Met. On Tuesday, in
Carnegie Hall, he conducted a concert Otello, with the Chicago Symphony,
that was electrifying. At Covent Garden, of course, he used also be
electrifying in this opera - but in Carnegie he had a greater orchestra, and
the extraordinary power and intensity with which he invested the score was
even more exciting.
Sure, some disapproving voices were heard in the intervals: 'hard', 'noisy',
'driven'. They are words, I confess, that I have on occasion used about
Solti performances, but they were not apt to this one. There was hardness,
there was drive, and sometimes the music was very loud indeed - but always
where it was appropriate, never at the expense of the singers, and never in
any show-off way. I've never heard Solti's famous excitability so completely
harnessed to a disciplined, long-lined, marvellously vivid, engrossing
account of the whole score.
For example, that strange, discordant blast of trilling woodwinds that
accompanies the first clause of Iago's Creed was terrifying: as if for the
first time one realised what Verdi meant by it; yet the Iago, Leo Nucci,
remained clearly audible. A list of string passages superbly, intently,
powerfully played would be long. There was also much tenderness and beauty.
The concert doubled as a Decca recording session. The soloists were raised
on a bridge behind the orchestra, and behind them was the large and
magnificent Chicago Symphony Chorus, prepared for this performance by Terry
Edwards. Pavarotti was singing the title role for the first time. (He had
not been well, and there was a great deal of carry-on with potations and
pills and a yard of white silk; the Desdemona, Kiri Te Kanawa, must have
been tempted to swat him as he and his outsize hanky scene-stole during her
Willow Song.) But when he rose to sing, he sang well. 'Esultate' was clear,
ringing, heroic. In the love duet, his reluctance to be intimate, confiding,
anything but stentorian, was a drawback. In Act 2 it was the ringing phrases
that made most effect. But in the third-act duet he began to engage with the
soprano and more fully with the role, and then 'Dio mi potevi scagliar' was
moving.
In Act 4 he was tremendous. He sang softly, tenderly, as well as loudly.
Most of my Otellos have been burly-voiced, thick-toned, sometimes raw and
sometimes heavily covered in their forceful outbursts. Pavarotti represents
a return to the lyrical tenor of exceptional, apparently limitless, power,
with free, forward emission and words out on the lips. Onstage, he might be
grotesque; in this concert, I admired him more than I have for years.
Dame Kiri, too. I never thought to write that her utterance of words would
be in itself a keen, piercing pleasure. But so it was in the Willow Song and
the Ave Maria. Each consonant and vowel was beautiful. She made her New York
debut as Desdemona 17 years ago. In Act 1, I thought that over the years her
tone had hardened somewhat, and that her lovely middle voice had paled
somewhat. But she got better and better. The dramatic fire that we admired
in her student days, at the London Opera Centre, and the vocal radiance
through the full range returned. The Willow Song and Ave Maria provided one
of those adventures that listeners remember all their lives: a house rapt,
silent and spellbound; the soprano, the conductor, the cor anglais, the
flutes mutually inspired and inspiring; the whole a revelation of why music
matters.
Nucci may be vocally hit-or-miss now, but he is not a dull interpreter; he
always brings the text to life, and his Iago, despite some dubious
intonation, was lively and trenchant. Elzbieta Ardam seemed a nice steady
Emilia until in Act 4 she began to shout. Anthony Rolfe-Johnson made his New
York mark as a sharp-cut Cassio, but made it by singing sometimes louder
than necessary.
I nearly skipped this Otello: in another hall, another Hungarian artist,
Adrienne Csengery, was making her New York debut, in Kurtag. I'm glad I went
to the Otello. It's a performance I'll not forget. Solti conducts it again
tonight in Carnegie - his last performance as musical director of the
Chicago Symphony, and a glorious crown to his 22 years in the post.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If there is a more hideous, confusing and hazardous spot in Europe than
Hammersmith Broadway and its tube station, I hope never to have to negotiate
it to see a dance programme. Prospective visitors to Riverside, where
Rambert Dance Company has opted to give its London seasons - the troupe in
quest of more movement space than Sadler's Wells can offer - are hereby
warned. It would be good to report that, whatever the hurdles, the trip is
worth while, but Tuesday's opening, though eminently well-intentioned, was
not calculated to set the pulse racing.
The choice of Riverside - a small auditorium, not blessed with the best
sightlines - gives Rambert more room to move and far less audience seating
than at the Wells, which makes for a doubtful equation. It also alters the
perspective of the dance. At the start of the evening Merce Cunningham's
Doubles sat less than easily on the Rambert dancers in this exposed location
(they appeared slightly self-conscious) and the audience's view of
Cunningham's spatial relationships was foreshortened when seen (as here)
from above. Doubles looked honest but not especially polished. As a fashion
note let me observe that the three girls in the cast had neat hair, which
helps stress the purity of physical line so significant with Cunningham,
while the three men boasted what appeared to be badly knitted dreadlocks -
no help to the dance's precisions.
The company has now acquired Siobhan Davies' Plainsong, which was first made
for Davies' own group a decade ago. It is visually elegant - unisex shirts
and trousers for the cast, in shades of grey - and stresses a frieze-like
progression of dance ideas, passed through a line of dancers, or shared and
dispersed among the performers. A grave problem with the piece is its score
 -an interminable sequence of dull Satie piano works (and are there any
duller?) which sound like doors holding a conversation. It is very worthy as
dance, subtle in its shifts of emphasis, and somehow monochrome.
Richard Alston's Roughcut uses two Steve Reich scores (for guitar and
clarinet) whose patternings are the basis for an 'end of the evening' piece
which, in the context of the Rambert repertory, is positively vivacious.
There are jazzy elements - admirably caught thing not unlike a blues duet
for Amanda Britton and Mark Baldwin. The cast are kept on the qui vive by
vigorous movement, and are made to look fatuous by Tim Hatley's costumes -
the girls in white, bare-midriff outfits that give them a matronly air; the
men in trousers, cut with malign skill to make them seem portly, with braces
over bare torsos. Dancers strive for physical grace and power; their
costumiers should honour this fact.

For Tuesday's LPO concert Christoph von Dohnanyi chose a piquant programme:
Webern's temperate little Symphony op. 21 before Beethoven's first and
least-favoured piano concerto, the so-called 'Second', and then Schoenberg's
Five Orchestral Pieces, op. 16, as prelude to the Fourth Symphony of
Schumann. But for the Webern, it worked surprisingly well.
In Beethoven's B-flat Concerto, Emanuel Ax outdid himself. Operating in
something like the Schiff/Uchida mode - pearly and unforced, but digitally
super-articulate - he found chiaroscuro delights in even the most
surface-routine passages. None of that sounded imposed on the music; as
interpretation it was knowingly pawky but never arch, and always elegant. I
do not remember hearing the delicate humours of the piece so wittily spelt
out. Ax maintained the illusion of keeping the pianistic scale within period
limits, but after a notably subtle, tender Adagio he attacked the Rondo with
tingling brio.
Dohnanyi's orchestral accompaniment - for with such an engaging soloist,
that was what it became - was a model of alert tact and sweet reason. In the
Schoenberg pieces after the interval he gave full value to their far more
lurid palette, but also the most judicious attention to their harmonic
sense: strong confirmation of Schoenberg's claim, cited by Eric Mason in his
programme-notes, that there was 'a remorseless, if unconscious, logic in the
harmonic construction'.
Among the Five Pieces Dohnanyi realised 'Vergangenes', the second, with
lovely cogency, dovetailing its soft overlap of voices with a sure hand. He
did as much for the final 'Obbligato Recitative' too, revealing much more
intricate musical argument than we usually hear. The orchestral balance was
scrupulously gauged.
The Schoenberg tuned our ears very well for Dohnanyi's close-focus
examination of Schumann's 'Fourth'. Though it wasn't a particularly tender
reading - some other conductors make it sing more affectingly - it had
sterling dramatic proportions, and sovereign clarity. His main executive
feat was to render the freehand 'development' of the first movement entirely
compelling, not just a profusion of amiable ideas; but the darkling hues of
the Romanze were remarkable too, and the brusque cut-and-thrust of the
Scherzo, much steelier than mere bucolic fun.
For such a sharp-eared reading Schumann's leaner original orchestration,
without his second-guess doublings, would have been a further asset. It
pre-dated his 'Second' and 'Third' symphonies; this one counts as his
'Fourth' only because the revised version was made after them. There is
surely a musical case - as against musicological fussing about
'authenticity' - for retaining the tauter structure of the later version,
but trimming its adipose instrumental tissue back to the clean lines
Schumann first imagined.

The time has come for the inauguration of a new leader in the country's
official religion. Anthropologists long ago established that this is a
pretty odd society, so it is not surprising that the new man will be wearing
a long frock and a tall hat and carrying a decorated stick. But controversy
has arisen among his followers: should the ceremony be a solemn one
conducted in archaic jargon, or a more merry affair with modern songs and
clapping? The Enthronement Of The Archbishop Of Canterbury can be seen live
at 2.20 and in a recorded shortened form at 10.20 (BBC1).
If the foregoing seems offensive perhaps you should watch Derek Jarman's
extraordinary 1978 film Jubilee which Channel 4 is repeating in its 'Banned'
season (midnight). A black view of England's decline, shot at the time of
punk rock and in much the same spirit, it occasionally seems to have no
other purpose than to offend. It is certainly different. In Arena (9.30
BBC2) performance artist Laurie Anderson examines mankind's obsession with
the human face.

FT  19 APR 91 / Management: The hapless and the paradox - The unhappy lot of
non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: a large army of experienced, independent-minded, part-time
businesspeople to infiltrate boardrooms across the UK. Ability to restrain
unbridled chief executives an advantage.
This, or something close to it, was the message yesterday from the UK's
institutional investors, which between them own two thirds of all UK listed
shares. Acting through their recently-reconstituted umbrella body, the
Institutional Shareholders' Committee, the institutions were adding their
voices - the most important yet - to the debate on corporate governance.
This has developed as a curious side issue to the debate on relations
between companies and their shareholders. Its origins can be traced to two
causes: the seemingly endless arguments about short-termism (whether or not
the providers of capital are unwilling to take a sufficiently long-term view
of their investments); and a lingering feeling that some of the excesses of
recent years should not be repeated.
What makes the debate on corporate governance odd is that the institutions
appear to want it both ways. They want to regularise the way some companies
are run, particularly by reining in some of the more powerful chairmen/chief
executives. But in the process they do not want to lose any of the
shareholder gains that can be generated by strong, entrepreneurial
leadership.
There is a noticeable sound of barn-door slamming in all of this. Periods of
corporate or financial excess are generally followed by reregulation. Come
the next boom period, these lessons are quickly forgotten. If the
institutions can't have it both ways, then it is a fair bet that, come the
next bull market, they will forget many of the lessons they are now
preaching in the scramble not to be left out.
In the meantime, it is to non-executive directors that the institutions have
turned. These hapless people are expected to labour under the institutions'
own unresolved paradox; they must at once bear equal responsibility with
other directors for a company's performance, but they must also act as an
internal check on the power of executive directors.
The ISC's paper, The role and duties of directors: a statement of best
practice, contains ample evidence of this paradox. Non-executives, it says,
should be independent. This is defined as 'free from bias, involvement or
partiality'.
Yet the paper also comes down firmly on the side of unitary boards, rather
than the two-tier structures seen in countries like Germany. It says: 'All
directors have an equal responsibility in helping to provide their company
with effective guidance and leadership and it is recognised that they must,
and in almost all cases do, act at all times entirely in the best interests
of the company.'
Is it really possible for a non-executive to bear all the responsibility
that this suggests and yet remain 'free from bias, involvement or
partiality'?
Leading members of the ISC admitted yesterday that this was expecting a lot.
'An increasing amount is being expected of non-executive directors,' said
Michael Sandland, chairman of the ISC and chief investment manager of
Norwich Union.
He said that the pool of available talent was probably not big enough to
provide suitable high quality directors for all UK companies, and suggested
two ways of easing this shortage: companies should make more of their senior
executives available to act as non-executives elsewhere, and companies
should pay non-executives more for their efforts. 'The traditional Pounds
5,000, Pounds 10,000 or Pounds 15,000 is not enough, given what is expected
these days,' Sandland said.
Who, though, will decide how much to pay the non-executives? This is yet
another paradox at the heart of the ISC position. Non-executives, who are
expected by the ISC to set the pay levels of executive directors, will
themselves be paid by the executives. Any guesses on the effect that has on
the level of executive pay?

FT  19 APR 91 / Management: A cautious repair strategy for the mistakes of
the past - A series on the challenges facing UK banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We may be a bank. But we are also a business.'
This statement by Lord Alexander, the new chairman of National Westminster
Bank, is revealing about attitudes in the UK's second largest clearing bank.
The first few words contain a hint of the conservatism - some would say
complacency - that people traditionally associate with bankers: a suggestion
that banks should somehow be judged by special standards. But the second
phrase conveys the new sense of realism that has been forced on NatWest
after three traumatic years.
Until the latter part of the 1980s, NatWest was widely described as the UK's
top clearing bank; it was the largest in asset terms, and its record of
profit growth and expansion, domestically and overseas, was impressively
consistent. Its top executives - all of them clearing bankers to the core -
displayed a cohesiveness and sense of purpose that were envied by its
rivals.
All this culminated in the golden year of 1988 when the bank made record
profits of Pounds 1.4bn before tax. But then things started going badly
wrong. The following year profits plunged to Pounds 404m, and last year
showed only a modest increase to Pounds 504m. For the current year, analysts
are predicting little change.
For many observers, this downfall was caused by an uncharacteristic
adventurousness, with the clear cautionary message that banks should stick
to what they know and do best. 'Self-inflicted wounds,' was how Julian
Robins, banking analyst at BZW, described NatWest's pain.
Two serious mistakes were compounded by bad luck.
One was NatWest's attempt to enter investment banking by creating County
NatWest at the time of the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986. County
not only lost large sums of money in each of the succeeding years, helped by
the 1987 market crash, but it plunged NatWest into the Blue Arrow scandal
which cost it its chairman and three senior executives. Several ex-County
officials are now standing trial, accused of rigging the market to conceal
the failure of the Pounds 857m Blue Arrow rights issue which they were
managing.
NatWest's difficulties in investment banking were not unique: other clearing
banks also lost large sums of money. But County's losses have been the
largest, and its failure to achieve its ambitions has been the most
conspicuous. County was supposed to propel NatWest into the ranks of 'global
banks'. Instead, it has ended up performing a limited range of services, and
is only a secondary player in places like New York and Tokyo.
The second mistake was NatWest's determination to expand in the US despite
recent history which suggested it was a high risk strategy. The plan was
directed by Tom Frost, the chief executive, who had previously headed
NatWest in the US.
But last year NatWest Bancorp, which has 263 branches across New York and
New Jersey, was hit by the property collapse and lost Pounds 167m - a larger
sum in nominal terms than Crocker National Bank lost Midland Bank in the
1980s.
Apart from costing NatWest much in the way of money and prestige, both these
setbacks had a demoralising impact on the rest of the clearing bank whose
3,000 branches in Britain's high streets were generating the bulk of the
group's profits. The losses have also exposed other weaknesses at NatWest,
like its expensive cost structure and its relatively poor earnings
performance compared with the stronger clearers, Lloyds and Barclays.
The test of NatWest's mettle will be its ability to deal with these
difficulties. When announcing last year's poor profits, Frost said:
'NatWest's 1990 results require firm action, and we are taking it.'
Of the two biggest problems, it looks as if NatWest will try to soldier on
with its US operation, but will have to decide whether to cut its losses at
County. Lord Alexander has given County two years to show it can make a
profit, with the threat that if it does not 'then we must out' of the
equities business.
The ultimatum set off tremors which appear to have culminated in last
night's sudden announcement by Howard Macdonald, County's chief executive,
that he was resigning. His departure suggests that there are still serious
strains between NatWest and its investment banking arm, and it creates a
further disruption to the much-needed healing process.
As for the US, NatWest knows that the bank there can make money - it was
consistently profitable earlier in the 1980s - and the culture of that
business is close to that of the clearing bank. But the road to recovery
could be long and painful because the volume of bad debts in the region is
still high. This week NatWest Bancorp announced a first quarter loss of
Dollars 191m, and required a further Dollars 150m capital infusion.
The US and the County problems had two points in common. They both marked
major departures from NatWest's mainstream UK banking business, and both
were conducted without the sureness of touch which marked NatWest's advance
in the early 1980s.
After these expensive mistakes, NatWest's fortunes will depend on its
success in the domestic UK market which, in a good year, should be able to
generate over Pounds 1bn in profits. But it is an increasingly competitive
arena in which Frost and his colleagues are trying to galvanise the bank's
massive labour force, while at the same time cutting costs.
NatWest will be shedding 4,000 people this year, with a total of 15,000 jobs
being eliminated over the next two years, about 13 per cent of its staff.
Frost has set up a centrally based team to oversee the cost-reduction
programme. It reports directly to him and he says it should save the NatWest
group Pounds 400m a year by 1993. Part of the cost savings will come from
the introduction of labour-saving technology; a data centre in Staffordshire
handles nearly half the group's cheque-processing with fewer than 25 people.
Frost has also rejigged the senior management. One of the key players is
Derek Wanless who heads UK banking at the age of only 43. Wanless is a
believer in new techniques; he speaks of the role of technology and machines
in delivering products to customers, and of the potential for cross-selling
more services to NatWest's enormous but under-exploited customer base in the
personal and local business markets. Although this is a familiar banker's
theme, Wanless says: 'Banks have barely made a start on the possibilities'.
One dilemma NatWest faces is whether to persist with its strategy of being a
broker rather than a creator of non-banking products like insurance and
investments. (Under UK law, a bank must 'polarise' one way or the other.)
NatWest was the only major clearer which chose to polarise as a broker. The
strategy has seemed a success. The broking business nearly doubled its
profits last year. But Lloyds Bank, which took the opposite extreme and
allied itself with Abbey Life, the financial services group, is setting a
hot pace which has caused some uncertainty at NatWest and caused analysts to
question the wisdom of its policy.
Although NatWest's difficulties were compounded by events like the market
crash in 1987, and the severity of the recession in the UK and the US north
east, analysts say that they have also found the bank wanting in strategic
foresight.
The County diversification was clearly undertaken to follow the fashion for
investment banking - but without a full understanding of the markets into
which it would lead the group. The US strategy never took into account the
possibility that recession could have such a regionalised impact. All this
has made NatWest a more cautious bank. For example, it is taking a very low
key approach to Europe and 1992. Since the plan for a single market started,
it has only bought out a minority of a small Dutch merchant bank, and a
handful of branches in France.
But if NatWest has a chastened air, it has not lost all the cultural
cohesion which served it well before the crisis. There is an obvious
determination among management to restore its self-respect. After a year in
the chair, Lord Alexander, a former barrister, has begun to speak out more
boldly on banking issues. And he warns people against 'selling the strengths
of this group short'.

FT  19 APR 91 / Technology: Chip with a flash of inspiration - The
semiconductor that could replace both hard and floppy discs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surfers search for the perfect wave, fishermen live for the big one that
doesn't get away, and semiconductor makers dream of a non-volatile,
sector-eraseable chip with limitless write cycles.
A chip, in other words, which could replace both hard and floppy discs.
The chip will have to perform the same functions as discs do. It will have
to be non-volatile, or capable of retaining information when the power is
switched off. It will have to be capable of performing large numbers of
write cycles, or store new information frequently without wearing out. It
will also have to be sector-eraseable, so that some of the information on it
can be deleted while the rest is retained. Above all, it will have to be
cheap.
A chip called the 'flash E-Prom' meets some of these requirements and its
champions believe it will eventually satisfy all of them. Supporters of the
chip say that because it is small, physically durable and uses little power
it is ideal for portable computers. Peter Norman, UK managing director of
Psion, the British-based computer maker, believes that flash E-Prom is 'the
technology of the 1990s'.
E-Prom stands for eraseable programmable read-only memory. E-Prom chips
retain memory when the power is switched off, unlike dynamic random access
memories (D-Rams) and static random access memories (S-Rams).
The problem with standard E-Proms is that they are difficult to erase and
re-program. To delete the information on them, the chips have to be exposed
to ultra-violet light for 20 minutes or more. There are E-Proms which can be
erased electrically. These are called electrically eraseable programmable
read only memories, or EE-Proms, but their drawback is that the erasure
process takes about two minutes.
Flash E-Proms, by contrast, can be erased by a flash of electricity that
takes less than a second. Because the chips do not have any moving parts
they are also less likely to fail than discs. Norman, whose company uses
flash chips in its portable and hand-held computers, says that computer
discs are an anomaly which will eventually disappear. 'There's something
bizarre about these wonderful digital computers with this rather horrid
mechanical device for data storage,' he says.
Byron Harding of Dataquest, a high technology consultancy, says that makers
of flash E-Proms will have to overcome several problems before the chips can
be considered a replacement for discs.
The first, he says, is that there is a limit to the number of times the
information on flash E-Proms can be erased and replaced with new data. When
flash chips are re-programmed some electrons remain trapped within the
memory cell. Eventually, this accumulation of electrons makes it impossible
to re-program the chip. Harding likens the process to filling a bucket with
wet cement and then emptying it. A residue of cement will remain each time
this is done. Eventually the bucket will be full of hardened cement.
Russell Clayton, a flash specialist with Intel of the US, the world's
leading manufacturer of the chip, says that the re-programming problem has
been exaggerated. Intel guarantees that its flash chips can be re-programmed
at least 10,000 times. A typical Intel flash chip can be re-programmed
100,000 times, he says. If the chip was re-programmed 10 times a day it
would last for nearly 30 years.
Another drawback to flash E-Proms is that it is not possible to erase only
part of the chip. All the data on the chip have to be deleted. On discs, it
is possible to delete some information while retaining the rest. Clayton
says there are no technical reasons why flash chips cannot be made partially
eraseable. EE-Proms are already partially eraseable. The problem, he says,
is one of cost. A 1 Mbit EE-Prom costs five or six times as much as the
equivalent flash E-Prom.
Although flash chips cost less than EE-Proms, many in the industry believe
that they are still not cheap enough to replace discs. It is the cost of
flash chips rather than any technical problems which could ensure that discs
remain the preferred method of data storage in computers and other
electronic devices.
A hard disc in a small portable computer might have 20 Mbytes of memory. A
typical flash chip will have 1 Mbit of memory, or an eighth of a megabyte.
Replacing the hard disc with an equal amount of memory would require 160
flash chips at about Dollars 12 (Pounds 7) each, producing a total cost of
Dollars 1,920. The equivalent hard disc would less than a tenth of that,
Harding says.
Psion's Norman, however, believes that high cost will not stop flash from
taking off. As the volume of manufacture increases, the price of the chips
will fall. The price of discs might fall too, but the greater reliability,
portability and lower power consumption of flash E-Proms will give them the
edge. The growth of the portable and hand-held computer market will aid that
process, he says.

FT  19 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Got nitrogen in the can
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RACE by brewers to provide traditional beers in the latest thin-walled
drink cans could be speeded up by a development from BOC.
The Guildford company has filed a patent for a way of dissolving nitrogen
gas in the beer before it is canned. Tests on nitrogen show that it does not
alter the characteristics of the beer at all.
After packaging the nitrogen is released from the liquid and exerts pressure
on the aluminium or steel can walls, making them rigid. They can then be
stacked on supermarket shelves or pallets without damage.
BOC believes the technique is easier to control and monitor than existing
methods of canning beer, where liquid nitrogen is fed into the can just
before closure. BOC's Stackmaster process could also be used for soft
drinks, and for bottling in plastic (Pet - polyester terephthalate)
containers as well.

A TOUGH, lightweight ceramic material is now being made into bearings for a
range of industrial sectors.
Developed by SNR Roulements, in Annecy, France, the bearings are made of
silicon nitride, which is chemically very stable. Other properties of the
material are that it is extremely hard and therefore lasts much longer than
traditional steel bearings.
SNR has two bearings for various applications: hybrid bearings - ceramic
balls held in place by steel rings - to give the speed needed in precision
machine tools; and ceramic bearings for use in nuclear physics and the
petrochemical industry where there are strong chemicals.

<TEXT>
FOR travel agents, there can be few quicker ways of persuading clients to
indulge in that special holiday than by showing photographic images of blue
skies and golden beaches on the computer screen in the office. But the
problem for travel agents - and businesses such as art dealers and estate
agents - is being able to get the photograph into the computer.
Canon, the Japanese camera and copier company, has come up with the idea of
using its still video camera for creating and inputting full colour images
into PCs.
With the Ion-PC kit the user takes a series of photos which are stored on a
floppy disc. The camera is then connected to the PC via an interface cable,
and each picture is displayed on the screen, enabling the selection of the
best one. Using the Ion-PC digitiser the image is captured digitally and
stored. Each image has over 400,000 pixels (picture elements).
Canon is working with several software companies, including Aldus, SPC and
Lotus, to allow users to incorporate captured images in their desktop
publishing and other graphics software.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN air-conditioning system which has no moving parts and could prevent the
spread of Legionnaire's disease has been installed in office buildings in
Cambridge.
The system replaces the boiler and cooling tower with a water tank
containing thousands of plastic balls (it is atomised droplets of
bacteria-ridden water escaping from the cooling tower that cause
Legionnaire's disease). Each of the balls is filled with salts which change
from a solid form to a liquid at 27 deg C. Such eutectic salts are already
used in the process industry where heat needs to be removed rapidly.
In hot weather the salts are frozen overnight using cheap-rate electricity.
During the day these frozen salts are used to cool the water circulating
through the tank. In winter the reverse occurs.
Although the designers of the system, The Company of Designers, in
Cambridge, say the system itself is more expensive than traditional heating
and cooling systems, it is less expensive to install in city centre
buildings because it takes up much less of the expensive floor space.

TRANSGENIC mice, which are now being bred in the US, could help chemicals,
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals manufacturers to test their products for
carcinogenic traces more quickly, while using far fewer animals.
GenPharm International, which is breeding the animals in Mountain View
California, says the mice hold the potential for experiments to be cut to
six months using 100 to 200 transgenic mice, compared with the two years and
the 1,000 mice used today.
The mice, developed at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, in Amsterdam, have
been made sensitive to carcinogens by the insertion of an extra gene, known
as an oncogene. These oncogenes are one of a series of biological triggers
which result in animals developing tumours. It therefore takes fewer
carcinogens to trigger cancer in the mice.

FT  19 APR 91 / The Property Market: Stanhope has designs on business in the
west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope is widely considered to be one of the most talented property
development groups in Europe. Nevertheless, like most overstretched players
in the overbuilt London market, it is facing a period of consolidation.
Last week it sharply wrote down the value of some sites - the bedraggled
South Bank Centre, a section of London Wall in the City, a part of Brunswick
Wharf to the north-east of the Isle of Dogs and some office blocks in Euston
Square - after postponing their development for the next three years.
Likewise, the 134-acre King's Cross site, potentially the most promising in
London, is unlikely to be started for several years, although Stanhope and
its partners are continuing to negotiate planning permission.
But Stanhope's wings have not been clipped entirely. After winning planning
permission at the start of the year, it is now converting an old bus
maintenance depot at Chiswick into an architecturally distinguished office
park set in 33 acres of parkland.
This suburban (or as the developer prefers, 'mid-urban') park will feature
the work of six leading UK architects - Eric Parry Associates, Richard
Rogers Partnership, Peter Foggo Associates, ABK, Terry Farrell and Co, and
Foster Associates. Among the buildings architects in this group have to
their credit are those for Lloyd's of London and the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank and the exuberant TV-am headquarters.
Asking a clutch of high-flying architects to produce harmonising designs
within a tight budget for an office campus is unusual - and laudably
ambitious. But the architects, headed by the master-planner Terry Farrell
and Hanna/Olin, the US landscape architect, appear to have come up with the
goods.
'The master plan and the details of the landscaping . . . suggests a scheme
of unusual interest and quality that will set the standard for developments
of this sort,' said the Department of the Environment's report.
Stanhope, which is building the business campus with Trafalgar House, says
the scheme is innovative in other ways. It is a cross between a conventional
business park, in landscaping, car parking and amenities, and an urban
office complex in its location and accessibility.
The developers (perhaps optimistically) reckon it takes just 31 minutes to
get to Cannon Street and 20 minutes to reach Heathrow. The park is a few
minutes' walk from three Underground stations and two British Rail stations,
which will eventually be connected by an interchange.
According to Stanhope, 3m people are within a 15-minute journey of the
projected site. 'The whole idea is: Why drag people into the town centre?
Why not provide jobs where they want to live?' says Mr Fergus Low, the
development director.
In addition, the park will have a sports club, a brasserie and childcare
facilities. Stanhope says the scheme, which will be ready in 1992, has
sparked an encouraging amount of interest from the media and from
pharmaceutical companies.
If so, there seems to be a good chance that it will be a financial success.
Kleinwort Benson Securities estimates that the project's break-even costs
are Pounds 27 per sq ft, while it aims to charge rents of between Pounds 30
and Pounds 35 per sq ft. Stanhope, which already has a Pounds 100m facility,
says it is confident that it can raise another Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m for
the project.
Elsewhere Stanhope's finances may be under strain. There are doubts about
the profitability of its Ludgate scheme in Holborn (in spite of the
record-breaking size of the letting agreed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte)
and there is concern about the value of Broadgate, the office development in
the City.
Broadgate held its value well in the initial phase of the property slump,
but is likely to see a drop in value this year. Because Rosehaugh Stanhope
Developments (the joint venture responsible for Ludgate and Broadgate) is
highly geared, this could wipe out a significant part of the company's asset
value. At the same time, there has been a realisation that the reduction of
RSD's large income deficit may be a long haul because of high (although
shrinking) interest costs and the worsening prospects for rental growth.
The conclusion - that RSD needs to sell part of Broadgate - is hardly new.
The decision to sell was taken last summer, although it was delayed by
disagreements between Rosehaugh and Stanhope. But the asking price was
ambitious (not least because of the extravagant sums that had been paid for
other prestigious buildings such as Lansdowne House) and the crisis in the
Gulf deterred potential buyers. A sale that was tentatively agreed with the
Prudential Insurance Company of America's Global Fund fell through when the
Gulf war broke out.
As investors start to return to the UK market, a sale should not be too far
away. The price is likely to be very different from that hoped for last
summer.

FT  19 APR 91 / The Property Market: Rise in yields has gone too far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE property market 'offers an opportunity not seen since the late 1950s',
says James Capel, the broker, in a recent investment strategy report, writes
Vanessa Houlder.
The crux of its argument is that the record-breaking rise in yields has gone
too far. 'Yields on anything but the very limited number of prime properties
are so high that, for a small injection of equity, the investor has positive
cash flow,' it says.
Property is now cheaply priced not only compared with its own historic
pattern, but against other asset classes, it adds. Relative property, bond
and equity yields, the relative growth of rents and dividends, and the
relative volatility of property since the late 1970s are cited as evidence.
Admittedly, rents are now falling, which means that the rents paid by
tenants are higher than those obtainable on the open market.
The recession could create a series of tenant defaults. But the Capel report
suggests yields have over-compensated for this risk. 'A buyer of a portfolio
of retail property yielding 10 per cent could suffer nearly 50 per cent
defaults and be unable to re-let before breaching the mean yield of the last
14 years,' it says.
These arguments carry weight and indeed, there is a rough consensus in the
industry that yields have gone out far enough. The problem for would-be
buyers is lack of good-quality, high-yielding property on the market, as
sellers have held back in the hope that yields would improve.
Nonetheless, it is questionable if property values will ever revert to their
historical patterns. At a seminar organised by County NatWest this week,
speakers argued that the industry - with the exception of the industrial
sector - is undergoing a sea-change.
Mr Russell Schiller of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors, said the retail
sector was experiencing fundamental changes, because of the growth of
out-of-town retail parks. Shoppers were rebelling against the tedium of the
high street - pointing to poor rental prospects in the town centres, which
account for most of the institutions' retail assets.
Mr Geoff Marsh of APR, which specialises in office research, said the
oversupply that followed planning deregulation in the 1980s meant the 1990s
could be a decade of dereliction. 'The numbers are heavily on the side of
the occupier,' he said. 'It is not just another cycle. It is a new game.'

FT  19 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Government 2-1 defeat over murder
sentences - Criminal justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLICY of mandatory life sentences for murder was shattered by the Lords
yesterday as peers rejected government advice and decided to give judges
discretion to impose whatever sentences they thought fit.
Senior judges led the cross-bench revolt which defeated the government by
more than two-to-one in the committee discussion of the Criminal Justice
Bill.
Peers voted by 177 to 79, a majority of 98 against the government, to follow
the advice of a Lords select committee on murder, and give judges the option
of sentencing murderers to set prison terms.
They then defeated the government again - by 120 votes to 68 - in deciding
that where life imprisonment was imposed, the judge would be required to
give his reasons and indicate how many years should be served.
The government intends to overturn the Lords' decisions when the bill
returns to the Commons, but the scale of the defeats must raise doubts about
whether it will be able to insist on returning to the previous position.
Lord Lane, the lord chief justice, said judges could set the appropriate
sentence for murder as for other serious crimes, and that the trial judge
was in the best position to determine the right penalty.
Lord Nathan, who had chaired the select committee, said the sentence should
be a decision in open court, rather than taken in secrecy by the home
secretary as it is under the present system. The range of crimes within the
definition of murder, he said, was so wide that imposing a life sentence in
all of them diluted its gravity and credibility.
Lord Waddington, the leader of the Lords and a former home secretary, said
the government had concluded that the proposed change would damage public
confidence in the criminal justice system and in the judiciary.

FT  19 APR 91 / FT Law Report: Bank of England rescue payment is a capital
expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWSON (HM INSPECTOR OF TAXES) v JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC
Court of Appeal
(Lord Justice Fox, Lord Justice McCowan and Lord Justice Beldam):
March 27 1991
A LUMP sum injected into an insolvent subsidiary by its parent company prior
to and as a term of the sale of the subsidiary to the Bank of England in a
rescue operation to which the only alternative would be disaster for the
parent, is a capital payment, though made for the sole purpose of preserving
the parent's trade, and is therefore not tax deductible as a trading expense
from the parent's profits.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendant
parent company, Johnson Matthey plc, from Mr Justice Vinelott's decision
that a Pounds 50m payment made to a subsidiary just before the subsidiary's
shares were sold to the Bank of England, was not an allowable expense in
computing the profits of the parent company.
LORD JUSTICE FOX said that the parent company carried on business in
refining and selling precious metals, particularly platinum. One of its
wholly-owned UK subsidiaries, Johnson Matthey Bankers plc, carried on a
banking business, including the merchanting of bullion.
In August 1984 the subsidiary got into difficulties on its commercial loan
business. Large advances had been made on what turned out to be inadequate
security.
A board meeting of the parent company was held at the Bank of England on the
night of September 30/October 1 1984, to deal with the resulting crisis.
At about 12.30am on October 1 the board concluded that the subsidiary was
insolvent and could not open its doors for business without further
financing, which the parent could not afford to supply. Cessation of the
subsidiary's business and resulting damage to confidence in the parent was
likely to lead to repayment demands by lending institutions which the parent
would be unable to meet. The parent would therefore have to cease trading.
There was no alternative but to wind up the subsidiary and appoint a
liquidator. A receiver should be appointed to protect the interests of the
parent's shareholders and employees, and to facilitate the orderly disposal
of assets.
The Bank was told of the decisions at once. It made a non-negotiable offer
to the board that the Bank would acquire the issued share capital of the
subsidiary for Pounds 1, on condition that, prior to the sale, the parent
injected Pounds 50m into the subsidiary.
The board accepted the proposals. They were implemented by the opening of
business later that day.
In its accounts to March 31 1985 the parent deducted the Pounds 50m as an
expense of its platinum trade.
The Revenue disputed that deduction on the grounds (1) that it was a capital
expense; (2) that it was not paid out exclusively for the purposes of the
trade.
The Commissioners found that the sole purpose for which the parent made the
Pounds 50m payment was to enable it to open the doors of its platinum trade
on the Monday morning. They found on the evidence that the payment was made
to preserve the parent's trade from collapse and that, as a payment to
preserve an existing business, it was of a revenue nature. They found that
its association with the disposal of shares did not convert it into payment
of a capital nature.
Thus they decided both points in favour of the taxpayer. The Revenue
appealed to the High Court.
On the appeal it did not dispute that the monies were laid out wholly and
exclusively for the trade. It did, however, contest the decision that the
payment was a revenue expense.
Mr Justice Vinelott accepted the Revenue's contention. He said the board's
purpose in agreeing to make the payment was no doubt to preserve the
parent's business, but the means by which that was achieved was to transfer
the subsidiary's shares to the Bank as part of a single arrangement to pay
Pounds 50m to the subsidiary and to release the subsidiary from any
obligation to repay it.
He said 'these two elements cannot be severed, the one being treated as a
disposal for a nominal consideration of a worthless but not an onerous
asset, and the other as a payment made to preserve the business'. He
concluded that the Pounds 50m was a capital payment. The parent now
appealed.
There were numerous decided cases on whether a payment was to be treated as
capital or revenue. They varied widely in their facts. The facts in the
present case were unusual and derived from very special circumstances.
Authorities were accordingly of very limited value.
In Strick v Regent Oil (1966) AC 295,315 Lord Reid said 'the determination
of what is capital and what is income must depend rather on common sense
than on the strict application of any single legal principle'.
That was accepted. It seemed to be an approach of some importance in the
present case.
Mr Park for the parent company submitted:
(1) the Commissioners found that the Pounds 50m was laid out to preserve the
parent's platinum trade from collapse;
(2) there was no ground for saying it was laid out to secure the disposal of
a capital asset, because (i) the shares were not an onerous asset (see
Mallett v Staveley 13 TC 772) but were a worthless asset; and (ii) the
parent did not need to pay Pounds 50m to get rid of the shares - it could
have disposed of them to a shelf company or could have liquidated the
subsidiary;
(3) prior to receiving the Bank's offer the parent had in fact decided to
put the subsidiary into liquidation;
(4) accordingly, it did not represent the reality of the matter to say
either that the Pounds 50m was paid to dispose of the shares or that it
achieved a disposition of the shares;
(5) it was not a case of negative consideration or reverse premium being
paid for the shares. The essence of the transaction was that the parent paid
Pounds 50m to preserve its own trade. The Commissioners, it was emphasised,
found that the monies were wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose
of the parent's trade. At the end of it all the parent lost its shares which
were worthless and would be lost anyway, but saved its platinum trade.
On the night of September 30 the subsidiary was a wreck. It would not be
able to continue trading on the Monday morning. The state of affairs
produced a perilous situation for the parent because the resulting loss of
confidence in the parent was likely to produce repayment demands which it
could not meet.
The sale of the shares was for a nominal consideration of Pounds 1 only. But
the Bank was not prepared to take them unless prior to the sale the parent
injected Pounds 50m.
Mr Park said this was a rescue operation by the Bank. That was right. But
the real question was, what was the nature of the rescue operation?
Mr Park said in effect that the Pounds 50m was not for and did not have the
effect of securing the sale of the shares.
That was not accepted. There was a single agreement. The Bank was ready to
acquire the shares only on terms that prior to the sale the parent paid the
subsidiary Pounds 50m. There was no other way in which the parent could rid
itself of the subsidiary without disaster.
It could have got rid of the shares by transferring them to a shelf company
or by putting the subsidiary into liquidation but that would not have solved
its problem.
The solution offered by the Bank was the only way out. The subsidiary had to
be rescued, not liquidated or ignored.
It was true that the parent's purpose was to preserve its own trade. But
that was not determinitive of the capital/income issue.
The position was in reality the same as if the Bank had said: 'We will take
over the subsidiary if you pay us Pounds 50m.'
Whichever way it was done, it was a payment by the parent to enable it to
get rid of a capital asset. The asset was not onerous, but its continuous
retention was harmful to the parent.
The common sense of the matter was that the Pounds 50m was capital
expenditure.
The appeal was dismissed.
Their Lordships gave concurring judgments.

Garrett).

FT  19 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brussels opens its doors to trade with
eastern Europe - The EC association accord with Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have put their collective weight against
the EC's door, shoved, and won themselves further valuable access to the
European Community market.
It now seems certain that these three countries will this year reach a new
type of association accord with Brussels, extending to them by the turn of
the century the freedom of movement of goods, services, labour and capital
in the Community's single market, and an option on full EC membership.
Only a couple of weeks ago, however, the eastern Europeans were fulminating
at the Community's hypocrisy in showering them with fine political words
empty of economic content. Sensitive to this charge, on Monday EC foreign
ministers softened the EC's negotiating stance in several key respects.
Membership of the EC may now figure in the preamble to the agreements as 'an
ultimate, though not automatic' goal. EC ministers conceded this, believing
the three states are likely to be in a second wave of new members, after
some European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries join in the mid-1990s.
But this preamble could come back to haunt Brussels, as has the reference to
possible membership for Turkey in the 1963 EC-Turkish association agreement.
The EC has dropped its call for a review half-way through the 10-year period
during which trade barriers will be phased out. Hungary, in particular,
argued that such a review, giving the EC a chance to go back on its free
trade words, would discourage western entrepreneurs wanting firm assurance
of an EC outlet for their investments in eastern Europe. But the EC still
wants a mid-term review of liberalisation in services, capital and labour.
The eastern Europeans will get more time to erect tariffs which they will
then spend the next 10 years dismantling. With these negotiations coming so
relatively soon after the collapse of communism, the eastern Europeans have
removed all the non-tariff barriers of central planning without yet
replacing them with a transparent tariff system.
Thus, in many cases they are left with markets more open and vulnerable than
the EC, contrary to the agreed aim of phasing in free trade so as to benefit
the eastern Europeans faster than the EC. A further complication is that a
long-standing member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt)
like Czechoslovakia will need its Gatt partners' agreement to raise its very
low 'bound' tariffs of 4-5 per cent on average.
Already the US is grumbling that eastern Europe will be making a general
increase in its tariffs, followed by a selective reduction only towards the
EC. Washington's counter has been to twist the knife in the EC's side by
insisting the planned EC-central European free trade area conform with Gatt
in covering all aspects of trade, including agriculture.
Partly as a result of this, EC members overruled Spain in promising extra
concessions on farm exports. East Europeans will be probably able to sell
more fruit, vegetables, pork, game, rather than mainline items like cereals,
beef, lamb, dairy products that will continue to get the full protection of
the Common Agricultural Policy.
Northern EC members overruled Mediterranean objections to giving eastern
Europe more on textiles and steel. All textile tariffs will disappear over
the 10 year transition period (despite complaints from Portugal and Greece),
while steel import duties and quotas will go within five years (against
Spain's wishes). But the country most concerned to keep out eastern European
(mainly Polish) coal was Germany, which has insisted on a special regime for
coal.
To help the three eastern economies integrate, the EC is now ready to allow
regional 'cumulation' in its rules of origin. For example, a product
exported from Poland but using components from Hungary or Czechoslovakia
would not, by virtue of those components, be considered any less 'Polish' or
less eligible for duty-free entry into the EC. The Commission had hoped to
open up the EC labour market more, in particular by 'communitarising' any
immigration quotas granted by individual EC member states to eastern
European workers. But Britain, for one, opposed this.
The main EC focus is on promising non-discrimination for those eastern
Europeans already legally established in an EC state, rather than letting
them move around the Community more easily or letting more come in from
outside.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday signed emergency legislation ordering
250,000 US rail workers back to work after just one day on the picket lines.
The legislation was whisked through Congress in a day, to forestall a strike
which could have left 500,000 workers idle in industries dependent on the
railways. The president was woken at 1:39am yesterday to sign the bill. By
7am most of the strikers were back on the job.
The strike came after three years of negotiations on some of the most
complex issues ever to come before the National Mediation Board, according
to its chairman, Mr Joshua Javits. A presidential emergency board was
created in May 1990 to resolve the dispute. It held 219 hearings on health
and welfare issues under dispute and issued a set of recommendations which
pleased neither unions nor management.
Unions were displeased with board proposals which backed a reduction in the
size of train crews, long sought by management. The rail companies were
unhappy with the size of the wage increases recommended, averaging about 3-4
per cent a year over the next three years.
The legislation establishes a new emergency board to resolve remaining
points of disputes or ambiguities in the previous board's recommendations.

FT  19 APR 91 / World Trade News: Hungary gets 'try harder' nod from Gatt -
Report calls for better behaviour from its members in return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY still needs to make many changes to become an open economy offering
predictable and stable trade conditions, the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade says.
However, in its first review of an eastern European country's trade policy,
Gatt suggests that its members could behave better towards Hungary.
Hungary badly needed more foreign capital and a 'supportive external
environment' to push through its economic reforms and make its trade regime
compatible with that of the west.
Countries with convertible currencies had to lower barriers further to
imports of Hungarian farm produce, steel, textiles, clothing and other
consumer goods, the Gatt secretariat said in the report presented yesterday
in the Gatt council.
Hungarian agricultural exports, in particular, were facing serious
difficulties in gaining access to markets in Europe and elsewhere. Not only
were they running into trade barriers, they were also being hurt by massive
export subsidies, which depress world market prices.
Successive devaluations of the forint, coupled with plummeting demand for
Hungarian exports among its former east bloc trading partners, have
stimulated exports to the west. Hungary achieved a record surplus of almost
Dollars 1bn in trade in convertible currencies last year.
Nevertheless, with debt-servicing obligations that exceeded half the value
of its convertible currency exports in 1989, only a further expansion of
exports could underpin Hungary's ability to pursue the structural adjustment
of its economy, says Gatt.
Gatt it acknowledges that Hungary is becoming 'a more attractive place' for
Gatt members to do business, but the secretariat remains critical of the
pace of reform. Foreign businessmen's confidence could be boosted by swift
privatisation and a clearer definition of the future role of state-owned
enterprises, it suggests.
State authorities still had wide discretion to introduce trade restrictions;
criteria or guidelines for decisions by the authorities were either lacking
or remained opaque. Administrative decisions could not be challenged before
courts and no independent statutory body carried out a regular review of
trade policy.
In response Hungary told the Gatt council that the success of the
privatisation process depended to a great extent on the inflow of foreign
capital. Under the new constitution state enterprises were guaranteed the
right to operate independently and only an overburdened legislative
programme had prevented parliament from replacing outdated laws.
Substantial liberalisation of imports appeared to have been achieved, Gatt
said, but a wide range of products, including transport and
telecommunications equipment, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods were still
subject to licensing. Hungary maintained a global quota on imports of
consumer goods from market economies.
These import restrictions and relatively high tariffs weakened, if they did
not prevent, competition in many areas of the economy. The simple average
tariff at 16 per cent was higher than in most developed countries.
The Hungarians say reductions in a large number of products introduced in
February have cut the average tariff rate to 13 per cent.
Levies and charges on imports other than tariffs were substantial, Gatt
reported. They included a 2 per cent customs clearance fee on imports
settled in convertible currency. A new import regime is being prepared for
farm products.
Export subsidies to Hungarian farm products totalled about Dollars 370m in
1990 and support will continue under the economic reform programme outlined
in September. The Hungarians say there are no other subsidies and point out
that, as a member of the Cairns group of farm-exporting countries, they have
been pressing for worldwide cuts in farm subsidies in the Uruguay Round
trade talks.
Currency convertibility was a major concern to foreign traders in doing
business with Hungary, Gatt commented. The Hungarians said that, after a
further rise in prices this year, strengthened budget discipline and a
liberal import policy were expected to slow inflation, stabilise the
currency and provide a basis for making the forint convertible in 1994.

PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has gone on the offensive against
corruption, an issue over which he has recently come under attack in the
media.
In a television address on Wednesday evening, Mr Menem announced a crackdown
on corruption and drug trafficking. He also dissolved a scandal-ridden
provincial government whose own political difficulties were threatening the
national government.
Government officials and even members of Mr Menem's extended family are
alleged to have been involved in corruption and drug trafficking.
However, he has done little to investigate the accusations.
Mr Menem promised the 'investigation, trial and punishment of organised
crime' which he said was involved in 'drug trafficking, money laundering,
smuggling, fraud and tax evasion'. The air force is also to co-operate with
the US in an aerial survey to locate coca plantations and illegal airstrips.
Mr Menem could also win support in September's crucial gubernatorial and
congressional elections after replacing the Peronist government of
Catamarca, an impoverished northwestern province, with a federal
administrator.

talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community has restrained its ambition to test its new-found
confidence in foreign policy on the issue of Arab-Israeli peace talks.
After meeting Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, in Luxembourg late
on Wednesday, EC foreign ministers settled - at least temporarily  - for an
undefined 'association' with the process.
They went into the meeting determined to secure full 'co-sponsorship' of
Washington's regional formula, with a seat at the table alongside the US and
the Soviet Union.
What Wednesday's talks - the third high-level US-EC encounter in the past
week - made clear was that the peace process was not sufficiently advanced
or secure enough for Washington to override Israeli objections to closer
European involvement.
This was not a climb-down, officials from the pragmatic Luxembourg
presidency of the EC underlined, but an act of prudence. Mr Baker had made
clear, to his EC colleagues and publicly, that he wanted Europe aboard.
But Israel, which has accepted in principle the US plan for face-to-face
talks with the Arabs, remains wary of the EC because of the Community's
long-standing call for a UN-sponsored peace conference which would include
the Palestinians.
Mr Baker said after the meeting that his primary objective was 'to establish
a process that has some reasonable chance of success and of being begun in
the first place'. But he added that 'we have made it very clear to Israel
that Europe can contribute to this process and should be involved'.
The added value the EC believes it can provide is twofold. It can provide
'something of an umbrella', as one EC diplomat expressed it, for Syria and
the Palestine Liberation Organisation. They are insisting on a UN-backed
conference centred on the 'land-for-peace' formula contained in Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338, requiring Israel to withdraw from the
occupied territories in exchange for a settlement.
'If you have four permanent members of the Security Council present,' said
one diplomat, 'the substance of what took place at the regional conference
would be under these resolutions'.
Second, and longer term, the EC believes it has a significant contribution
to make to economic development in the region.
The EC is in no sense relinquishing its aim to raise its political
involvement to the level of its economic commitment. But having provided
leadership sufficient to jolt the US into action on providing aid plus
security to the Kurds, it is confident and prudent enough to let the US set
the pace on regional peace. As one senior EC diplomat remarked, 'the US is
the only player that can make progress now'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S money supply rose by just 4.9 per cent in March compared with the
same month last year, the lowest monthly rate of increase on record.
The decline in growth, from a peak of 13 per cent less than a year ago,
highlights the fierceness of the Bank of Japan's determination to squeeze
excess money out of the economy. In the first three months of 1991, the
money supply has shrunk by 1.2 per cent, on an annualised basis.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, insists that he will keep his
grip on credit for at least the time being - despite hopes among investors
of an imminent cut in the Official Discount Rate. In a speech on Wednesday,
Mr Mieno said that there had been a slight slowdown in the economy. 'But
that is only natural and even desirable in consideration of the past tight
monetary policy.'
Mr Russell Jones, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities
company, says that the central bank could cut interest rates with little
fear of inflation. But other factors, including the recent weakness of the
yen against the US dollar, might give Mr Mieno pause for thought.
Aside from the exchange rate, the central bank is concerned about upward
pressure on wages from labour shortages, consumer price inflation and a
possible resurgence in speculative investment in land if interest rates are
cut too soon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLOWOUT teams fighting to cap Kuwait's blazing oil wells said yesterday they
were making 'tremendous progress' despite still lacking vital equipment and
responded angrily to criticism from the Kuwaiti government that they were
not working fast enough.
The four US and Canadian teams working in Kuwait's southern al-Ahmedi and
Burgan oilfields have capped 45 wells to date, including at least 14 of the
more than 500 which were ignited by the Iraqis, and say they are capping at
a rate of between three and five wells a day.
Mr Joe Bowden, president of Wild Wells Control, which has capped 27 wells,
said: 'You'll see tremendous progress now. The pace will pick up
tremendously in the next few weeks.'
The two other Texan-based blowout specialists, Boots and Coots and Red Adair
Company, have capped 12 and six wells respectively, while Safety Boss, the
Calgary-based Canadian group, yesterday began work on its first two wells.
Mr Larry Flak of OGS, the group co-ordinating the capping operation, said
yesterday the teams were working as fast as they could given that they still
lacked much of the heavy machinery necessary to tackle the largest fires.
'We're risking men's lives to put out these wells, and we couldn't work
faster if we wanted to,' he said.
Although more equipment arrives daily on board US air force Galaxy C5
transporters, Mr Flak said the blowout teams were short of 'damn near
everything' and criticised the Kuwait authorities for having been slow to
sign contracts to import equipment to meet the companies' needs.
He said all four teams required more heavy earth movers, cranes, hydraulic
excavators, jet cutters and jackhammers - mostly to deal with badly damaged
wells which have accumulated large deposits of burning coke around the head
which must be cleared before the well fire can be attacked.
Some of the teams have resorted to cannibalising some of the innumerable
trucks and other vehicles wrecked by the Iraqis and which litter the oil
centre of al-Ahmedi. 'Money could have saved a lot of this,' said Mr Flak.
'The Kuwaitis are the problem,' he said. 'Not the ones here, but the
Kuwaitis in London and elsewhere who control the purse strings. It's the
guys sitting in their little air-conditioned palaces outside that are
causing the headaches.'
All four blowout teams were stung by remarks last weekend by Dr Rasheed
al-Almeeri, the Kuwait oil minister, that they could not cope with the oil
well crisis alone and that he was therefore tendering for help from European
and other oil and construction companies.
'We really resent the oil minister's comments,' said Mr Flak. 'We think
we're making excellent progress with little support.'
The four teams are also handicapped by lack of water at the fire sites. A
giant lagoon built in the oil field is being fed by water tankers and work
is proceeding to pump water back to the wells through the oil gathering pipe
network running to the oil terminals. However, the blowout teams say there
is enough water so far only to deal with the smaller fires.

GREECE'S former deputy prime minister, Mr Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, a
defendant in the Bank of Crete embezzlement trial, died in hospital
yesterday, eight days after suffering a stroke while questioning a witness.
Mr Koutsogiorgas, who was 69, was accused of accepting a Dollars 2m bribe
from the bank's owner in 1988 in return for introducing legislation on bank
secrecy aimed at blocking a central bank investigation.
The trial, adjourned after Mr Koutsogiorgas' dramatic collapse in the
courtroom, can now continue. But without his testimony, it appears
increasingly unlikely that Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former prime minister,
could be convicted.
Mr Papandreou is also charged with taking bribes in the Dollars 200m
embezzlement scandal, which helped bring down his Socialist government, but
refuses to appear in court.
Mr Koutsogiorgas was Mr Papandreou's family lawyer and his closest political
associate during eight years in office. He served in a number of ministries
during the years of Socialist government from 1981 to 1989 and had been
expected to come up with damaging revelations about corruption during that
period.
He did not run for office in the June 1989 election after accusations
concerning his role in the bank scandal.
The court hearings will now focus on two other ex-cabinet ministers accused
of involvement in the Bank of Crete scandal, but their political
significance will be considerably diminished. Koutsogiorgas in court last
month

AN UNEXPECTED change in the leadership of Iceland's main conservative
opposition party has improved its chances of toppling the centre-left
coalition government in this weekend's general election.
The Independence party should win about 40 per cent of the vote, compared
with 27 per cent four years ago, according to a recent opinion poll. With
the existing coalition split over EC membership, Independence is should be
able to form a government with the pro-European Social Democrats.
Just over a month ago, Mr David Oddsson, Reykjavik's colourful mayor,
successfully challenged former Prime Minister Thorstein Palsson for the
leadership of the party at its annual conference.
Mr Oddsson, a writer and radio comedian, is more than Mr Palsson, who fell
out with his colleagues in the coalition he led after the 1987 election and
was forced to resign as premier in October 1988.
Independence is promising to cut taxes to stimulate the economy, a message
that finds considerable support among the voters. Furthermore, Independence
is expected to get most of the 11 per cent share of the votes it lost to a
breakaway faction of the party in 1987, which is now facing extinction.
The parties in the present coalition have all lost ground, according to
opinion surveys.
Another loser looks like being the Women's Movement, which burst upon the
political scene four years ago with just over 10 per cent of the vote. This
all-woman party with a strong environmentalist position seems set to fall
back to around 8-9 per cent support.
The centrist Progressives, main force in the present government, are
expected to poll almost as last time, with around 19 per cent support.
However, its total opposition to EC membership has reduced its chances of
being a part of the next coalition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON BRITTAN, the EC competition commissioner, warned yesterday of
further moves to break up monopolies in the electricity and gas market.
In a speech to the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, he said Brussels
was increasingly sceptical of government arguments that energy monopolies
were necessary to maintain security of supply.
The Commission's new yardstick, he said, was that governments should be
allowed to reserve no more than 20 per cent of their electricity production
for domestic primary energy producers on the grounds of security of supply.
In time this proportion should come down to 15 per cent.
Brussels has recently moved to break up cross-border trading monopolies in
electricity and gas, and the European Court of Justice has backed Commission
legal action against state monopolies.
Sir Leon suggested that next in the firing line might be organisations which
had concluded long-term exclusive energy supply accords that foreclosed
markets to other companies, or which abused their dominant market position
by denying others access to their networks or grids, or by setting
uncompetitive prices.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH TAX authorities have launched a belated crackdown on companies which
exploited a loophole in investment tax law, government officials said
yesterday.
The Finance Ministry is considering heavy fines, thought to exceed FFr1bn
(Pounds 100m), against 'several dozen' leading companies accused of setting
up investment funds with the sole purpose of generating tax credits on
dividend payments.
Mr Michel Charasse, the budget minister, told the national assembly this
week that an inquiry was under way, though he gave no precise figures or
names in answer to a parliamentary question.
He did not deny French press reports that the tax directorate had sent a
FFr600m demand for unpaid tax, relating to the 1987 fiscal year, to 157
companies and was negotiating substantial fines on top of that figure.
The inquiry comes at a potentially helpful moment for the government, which
is looking around for new measures to hold the line on a budget deficit now
in danger of growing because of the drop in tax revenues caused by the
recession.
Mr Michel Rocard, the prime minister, has recently suffered a parliamentary
setback and there is increasing speculation that a government reshuffle may
be in the offing. His colleagues are looking for ways to pass the buck on
unpopular spending cuts. Clearly, they would all welcome a corporate tax
revenue windfall.
The Association Francaise des Banques is attempting to negotiate a reduction
in the likely fines on behalf of its members, some of which set up
investment funds to help corporate clients minimise their tax bills.
The government closed the loophole in question in 1989, but it was not until
recently that the tax directorate took action against companies that had
made use of it before then.
It is an example of several grey areas that still exist in France's
surprisingly flexible tax laws, said Mr Patrick de Freminet, director of tax
affairs for Paribas, which has not made use of this loophole.
'In French tax law there are some things which, although not forbidden, are
. . . in any case not advisable,' he explained.

METAL workers in the Urals industrial city of Sverdlovsk stopped work
yesterday in a two-hour strike to show solidarity with demands of striking
coal miners.
The Sverdlovsk protest, affecting 46 big enterprises in the former power
base of Mr Boris Yeltsin, was the first of a series of solidarity strikes
planned outside the mining sector.
The action came as Russian leaders held talks with miners' representatives
to discuss ways of transferring their centrally-run mines to the
jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.
Mr Yuri Skokov, the deputy Russian prime minister, told parliament after the
talks that this was a key condition for ending the miners' strike in Russia.
The miners have a series of other economic and political demands, including
round-table talks as a prelude to the formation of an all-union coalition
government. Their demands are shared by many of the miners still on strike
in the Ukrainian Donbas.
Mr Skokov said the all-union Coal Ministry, the mines' current master, had
opposed his proposal to turn them over to Russian jurisdiction as joint
stock companies.
The miners see a defection to republican control as an opportunity to market
more of their output independently. The Raspadskaya mine, the largest in the
country, returned to work yesterday after it was switched to Russian
jurisdiction.
In the latest example of the dramatic knock-on effects of the coal strike, a
metal works in the Urals, at Nizhny Tagil, the sole supplier of some
essential inputs for the engineering industry, has been forced to close four
of its six furnaces.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, yesterday met leading radical
economists, including Mr Nikolai Petrakov and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, to hear
criticism of his anti-crisis programme.

FT  19 APR 91 / Brussels' biotech strategy draws cross-fire

<TEXT>
A NEW European Community strategy for the biotechnology industry was
attacked by both environmental groups and chemical companies yesterday.
Unveiling a policy paper in Strasbourg, the European Commission promised to
limit the regulatory burden on Europe's biotechnology industry and to set up
a committee to tackle the ethical problems of genetic, environmental and
human embryo research. But the paper has not laid to rest controversy about
the risks involved in developing biological techniques for use in
agrochemical, pharmaceutical and food industries.
The European Chemical Industry Federation (Cefic), said the Commission could
still discriminate against biotechnology products by subjecting them to an
extra level of testing and regulation, irrespective of the type of product -
a safeguard demanded by environmentalists.
Green party members of the European Parliament said the paper should be
withdrawn on the grounds that it offered inadequate protection for the
environment and human health. 'It's as though the biotech industry had given
the Commission its wish-list, and the Commission turned it into their basic
position paper,' said MEP Ms Hiltrud Breyer.
The strategy paper is itself a product of fierce internal debate in the
Commission, between departments responsible for environment, research,
agriculture and the internal market. It follows hard on the heels of the
strategy for the ailing information technology industry. Both sectors fall
under the EC's new industrial policy, which aims to stimulate investment,
but requires the companies themselves to come up with the cash.
European biotechnology companies are prospering, but Brussels wants to
streamline product authorisation procedures, harmonise standards and ensure
patent protection for EC biotechnology products to lure investment back from
the US industry.
Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market and industry commissioner, said that in
exceptional cases where controversy arose over social or economic effects of
a product - for example, the economic effect of a genetically-engineered
hormone to stimulate milk production - the Commission might have to take a
political decision on it. But this would not take the form of another layer
of regulation.

FUERTEVENTURA: The Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno described Fuerteventura as
'an oasis in the midst of the desert of civilisation' when he was exiled
there in 1924. Today, Fuerteventura can truly be described as one of the
'Fortunate Islands' in that it is relatively free of package tourists.
The islands are home to more than 3,000 members of the Spanish Foreign
Legion, whose reputation concedes nothing in toughness to that of their
French counterparts. The legion was originally based there with the purpose
of keeping an eye on King Hassan II of Morocco, who in the mid-1970s
successfully and peacefully invaded Spanish Sahara and recovered the
territory. The troops generally keep a low profile; the islanders do not
have a great love for them.
The second largest island of the group, at 1,725 sq km, Fuerteventura is a
desert-like place whose capital, Puerto del Rosario, is a stepping-stone for
the thousands who visit the island each year for its sun and sand. Pale
Europeans riding on camels, soaking up a touch of Africa, mingle with the
island's fishermen; Fuerteventura hosts some of the best of the Canaries'
fishing.
But although surrounded by water, the island still has to import much of its
drinking water from mainland Spain. Rainfall generally comes to the island
only once a year in a downpour which may last only one night.
Mass tourism has not yet defaced Fuerteventura as it has some of the other
islands; there are only 14,000 beds available to tourists on the whole
island, a small proportion of the Canaries' total.
That will change by the end of this year, when the Pounds 200m, 62 acre
Puerto Ventura project and a 9,000 bed hotel complex opens. A village
complex of hotels, apartments and entertainments, the development is a Swiss
project by a Zurich based company, Alpha Generalunternehmung. The man behind
the scheme, Mr Werner Bleiker, has convinced the Canarian authorities that
his village will offer Swiss quality with Spanish culture.
LANZAROTE: The volcanic arid island of Lanzarote (795 sq km, population
54,000) has become irrevocably linked in the minds of millions with cheap
package holidays - the 'lanzagrotty' of down market sun-worshipping. Not for
nothing has the island developed the myth - which may be true - that two BBC
television executives dreamed up the soap opera 'Eastenders' while taking in
the sun on Lanzarote; some 600,000 tourists come to the island each year.
That does an injustice to the island's natural beauty and scenic
attractions. But the bad image of the island has much to do with the
down-at-heel appearance of the principal town, Arrecife. The wise traveller
leaves Arrecife as soon as possible and heads off for places such as the
Timanfaya National Park, a reserve which is doing its best to maintain in an
unspoilt condition one of the world's youngest volcanic landscapes - the
last eruptions were in the early 18th century, and covered a quarter of the
island's most fertile land in a layer of lava between 6 and 10 metres deep.
The heat generated is such that bushes still spontaneously combust and
potatoes can be cooked by burying them just beneath the earth's surface.
GRAN CANARIA: With 700,000 people living and covering an area of 1,533 sq km
(making it the third largest island in the group), Gran Canaria is both the
seat of government for the autonomous region and the most popular tourist
destination within the islands. Its capital, Las Palmas, is both a major
port and the centre of one of the island's most famous resorts, Las
Canteras. But the Playa del Ingles and Maspalomas are equally well-known
among the hundreds of thousands of British, German and Scandinavian
tourists.
Gran Canaria has been pillaged for tourist attractions, its coastline
littered with ugly and badly designed mass-market resorts. Las Palmas
retains an authenticity lacking in many of the ready-mixed resorts, thanks
to its necessarily retaining all the functions of a working capital.
Las Palmas was used by General Franco as his launching post for the 1936
Spanish revolution against the Republican government, which had exiled him
to the islands following suspicion that he had been plotting a coup d'etat.
Local wits say that the Canaries have only committed two errors; the first
was to prevent Nelson winning the battle of Tenerife, the second, allowing
Franco to leave.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (6): Madrid is the common enemy
 -The relaxed and friendly local political scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL life on the Canaries has been relatively quiet since 1936, when
General Franco left his exile on Tenerife to bring about almost 40 years of
dictatorship for Spain.
Naturally, Canarios would see the matter differently, but it is perhaps no
misrepresentation to suggest that the holiday atmosphere which supports the
islands economically has permeated their general atmosphere, which is
relaxed and friendly. The squabbles that do exist are within the traditional
rivalry between Tinerfinos and Canarios; but even they quickly sink their
differences in the face of the common enemy - Madrid.
The peak of the separatist movement on the islands was in the early 1970s,
when Antonio Cubillo led the Movement for Self-determination and
Independence of the Canary Archipelago (MPAIAC), which was implicated in
bomb explosions in 1978. The MPAIAC backed closer relations with Africa,
against being tied to the EC.
Libyan leader Col Muamar Ghadaffi caused local uproar in February 1987 when
he said that 'Spain has absolutely no legal right to the Canaries'; a number
of Libyans were expelled as a result of their alleged support for local
independence activists. But the handful of pro-independence politicians on
the islands today stand in a clear electoral minority.
Elections for all levels of local, regional and national government are to
be held on May 26. For the Canaries, the contest is largely between a
centre-right coalition and the socialists, led by Mr Jeronimo Saavedra, a
54-year-old university professor of law who was president of the first
autonomous Canarian government between 1983-87.
Of far greater political weight than the issue of separatism is the
continuing struggle concerning Las Palmas' pressure to open a second
university - the only one so far is at La Laguna on Tenerife. In April 1989
thousands of Tinerfenos took to the streets to protest against moves to
re-open the issue, responsible for the collapse of a coalition government in
1988.
Mr Saavedra says that any politician hoping for office on the islands 'has
to recognise the self-limitations of the islands. There are 7,000 fragmented
kilometres here, far from the European continent. Moreover, we have a very
strong demographic pressure, since 1980 the highest birth rate in Spain.
There is a scarcity of cheap energy supplies and we don't have basic raw
materials.'
For him, the 'only possibility that we see for the recuperation of the
Canaries' previous high growth rates or to achieve average national growth
rates is the re-launching of public investment in construction of housing.
We have a shortage of more than 10,000 houses in the urban centres. Without
that, the urban centres are not going to be able to reactivate, economically
speaking. If that continues, then the negative growth of 1990 will continue
for several more years.'
As Mr Saavedra sees it, May's battle will be fought firmly and squarely on
economic performance. The public sector is one of the Canaries' largest
employers but wages are depressed. More than 50,000 of the 450,000-strong
workforce, in his estimation, depend on various government offices of the
Canaries for employment.
'There has been an exaggerated inflation of the public sector, particularly
in the last two years and especially in the autonomous government', charges
Mr Saavedra.
A plan to reactivate the tourist sector is a vital necessity, says Mr
Saavedra, 'so that some of the obsolete installations, dating back 20 or 30
years, can be updated and improved.' He dismisses President Lorenzo Olarte's
April announcement of a Pta10bn subsidy for the tourist sector as
'misleading', in that the bulk of the subsidy is to be destined for
improvement to airport facilities.
'In that area, of air transport and infrastructure, the autonomous
government has no jurisdiction. It's a central government responsibility. To
present the reality of the situation in such a disfigured fashion is
habitual in the current government of the Canaries.'
Mr Saavedra takes a tough view of the argument, common on the islands, that
Madrid neither cares for nor thinks of the Canaries and their problems of
distance, isolation and geographical hardship. He points out that the
islands have long enjoyed favourable tax regimes.
'According to the pseudo-nationalists of the islands, who accuse Madrid of
abandoning them and mount a barrage of complaints against Madrid, the
Canaries is the poorest region of Spain. That just is not true. That hides
the fact that the Canaries is precisely in the middle; we have an income per
inhabitant only very slightly less than that of the national average. There
are communities much more worse off than ours', argues Mr Saavedra.
Nor is he worried by the imminent complete adhesion of the Canaries to the
European Community.
'The Canaries are trying to join the community with a series of very
important exceptions in order to avoid greater unemployment and inflation,
particularly in foodstuffs, since as we are going to join a system of
subventions and quotas at an international level that will inevitably mean
heading towards international prices.
'I think the only negative consequence of our becoming full members of the
community could be in our food processing industry, if we don't have - for
another five years at least - a protectionist tariff placed against those
similar goods which come from outside the EC.'
Mr Saavedra believes such protectionism is necessary to shelter small
companies from dominant multinationals. But he wants to see the end of such
minor local protectionisms - their function is 'only to protect those
factories which spring up today and which, without protection will disappear
tomorrow'.

GOMERA: The most important news for Gomera is that it is finally due to have
its own airport. The only one of the seven islands lacking an airport,
Gomera's new landing spot is to be built with Pta3.3bn (Dollars 31.7m)
support from the local government and the European Community. Part of the
stipulation any contractors - and tenders from all EC member countries are
invited - must meet is to complete the work within three years; the
government hopes work will start by July 1992.
Gomera is the second smallest island in the group, with a surface area of
roughly 370 sq km; its coastal perimeter is just 87 km.
A volcanic island, Gomera's 20,000 inhabitants suffer a familiar Canarian
problem - water shortages, hindering all but the most basic agricultural
development. It is connected to the other islands by a ferry system from its
capital, San Sebastian, across 32 km of water to the port of Los Cristianos
in southern Tenerife. Tourists tend to spend brief periods on Gomera,
depending on the ferry shuttle service.
Columbus sailed from Gomera in 1492 on his voyage to the New World; other,
supposedly more sophisticated Canarios say that was the last time anything
happened on the island. The only resort hotel is the Hotel Tecina, which
provides a comfortable spot to launch off into the lush green forest, ideal
for walking holidays.
One of Gomera's many curiosities is a language exclusive to the island, a
whistling language called Silbo and used to communicate across valleys.
HIERRO: The smallest and least populated of the Canaries, its 274 sq km area
being home to just 6,000 people, Hierro is one of the more fertile islands;
production of wine and livestock farming are the main commercial activities.
Tourism is limited, with just one hotel offering four rooms on the quayside
of Las Puntas. Its main town, Valverder, lies inland, the only capital of
the islands not on the coast. Adventurous explorers may spend time searching
out concealed beaches along the southern coast, where strange circular
rock-carvings, known as Los Letreros and thought to be a primitive script,
can also be found.
LA PALMA: Fifth largest in the island group (728 sq km), La Palma has a
population of 72,000 and is 97 km from Tenerife. The greenest of the
Canaries, one of its most famous features is the Caldera de Taburiente, one
of the world's largest volcanic craters stretching 9 km across. La Palma's
volcanoes are still quietly murmuring to themselves; the last major activity
was in 1971 when a new volcano erupted in the side of an older. The new
volcano, Volcan de Teneguia, still smoulders.
The island's main town, Santa Cruz de la Palma, is architecturally
interesting, its houses decked with colourful balconies. La Palma is also
home to one of Europe's most important astronomical observatories, at the
high point known as Roque de los Muchachos.
TENERIFE: More than 600,000 people live on the group's largest island (2,056
sq km). Tenerife has always been the best-known of the Canaries. Many
English and German citizens have so fallen in love with it that they have
taken up permanent residence. Although most of the administrative offices
and functions are now in Las Palmas, Tenerife has managed to cling to the
Canaries' only university. Pressure in Las Palmas to create its own
university caused a political uproar in 1988 and led to the collapse of the
government.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (4): Ports provide that vital
economic lifeline - Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria
face competition from Agadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canary Islands depend on tourism for foreign earnings, but the two major
ports - Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria - are equally
crucial to the economic life of the community, since the vast bulk of all
imported goods arrive by sea. Las Palmas is Spain's busiest port, and is
placed fifth in Europe in terms of traffic handled. Both are free ports and
goods enter without customs dues.
To some extent the autonomous region of Las Canarias, which awkwardly
sub-divides into the two separate provinces of Gran Canaria and Tenerife, is
handicapped by much of its central bureaucracy being handled by the central
state from Madrid. This is particularly true of its ports, which are under
the direct control of Spain's ministry of public works. That ministry
administers via two control boards, one for each province. But it is Madrid
which dictates policy - and handling charges for visiting ships. Central
government supervision of the container, repair and bunkering services means
that although the Canaries' ports are free ports, charges are the same as in
all other Spanish ports.
In spite of that disincentive, fishing fleets from Japan, South Korea and
the Soviet Union have made made both ports their main international bases.
Shops selling an array of duty-free watches, cameras and other luxury goods
commonly display signs in Cyrillic throughout the port area of Las Palmas.
There are well-advanced plans to make the Canary Islands Europe's latest
offshore ship register, certainly before June 1991. Spanish shipowners and
their professional organisation, the Asociacion de Naveiros Espanoles
(Anave) have been lobbying Madrid for some time to permit such a new
register, their complaint being the high cost of operating under the Spanish
flag.
The interest of the Canary Islands' government - which has been promoting
the new register - is obviously related to its attempt to find ways of
continuing the growth in the islands' shipping industry. The ship owners
stand to benefit from the low tax rates of the new register (from zero tax
ratings upwards), and reduced social security contributions.
Spanish seafaring unions initially fiercely opposed the new register idea,
but have since been mollified by an undertaking that the Canary register
will permit the contracting of European crews only.
LAS PALMAS
There are nine principal docking areas, including fishing, commercial
traffic, a naval base and repair docks, stretching for 11,000 m. The dock is
capable of receiving the world's largest ships. Considerable warehouse and
storage space is available: 215,000 sq m open-air and 150,000 cu m of
refrlgerated space, 28,000 sq m of covered and 5,000 sq m of semi-covered
space - all of which are to be expanded by 20 per cent over the next five
years.
The facilities offered by Las Palmas include rapid re-fuelling (between 30
and 1,500 tonnes per hour from more than 350 supply points throughout the
dock) and rapid resupply of fresh drinking water; the port's desalination
plant can pump 500 tonnes per hour from 240 different points, and an
ice-plant produces 200 tonnes daily.
But it is the port's duty-free status, meaning cheaper fuel, together with
its convenient position en route to Europe, Africa and the Americas, which
make it an especially attractive spot for major shipping companies.
While Las Palmas remains healthily profitable, recording a net profit in
1989 of Pta2.230bn - almost double 1988's performance - on a turnover of
Pta4.168bn (up 28 per cent from the 1988 figure of Pta3.249bn), its position
is under threat. Traffic grew by just 1.06 per cent in 1989; passenger trade
fell by almost 25 per cent in the same year. The port employs some 2,500
people, and there are accusations from shipping agents that that figure is
excessive and consequently the port's rates are becoming less competitive.
Moreover, both Las Palmas and Santa Cruz are likely to face strong
competition from the developing port of Agadir in nearby Morocco. Port
officials in the Canaries dispute the idea that Agadir can compete today,
arguing that the quality of service offered locally far outweighs any price
advantage in Morocco. But they are aware that the situation is bound to
change within a very short time.
The local port authority - currently in the hands of officials appointed
directly by the socialist government in Madrid - has managed to obtain
central government support for some Pta19bn to be invested in the next five
years at Las Palmas and the smaller ports on the islands of Fuerteventura
and Lanzarote, improving and extending storage and ferry and cruise
facilities.
SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE
Though smaller than Las Palmas, Santa Cruz remains one of Spain's more
important ports, with 9,000 m of wharves, roll-on-roll-off facilities and
large container areas.
Declared a free port in 1852, Spain's first oil refinery was built in the
port, in 1930. Today, the dock has some 300,000 sq m of open air and 86,000
cu m of refrigerated storage space, 27,000 sq m of semi-covered area and
13,800 sq m of fully covered storage space.
But the most important scheme in the mind of the port's president, Mr Pedro
Meneses, is to expand the port's cruise liner and tourist traffic. He has
hired a marketing company to investigate ways of capturing a bigger share of
the Canaries' passing tourist trade.
Against suggestions that Santa Cruz's relatively high charges prevent the
port increasing its traffic, Mr Meneses says: 'What we are offering is the
equivalent of a five star hotel service, in terms of speed, efficiency and
quality of service. Of course, there are cheaper ports in the region, in
Morocco and other parts of North Africa, but they do not compare in terms of
service.'
Mr Meneses has five ports under his jurisdiction (including that of Santa
Cruz), the five being part of the separate province of Tenerife. His
administration has plans to develop Santa Cruz's infrastructure, which will
cost Pta10bn and will include a new container terminal at Bufadero, covering
about 12 hectares; expansion of the passenger terminal; and improving
traffic flow between the docks and around the harbour area.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (5): Captive market for bananas
 -Growers look to Gonzalez to secure German support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez
meet in Lanzarote next month, their discussions will centre largely on a
matter of some importance to their peoples - bananas. The two leaders may,
for all that is known, loathe bananas, but the citizens of their countries
do not: Germans love to eat them, and Canarios love to sell them.
The Canaries retain a monopoly over the Spanish market, an anomaly granted
them by the European Community but which is due to be phased out by 1996.
Nearly all of the islands' annual banana exports, which amounted to roughly
400,000 tonnes valued at Pta25bn last year, are shipped to Spain. That
captive market is set to be flung open to non-EC producers.
The EC is the world's largest banana market, consuming almost 37 per cent of
the world's 7.9m tonnes exported in 1988, but the 12 member states run three
different import regimes. The German method is the most liberal; the EC's
biggest importer operates an annual quota, which is raised annually in line
with demand and is met almost entirely by the cheaper and larger produce
from the so-called 'dollar area' of Central America.
Under current EC rules, 46 per cent of banana supplies comes from protected
sources, normally possessions or former colonies of EC member states. The
other 54 per cent largely comes from Central America. All EC countries,
except Germany, have a 20 per cent tariff against Central American bananas.
Preferential and duty-free access to the UK market is granted to the
Windward Islands, Jamaica and Belize.
The European Commission has wavered on the issue of its members having
different attitudes to imports, making the Lanzarote meeting of crucial
importance to Canarian banana producers. With their islands about to become
fully integrated with the EC, they expect Mr Gonzalez to secure Chancellor
Kohl's support for an internal EC regime beneficial to the Canaries. For the
Germans, the banana is equally symbolic; exemption from common tariff rules
governing the fruit was a key condition for West Germany's signature of the
the Treaty of Rome.
Last December, when the commission gave the green light for full integration
of the Canaries (at the original behest of the islands' autonomous
parliament), it indirectly raised the question of what will happen to the
Canaries' agriculture, which accounts for 12 out of every 100 jobs. Bananas
and tomatoes represent 70 per cent of agricultural production and 60 per
cent of the total value of exports.
According to Mr Juan Sans, adviser for the EC in the department of
agriculture of the Canaries' government, 'there is enormous pressure being
applied at Brussels by Central American producers of bananas, who are
basically in the hands of three or four large oligopolies.
'They want to see completely free and unhindered entry to the EC market,
because they can produce more cheaply thanks to lower wages and better
climatic conditions.
'Such free entry for their produce would, purely and simply, mean the
disappearance of the Canaries and other producers. That would be a
catastrophe, not just for the workers on the islands but for the shipping
fleets and so forth', he says.
A number of 'non-papers' are currently under consideration in Brussels.
Spain has not yet officially defined its position, though this may alter
after the Lanzarote meeting. But canny Canarios are already willing to bet
that Germans will soon have to start paying more for their bananas, which
are likely to come from Tenerife rather than Tegucigalpa.
However, full EC integration, implying adhesion to the Common Agricultural
Policy, would also mean that other important local crops - such as tomatoes,
peppers, cucumbers and pineapples - would gain unrestricted access to the EC
market.
Furthermore, the islands are likely to benefit from an EC programme of
assistance worth some Pta3.7bn over three years, aimed at reducing Canarian
agriculture's dependence on bananas.
In any event, the deal currently being worked out in Brussels would
guarantee the Canaries their captive banana market in Spain until 1996.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (3): Pressures of integration -
Canarios are wary of full EC membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Spain joined the European Community in 1986, the Canaries specifically
excluded themselves from some of the community's more important agreements,
including the common policies on agriculture, fishing, value added tax and
customs relations - exclusions designed to protect and preserve the islands'
free-trade status. If local sentiment were asked to consider which it
distrusts more, Madrid or Brussels, it would have a tough time deciding.
But last December, the autonomous parliament approved legislation calling
for full membership of the EC; the issue is now being being debated in
Brussels and is a subject of considerable lobbying, report-writing and
discussion.
The European Commission has drafted a set of proposals which will allow the
Canaries a 10-year transition period into full membership.
In spite of the apparently successful three-way negotiations between the
commission, Madrid and the Canarian autonomous government, some local
businessmen have called for a referendum on the issue, which could - if ever
staged and if it secured an anti-Euro majority - scotch the whole process.
But as it has been almost a year since the first such calls were made,
without any real sign of such a vote happening, the chances of the Canaries
not becoming fully integrated into the EC are slim.
The changes which are likely to follow and which are likely to cost Madrid
some Pta40bn (Dollars 38.46m) - less than half of what the Canaries'
autonomous government has requested - as compensation for the supposedly
deleterious effects they will have on the islands' economy include:
free access for Canarian agricultural produce to the EC market, but
controlled imports of EC origin;
partial membership only of the customs union, with a 10-year staged
integration with the common tariffs;
special tariff norms for imports of products and goods defined as being of
either basic or special necessity (including those from developing
countries);
transport subsidies.
The proposal to tie the islands into a closer relation with the EC caused a
political furore in early 1989, as a tax revolt on the islands proved a
source of deep political embarrassment for Madrid during its first six-month
stint in the EC presidency.
The revolt centred on the Canaries' local town councils (Cabildos) refusal
to support a 15 per cent reduction in import tariffs in line with the
reductions on the Spanish mainland, as required of Spain following its
admission to the EC on January 1 1986.
Although the Canaries were exempt from many of the Treaty of Rome's
requirements, they were nevertheless obliged to reduce import tariffs in
order to meet EC regulations.
Nor was the islands' autonomous government, under President Lorenzo Olarte
of the Centro Democratico y Social (CDS) party, prepared to back down and
see the tariffs - on which the Cabildos depended for about 60 per cent of
their income - substantially cut, causing an estimated Pta11bn loss of local
government income in 1988.
Canarios were already wary of the impact of full EC membership; local
independent studies conducted in 1987 put the potential loss following from
full EC membership at anything between Pta73.5bn and Pta100.8bn.
The fiscal fight between the Canaries and Madrid has eased, but it has given
way to complex discussions on reform of the islands' special economic and
fiscal status, the so-called Regimen Economico y Fiscal (REF). These debates
are still proceeding and their outcome will determine the future economic
course of the islands.
One of the most important proposed changes is the creation of a Canarian
General Indirect Tax (Impuesto General Indirecto Canario), similar to the
EC's VAT structures, but which would operate at a lower rate and at zero for
a number of items affecting small businesses and consumers of basic food and
other necessities.
The Canaries' accession to full EC membership will be accompanied by an
EC-directed economic support programme, the 'Programa de Opciones
Especificas de la Lejania e Insularidad de las Islas Canarias', or POSEICAN,
which is designed to take account of the islands' distance and isolation
from the rest of the community.
Despite the fears of many Canarios that full EC membership would lead to the
end of many of their special tax privileges, the end of their successful
banana export programme to a captive Spanish market and a subjugation to
Madrid's dictates over local fiscal authority, it is now clear that by June
 -when the European Commission is likely to pronounce on the precise terms
of the islands' new status within the EC  - a suitable compromise will have
been reached. The islands' special tax regime will be suitably re-worded and
subtly tinkered with, and yet another crack in the supposedly 'common'
market will have been papered over.
As a sweetener to ease the growing pains, the director-general of economy
and planning in the Canaries' government, Mr Jose Cristobal, announced on
April 10 that up until 1993 the islands will receive a total of Pta268.796bn
from EC support grants - enough, perhaps, to sugar even the bitterest pill.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (2): Tourist slump leaves
economy exposed - Most investment has gone into services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STREETS of Las Palmas, with their bustling traffic, cramped pavements
and lackadaisical atmosphere remind one of any one of a dozen different
Latin American capitals. Unfortunately for Los Canarios, the island's 1.7m
inhabitants, the economy, in spite of the success of tourism in the 1980s,
is beginning to bear remarkable similarities to some of Latin America's
weaker nations.
While the Canaries are far from falling prey to the Argentine or Brazilian
plague of hyperinflation, the islands have become too dependent on a series
of succeeding monocultures - the latest being tourism - as the prime source
of income. Few Canarios today are likely to follow the hundreds of thousands
of their predecessors who, in the 1950s emigrated to Caracas, Buenos Aires
and Havana. But a growing number of them face a distinctly uncertain
economic future.
Mr Cayetano Gonzalez, president of the Export Club of the Canaries, says:
'If the government does not do something to improve the social and economic
situation then, without exaggerating, I think we might be in danger of a
'Carazco' here in two or three years from now.' By a 'Carazco', he means
social upheaval along the lines of that which occurred in the Venezuelan
capital Caracas in February 1988, when several hundred people died during
food riots and mass looting.
A familiar cry from Canarios is that their economy is faced with three
central disadvantages: the distance from mainland Europe; the small and
fragmented nature of the community, split as it is between seven islands;
and the isolated, limited extent of their natural resources.
While all those are true, the situation has been exacerbated by what can
only be called a 'get rich quick' mentality of many of the islands' business
community, which has seen tourism as a cheap and easy way to quickly recover
investments with large profits.
What investment there has been has largely poured into services, at the cost
of long-term planning elsewhere. Now that tourist figures have stabilised at
between 5m and 6m visitors a year, the economy finds itself over-rich in
ugly hotels and under-nourished elsewhere.
The problem is that of recession, which has damaged all Spain. But because
the Canaries have almost nothing to fall back on after a slump in tourism,
the islands are more exposed and have less chance of swift recovery. Tourism
accounts for more than 70 per cent of the gross domestic product of the
islands, the other 30 per cent divided between industry, the ports,
agriculture and construction (whose fortunes are in turn closely linked to
tourism). One of the main planks in the opposition socialist party's
(PSC-PSOE) campaign for elections on May 26 is a programme of public works
construction, in order to soak up the many unemployed building workers.
The islands' industrial sector is very weak, being limited solely to
manufacture for local consumption. The high cost of freight and the lack of
any basic raw materials mean that prospects for developing any export-led
industry are dim.
Inflation during 1990 reached 5.5 per cent, compared with 7.7 per cent in
1989. Overall growth for 1990 is estimated at 2.2 per cent (compared with
mainland Spain's estimated 4.4 per cent) and projected at less than 1 per
cent or perhaps negative for 1991 and 1992.
Perhaps strangely, UK exports to the islands have not been affected by the
local recession.
In 1985 UK exports stood at Pounds 45m (Dollars 79.65m) but that figure has
more than doubled; the January-June 1990 figures alone were Pounds 53.8m
(Dollars 95.22m), a 13 per cent growth over the same period for the previous
year. Only Germany has a greater value of trade with the islands.
The impact of recession is mostly clearly be seen in the growth of
unemployment and social deprivation, an aspect of the Canaries which few of
the sun-seekers ever have cause to witness.
An officially-sponsored report published at the beginning of April (Estudio
sobre la Pobreza en Canarias) reported that 24.83 per cent of islanders -
some 98,000 people - live in poverty (defined as monthly income of Pta29,000
(Dollars 278) or less.
Within that group, a further 7.46 per cent - some 29,000 people - live in
extreme poverty, with monthly income of Pta15,000 (Dollars 144.23) or less.
The European Community average for the first, broader category, is 14 per
cent.
Unemployment, hovering at the 21 per cent mark, is almost 5 per cent higher
than the Spanish national average.
While this is unlikely to spark Venezuelan-style social upheavals, it may
help President Felipe Gonzalez's local representatives to score well against
the centrist alliance in the upcoming May 26 elections.
There hangs a cloud of uncertainty over the islands' business community,
which faces a decade of gradual easing into full adhesion to the European
Community. The Canaries opted to stand aside from many of the EC's
regulations when Spain joined in 1986. That has been yet another mixed
blessing for the islands; the Canaries' relations with Brussels are the
subject of another article in this survey.

FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (1): EC anomalies on the agenda
 -With some 7m visitors each year, tourism remains the dominant industry for
the islands. But relations with the European Community and the effect on the
Canaries' free-trade status will increasingly determine economic prospects
</HEADLINE>

THE STREETS of Las Palmas, the capital of Gran Canaria, are more reminiscent
of Latin America than mainland Spain. Canarios - the inhabitants of the
seven islands which make up the archipelago - speak a Spanish which might
raise a sneer in Madrid, but would be perfectly acceptable in Mexico City.
Indeed, throughout this century thousands of Canarios have left their
homeland in waves, headed not for the bright lights of Barcelona but to make
new lives in Havana, Caracas, and Buenos Aires. Under the Franco regime in
the 1950s, at least 150,000 Canarios, with the rallying slogan 'Justice +
Work = Venezuela', left for good.
To the casual observer the shops of Tenerife and Las Palmas, crammed full of
duty-free electronic goods, cigarettes and spirits, are pure Montevideo, if
slightly more up-market. But the Canary Islands are part of Spanish national
territory (although geographically closer to North Africa), not Latin
America.
More significantly, the Canaries are now by definition part of the European
Community, following Spain's accession to the community on January 1 1986.
Yet in certain respects - particularly concerning agriculture and taxation
laws - the status of the islands' EC membership may still be tactfully
described as irregular.
The Canaries have managed to avoid being drawn into the Common Agricultural
Policy and retain the distinct advantage for tourist and resident alike of
extremely liberal tax laws and duty-free import regulations. The most
important political issue for the islands is their future relationship with
the EC, since that will largely determine economic prospects.
These anomalies are more or less permanently on the EC's agenda, though
Canarios look to Madrid to protect their privileges against the
encroachments of Brussels. One of Tenerife's more touching roadside
hoardings depicts a tail-drooped hound dismally standing in the middle of a
road. The dog is supposedly saying 'I wouldn't leave you - don't forsake
me'. While Canarios and Tenerfinos (islanders from Tenerife) are justifiably
proud of their history and can be fiercely defensive of their autonomous
status within the Spanish constitution, they are in the end supplicants at
the Madrid court, hoping not to be forsaken by their much more Euro-minded
mainland cousins.
The Canaries, though geographically linked and constitutionally unified, are
in fact two groups of islands which, over centuries, have conducted a battle
 -as yet finally unresolved - for political ascendancy. Under the 1978
constitution, the Canaries form one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions, with
an elected government responsible for local affairs. But in 1927 the rivalry
between the two major ports - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de
Tenerife - created a split into two provinces, which remains the case today.
The rivalry is either a matter of deep cultural difference or petty economic
squabbling, depending on one's proximity to the quarrel.
Nevertheless, it is taken seriously on the islands, where there still exist
authoritative voices calling for a complete partition of the islands into
two autonomous regions, one centred on Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the other on
Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.
To an outsider the causes and nature of the disputes between the two sets of
islands can seem esoterically remote; but anyone wishing to do business
there should beware of the prickly partisanship of Canarios versus
Tenerfinos, and everyone against the butt of most local jokes, the Gomera).
The western province comprises the islands of Tenerife, with the capital
Santa Cruz de Tenerife; Gomera, La Palma and Hierro. The islands of
Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria form the eastern province, with
Las Palmas de Gran Canaria as the capital city and, at its heart, Puerto de
la Luz, the largest port in Europe.
Plutarch wrote of the Canaries that they 'enjoy a fortunate climate in
consequence of the barely perceptible change of the seasons'. The name
stuck, and for centuries they were known as the Fortunate Islands. But the
irony is that the Canaries' climate is both a benefit and a curse, since the
sun so beloved by millions of pale northerners is accompanied by serious
water shortages, particularly on the eastern islands of Lanzarote and
Fuerteventura.
Paradoxically, the Canaries may be said to be fortunate to have survived and
developed as successfully as they have. They flourish thanks to a knack for
generating a series of economic monocultures to meet contemporary demands.
The latest such monoculture is tourism, so that in spite of years of net
population loss through emigration, the Canaries thrive on a regular influx
of British, Scandinavian and German tourists, many of whom eventually put
down roots. Around 7m tourists visit the islands each year and have
displaced tomatoes and bananas as the Canaries' best source of foreign
earnings.
In the early 19th century Admiral Horatio Nelson was one of the first
British visitors to pay a business call to Tenerife, where he attempted to
capture a Spanish bullion ship, losing an arm in the process.
While today's tourists are not likely to suffer such extreme consequences of
a foreign adventure, doing business on the Canaries might still cost the
unwary an arm and a leg, metaphorically speaking - not because Canarios are
any more voracious than other communities, but simply because the islands
are still in a process of considerable political and economic flux.
The last FT Survey of the Canaries was in 1972. Since then, Franco has
departed, democracy has returned to Spain and the country has joined the EC.
For the Canaries the intervening 19 years have, economically speaking, been
dominated by one phenomena - the vast and rapid expansion of the tourist
industry. Out of the barren and arid islands of some of the archipelago have
been created vast hotel and entertainment complexes for the package
holidaymaker interested in an annual burst of sunshine without straining
either pocket or curiosity.
But that industry is now facing a crisis of some magnitude. Of the many
issues facing policy-makers on the islands, that of tourism and how best to
promote it is uppermost in everyone's mind.
Certain islands, such as Lanzarote, have been the subject of what might be
called construction barrages, intense campaigns to build fast and furious
for the mass tourist market.
Others, such as Hierro or Gomera, are virtually unexplored and certainly
unexploited tourist markets, offering spectacular natural flora and fauna
for a more upmarket tourist whose idea of a holiday is more than two weeks
by a hotel poolside. Tapping those additional resources must be one of the
ways forward for both the islands and potential future investors.

Correction (published 19th April 1991) appended to this article.
SHARES IN Hardanger Property, the Kidderminster-based property company, were
suspended at 65p while the company sought the support of its bankers.
'Following delays which have occurred in a number of property disposals, and
in particular one relatively large project, the company's level of
borrowings has remained uncomfortably high,' it said.
At the September year-end it had borrowings of Pounds 72.1m, compared with
assets of Pounds 19.8m. Interest costs in its last financial year were
Pounds 8.1m, compared with rental income of Pounds 2.5m.
Hardanger has been unable to make sufficient property sales to finance its
income deficit because turnover in the property market has virtually ground
to a halt in recent months.
The company said that it was vigorously pursuing a programme of disposals
and that a further announcement would be made, possibly this week.
The large project alluded to in the announcement was a department store in
Plymouth, which the company acquired in January in a property exchange with
Legal &amp; General. The company's main bank is Barclays.
Correction (published 19th April 1991).
Borrowings of Hardanger Properties at the end of September totalled Pounds
72m, compared with the group's gross assets of Pounds 134m. The asset figure
was incorrectly stated in Thursday's paper.

FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: GPA warns on growth prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation (GPA), the world's largest aircraft leasing company,
warned yesterday that it would show a modest growth in profits compared with
the previous year, despite a 66 per cent rise in lease revenues.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's president, said the company's rate of profits growth
had slowed significantly. 'Unless there is a remarkable last quarter, our
profit this year will be relatively modest,' he added.
He also said it was unlikely, although not impossible, that the company
would be floated on the stock market this year. Mr Foley suggested that a
flotation was more probable next year.
Although the company will not release its results for the latest 12 months
until June, it decided to announce its aircraft lease revenue figures for
the year ended March 31, 1991 in an effort to bolster confidence in its
business prospects.
Mr James King, head of the company's aircraft leasing division, conceded
that the past year had been particularly difficult for the airline industry.
The sector is estimated to have lost about Dollars 4bn in the past six
months because of the combination of the Gulf crisis, higher fuel prices and
the general economic slowdown.
But he argued that some City forecasts were excessively pessimistic. Mr Tony
Ryan, GPA's chairman, also added: 'There has been an over-reaction to the
short-term factors which have adversely affected many airlines in recent
months. As a result, some commentators' perceptions of the future prospects
of the civil aviation sector have been unduly gloomy.'
Contracted lease revenues rose 66 per cent to Dollars 8.3bn from Dollars
5bn. GPA said it sold or leased 176 aircraft to its airline customers, a 17
per cent increase over the year before. It also sold a further 40 aircraft
to investors on whose behalf it continues to manage the related aircraft
leases.
At the end of the latest financial year, the company owned or leased-in 306
aircraft compared with 240 during the previous 12 months. GPA took delivery
of 82 new aircraft in the last year, all of which it said had been placed
with customers.
After-tax profits of the Shannon-based group showed a 9 per cent rise to
Dollars 196m for the nine months to December 31 against the previous year.

FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Hafnia tumbles to DKr1.39bn
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING security values last year sent Hafnia Holding, which heads the big
Danish insurance and financial services sector, into a loss of DKr1.39bn
(Dollars 217m) compared with profits of DKr1.52bn in 1989.
Mr Per Villum Hansen, chief executive, said that by the middle of this month
most of last year's unrealised losses on securities had been recouped as the
markets recovered.
'We are fairly optimistic because Hafnia's underlying business continues to
make good progress,' he said.
As from 1989, gains and losses on securities must be taken in the profit and
loss account, not the balance sheet, which has contributed to see-sawing
profit and loss figures in the Danish insurance groups.
Hafnia's current battle to gain control of its domestic rival Baltica also
contributed to the profits turnround. The group acquired 33.7 per cent in
Baltica Holding and 12 per cent in Baltica Insurance during the year-long
battle. The cost of financing this DKr4.53bn investment was the principal
factor in an increase of DKr350m in financial costs.
The losses on securities reduced equity capital to DKr5.3bn from DKr6.3bn at
the end of 1989. Earnings per share slumped from DKr162 to a negative DKr154
and book value per share from DKr663 to DKr476.
Premium income in the insurance business increased from DKr5.70bn to
DKr6.98bn, reflecting primarily the acquisition of the UK's Prolific Group
and Denmark's Forenede Assurandorer in the autumn of 1989.
In a statement to the stock exchange the group said the results in the
current year will depend to a large extent on developments in the bond and
share markets and it was therefore too soon to make a forecast, but group
profits on ordinary business activities are expected to exceed the 1990
figure.
An unchanged DKr10 per share dividend was proposed.

FT  18 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Volatile trading in NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE performance of NatWest Bank confounded the market. The stock eased back
for much of the session, then dipped sharply after bad news from its US
subsidiary, before staging an about-turn late in the session.
Dealers took a bearish tack at the outset, marking the stock down to around
327p, amid worries that first quarter figures from NatWest Bancorp, the US
arm, would be below the Dollars 75m-Dollars 150m loss range forecast by City
analysts. Also acting as a drag was a bearish appraisal of the banking
sector, especially NatWest, published by the bank's own securities arm,
County NatWest.
County said the sector was 10-15 per cent overvalued. It seemed unlikely
that the UK banks would be able to fund their own requirements and that
deterioration in balance-sheet ratios might prompt fears of rights issues,
which would in turn damage share performance
First-quarter figures from Bancorp came out at a loss of Dollars 191m and
when NatWest shares dropped to 323p, heavy buying from institutions reversed
the trend and left the stock a net 4 higher at 335p. Turnover reached 3.4m.
Dilution worries
Short-term factors continued to unsettle Smiths Industries, the first being
renewed concern about the extra research and development costs involved in
the Dollars 700m contract awarded last week by Boeing. The development of
new systems for the US manufacturer's B777 aircraft could amount to Pounds
10m a year, say analysts, and may hold back profits in the next three years
until revenue flow begins.
Another worry was the prospect of further short-term dilution if the group
used its cash pile of some Pounds 120m on an acquisition. The group tends to
follow a policy of longer-term expansion and, in the near term, profit
margins could come under pressure. The shares moved against the market,
falling to 270p before ending 4 down on balance at 272p.
Glaxo recommended
Glaxo led pharmaceuticals higher as Kleinwort Benson said the shares were
oversold, while a presentation in the health and household sector at S. G.
Warburg attracted attention to the whole sector.
The shares have been hit in recent days by the prospect of a law suit
challenging one of the patents on Glaxo's Zantac, the world's best-selling
drug. Mr Ian White at Kleinwort said this presented a short-term buying
opportunity and the shares rose 15 to 1100p.
Glaxo had also been affected by switching from SmithKline Beecham, which
continued to benefit from presentations to analysts on Monday in London and
on Friday in New York. Traders said there was still an overhang of buying
from the US encouraged by the recently strong dollar. In a shortage of
stock, SmithKline was squeezed 13 to 831p.
The good sentiment spilt over into Fisons, 11 1/2 better at 481p, and
Reckitt and Colman, which closed 32 to the good at 1547p as traders spoke of
a shortage of stock.
Kleinwort Benson was involved in the oil sector, re-affirming their strong
buy stance on British Gas and also issuing a detailed buy note on Ultramar.
Kleinwort said British Gas shares already discounted even the most severe
adjustment to the gas pricing formula from the industry watchdog, Ofgas.
'Unless it's a real hammer blow the shares will go up,' said Mr Philip
Lambert at Kleinwort. Gas settled 5 1/2 firmer at 357p on 5.7m. Ultramar
added 7 at 330p.
Racal Telecom advanced strongly, boosted primarily by a buy note from UBS
Philips &amp; Drew, but also by revived speculation that a bid could be imminent
for Racal Electronics before the latter's demerger of Telecom, expected this
summer.
Talk of a bid from Cable &amp; Wireless, on its own or in conjunction with
Mannesman and Hutchison Whampoa, has been in the market for some time. UBS
said Racal Telecom was its only buy recommendation in UK telecoms,
describing it as the premier play on long term growth in mobile telecoms.
Telecom closed 12 up at 393p and Electronics 8 1/2 higher at 241 1/2 p.
GEC, restrained by yet more profits downgrades - Smith New Court was the
latest - could only manage a 3 gain to 205p. Booker rose 11 to 480p after it
surprised the market by announcing that it had sold two subsidiaries,
Holland &amp; Barrett and Kingswood, to Lloyds Chemists for Pounds 55m. Analysts
said the deal would reduce Booker's gearing by 20 points to 85 per cent. Mr
Carl Short of Nomura increased his next year's Booker forecast by Pounds 1m
to Pounds 114m, welcoming the news as 'a good deal for Booker'. Lloyds rose
3 to 278p on the announcement, but a Pounds 71.1m rights issue prevented a
larger advance.
Food specialists said Booker may announce a further small disposal this
morning to Albert Fisher. Fisher eased a penny to 120p ahead of its interim
results today. Profits of Pounds 44m against Pounds 19.9m last time are
expected.
First-quarter new business figures from Legal &amp; General were described as
disappointing by the market and the shares, additionally unsettled by a UBS
Philips &amp; Drew review of the life sector, fell 6 to 459p.
Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) added 6 at 236p in response to the
publication of the prospectus for the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers
(MGN). MCC and MGN are both controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell.
A newspaper report revived talk that MB-Caradon, the building products and
printing group, was on the verge of selling its 25 per cent stake in CMB
Packaging. Mr Richard Rae at Hoare Govett said that the talked-of price of
Pounds 300m was in line with expectations and would give Caradon Pounds 100m
net cash. Caradon gained 12 to 234p.
Bid speculation took hold in Caird, the waste management company, and the
shares rose 7 more to 72p. Severn Trent Water is a major shareholder after
allowing its offer to lapse last December and must agree terms with Caird
before it can return within the statutory 12 months required by Takeover
Panel rules. Several main board directors of Caird announced further share
purchases on Tuesday.
Specialist engineer EIS Group rose to a 1991 high of 330p, up 8 1/2 , on the
good results and a positive statement which outweighed the call for fresh
funds of Pounds 18.3m. A sixfold increase in annual profits and an
encouraging view on current trading lifted Copymore 7 to 40p.
BAA added 16 to 444p following comments by Sir Norman Payne, the chairman,
that airline passenger traffic is almost back to pre-Gulf war levels. A B
Ports was up a penny at 267p despite late news the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is to investigate cross-Solent ferry services. A B Ports'
subsidiary, Red Funnel, has a 20 per cent share in the market.
USM-quoted Radio City jumped 42 to 301p, after peaking at 318p, as it
revealed it was in talks that might lead to a bid. Traders suggested the
buyer was unlikely to be another radio company, given that the sector's
advertising revenue has been hard hit by the recession.
Two quoted holiday tour operators continued to be squeezed higher in
response to reports of record levels of bookings. Airtours rose 14 to 402p
and Owners Abroad firmed 6 to 92p.
Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, bounced 8 to 123p
as investors scented increased business from the acquisition of fellow fund
group Argosy Asset Management. The latter had been facing uncertainty since
it lost management of the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund last month.
Support of investment trust Berry Starquest also increased. Dealers became
wary, having seen buying recently from brokers not normally associated with
investment in the sector, and speculation arose of Berry perhaps reporting
some other development with the annual results, due tomorrow. The shares
rose 5 to 141p.

FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Investor demand pushes Dow to
record close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE DOW Jones Industrial Average closed above 3,000 for the first time in
its history yesterday, propelled by demand from investors looking forward to
an economic recovery this summer, and buoyed by some positive corporate
results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 17.58 at 3,004.46. The broader- based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 also rose to a new high, up 2.84 at 390.46. The Nasdaq composite
of over-the- counter stocks climbed 4.56 to 511.31, another record.
Turnover on the New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 248m shares, boosted
by computer program trading and strong institutional demand. Advancing
shares outpaced declining shares by almost two to one.
After opening slightly weaker the Dow spent the day moving back and forth
either side of 3,000 before late afternoon demand helped the index to its
record. Analysts have been expecting the Dow to set a record soon. After the
53-point gain on Tuesday yesterday was seen as the most likely day for a new
closing high for the blue-chip index.
Although the current reporting season has so far been a mixture of good and
bad, the market has risen on the belief that the recession is nearly over.
The fact that the Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates recently, while
initially disappointing, is now being interpreted as a sign that the Fed is
confident the economy can rebound from its trough without the need for lower
interest rates.
Among individual issues AT&amp;T rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 on turnover of
2.4m shares after the telecommunications group unveiled earnings of 65 cents
a share in the first quarter, up from 62 cents a share a year earlier. AT&amp;T
also said it was not ready to raise its bid for NCR, the computer group
which has resisted AT&amp;T's unwanted Dollars 110 a share bid. Yesterday NCR
shares were down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 97 7/8 .
United Technologies slumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 on turnover of
3m shares after the defence group reported, late on Tuesday, a fall in first
quarter income from Dollars 1.01 a year ago to 25 cents this year.
Philip Morris, one of the market's biggest stocks, eased Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 70 1/4 after the tobacco and foods group met market expectations
with net earnings of Dollars 942m in the first quarter. AMR, the parent
group of American Air lines, rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 in spite
of announcing a loss of Dollars 195.6m for the first three months of this
year.
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the troubled publishing and insurance group, fell
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars  13/16 after General Cinema, the cinema and
retailing company, said talks with Harcourt bondholders had broken down,
threatening the merger agreement between the two companies. General Cinema
shares slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO prices drifted higher in moderate trading before a late pullback
took away half of the day's gains. The composite index ended the day up 6.20
at 3545.93. Volume of 28.25m shares was above the previous day's 22.56m and
value jumped to CDollars 367.0m (CDollars 234.9m). Advancing issues were
ahead of losers by 308 to 248.
Mining issues surged 2.01 per cent on index, as nine of the 14 industry
sub-groups moved ahead. Industrial products were up 0.90 per cent on index.
Financial services, energy and golds ended steady while consumer products
finished slightly lower.

FT  18 APR 91 / Government Bonds: US long bond prices rally as freight rail
strike bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPECTATION that the nationwide freight rail strike which started
yesterday might slow the pace of economic activity lifted government bond
prices at the long end during the day.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up  3/32 at 97 3/8
to yield 8.102 per cent. The two-year note, however, was unchanged at 100
7/16 , yielding 6.862 per cent. Trading was said to be quiet.
In the absence of a move on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the
bond market looked elsewhere for a lead and found it in the rail strike.
Estimates suggest that the 235,000 railworkers' industrial action could stop
the flow of one third of US goods in the country, making as many as half a
million non-rail workers temporarily out of work. Bad news for the economy
is traditionally good news for long bond prices.
The market was also helped by a report that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, had said at a conference yesterday that while the recovery was
under way, there was more economic weakness ahead. He was also reported to
have said that US inflation was under control, and his remarks were seen by
the market as a hint that further interest rate cuts might be in the
pipeline.
EUROPEAN bond markets were lifted by the rally in the US market towards the
end of the session, but activity was limited, according to dealers.
The yield spread between French and German government bonds reached another
historic low of 48 basis points. Some investors are now taking profits on
that spread trade, unwinding positions taken at the turn of the year when
the spread was around 100 basis points.
However, others are keeping the trade in place in the expectation of further
tightening. Mr Alex Mitcheson-Smith, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
expects French and German inflation rates to cross over this summer, and
government bond yields to cross in the third quarter.
Volume in the German market was low yesterday, but prices were lifted by the
rally in the US. Dealers said that there are some short positions in the
market, which could prompt something of a short-covering rally in the next
few days.
The Bund futures contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange ended at 85.80, up from 85.46.
Trading in the gilts market was confined to a narrow price range in low
volume yesterday. The market failed to react to data showing a Dollars 3.1bn
borrowing requirement in March, in line with expectations.
The Bank of England's Pounds 1.2bn tranche of 10 per cent gilts due 1996, to
be auctioned next week, is trading on a when-issued basis at 48 7/8 (the
stock is partly paid), in line with the outstanding issue.

DEPRESSED markets for pulp, paper and wood products brought an 87 per cent
drop in MacMillan Bloedel's first-quarter earnings and the company sees
little hope of improvement later in the year, writes Robert Gibbens.
Net profit was CDollars 3.8m (USDollars 3.27m), compared with CDollars 30m
or 26 cents a common share in the first quarter of 1990 when the recession
was biting into forest products companies' earnings. Sales were CDollars
678m, against CDollars 781m.
After preferred dividends, there were no earnings attributable to the common
shares in the latest quarter.
Newsprint markets were weak and a price increase posted on January 1 failed
to hold.

<TEXT>
SMITH Corona, the US typewriter manufacturer 48 per cent-owned by Hanson
group of the UK, yesterday reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings
for the three months to end-March.
The company made Dollars 3.8m after tax, compared with Dollars 6.1m in the
same period a year ago.
This leaves net income for the first nine months of the financial year
virtually halved at Dollars 17.3m from Dollars 34.4m. The company's shares
eased by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 10 1/4 .
The group, which has been badly hit over the past 18 months by falling
demand and strong pricing pressures, suggested it was pleased. 'The weak
consumer spending environment as well as the ongoing product mix shift
favouring lower-priced models continues to affect sales and earnings,' said
Mr Lee Thompson, chairman.
At the operating profit level, Smith Corona reported Dollars 5.2m against
Dollars 11.1m, while sales slipped from Dollars 110.6m to Dollars 80.9m.

<TEXT>
HIGHER nickel prices raised operating earnings from primary metals at Inco
of Canada, the largest nickel company in the world, to USDollars 136m in the
first quarter from USDollars 110m a year earlier.
But overall net profit dipped 21 per cent to USDollars 53.6m or 50 cents a
share from USDollars 67.7m or 64 cents a year earlier because of lower
results from the alloys and engineered products business, currency
adjustments and higher taxes.
Revenues were USDollars 845m, against USDollars 735m.
Realised nickel prices averaged USDollars 3.94 a lb in the first quarter, up
from USDollars 3.69 a year earlier and USDollars 4.31 in the fourth quarter
of 1990. Copper prices were stable. Finished nickel inventory at March 31
was 54m lbs, down from 56m lbs at December 31 1990.
First-quarter nickel deliveries were 136m lbs against 123m lbs a year
earlier. Copper, platinum,silver and gold deliveries were all up
significantly, but cobalt declined.
Inco said the market value of 62 per cent-owned Consolidated TVX Mining was
almost USDollars 270m as of March 31, based on its gold mines in Quebec,
Brazil and Chile.

THE campaign of Mr Robert Monks, an investor activist, to win a contested
seat on the board of Sears, Roebuck, the largest US retailer, was boosted
yesterday. The California Public Employees Retirement Systems (Calpers), a
large pension fund holding 2.3m shares in Sears, Roebuck, said it would cast
its votes for Mr Monks.
He has been fighting for a seat on the Sears, Roebuck board because he
claims the company, which has been struggling financially, has earned an
inadequate return on shareholders' equity. Last year, Sears Roebuck's return
on equity was only about 7 per cent.

Polaroid
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLUMP in sales of instant film contributed to a near-halving in Polaroid's
first-quarter earnings.
Net income slid to Dollars 16.4m (13 cents a share) from Dollars 31.8m (43
cents) a year earlier. Net sales rose fractionally to Dollars 441.2m, with a
10 per cent rise in international shipments being largely offset by weak
demand in the US. Operating profits, which fell by 24 per cent, were also
hit by higher marketing expenses.
The recession, as well as the slump in tourism earlier this year,
contributed to the fall-off in film sales. Polaroid said that retailers were
keeping low inventories.
On the other hand, there was a substantial - though unspecified - rise in
shipments of cameras, conventional film and videotape. The popularity of
cameras was helped by an aggressive campaign to promote the company's
One-Stop Flash cameras, which sell for under Dollars 30 apiece. The company
expects higher camera sales will eventually be followed by stronger orders
for instant film.
Polaroid cut its long-term debt by 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars
504.2m, and interest expense fell to Dollars 15.8m from Dollars 21.5m.

<TEXT>
GTE, which operates the largest non-Bell telephone system in the US,
yesterday revealed a sharp fall in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 200m,
compared with Dollars 407m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per
cent share slipped from 46 cents to 22 cents, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
However, the market was already aware GTE would take a one-time charge,
resulting from its merger with Contel, and had expected the bottom-line
reduction.
GTE said that, exclusive of the Dollars 245m one-off charge and a
compensatory gain on the transfer of minority interests in certain cellular
properties, net income worked out at Dollars 404m, or 45 cents a share.
This, it said, represented a 7 per cent rise on the first quarter of 1990 -
once the previous year's results were adjusted. First-quarter sales totalled
Dollars 5.22bn, with Dollars 3.79bn coming from the telephone operations.

POLICYHOLDERS at First Executive, the ailing Los Angeles-based life insurer
whose two main operating units have been seized by the insurance regulators,
yesterday filed a suit in the Manhattan courts, writes Nikki Tait. It
alleges fraudulent activity, accuses First Executive's management of
misleading policyholders, and claims that they did not disclose the
speculative nature of the group's investments in 'junk bonds'.
First Executive had an abnormally high proportion of its portfolio in junk,
and much of troubles stem from this.
A similar class action was filed in the Los Angeles courts last week.

<TEXT>
THE Canadian forest products industry is reporting continued losses for the
first quarter and warns that little relief is likely until well into 1992.
Canadian Pacific Forest Products, a fully integrated group and one of North
America's biggest newsprint producers, reported a first-quarter loss of
CDollars 50.1m (USDollars 43.1m), or CDollars 1.14 a share, against a profit
of CDollars 4.8m or 11 cents a year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 526m
from CDollars 623m.
The company cited low market pulp prices, now down about USDollars 200 per
ton from the recent peak, and also poor newsprint prices. Tonnage volumes
were also sharply lower.
CPFP is reviewing all its operations and will keep only those businesses
where it has 'competitive strength'.
But it is completing a CDollars 350m modernisation at Thunder Bay in Ontario
and will invest a further CDollars 210m for a new pulping unit and paper
machine modernisation at Gatineau in Quebec.

Mr Heikki Parnanen, a CAFFI vice-president, blamed the poor result of the

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET PROFITS at Internatio-Mueller, the diversified Dutch transport, trading
and engineering group, plummeted to Fl 2.6m (Dollars 1.38m) in 1990 from Fl
56.1m in 1989, reflecting setbacks in Australia, New Zealand and the port of
Rotterdam.
The company, which cautioned in December that it would produce a 'small' net
profit in 1990, is to omit the cash dividend, which in 1989 totalled Fl
3.60. Shareholders will receive a tax-free payout in shares of 2 per cent.
Turnover rose by 7.4 per cent to Fl 2.9bn, while pre-tax operating profit
tumbled to Fl 17.2m from Fl 60.2m.
In Rotterdam, the group's transport division was hit by a downturn at its 44
per cent-owned Europe Combined Terminals, the world's largest container
handling company. Unfavourable economic conditions in Australia and New
Zealand hurt the results of Internatio's trading division. At the same time,
its engineering division had had to create provisions for several technical
installation projects.
Internatio, which said it was unable to make a forecast for 1991 results,
plans to concentrate increasingly on its engineering and trading businesses
in future.
Nationale-Nederlanden, the biggest insurance company in the Netherlands,
said that losses at Orion, its UK subsidiary, were expected to narrow by
roughly one third in 1991, falling to around Pounds 30m (Dollars 53.7m) from
Pounds 48.8m in 1990.
Major losses at Orion, which had posted a profit of Pounds 6.3m in 1989,
were one of three main factors behind the 7 per cent decline in Nat-Ned's
1990 net profit to Fl 905m (Dollars 479m).
Nat-Ned's results were also affected by two severe winter storms which
lashed northwestern Europe in January and February 1990 and by the losses
posted by its non-life insurance activities in North America.
Mr Jaap van Rijn, Nat-Ned's chairman, said the North American non-life
insurance market was still in a down phase but should improve in 1992.

RADIO CITY (Sound of Merseyside), the USM-quoted commercial radio company
based in Liverpool, has been approached by a potential bidder, writes Jane
Fuller.
Yesterday's announcement followed a rise in the A share price from 219p to
269p in little more than a week, and sparked a further surge to 301p. This
valued the 2.2m non-voting A shares at Pounds 6.6m. There are also 400,000
ordinary shares, of which about 30 per cent are held by Mr Terry Smith,
managing director, and other board members.
Radio City's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 880,000 (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of
Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.3m) in the year to September. The launch of a new
station, City Talk, was a factor behind the dwindling of cash held to Pounds
5,000 (Pounds 640,000).
Other shareholders include Capital Radio with 5.9 per cent, Higsons Brewery
with 10 per cent and GMWU general work-ers union with 6.6 per cent.

ANDY CAPP, the cartoon character whose idea of work is lifting a pint, was
yesterday press-ganged into Robert Maxwell's marketing campaign for the sale
of almost 50 per cent of Mirror Group Newspapers.
The Mirror cartoon favourite has been recruited to a press and television
campaign to boost interest among readers and other private investors in the
sale of the MGN stake.
The pathfinder prospectus launched yesterday in London will form the basis
on which shares are marketed to institutions.
The float aims to raise about Pounds 250m for the group, which comprises the
Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and The People and the Scottish papers, the
Daily Record and the Sunday Mail. MGN also has two specialist racing papers
and two free papers in Scotland.
In the prospectus these titles are being accounted for as Pounds 625m worth
of intangible assets. Total net assets in the pro forma balance sheet,
prepared as if the company were already floated, are Pounds 840.3m.
MGN is also involved in contract printing and the syndication of newspaper
material and has interests in two North American companies: Quebecor
Printing and Donohue, a forest products group.
Prospectus pro forma pre-tax profits for last year amount to Pounds 83.4m.
That is after an interest saving arising from application of Pounds 210m of
the proceeds to repayment of bank borrowings. The balance of the sale
proceeds will go to repay a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings, a family
company.
Compared with yearly figures for 1990, circulation of the four main titles
suffered slight declines in the first quarter.

<TEXT>
EAGLE TRUST, the mini-conglomerate that was delisted in September, has sold
the businesses and assets of Pavis Group, its distributor and retailer of
plumbing equipment, for Pounds 9m.
The purchaser is the D Pavis Group, which has been set up by former Pavis
Group managers and two new investors.
The sale is the latest in a series of disposals by Eagle Trust in a
reorganisation aimed at reducing its debt and trimming its operations.
It will initially reduce borrowings, currently at about Pounds 8.3m, by a
little less than the Pounds 5.9m cash it will receive in the first stage of
the sale.
The remaining Pounds 3.1m will come from a net surplus of debtors over
creditors which Eagle Trust will retain. It has also subscribed for an
initial 74 per cent of the ordinary shares of the new company. The remaining
26 per cent has been subscribed for by the new company's management team.
Eagle Trust has also subscribed for Pounds 1.85m of Pounds 1 preference
shares at par, Pounds 1.3m of 15 per cent secured loan stock and Pounds 1m
of 15 per cent unsecured loan stock in the new company. The arrangement
enables the management team to increase its shareholding from between 51 per
cent and 75 per cent as the preference shares are redeemed and loan stock is
repaid.

<TEXT>
BENTALLS, which owns six department stores in the south-east, announced
pre-tax profits down 14 per cent from Pounds 3.86m to Pounds 3.32m in the 53
weeks to February 2 1991 - a year which saw a new location for the flagship
store and headquarters.
After steps to maintain margins, second-half operating profits showed
improvement.
Turnover last year fell to Pounds 70.73m (Pounds 71.85m).
Sales at the new store in Kingston-upon-Thames, usually accounting for more
than half group turnover, were affected by building works and competition
from a new John Lewis branch.
Costs included fitting out the Kingston store (Pounds 13.5m net) and an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.4m for the move.
Bentalls is a partner to Norwich Union in a shopping centre development at
Kingston, to be opened in September 1992. Its contribution is being financed
by a loan facility of Pounds 25m from Natwest, of which Pounds 18m has been
drawn down.
The company has a 23.6 per cent stake in the project's rental income. This
is expected to exceed the guaranteed Pounds 1.65m per year, coming closer to
Pounds 2.5m.
Property revaluations put the company's investment property at Pounds 75.9m,
of which the discounted value of the Bentall Centre project is Pounds 33.5m.
This increases shareholders' funds to Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 25.75m) and
raises net asset value from 62p to 169p per ordinary share.
The final dividend of 3.25p leaves the total unchanged at 3.85p on reduced
earnings per share of 4.87p (5.59p).

FT  18 APR 91 / Michelin announces Pounds 524m losses

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest and most indebted tyre maker, yesterday
announced a FFr5.27bn (Pounds 524m) net loss for last year and warned that
the full benefits of its cost-cutting drive would not show until 1993.
The loss, caused by a plunge in tyre demand, a rise in finance charges and
the dollar's fall, compares with a FFr2.65bn net profit the previous year
and is slightly smaller than the group had earlier forecast.
It includes a FFr3.36bn exceptional charge for the cost of more than 16,000
job reductions - 15 per cent of the total - to be made worldwide in the two
years to the end of 1992.
The job cuts will be equally split between the US and Europe, where Michelin
last week announced 4,900 job losses. It has also announced job cuts in the
US, but warns that it has not yet reached its target. No jobs cuts are
planned in Asia and Japan, the group's only growth market.
Michelin expects to make another loss this year, forecast at FFr1bn to
FFr2bn by securities analysts, but estimates that it will start to break
even towards the end of 1991, assuming an upturn in the US market, which
absorbs 40 per cent of sales.
Turnover rose 13.6 per cent from FFr55.25bn in 1989 to FFr67.73bn last year,
mainly because of the first contribution from Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre
maker which Michelin bought at the end of 1989.
Sales fell an average 5.6 per cent in the first three months of this year,
with the North American market declining twice as fast as Europe. Michelin
says it is not losing market share - slightly more than 20 per cent of the
world total.
The cost of the Dollars 1.5bn Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition drove debts up
from FFr22bn to FFr28.5bn last year, with gearing up from 116 per cent to
161 per cent of shareholders' funds. Michelin warns that debts will rise in
1991, as it pays for its restructuring, but will turn down next year.
Gearing rises to an estimated 280 per cent if FFr5.5bn of subordinated loans
are counted as debt, estimated Mr Bob Barber, analyst at James Capel in
London. At that level, it is hard to see how Michelin can turn the corner
without reconstructing its capital or selling a large part of the business,
he said.
However, Michelin has no plans to sell industrial activities and said it did
not wish to consider issuing fresh capital until it had convinced investors
that it was on the road to profitability.

FT  18 APR 91 / Banking on a change in the climate: A wary optimism is
taking hold at hard-hit US financial institutions - How US banks are coping
in lean times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest US banks are slowly - though not yet very surely - moving away
from the storm which only a few months ago threatened to engulf some of
them.
While earnings of most of the banks continued to slide in the first quarter,
largely due to big jumps in loan write-offs and bad debt provisions, the
reports published over the past week or two contain a few glimmers of light.
Lower interest rates have pushed down funding costs, paving the way for
wider lending margins. Citicorp, for instance, which reported a 70 per cent
plunge in earnings, has seen its interest margin rise from 3.49 per cent in
the third quarter of last year, to 3.5 per cent in the fourth and 3.67 per
cent in the last three months.
At the same time, capital ratios are generally improving and operating
expenses are under better control than they have been for some time. Job
cuts, consolidation of operations and disposal of unprofitable businesses
have become the order of the day in the US banking industry.
Concern over the banks is now centred on the quality of their assets.
Non-performing loans and loan losses continue to spiral, reflecting fears
about the world economy in general and the US property market in particular.
Noting that city centre office vacancy rates are now double what they were
in the early 1980s, Mr Tom Labrecque, Chase Manhattan chairman warned at the
bank's annual meeting earlier this week that the property headache was
likely to persist for between three to eight years, depending on the
location.
Mr Labrecque, said that Chase was not counting on any improvement in the
market for the remainder of 1991. The bank has seen its non-accrual
commercial property portfolio - those loans which are far in arrears -
balloon from Dollars 884m (Pounds 496.6m) to Dollars 2.1bn in the past year.
The banks with the largest property portfolios, especially those with a
heavy exposure to undeveloped land, thus remain the most vulnerable.
Atlanta-based CAS/Sovran, for instance, has seen its ratio of non-performing
assets to total loans soar in the past year from 1.15 per cent to 3.25 per
cent. The sharp rise is largely due to its heavy commitment to land and
other property in the Washington DC area. The bank's first-quarter net
income of Dollars 30.8m was less than a third of the figure a year ago.
None the less, there is a bright side to the banks' swelling bad-debt
portfolios. The first-quarter results contained few unpleasant surprises,
which is a change from recent experience. In some cases, such as Chase
Manhattan, where net write-offs in the latest quarter fell slightly on the
previous three months, there were even some morsels of good news.
Ms Helen Rowan, vice-president for finance and investor relations at the
Florida-based Barnett Banks, predicts that the momentum of increase in
non-performing loans will start to slow over the next few quarters. 'We're
probably not far from the peak,' she says.
This wary optimism is reflected in the lusty performance by US bank stocks
over the past few months, as well as a willingness by investors to inject
sizeable amounts of new capital into the industry.
Citicorp's share price has zoomed up by more than 50 per cent since last
October, and continued rising this week to Dollars 16 1/4 , even after its
announcement of a 70 per cent plunge in first-quarter earnings. NCNB, the
North Carolina-based bank, has seen its share price more than double from
last year's low of Dollars 16 7/8 .
Citicorp, Security Pacific and, most recently, Bank of Boston and Chase
Manhattan are among the institutions which have tapped outside investors for
new capital since the beginning of the year.
The investors are demanding their pound of flesh, however, in the form of
high yields. Barnett Banks offered a relatively generous yield of 9 per cent
on its Dollars 100m cumulative convertible preferred share issue last month.
Targets set by the Bank for International Settlements require banks to have
Tier 1 capital - equity and retained earnings - equal to 4 per cent of
assets and total capital equal to 8 per cent of assets by the end of 1992.
Most of the big banks are likely to meet those goals with a combination of
new share issues, retained earnings and shrinking assets. But regulators are
firmly telling some of them that the BIS guidelines are only the minimum,
and not necessarily the desirable, ratios.
Observers see it as no accident that JP Morgan, one of the most
strongly-capitalised banks with a total capital ratio of 10.3 per cent, was
among the first to be allowed into the securities business. Conversely, a
much weaker Florida bank withdrew a planned acquisition of a local savings
and loan institution late last year, apparently under pressure from the
regulators who would have had to approve the deal.
The move to toughen capital requirements is not universally welcomed,
however. Mr Robert Smith, chairman of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific,
noted at his group's annual meeting this week that the largest US banks have
roughly doubled their capital ratios in the past decade. They have also set
aside reserves covering two-thirds of all non-performing assets.
The problem, Mr Smith observed, is that 'if our leverage is reduced, our
profitability is reduced. And our profitability determines the costs and
availability of additional capital. It becomes a vicious circle, and the
short-term solutions being applied now will not work in the long-term
interests of the industry, its customers or the nation'.

FT  18 APR 91 / Maxwell floats MGN in style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Maxwell yesterday launched a lavish marketing campaign for the
upcoming flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers of which he is chairman.
Mr Maxwell, speaking amid flashing cameras at a packed press presentation in
MGN's Holborn headquarters, declared he was offering the chance to invest in
a 'great company'.
The press conference was called for the publication of the so-called
Pathfinder Prospectus - the final one, but without the pricing details  -
which will form the basis on which shares are marketed to institutions.
The sale will involve just under 50 per cent of the equity and aims to raise
about Pounds 250m. To maximise demand, the shares are to be spread thinly
between institutions in the UK, North America and continental Europe, and
private investors.
The prospectus shows that MGN's profits have consistently risen over the
past three years as it has reaped the benefits of investments in new
equipment and extensive reorganisations. These, Mr Maxwell said, were now
largely complete.
Pre-tax profits improved to Pounds 53.3m from Pounds 31.9m during the year
to end-December 1990, on sales up to Pounds 445m from Pounds 412.3m.
The operating margin improved from 15.8 to 19.8 per cent.
The document shows that group debt before flotation proceeds amounts to
about Pounds 400m. In addition, MGN has about Pounds 180m of obligations
under finance leases.
Mr Maxwell stressed yesterday that against an adverse trading profit MGN had
improved operating profits in the first quarter of this year.
ted flotation value of MGN compares with the Pounds 113m purchase price paid
to Reed International in 1984.
MGN will now be taking soundings with institutional investors before
deciding the flotation issue price, to be announced on April 30. Private
investors, who will be required to put up at least around Pounds 250, will
have until May 9 to return application forms. The basis of allocation is to
be announced on May 14 prior to commencement of stock market dealings,
scheduled for May 21.
Samuel Montagu is financial adviser to the sale and Smith New Court
stockbroker. Salomon Brothers International is handling the international
side.

FT  18 APR 91 / Cheers as Dow holds its nerve above 3,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the psychologically important
level of 3,000 points for the first time yesterday.
When Mr Richard Grasso, president and executive vice-chairman of the New
York Stock Exchange, rang the closing bell to a volley of cheers from the
floor, the Dow was up 17.58 at 3,004.46, eclipsing the previous record close
of 2,999.75, achieved on July 16 and 17 1990.
Investors had rushed to buy stocks in expectation of a brisk recovery in the
US economy, and in celebration of some unexpectedly good quarterly results
from US companies.
Turnover on the NYSE for the day, buoyed by heavy computer program trading,
was exceptionally heavy at 248.9m shares, the biggest volume since March 5.
The Dow, which has risen 14 per cent since the beginning of the year, had
climbed over 3,000 on five previous occasions - March 6 being the most
recent - but each time lost its nerve by close of trading.
The index first appeared in the Wall Street Journal on October 8 1896,
reaching 100 in 1906. On November 14 1972, 66 years later, it had scaled the
heights of 1,000. On January 8 1987 the index closed above 2,000. Set
against this leisurely background, the Dow has positively raced through its
third thousand.
The surge in US share prices this week, which has spurred shares in London
and the rest of Europe to near record levels, reflects growing confidence in
the country's economic outlook. It also confounds the predictions that the
market would react badly to the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest
rates unchanged.
Analysts said investors believe the Fed's decision should create the
conditions for a sustained, inflation-free recovery.
Two other main stock indices also finished at record levels. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 rose 2.84 to 390.46 and the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter shares climbed 4.55 to 511.30.

FT  18 APR 91 / Teachers to have pay review body: Government's policy
reversal is dependent on unions agreeing to a no-strike deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT pay re-view body to assess teachers' pay and conditions is to
be set up later this year and could lead to a significant increase in salary
levels.
The setting up of the review body is conditional on teachers not resorting
to strike action.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, who ann-ounced the sharp
reversal in policy to the Commons yesterday, expects the body to be in place
for next year's pay settlement.
The review body is intended to give teachers parity of treatment with
doctors, dentists, nurses and the armed forces, who have similar boards. The
Teachers' Pay and Conditions Bill, which would have restored negotiations
between teachers' unions and local authority employers, is to be withdrawn,
and a new bill will be introduced shortly.
The about-turn in policy signals the government's determination to enhance
the status of teachers as promised by Mr John Major during his campaign for
the Conservative party leadership last year.
Five of the six main teachers' unions gave broad support to Mr Clarke's
announcement. 'This is a step forward; we are very pleased indeed,' said Mr
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, the second largest of the unions.
The National Union of Teachers remained opposed. Mr Doug McAvoy, its general
secretary, said he 'totally rejected' the review body. 'It will be hidebound
to the government. And it will be the only pay review board which covers
conditions as well as pay,' he added.
School teachers' pay should be such as to 'recruit, retain and motivate'
high-calibre teachers, Mr Clarke said in his statement to the Commons.
He pledged that the government would implement the review body's
recommendations unless there were 'clear and compelling' reasons to the
contrary, but made its establishment conditional upon the teacher unions not
taking strike action on matters within its remit.
'My concern is that we should have a well-qualified and well-paid teaching
force . . . The body will not be subject to a pre-determined financial
constraint,' Mr Clarke said.
He also stressed the need for 'maximum flexibility' in teachers' pay to
reflect local labour-market conditions and good classroom performance.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's ed-ucation spokesman, attacked the 'no strike'
condition, and condemned the proposed body as a 'breach of faith with the
teaching profession' but refrained from outright opposition.

FT  18 APR 91 / Tranquilliser case claims multiply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of alleged victims of tranquilliser addiction bringing claims
against Roche and Wyeth, the drug companies, has almost doubled to 6,000
since the High Court cleared the way for a 'group action' against the
manufacturers of benzodiazepine drugs in January.
Mr Paul Balen, the chairman of the Benzodiazepine Solicitors Group which is
co-ordinating what will be the largest personal injury action brought in the
UK, said yesterday that applications for legal aid from alleged victims
wanting to join the group action were mounting at the rate of 40 a day.
Nearly 6,000 applications for legal aid have been made by potential
claimants to date. Legal aid has already been granted to 3,800 of them.
The number of solicitors' firms in England and Wales handling claims has
increased from 575 in January to 962.
Most of the claims relate to Ativan made by Wyeth and Valium made by Roche.
The claimants allege negligence against the two drugs companies for failure
to give adequate warnings to doctors in accompanying drugs literature that
the pills should only be used in limited circumstances because of the danger
that patients would become dependent on them. In relation to Ativan, it is
also alleged that the manufacturer recommended too high a dose.
At a preliminary hearing in the High Court last week, Mr Justice Ian
Kennedy, the judge appointed to supervise the litigation, authorised the
addition of Librium and Serenid to a list of 15 brand-named drugs which he
approved for inclusion in January. Librium is made by Roche and Serenid by
Wyeth.
Mr Justice Kennedy is expected to set a 'cut-off date' for claimants wanting
to join the group action.
Mind, the mental health charity, says that more than a million people in the
UK may have been addicted to benzodiazepines.

FT  18 APR 91 / Congress moves to end rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress was yesterday working on emergency legislation to end a
potentially crippling nationwide rail strike.
The American Association of Railroads said the strike, which began yesterday
morning, was affecting freight traffic across the country and that picketing
was widespread.
Congressional leaders, who hope to be able to send a bill to President
George Bush by today, have been meeting administration officials and their
staff into the early hours this week in an attempt to avert the stoppage,
which is thought likely to cost about Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) a day in its
initial stages.
The strike, by 10 unions representing about 250,000 workers, comes after
three years' effort to agree on wages, workers' health care costs and the
size of work crews. The railways want to increase productivity by
eliminating what they consider outdated and outmoded work rules.
Mr Samuel Skinner, transportation secretary, warned that a prolonged
stoppage would impair national defence and have a disastrous effect on the
economy. If it continued, the strike would ultimately cost Dollars 1bn a day
as more industries were forced to lay off workers, he said.
The administration sought to head off the strike last May by establishing a
three-man presidential emergency board to recommend a settlement. Similar
boards have provided the basis for settlement in at least three strikes in
the industry in the past decade.
The board recommended pay rises averaging between 3 and 4 per cent a year
over the next three years. However it also called for changes in work
practices broadly in line with management demands and said workers should
shoulder a higher proportion of health care costs, which the unions
rejected.
One option being discussed in talks between Congress and the administration
was a 100-day 'cooling off' period.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LESSONS OF HISTORY By Michael Howard Oxford University Press Pounds
17.50, 217 pages
Professor Sir Michael Howard is the most urbane of contemporary British
historians. His best and most detailed book, The Franco-Prussian War, was
published in 1961. Since then he has gone on to produce shorter works,
numerous essays and lectures and newspaper articles. It was essential for
his task that he had a major work behind him. And what a brilliantly
well-chosen one it was. Franco-German relations have remained the key to
much of European history long after 1870, and an understanding of the
details, the technology and the psychology of war remain an indispensable
guide to the present.
No contemporary historian could be better equipped. Professor Howard can
write with equal facility about the nuclear balance of power and the war in
the Gulf. He bestrides the gap between continental western Europe and the
east coast of the United States. For Howard is more than a military
historian. He writes well and sometimes speaks even better. When he became
regius professor of history at Oxford in 1981, he drew attention to the
apparent anomaly of a university professor being appointed by the crown. Yet
as he must have known, he was the ideal man for the job.
In his inaugural lecture, he spoke of the old debate about what the Oxford
history school is for: whether to train historians to teach historians, or
to teach history to the ordinary man. He cited a predecessor as defining the
latter as 'one capable subsequently of being a cabinet minister, a bishop,
an ambassador, a viceroy of India or one of the permanent under-secretaries
in the civil service'. Howard's preference, mutatis mutandis, clearly lies
in teaching the ordinary man.
In such a task he has been outstandingly successful. Some of the truths in
this selection of essays and lectures may be self-evident, but they are
still worth repeating. For example: do not judge the past by the fashions
and ideas of the present; bear in mind that while historical idols may not
have feet of clay, they were made of flesh and blood; remember that Neville
Chamberlain and his generation grew up rooted in empire, not the European
continent, which may help to explain some of their mistakes about Germany.
Again, Howard explains that one of the reasons why people expected the first
world war would be short was that the last big European war, in 1870, had
lasted only six months. He points out that it is a demonstrable myth that
nazism was a natural extension of Prussia. Moreover, it scarcely occurred to
anyone until towards the end of the 19th century that European conquests of
territory had to be morally justified. On the contrary, conquest could be
seen as a mission civilisatrice, or even a mandate from heaven, not even
much resented by those conquered. It was the natural way of things.
Howard gives all the warnings, too, about the dangers of ethnocentrism: 'Our
awareness of the world and our capacity to deal intelligently with its
problems are shaped not only by the history we know but by what we do not
know. Ignorance, especially the ignorance of educated men, can be a more
powerful force than knowledge.'
On war, he cites Clausewitz and the 'paradoxical trinity'. This is composed
of governments, for whom war is an instrument of policy, of the military,
for whom it is the exercise of a skill, and the people as a whole, the
extent of whose involvement determines the intensity with which the war can
be fought. The problem is, as we know from the war in the Gulf, getting the
balance of those three forces right. It is as difficult for the war-maker as
for those who try to stop him.
As an entertainer, Howard is full of intriguing facts. On the eve of the
first world war, he notes that five out of the seven honorary doctorates at
Oxford were given to Germans, yet at the same time one in three of
undergraduates had joined the Officer Training Corps in preparation for
battle. The British army defended the use of the bayonet until the last
partly because possession of it provided a moral incentive to use it.
Howard thinks that militarism was instilled into the British by empire,
which had to be defended. Then he makes the wholly serious point that while
wars used to be about territory, today people are more important than land.
As an historian, Professor Howard has performed his own mission
civilisatrice. As he himself warns, however, even historians are products of
their own times. Howard would not, I think, have advocated Britain being a
full part of the European Community from the Treaty of Rome onwards. He
prefers nation states, in which he had his intellectual upbringing, to
pastures new. Indeed if he were not so urbane, he might even have been a
natural member of the Bruges Group. That is the only depressing comment that
I have to make on a book by a very wise man.

FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Quality and productivity in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN FARAGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the past 10 years industry and commerce (and readers of the FT's
Management features) have learned that dedication to continuing improvements
in quality of goods and services to meet rising customer expectations,
almost invariably brings added benefits of less waste, lower costs, higher
productivity and an improved working environment.
Those unwilling to change attitudes, methods and organisation have not
survived.
Dedication to quality improvement techniques, better use of time and other
resources is just as likely to yield improved, more cost-effective service
and elimination of waste in the labour-intensive fields of research and
education; better quality and productivity need not mean less personal
contact with students or larger classes.
If teachers and academics (like Mr George Bernard, Letters, April 12) say:
'productivity cannot be raised except at the expense of quality' who is
asking for a free lunch - and who will pay for it?

FT  18 APR 91 / Economic Viewpoint: Now forward to the 1960s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Oxford and Cambridge university unions had a neat way of circumventing
the ban on discussing contemporary issues imposed during the period of
repression which followed the Napoleonic wars. They would take some earlier
historical controversy and discuss it in contemporary terms. For instance,
they would pretend to discuss Cromwell's commercial policies to debate the
corn laws of the early 19th century.
I had a feeling something similar was afoot when I took part last weekend in
a conference in Glasgow University to mark the 80th birthday of its
chancellor, that perennially youthful British economist, Sir Alec
Cairncross. The occasion was a great success, thanks in large part to the
chairmanship of Lord Callaghan and the efforts of Sir Alec's daughter
Frances, who is an example of that extremely rare breed - an economic
journalist with organisational ability.
The topic chosen was: did the mistakes of the 1960s contribute to the
problems of the 1970s? To his credit, Sir Alec himself voted in favour,
although he was economic adviser to the Treasury for most of the 1960s - the
'growthmanship' of the period was undertaken despite rather than because of
his advice.
Occasionally I was reminded of Wordsworth's lines from The Solitary Reaper:
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
For old, unhappy, far-off things,
And battles long ago.
Time had not diminished, for instance, the strongly opposing views on the
realism of the growth targets of the 1960s.
An example of 'growthmanship' continuing long afterwards was the Bonn summit
of 1978, at which the German government was chivvied into raising its budget
deficit under the slogan of 'increasing growth by 1 per cent'. Any illusion
that anything is learned from history was dissipated when I arrived back
from Glasgow to find the US Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady, berating the
Germans for pushing up real interest rates - as if such magnitudes were
under official control.
* * * Just how difficult it is to step out of the historical rut is shown by
Labour's 'Better way for the 1990s'. It is mainly a rehash of earlier policy
statements and has had a very soft reception. But although some of the more
alarming ideas the 1970s and 80s are jettisoned, it still serves to remind
us how little Labour has moved from the soft collectivism of the 1960s. The
collapse of hard collectivism in central and eastern Europe, and the
determination of electorates there to have no truck with a third way between
communism and capitalism, are not even mentioned. The new Labour buzz word
is 'partnership'. But there is no real change. The Conservatives are
condemned for their refusal to 'accept the case for an industrial policy'.
The authors tie themselves into knots saying that they will not try to pick
winners and only succeed in convincing me that they will pick losers.
(Conservative govenments are no slouches at picking losers either, as we
know from Concorde and the atomic energy programme.)
We still come across the assertion, particularly associated with Labour's
overrated industrial spokesman, Gordon Brown, that manufacturing has an
intrinsic importance of the economy, such as services. This singling out of
one type of activity is offensive to those of us who might sympathise with
some of Labour's ideas on constitutional (and even budgetary) reform, who
would like more redistribution in favour of the poor, but who will not be
bullied into accepting sheer superstition. Nor is it a recommendation that
some industrialists, who vote against Labour for pocket-book reasons, share
the same fixations.
From here it is a natural step to a Manufacturing Investment Programme and
tax incentives for companies to invest in science and technology parks. We
are truly in the land of the expensive business cliche - expensive because
financed by the taxpayer.
There is of course to be a National Investment Board to bridge the 'long -
term investment gap'; and no doubt to retrace the history of the National
Enterprise Board. Takeovers will be judged 'not only by their impact on
competition, but also on their impact on research and development, regional
location, employment, export strategies and the environment'. In other
words, official committees are to second-guess economic decisions. After
that it is a foregone conclusion that British Telecom will not be sold off
or that the Post Office is to remain forever a state fief.
I normally suppress all iconoclasm on the sacred subjects of education and
training. But what do you make of the following? 'Although the National
Council of Vocational qualifications and Scotvec has done much good work,
Britain is still far from a system of high-quality NVQs common across
industry.' It makes me sympathise with John Major's distrust of paper
qualifications. Can you imagine Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was responsible
for the best railway architecture in the UK, bothering to acquire an NVQ?
Would he have passed if he had tried?
By comparison with the industrial section, Labour's treatment of Treasury
matters is almost benign. The National Economic Assessment will no doubt
provide relief for commentators, as well as economists and statisticians.
Beware, however, of the top marginal personal tax rate supposedly of 50 per
cent. If we allow for the abolition of the ceiling on employees' National
Insurance contributions (in itself desirable) the marginal rate rises to 59
per cent. And if we take into account employers' contributions and consumer
taxes, the effective top marginal rate could be well over 70 per cent. (It
is 50-60 per cent even today, a point Conservative chancellors do not like
my making).
But it is the so-called social side that makes me most cross. For this is
just where Labour is at its most stick-in-the mud and in my experience does
not even welcome outside discussion, taking the attitude: 'Please talk to us
about European monetary union, but stay out of our own backyard when it
comes to policy on poverty.' No such territorial claim is going to convince
me that an indiscriminate across-the-board increase in pensions of Pounds
5-Pounds 8 per week, followed by upgrading in line with earnings is a
cost-effective way of helping the worst off. And Labour's attachment to the
National Insurance system and lack of interest in using the tax system to
pay out benefits where they are most needed is worthy of Mrs Thatcher at her
most reactionary.
As for the national minimum wage, starting at a half of men's median
earnings, but eventually rising to two-thirds: this is an inbuilt engine for
destroying jobs. The case for it is not strengthened by references to its
prevalence in other Community countries where unemployment is high by both
international and historical standards. To deny the connection between pay
and jobs is like denying that water runs downhill. There are libraries full
of empirical research which spells this out in detail.
Unfortunately it is thus still not possible for market economists to support
Labour with a straight face. This is something about which I used to worry
even at university when I was an active member of the Labour Club. I
supposed this explained the tendency of Labour-sympathising economists to
retreat into macroeconomics, which I myself occasionally still do in such
circles for the sake of a quiet life.
A market economist might vote Labour for non-economic reasons or out of
democratic belief in an alternation of parties. But nonsense remains
nonsense, however progressive or unTory one wishes to be.

Sir Michael Edwardes, the South African-born entrepreneur, has always been a
trouble-shooter in a hurry.
With spells at Chloride, British Leyland, ICL, Mercury, and Minorco - where
he led the abortive bid for Consolidated Gold Fields - he has tested his
management skills on more famous companies than most executives. So it seems
surprising he may soon join the board of troubled Porth Group, Britain's
biggest maker of artificial Christmas trees.
Capitalised at just Pounds 2m, it hardly sounds big enough for 5ft 3 1/2 in
Sir Michael. It does have a South African in charge, however, which may
explain the interest.

Apart from getting a bit long in the tooth, they are all well-worn directors
of Hawker Siddeley who, unusually, have been promised an annual pension of
Pounds 7,000 apiece on retirement.
It is the cosy sort of deal which would probably not be allowed in the
statement of best practice for directors which the Institutional
Shareholders' Committee is due to release later today. Non-executive
directors are supposed to be independent souls. Awarding them pensions might
be thought to mar their impartiality.
Hawker says the pensions reflect undertakings previously given to the
directors concerned. In future, remuneration receivable by non-executive
directors will not be pensionable.
About time too.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is now well and truly
inaugurated, but mercurial president Jacques Attali has as yet failed to
fill what is probably its second most important position: the
vice-presidency of the merchant banking division.
It is vacant because he could not land Ernest Stern, the World Bank senior
vice-president, who was in line to be his number two. The job has to go to
an American, and Attali says he wants someone with strong investment banking
credentials. But he has decided to take his time in filling it, otherwise
'the person would be happy for five minutes and I'd be unhappy for four
years.'
It seems that the 'excellent' recruit he seeks should not be nervous about
working with him. 'I've always thought that only weak people are afraid to
work with strong people.'
Indeed, opinions about Attali and his bank seem even stronger than before
this week's celebrations started. Despite a commitment to 'openness', Attali
has yet to come to grips with the concept. For example, he has been trying
to limit - no doubt for good practical reasons - the access of the bank's
23-strong board of directors to the staff of the bank.
Originally, his suggestion was that board members would be able to access
staff only through him or one other person, the bank's secretary-general.
Now he appears to be willing also to allow approaches through the bank's
five vice-presidents. The topic is far from settled.
He has also made much about press freedom: a free press will be one factor
which will condition the new bank's approach to operations in a borrowing
country. However, the condition seems not to apply to the bank itself.
Copies of a newsletter, Annual Meeting News, published for the meeting were
withdrawn from circulation because of the rude comments about Attali it
contained. A libel suit has been threatened.

FT  18 APR 91 / Leading Article: A manifesto from the CBI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH so many manifestos in the air, a British general election cannot be far
away. On Tuesday, the Labour party published its draft policy paper.
Yesterday, it was the turn of the Confederation of British Industry to set
out its thinking on the way ahead in a mercifully rather briefer document
entitled 'Business Agenda for the 1990s'.
The most immediately striking feature of the CBI's publication is how far
its recommendations are congruent with Labour's stated priorities. Both
organisations emphasise the need to increase industrial investment,
strengthen manufacturing, improve education and training, promote research
and development and modernise the national infrastructure - all within the
framework of prudent public expenditure policies.
There are inevitably differences between the two positions, though in terms
of measures specifically directed at industry these are mostly of detail and
degree. CBI members no doubt still worry about the depth of Labour's new
convictions, but the overall impression from the document is that British
business finds the prospect of life under a Labour government far from
unsettling.
That, of course, says much about the changes which have taken place within
the Labour party in recent years. But 'Business Agenda for the 1990s' also
reflects changed attitudes in the CBI. A decade ago, it was clamouring for
corporatism and interventionism as the solutions to recession and flagging
competitiveness. Today, to its credit, the organisation has forsworn
pleading for short-term palliatives and given pride of place to the
reduction of inflation.
Sterling parity
'Business Agenda for the 1990s' contains scarcely a whimper about the level
of short-term interest rates or of sterling. Indeed, it explicitly endorses
the maintenance of sterling's parity within the exchange rate mechanism as
an essential competitive discipline and calls for the adoption of narrower
bands. 'There must be no return to the cycle of inflation and devaluation
which characterised the decades of Britain's relative decline,' it declares.
It is equally forthright in rejecting trade protection and direct subsidies,
while accepting that industry must shoulder much of the responsibility for
improving its own performance by raising standards of management practice
and training.
This realism is welcome. However, 'Business Agenda for the 1990s' is not
primarily a treatise on the virtues of economic liberalism. It is a lobbying
document. And when it comes to making specific demands and proposals on
behalf of industry, it is less coherent and rigorously thought through.
Economic strength
For instance, the high level of British gross domestic product devoted to
consumption is lauded on page one as a sign of economic strength, only to be
castigated a few pages later as a diversion of resources from savings and
investment. The document is equivocal about corporate takeovers, lamenting
their contribution to short-termism in Britain while also calling for a more
open market in the rest of Europe. Its arguments for giving more emphasis to
manufacturing are unconvincing. The CBI also, like both main parties, is
less than clear how its demands for increased government investment in
education and infrastructure and for tax breaks for industry can be financed
within the framework of tight public expenditure.
However, these are relatively minor inconsistencies. The much bigger
question is how far British industry has absorbed the implications of the
document's central message about the paramount importance of controlling
inflation. In that respect, the government's priorities are set. The onus
now is on the private sector. But the signals to date are mixed: this week
saw statistics showing a stubbornly high factory-gate prices and a 14 per
cent annual rise in executive pay. The CBI may protest that it cannot
influence its members' actions. But it cannot expect to be taken seriously
by governments until they are seen to be delivering on their side of the
bargain.

FT  18 APR 91 / From doldrums to new dawn: The turnaround at MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The numbers cannot lie,' Mr Robert Maxwell, the publisher, said yesterday at
the marketing launch for the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers.
Its flagship, the Daily Mirror, may be famous for its pithy words and punchy
pictures but it was the numbers that held sway - money paid, money invested,
money made. Mr Maxwell is trying to raise about Pounds 250m from floating
45-49 per cent of the company partly to pay off debt of more than Pounds
200m.
The irony is that Mr Maxwell, long thwarted in his attempts to become a
national newspaper owner, was only able to buy the Mirror group in 1984
because S G Warburg, the merchant bank, had advised its then owner, Reed
International, that it could not go ahead with a flotation.
He paid Pounds 113m for the group, but Pounds 23m of that was an
inter-company loan, so the real price was Pounds 90m. On top of that the
premises were then estimated to be worth Pounds 10m. In the final year of
its previous ownership operating profits at the Mirror group had been Pounds
4.3m on sales of Pounds 274m. Last year operating profits were Pounds 88.3m
on sales of Pounds 445m.
When Mr Maxwell took over the group, it seemed as if the best days of the
Daily Mirror were far behind it. It had sold The Sun to Mr Rupert Murdoch,
thus creating a ferocious competitor. Reed has since admitted that it did
not feel able to take on the apparently invincible print unions and their
exorbitant costs. In pre-Maxwell days, the Mirror's headquarters in London's
Holborn were called a 'mink-lined coffin', a reference to the newspaper's
image as a declining title that was still overspending.
Its transformation has been remarkable. In January 1986 Mr Maxwell reached
agreement with the print unions - backed by closure threats - to shed 2,100
jobs, nearly two months before Mr Murdoch's dramatic move of his titles to
Wapping.
Costs have gradually been squeezed by Mr Maxwell's home-grown management.
The operating profit margin rose from 14.6 per cent in 1988 to 19.8 per cent
in 1990. Since 1985 the full-time labour force on MGN titles - including the
Sunday Mirror, People, Scottish Daily Record, Sunday Mail and Sporting Life
 -has fallen from a yearly average of 7,235 to 3,726 last year.
Apart from his deal with the print unions, Mr Maxwell has made at least one
other key contribution to the turnround of the group's fortunes. He spotted
very early the importance of colour to the future of popular newspapers. He
was nearly two years ahead of Mr Murdoch when he introduced colour in 1988.
This move has sustained group advertising revenue in the face of the
sharpest recession for a decade.
Mr Maxwell exuded optimism yesterday about the future of the popular press
and clearly does not take kindly to anyone who suggests otherwise. In
January, Mr Roy Greenslade, then editor of the Daily Mirror, told UK Press
Gazette, the newspaper industry journal, that he worried about its future.
Mr Maxwell revealed that this unauthorised pessimism was one reason the two
parted company last month.
But the overall picture seems to support Mr Greenslade. It is one of
declining circulation, internecine rivalry and increasing competition from
television. Mr Maxwell's Pounds 500m investment in re-organisation and
colour presses and inserting equipment has meant, however, that the Daily
Mirror has had a smaller fall in circulation than The Sun.
In 1988 The Sun had average sales of 4.184m compared with the Daily Mirror's
3.119m; the Daily Record was at 771,000. In 1990 the Daily Mirror was at
3.109m, the Daily Record on 778,000 and The Sun had slipped to 3.896m. In
the first quarter of this year the Daily Mirror on 2.988m and the Daily
Record on 769,000 were together just ahead of The Sun with a circulation
that had fallen to 3.739m.
Despite its gentle circulation slide the Daily Mirror still has a 24.5 per
cent share of the national popular newspaper market and operating profits
are up for the first quarter of this year compared with the same quarter
last year. The improved performance has come from increased cover prices,
the appeal of colour to advertisers, and inserting.
Two things are unlikely to change at a publicly quoted Mirror Group
Newspapers. Mr Robert Maxwell will still be around despite his purchase of
the New York Daily News which could be offered for sale to MGN before the
year is out.
His part-time commitment to MGN as chairman 'would likely be whatever an
ordinary man does on a full-time basis', he said. The Mirror titles would
also continue to support the Labour party unless it fell 'yet again' into
the hands of people who do not understand democracy.
Labour had at last seen things the Daily Mirror and Mr Maxwell's way, and
had embraced Europe, rejected unilateral disarmament and shown the door to
the hard left. 'I played a small part in bringing them to heel or to book,'
said the MGN chairman.

FT  18 APR 91 / Leading Article: A risk worth taking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by the US, Britain and France to send troops to northern Iraq
to ensure the safety of hundreds of thousands of Kurds has been taken to
prevent a human disaster of horrifying proportions. These people, who have
been stranded on the Iraqi border in appalling conditions, have preferred to
risk starvation and death in the icy mountains rather than face the wrath of
President Saddam Hussein's forces by returning home. The only way to save
them is to persuade them to come down from the mountains and that they will
only do if their security is guaranteed.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, must be given the credit for mobilising
not only his European partners, but ultimately a clearly reluctant US
president, in support of at least the main elements of his safe havens plan.
However, Mr George Bush's initial reservations about the original British
proposals were entirely understandable. The suggestion that the fleeing
Kurds should return to their home towns and villages under the military
protection of allied forces or the UN over a very substantial area of Iraq,
could be seen as the first step towards the creation of an autonomous
Kurdish region. Worst of all, it risked directly involving the US and
Britain in Iraq's internal affairs for years to come and thus provoking the
hostility of most of the Arab world, including the coalition partners in the
Gulf conflict.
Military involvement
Though the plan that was finally adopted is still full of hazards, the risk
of permanent military and political involvement by the US, Britain and
France in the domestic affairs of Iraq has been reduced. The forces which
will be sent to safeguard some five to six refugee camps in northern Iraq
will be relatively limited. The US is sending 5,000 to 10,000 troops and
Britain some 2,000. Both Mr Bush and Mr Major have stressed the intended
temporary nature of the operation - perhaps two to three months - and their
desire to hand over responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Kurds to
the UN as soon as possible. They have once again emphasised that it was not
US or British policy to break up Iraq into separate states or to get
involved in internal political quarrels, but only to deal with an urgent
humanitarian need.
It is right that these good intentions should be underlined publicly. But it
is equally necessary squarely to face the dangers inherent in the joint
military action. Though Washington and London sound confident that the
Iraqis, while denouncing the allies for intervening in their internal
affairs, will in practice do nothing to hamper it, that cannot be taken as a
foregone conclusion. Even an isolated shooting incident, either between
Iraqi and allied troops, or between Iraqi and Kurdish rebel forces, runs the
risk of reigniting a conflict which most people thought had come to an end
with Baghdad's acceptance of the coalition's tough ceasefire terms.
Legal authority
Neither is it possible to ignore the fact that the decision to send troops
to northern Iraq has been taken by the three governments in question without
the specific sanction of the UN, which provided the anti-Iraq coalition with
its much-vaunted stamp of legitimacy throughout the Gulf conflict. The claim
by the US and Britain that Resolution 688 gives them the necessary legal
authority for their move is controversial, to say the least, and is unlikely
to convince either China or the Soviet Union, both permanent members of the
Security Council. The UN itself, which reported yesterday that it had
reached agreement with Baghdad to set up 'humanitarian centres' in northern
Iraq, said its initiative could be undermined by the trilateral action.
No one should thus be under any illusion about the political risks of a
humane move which cannot in any case provide more than a very short-term
answer to the Kurds' plight. The problem of their long-term security and
identity will remain as acute as always after they have been fed and cared
for and the allied troops have returned home. Over this matter, the
coalition partners can exercise only the most modest influence.

FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Frontal attack on Hamlet - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS and STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Who's there?' 'Nay, answer me: stand and unfold yourself.' 'Long live the
King.' 'Mel Gibson?' 'He.' 'You come most carefully upon your hour . . .'
Career moves need perfect timing. Hamlet himself, a postponement-prone
prince, learned this too late: it was his greatest tragedy and it gave birth
to William Shakespeare's greatest tragedy. For his film version Franco
Zeffirelli has made a casting decision so insane that it partakes of genius.
Australian action-man Mel Gibson plays Hamlet. From the actor who brought
you Mad Max and Lethal Weapon comes the tale of a mad Dane caught between
action and rumination. As the film's trailer intones it, 'A man must choose:
to love or hate, to live or die, to be or not to be . . .'
But Hamlet the movie is so much better than one feared, including Mr Gibson,
that I am thinking of belatedly joining the Zeffirelli fan club. The
audience's first giggle, at a long-shot of Dover Castle (playing Elsinore)
in which tiny cars are visible trundling down to the docks, may well be
their last. Cultivating a russet beard and rugged English accent, Gibson
suggests a pent-up young achiever surrounded by corrupt and wassailing
elders.
The prankish volatility that stamped his Lethal Weapon hero serves the star
now for Hamlet's verbal fencing with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Shafts of
vindictive wit and wildness light up his scenes with the Ghost (Paul
Scofield) and Gertrude (Glenn Close). And in the duel scene Zeffirelli has
him playing the fool until the venom strikes. Indeed the only places where
Gibson stumbles are the soliloquies. With no sparring partner to spark him,
this reactive actor is suddenly unmanned. The speeches are delivered in an
anxious sing-song, with a decreasing sense of inner meaning or feeling.
But even this proves non-fatal. Zeffirelli has cut the text to the bone and
then reviewed it to see if he can cut to the marrow. Half Shakespeare's
words are thrown away, and those that remain are delivered with whirlwind
directness. (Only Scofield's burnished-toned Ghost is allowed to savour the
verse). But this style of frontal attack suits Glenn Close's furious,
agonised Queen, her face a mediaeval death-mask come to life. It suits
Helena Bonham-Carter's brusque, rebellious Ophelia, and it galvanises
players like Alan Bates (Claudius) and Ian Holm (Polonius), who look as if
they would like more time but rather improve without it.
Bardophiles will rail at the roughshod ride they get over English
literature's greatest verse drama. And Zeffirelliphobes will point to the
absence of any challenging modern slants or insights. This is simply the
Swan of Avon sliced up, served piping-hot and garnished with lovely costumes
and castles. But the film works on its self-appointed, simple level. And
Gibson's success sets an eye-opening precedent. (What next? Schwarzenegger's
Coriolanus?)
Sergei Bodrov's Freedom is Paradise takes its title from a tattoo popular
among residents of the Soviet Union's still crowded gulag. The illustrated
man is a 13 year old boy, Sasha (Volodya Kozyrev), incarcerated in a reform
school so dismal that the obligatory beatings are performed with rote,
enervated weariness. Sasha tries to escape at every possible opportunity,
his intended paradise is not simply freedom, but reunion with the father he
hardly knows. After learning that he also resides at one of the gulag's
prisons, the stubborn Sasha sets off on a harrowing journey across the
Soviet Union, using wit, luck and the occasional kindness of strangers to
track his father down.
Bodrov casts this passage through Gorbachev's Russia in a bleakness so
pervasive that the small acts of mercy bestowed on Sasha - a few US dollars
from a kindly soldier, an apple from a peasant, a hungry kiss from a little
rich girl - shine forth like bountiful windfalls. Sasha's tormentors are so
sluggish in their abuse, so distracted by their sorry lives, that the frail,
tenacious boy is able to slip through their grasps time and again. It is a
desolate portrayal of contemporary Russia.
Bodrov takes his time in rendering this portrait, employing a touch that is
at times painfully slow. The cumulative effect is a strong one, however,
enabling the exquisite melancholy of the film's final moments, when Sasha
meets his father (Alexander Bureyev), a hollow, broken man rotting in
solitary confinement. At first hesitant, father finally warms to son,
advising Sasha to disown him to avoid trouble. Sasha's response is simple -
'Who would give up a father?' It is an answer as heartbreakingly honest as
the film itself.
A less convincing rite of passage stands at the centre of Ken Loach's
Riff-Raff. Stevie (Robert Carlyle), a proud, sensitive, unemployed
Glaswegian, follows Norman Tebbit's advice by getting on his bike and
travelling to London, where he finds work on a construction site. The bosses
are venal but his co-workers, especially the Liverpudlian trio of Larry, Mo
and Shem, have hearts of gold. Stevie also meets Susan (Emer McCourt), a
fragile, would-be singer who moves into Stevie's squat. They have a
sometimes sweet, sometimes stormy relationship that inexplicably ends when
Stevie travels to Glasgow to attend his mother's funeral, leaving a confused
and lonely Susan to seek solace in smack. Things at the building site also
go awry, with long neglected safety standards eventually reaping the
inevitable harvest of death.
Despite some fine comic moments, Riff-Raff is never very convincing. Loach
and writer Bill Jesse career between genial, well-observed comedy and
hackneyed social tragedy so often and so joltingly that the overall effect
is confused. The scenes on the building site provide a genuinely engaging
and occasionally hilarious portrait of a group of men trying to make ends
meet in tough times. The filmmakers cannot seem to let well enough alone,
however, investing their story with tendentious social significance and
suspect melodrama every time it threatens to achieve its true voice. Given
this pervasive overreaching, it comes as little surprise that the film's
finale, with its predictable accident and obligatory conflagration, is
simply too much to believe.
The credibility of War Party suffers an early test when we are asked to
believe that the elders of a racially eruptive Montana town would choose to
celebrate a holiday by staging a mock battle between Indians and the US
Cavalry, in which the Indians are portrayed by proud young men from the
local reservation while bigoted rednecks play the cavalry. Not surprisingly,
the pageant ends in bloodshed, with the Indians forced to tomahawk one of
the whites after he unsportingly decides to use real bullets on them. Anyone
who swallows this bit of tenuous plotting surely must choke on the moment
several scenes later when the young Indian's leader, Sonny Crowkiller (Billy
Wirth), shoots down a pursuing airplane with an ancestral arrow. This
preposterous film, the first in what promises to be a spate of corrective
celluloid treatments of Native Americans following Dances With Wolves, may
possess the best of intentions, yet ham-fisted direction by the usually
steady Franc Roddam, an absurd script and generally wooden acting mean that
its makers only manage to replace old stereotypes with new, casting whites
as the savage and benighted aggressors, while Indians are the untainted,
civilised heroes. It may be less racially offensive than your basic Western,
but it's certainly no more credible.

FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: King Henry IV Pt I - Royal Shakespeare Theatre,
Stratford-Upon-Avon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from Stratford is decidedly mixed. Robert Stephens makes a charming
intellectual out of Falstaff in the new production of King Henry IV Part I,
but rather at the expense of the rest of the play.
The secret of Stephens's approach to the part is that although his Falstaff
is as fat as the text dictates, he is not gross. He drinks a lot of sack,
but does not appear to get drunk. He is in control of his faculties
throughout. Although he seems seldom to sleep in his own, or indeed any,
bed, and never takes a bath, he is remarkably well-groomed. The hair and the
beard may be a bit long, but they are not dirty. All told, this Falstaff
would be at home as rather a wise QC enjoying himself at the Old Bailey.
Stephens not only plays the character well, but adds the extra dimension of
Falstaff taking himself off: for example, when he speaks with a slight lisp
and introduces an element of sexual camp.
Such an interpretation is entirely in line with the text. Falstaff is, after
all, the cleverest and wisest man in the play with the possible exception of
Prince Hal. What Falstaff has to say about honour is far more intelligent
than the rantings and ramblings of a Glendower or a Hotspur. Beside him the
English nobility are simply uneducated, or in this production almost
anonymous.
On Michael Maloney's Hal, the Prince of Wales, we shall have to suspend
judgment until we see how he develops in Part II. As an actor, he is
physically very small - about half the size of his father, the king, and one
quarter the size of Falstaff. That could be an inspired piece of casting,
allowing him to grow in stature as he moves towards the crown. For the
present, he plainly sees that there is more to Falstaff than obesity: he
loves him as a benevolent, if eccentric uncle, but also as someone who has
something to teach.
Judgment will have to be suspended, too, on Adrian Noble's direction until
we see where it leads. So far, it is uneven. Julian Glover's Henry IV is a
very Christian king who appears to dislike war in general. This may be a
modern touch, which would help to explain why the battle scenes are so
ponderously awful. Clearly it must be a deliberate decision to stage them so
obviously without excitement. Sometimes it is hard to tell which character
is which. Possibly it is meant to illustrate the fog of war.
Anyway, Glover speaks his opening lines well and is undeniably upset about
the behaviour of his son. It may be that Hal is just as troubled by the
behaviour of his father: hence the affection for Falstaff. Afterwards the
king does not get much of a showing, which is not his fault.
I have high hopes of Rob Edwards's bisexual Poins. It has always seemed one
of the most intriguing minor parts in Shakespeare, and it is a pity that he
is not allowed more of a role. Sylvestra le Touzel makes a pretty shot at
Kate, the wife to Hotspur, and it is fun to see Glendower (Bernard Kay)
played as a thoroughly unhumorous Welsh bore. Otherwise the production
leaves a lot to be desired.

FT  18 APR 91 / Accountancy Column: Six items all financial reports should
have
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ROQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL reporting in the UK is in the process of much-needed reform. The
first tangible evidence came last week when the Accounting Standards Board
issued its draft proposals on the restructuring of profit-and-loss accounts.
While welcoming the fact that the ASB is taking a long and intelligent look
at the many difficulties of financial reporting, I have some reservations
about the package of draft measures issued last week.
At the risk of being controversial, I would like to remind the
standard-setters that the essence of good financial reporting is simplicity.
In my opinion, complexity should be confined to the notes to accounts. I
believe that, while improved in many respects, the new profit-and-loss
format proposed by the Accounting Standards Board is still too complicated.
Accountancy is the science (or more probably the art) of communicating
financial information. Whatever information is reported, it is necessarily
heavily summarised.
Earnings per share is but one measure of summarised performance. It is a
useful indicator of corporate profitability, but no more. Company directors
and City analysts place too much emphasis on this one number, giving rise to
the many well-chronicled distortions in company report-ing.
In my opinion, companies should be obliged to present a series of simple
measures that reflect the different aspects of the full financial report,
not just the profit-and-loss account, but also the balance sheet and
cash-flow statement. In my view, six ratios or measures would be about the
right number.
A key aspect of corporate performance will continue to be profitability.
Here there is no reason to depart from the established measure of earnings
per share.
Users of accounts need to know the return shareholders will receive from the
company, and how safe that return is. That could be given either in terms of
dividends per share or dividend cover.
A second profit-and-loss disclosure is that of the return to those other
providers of finance, the lenders. Again it is interest cover which is
probably of greatest significance, as it also gives a measure of the
security of the investors' own ratios.
Turning to balance-sheet items, we need to know the level of capital
employed and the adequacy of the way the business is financed. The first of
those could be measured in terms of net tangible assets, or possibly net
tangible assets per share. Finance is most appropriately summed up by
disclosure of the level of gearing.
That gives five measures and I have suggested there should be six. So far, I
have concentrated on the profit-and-loss account and balance sheet. But I
would suggest that recently the accountants have rediscovered at last one of
the most important areas of a company's performance: cash flow.
Most company failures occur because a company runs out of cash. That can
happen to profitable companies as well as loss-makers. Of course, a company
that makes losses will, unless it is supported by others, eventually run out
of cash and fail. It is essential that we accountants develop a suitable
measure of cash flow, equivalent to earnings per share.
Something along the lines of the ratio of gross cash flows to profit, or
gross cash flows to net assets, would probably be suitable. That should be
the sixth disclosed measure.
The main statements in the accounts should support those statistics.
They should not be over-complex. That is why I have reservations about the
ASB's new profit-and-loss format.
In most businesses, acquired companies and disposed companies become
integrated, or were at least partly integrated, with continuing businesses.
Determining their profit separately can only be arbitrary. In most
businesses in every year there are circumstances that affect profit which
will not recur. Whether those effects are ordinary, or exceptional, or
extraordinary, no one can reasonably know. There must be circumstances where
disclosure of the total of profit or loss alone would be misleading, but the
present proposal is too complex.
On the other hand, I strongly support the proposal for a new statement of
reserves reflecting changes in the net worth of the company other than from
new capital contributed. I would like to see that information on the
profit-and-loss page in the accounts.
So far as the balance sheet is concerned, I am worried about some
suggestions that it should become a statement of value. That could lead the
profession back into the quagmire of current-cost accounting. I would keep
the balance sheet on a straightforward historic cost basis. Other
information - relevant on such matters as the value of properties, or brands
or infrastructure assets - should be provided separately.

from the ASB's document on the reporting of financial performance -
illustrate how companies would have to disclose the proportion of
income and expenditure coming from continuing businesses and those sold
during the course of the year.

A group of MPs, most of them Labour, led by Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour member

FURTHER surrenders of national sovereignity by the 12 member states of the

Responding to questions at a Parliamentary press gallery luncheon he argued
that the pooling of sovereignity which had already occured through the
creation of Nato and the United Nations was likely to continue as the EC
progressed towards economic and monetary union.
Baron von Richthofen saw a further pooling of sovereignity as the inevitable
consequence of the creation of the single European single market.

FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Uncertainty on takeovers criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREATER continuity between the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission is needed to reduce uncertainty in industry over
government merger policy, the Commons trade and industry committee heard
yesterday, writes Robert Rice.
Mr Archie Norman, group finance director of Kingfisher, told the MPs'
inquiry into government policy on takeovers and mergers that the present
system had an unacceptable degree of uncertainty.
Any company contemplating a takeover needed a high degree of certainty
before embarking on an exercise involving substantial costs in management
resources and fees to advisers.
The OFT should be more candid with the parties on their reasons for
misgivings about a particular merger and should be prepared to identify
undertakings which which would satisfy them instead of waiting for the
parties to suggest them.

FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd rules out open commitment -
Kurdish Refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to allay fears that
British, US and French troops protecting the Kurdish refugees moved to the
safe havens to be established for them in northern Iraq might be involved in
an open-ended commitment.
He told the House of Commons that while no time limit could be set, every
effort would be made to bring the task to an end 'in safety' by handing it
over to the United Nations.
Dealing with the likely size of the British force assigned to the operation,
Mr Hurd said it would be 'as heavy as required, but as light as possible'.
He envisaged about 2,000 troops - somewhat less than a brigade - being
involved.
A statement is to be made by Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, outlining
the rules of engagement to be observed by British troops in the event of any
interfence by Iraqi forces with setting up camps for the Kurdish refugees.
Mr Hurd led Conservative MPs in praising the persistence of Mr John Major,
the prime minister, in overcoming initial US objections to the establishment
of safe havens.
He also underlined Mr Major's earlier insistence that there could be no
question of allowing them to be used by the Kurds to mount guerrilla attacks
on Iraqi forces controlled by President Saddam Hussein.
A restrained welcome by Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, for the
fresh impetus given to the British initiative - in which he emphasised that
it was backed by the authority of the UN - contrasted sharply with the
comments of many Labour backbenchers who argued that more should have been
done earlier.
Mr Kaufman said if Iraqi forces were to interfere with the establishment of
the camps for the Kurdish refugees they would be 'in breach' of resolutions
approved by the UN.
He urged the government to press Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN
secretary-general, to send a mission to Iraq to investigate charges of
genocide by Saddam Hussein 'against the Kurds and others'.
While acknowledging the role which the UN could play in bringing Saddam
Hussein to account, Mr Hurd refused to accept that it was a matter on which
the government was open to criticism.
He said the practical position was that 'Saddam Hussein is not within our
power'.
Mr Hurd rejected suggestions that the establishment of the safe havens
amounted to the 'de facto partition' of Iraq, with an implicit risk of
further developments paralleling Britain's experience in Northern Ireland.
He said five or six camps would be provided for the Kurds and, discounting
fears of a duplication of the Palestinian refugee issue, stressed that they
would not form a single area comparable to the Gaza strip or the west bank.
The foreign secretary did not envisage a role for representatives of the
Kurdish refugees in a 'huge' conference dealing with every Middle East
issue.
Once the camps had been established, he said, they would become the
responsibility of the UN. 'We do not want to establish camps which start as
temporary and end up as permanent'.

FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour publishes plan for rates -
Poll Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR maintained its pressure on the government over the poll tax yesterday
by publishing its bill to abolish the tax and replace it with a return to
the rates next year.
The cabinet is due to confirm today the decision to replace the poll tax
with a property-based tax with discounts for single-person households, but
the new tax is unlikely to come into effect until 1993-94 at the earliest. A
statement on the consultation document is expected early next week.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, told a local election
campaign press conference that unless the government accepted Labour's bill
there would be perhaps three years in which local councils would face high
administration costs and rising non-payment, 'three years of completely
un-necessary pain and anguish'.
Mr David Blunkett, the opposition local government spokesman, said that even
before the government's announcement it was clear the new tax would not be
fair as it would give an automatic discount to a high-earner living alone,
compared with a pensioner couple who, he claimed, would have to pay the full
amount.
The Liberal Democrats said yesterday their approach of targeting areas where
they were well-placed would increase the councils where their party was in
control or had significant influ-ence, whatever the overall number of seats
held nation-ally.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, chairman of the Liberal Democrat local election campaign,
admitted that the party was under more pressure 'in areas where we are less
established', but insisted that the areas where the party had a strong base
'will produce positive results'.
The party is fielding candidates in about one-third of the 12,000-plus seats
up for election - 1,000 fewer than in 1987.

FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fall in numbers on waiting lists -
Health Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in the number of people waiting for treatment in national health
service hospitals in the six months to September last year, was welcomed by
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, in a Commons debate yesterday.
The number of people on the in-patient waiting list was 705,000 - down 1 per
cent on the total for March - while the figures for people on the day-case
waiting list had dropped by 1 per cent to 200,700.
Mr Waldegrave said yesterday's figures showed that good progress was being
made, and referred particularly to the drop of 5,100 in the total number of
people waiting more than a year.
'The latest provisional figures from regional health authorities indicate
that this progress is gaining momentum, with a 12 per cent reduction
expected in the five months from September 1990 to February this year,' he
said.
But Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, said that the total was
still the highest for any September since records had begun, and said that
there had also been a reduction in the level of patient activity.
Opening an opposition-led debate on the health service, Mr Cook claimed that
the government might begin to manipulate the statistics as it had done the
figures for unemployment.
In future fewer people might be accepted on to waiting lists, he said.

FT  18 APR 91 / Political Notebook: Risk-taking Major keeps Major the
ditherer at bay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major needs confidence. His cabinet colleagues hope that
international acceptance of his plan for safe havens for the Kurds will
provide it.
There is still some ambivalence in Whitehall about the strategy. One senior
official warned yesterday of the risk that British troops could become
bogged down in Iraq. Ministers want them replaced by soldiers wearing the
United Nations blue beret as quickly as possible.
But the judgment at Westminster is that the prime minister had taken a risk
that needed to be taken - and it had paid off handsomely. Even members of
Labour's shadow cabinet admitted grudgingly that it would be harder to call
him a ditherer. The voters may take the same view.
French participation provided an added diplomatic bonus. Mr Major's success
in rehabilitating Anglo-German relations and his choice of the European
summit to launch the enclave plan has led President Francois Mitterrand to
take him seriously.
Downing Street is clearly excited about the prospect, pointing out that its
announcement on Tuesday night came a full two minutes before President
George Bush's press conference.
If Mr Major is to dispel entirely the charge that he can not make up his
mind, he must show the same confidence over the dismantling of the poll tax.
Friends do not expect him to change his character - nor do they want him to.
His political success is based on a clear-thinking, careful pragmatism which
has steered him through the ministerial minefields that have claimed so many
other once-rising stars. It is not a bad quality for a prime minister.
Some colleagues would like to see a bit less personal understatement - and a
bit more readiness to deal firmly with awkward television interviews.
Most do not judge his ideological innocence a dangerous weakness. Nostalgia
for the rough certainties of Thatcherism is unlikely to outlive the present
parliament.
But there is a widely-held view that he has overestimated the power of the
irritated right of the Tory party. That, as much as the need to get the
numbers right, has prevented a clean break with the poll tax.
The property tax which the cabinet will approve today is as distant from the
poll tax as it is from a local income tax. But Mr Major's anxiety to pretend
that the principles have been preserved means that the 'son of poll tax' tag
might yet stick.
It would be far better, colleagues believe, to risk the wrath of a dozen or
so of the disaffected and disenchanted on the Tory backbenches by making a
clean break. Even the newspapers might applaud. The voters certainly would.
* * * Mr Neil Kinnock is looking confident. He is convinced that Labour's
latest policy document has rid it of its remaining ideological baggage. He
can also act - as he has during the Kurdish crisis - as a leader in full
command of his party.
Few electors will actually read the document, titled Opportunity Britain,
and among a random selection of Labour MPs this week only a minority were
ready to claim with hand on heart that they would plough through the entire
27,000 words.
But that is not the point. It is the message rather than the
less-than-elegant prose which counts. The opinion polls indicate that the
voters are receiving that message. They are still not quite certain what
Labour stands for, but they are becoming convinced that it is no longer its
old extremist self.
Mr Kinnock's pledge to keep an independent nuclear deterrent as long as the
Soviet Union maintains a nuclear arsenal will get him into trouble with the
Labour conference, but there may be no harm in that.
There is some anecdotal evidence also that Mr Major's tilt towards the
centre has had the perverse effect of reinforcing his opponents'
respectability.
But there are still potentially dangerous traps in Labour's tax plans. The
economic logic of its proposal to abolish the present ceiling on National
Insurance Contributions is indisputable. Mr Nigel Lawson would have liked to
have done so in 1988.
The problem is that it would affect more than 3m voters - more than half of
them with less-than-extravagant incomes of Pounds 20,000 a year or so.
In the south, Labour will need their votes - and the votes of the millions
of others whose incomes are approaching that level. The Conservatives will
not be shy in telling them how much they stand to lose.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Revenue paves way for curbs - Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue yesterday prepared the ground for the introduction of
investment restrictions on all small self-administered pension schemes. Such
schemes, much favoured by owner-managers of private businesses as a way of
reinvesting funds into their businesses, have so far escaped the investment
restrictions which are to be applied to other types of fund.
The Revenue has indicated several other restrictions it intends to
introduce. Loans from a pension scheme to a business will be limited to 25
per cent of the value of the fund in the first two years, and 50 per cent
after that. Also, there will be an effective ban on investment in
residential property.
The bill also contains a provision to amend UK pension regulations to take
account of the Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange ruling in the European Court
last May, which forces schemes to adopt a common pension age for men and
women.
Revenue rules had allowed full pension benefits to women who retired between
the ages of 55 and 70. In future, this will be limited to both women and men
retiring between the ages of 60 and 75. This will have little effect in
practice, since few occupational pension schemes recognise a retirement age
for women below the age of 60.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: 'Loophole' closed - Building Societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAUSE 50 of yesterday's bill is couched in dry draftsman's language. Yet
the wording conceals what 'could be the greatest building society robbery of
all time,' says Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, the
UK's fifth largest building society.
The clause formalises the government's position on what is becoming known as
the transitional arrangements debate. The arrangements in question were
those introduced in 1985-86 when composite rate tax was applied to the
societies for the first time. Under these rules, a number of building
societies found themselves taxed twice.
According to Mark Boleat, the director general of the Building Societies
Association, the amount lost to building societies stands at Pounds 250m.
The Woolwich and the Leeds were particularly badly hit: between them they
paid an extra Pounds 130m.
The Woolwich launched a lawsuit against the Inland Revenue which was won in
the House of Lords last October. As a result, the society is to be repaid
Pounds 44m. The victory prompted the Treasury to close what it considered a
loophole in this year's Budget. Yesterday's bill will not stop that cash
going back to the Woolwich, but it will block all other societies from
taking advantage of the precedent set in the House of Lords last October.
Earlier this week, the Leeds said it was considering going to the European
Court of Human Rights to challenge Mr Lamont's legislation.
David Waller Permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs), a new form of
security which can be issued by building societies, will be taxed as debt
instruments rather than as equity, writes Simon London.
The Building Societies Commission recently ruled that building societies may
issue interest bearing shares to investors to raise capital. The shares will
have no maturity date and a rate of interest fixed each year by the issuer.
They will also be deeply subordinated, ranking below other creditors and
savers' deposits in the event of winding up.
The Budget statement said that interest payments on the Pibs will be tax
deductable for the building society. The Finance Bill confirms that the tax
relief - like that on interest payments on other forms of debt  - will only
be allowable up to the 'commercial rate'. Interest payments over the
commercial rate will be treated as dividend payments.
Interest will be paid net of tax to Pibs holders. Non-taxpayers will not be
able to claim gross payments.
Like all other forms of sterling-denominated debt instruments, Pibs will be
exempt from capital gains tax. They will also be bought into the accrued
income scheme, which prevents 'bond washing' - the practice of converting
interest payments into capital gain by selling shares shortly before an
interest payment is due and buying them back afterwards.
Building societies will be able to claim the 'incidental cost' of issuing
Pibs, such as fees paid to professional advisers, against tax.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Drowning in a sea of paper - The need to
modernise the way tax law is made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The one certainty about our tax system is that what the government gives,
it must first take away. The archaic ritual by which parliament decides how
this shall be done is about as appropriate to a modern industrial democracy
as tally sticks to the international money market. We need radical reform of
our machinery for tax legislation. Only then will the legislation itself
become intelligent and intelligible. As long as we continue to worship in
accordance with established rites at the altar of the annual Finance Bill,
so long will our laws be confused and confusing.'
Sir Geoffrey Howe made this rousing call for reform in January 1977. A
couple of years later he was back in office and chancellor of the exchequer,
a post he held from 1979 to 1983. Once established in Number 11 Downing
Street he took no action to restructure the process by which tax law is made
in the UK. Nor, despite sporadic reforms of the tax system, has any of his
successors.
As a result, the tax system is less intelligent and intelligible than it was
in the late 1970s. Even professional tax consultants, who profit from the
obscurity of the law, admit to being exasperated at the complexity of the
UK's tax legislation.
They also complain about the volume of it: 3,338 pages of new law enacted
between 1975 and 1989. Some taxes were abolished during the course of the
Thatcher administration - for example Capital Transfer Tax - but this was
more than compensated for by a succession of voluminous Finance Acts.
'But for the efficiency of the tax publishing firms in producing materials
that annually update the tax legislation, the majority of tax practitioners
would not even begin to cope with the recent volume of legislation,'
reflects Malcolm Gammie, a tax partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, in a
discussion document on tax reform first published last year and to be
re-issued later this year.*
Every tax partner has his or her favourite complaint about the tax system.
Adam Broke, formerly head of tax at Ernst &amp; Young, wishes that the Inland
Revenue would stop trying to make distinctions between income and capital.
Andrew Jones, Broke's successor at Ernst &amp; Young, objects to the arbitrary
pigeon-holing of different types of income. Mr Gammie notes that basic tax
concepts such as 'income', 'trade' or 'disposal', are not defined.
All are agreed that one central cause of the complexity is the way in which
tax legislation is enacted by means of the Finance Bill, the 'archaic
ritual' identified by Sir Geoffrey in 1977. The process works as follows:
proposals are worked up in great secrecy and announced in broad terms in the
Budget; about a month later a Finance Bill is published containing the
detailed legislation. This is debated in committee at the House of Commons
and enacted in the summer.
'Through the Finance Bill process, parliament performs the important
constitutional role of allowing the opposition to oppose what government
proposes,' says Mr Gammie in his discussion paper. 'It is, however, largely
ineffective as a body designed to scrutinise the detail of new legislation .
. . Measures which are inherently complicated or require the active
involvement of taxpayers to be implemented successfully, require more
detailed examination than the current Budget and Finance Bill process
allows.'
As Sir Geoffrey put it: 'There now follows the by-now-traditional struggle
on the Finance Bill Standing Committee. Both sides arrange themselves in
adversary relationship, with the opposition attacking the Treasury and the
Treasury defending . . . . The minister often feels no compunction about
glossing over questions which are beyond him, and the government
backbenchers often require little more assurance on a moot point than a
promise which trips lightly off the financial secretary's tongue 'to look at
the matter again.''
'Technical material is thus enacted through a parliamentary process where
the politicians are not interested in anything but knockabout point
scoring,' says Roger White, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock.
'Let's face it, there is no political will to get a better tax system. There
are no votes in it.'
Another problem is that MPs have no opportunity to influence tax policy:
pre-Budget secrecy ensures that there is, in most cases, no consultation
over tax proposals. MPs are up against a tight timetable and there are no
independent parliamentary experts to help them with the details. The only
advice comes from people outside parliament who have axes to grind.
Personal Equity Plans (Peps) were first introduced in the 1986 budget, Mr
Gammie says, without the benefit of a formal consultation process. Peps were
substantially modified in the 1989 budget, reflecting 'a failure to achieve
the objectives of the original proposal'. This is but one example of tax law
which has had to be rewritten in the light of experience. In more complex
areas, tax advisers are forced to rely on the Revenue adopting a pragmatic
approach to enforcement. A huge volume of case law has sprung up to give
interpretation on difficult points.
Mr Jones at Ernst &amp; Young says that, in an ideal world, tax law would be
codified and amendments would be made by inserting a new paragraph or
schedule into the relevant section of the code, rather than by a reference
in one Finance Act to a previous Finance Act.
Echoing some of Mr Gammie's conclusions, Mr White makes three proposals for
reform. First, he argues that the Revenue should consult more widely and
more frequently. Second, he believes that the Budget proposals should be
split into two pieces of legislation, one covering tax rates and allowances
and the other containing the detailed tax proposals (the technical bill
would not have to be enacted until October). Third, he believes there should
be a formal tax advisory committee - consisting of lawyers, accountants and
industrialists - which could debate the Revenue's proposals before they are
published in the form of a bill.
The Revenue is getting keener on consultation: last month it published
consultative documents on, among other issues, UK trusts, the taxation of
foreign exchange gains and losses and the taxation of subcontractors.
But other reforms are unlikely. The way tax is implemented now may be
tiresome to specialists but it is convenient for the government: huge pieces
of legislation can be ushered on to the statute book speedily and with the
minimum of fuss. The arcane ritual looks set to continue for some time.

IN RE HARRODS (BUENOS AIRES) LTD
(FT, March 26)
By a majority the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against a refusal to set
aside proceedings served against Intercomfinanz SA brought by a minority
shareholder, Ladenimor SA, which had alleged that the company's affairs were
being conducted in an manner which was unfairly prejudicial to its
interests. The company was incorporated in the UK and made returns to the
Companies Registry but had its registered office in Argentina from where it
conducted its business. At first instance the judge had found that while the
Argentine court was the one with which the dispute had the most real and
susbstantial connection, nevertheless the remedy under section 459 and 461
of the Companies Act 1985 was such that leave to proceed in the UK should be
given. However, the Court of Appeal stated it was not established that the
remedy available in Argentina was significantly of less value than the UK
remedy. A stay should be granted because of the very close ties between the
case and Argentina and the huge advantage of holding the trial there.
OFFICE ANGELS LTD V RAINER-THOMAS AND ANOTHER (FT, March 27)
The plaintiff employment agency stipulated in its contracts with its own
employees, inter alia, that the employee would not, within six months after
termination of employment, 'engage in. . . the business of an employment
agency' in Greater London within a 1km radius of the branch where she had
been employed (clause 4.5(b)). In allowing an appeal against a decision that
the restrictive covenant was valid with regard to clause 4.5(b) by the
defendants, who were former employees of the plaintiff and had set up their
own business, the Court of Appeal stated that while a covenant containing a
territorial restriction in a suitably drafted form might well have been
justifiable as a means of protecting the company's connection with its
temporary workers, a covenant containing territorial restriction was not
necessary to protect its trade connection with clients. Further, the clause
placed a disproportionately severe restriction on the defendants' right to
compete with the plaintiff after leaving its employment and went beyond that
which was reasonable in the parties' interests.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): A clean slate for adding up teachers'
pay - Review of a government volte-face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision to establish a pay review body for teachers in England and
Wales announced yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary,
marks the culmination of years of bitter conflict in education between
unions and the government.
Teachers, deeply troubled since their 1985 strike and the collapse of the
Burnham negotiating machinery, join six other public-sector professions -
doctors, dentists, nurses, paramedics, senior civil servants and those in
the armed forces - covered by pay review bodies.
The new structure is the first to be set up since that for nurses, midwives
and health visitors was established in 1983 and adds 400,000 employees to
the 900,000 at present covered by review bodies.
The decision also represents a volte-face by the government, which until
yesterday was committed to restoring pay negotiations between teachers and
education authorities.
No two review bodies are quite alike. Some have broader terms of reference
than others - the nurses' board, for instance, is markedly more constrained
in its remit than those for the armed forces and for doctors and dentists.
The review body for teachers will be the only one to cover conditions as
well as pay. Yet the similarities are more marked than the differences. All
the bodies have the same function: to recommend annual pay increases based
on comparisons with the private sector and assessments of recruitment and
retention.
Most of their members are drawn from professionals in the sectors they
cover, with a few academics. The secretariats come from the Office of
Manpower Economics, which safeguards autonomy and ensures some uniformity of
output.
They also share a weakness. They are bound by Treasury inflation forecasts,
which have been notoriously optimistic in recent years. Moreover, the
government reserves a veto where it believes 'wider economic considerations'
should override review body recommendations.
More often than not, recommendations are watered down, usually by ministers
staging payment of awards across the year, which reduces their value in real
terms.
The government has staged payment of all 1991 awards except for the armed
forces (because of the Gulf war). Only once in the past eight years have all
the boards' recommendations been paid in full.
A pay review body for teachers may help to ease the acrimony of the past
five years, but any gains beyond that are far from assured. The
recommendations of this year's Interim Advisory Committee (9.5 per cent for
teachers, 12.75 per cent for heads) were on a par with those of the review
boards, as was the government's decision to pay the increase in stages.
'Pay review boards are not a panacea by any means,' says Mr Chris Trinder,
senior research fellow at the Public Finance Foundation. Differentials
between public and private-sector pay have barely narrowed and pay review
boards have fought shy of performance pay.
Mr Trinder points out that under four years of Lord Chilver's interim
advisory committee, teachers in England and Wales saw their pay fall below
levels in Scotland, where teachers have retained direct negotiating rights.
Much will hinge on the government's readiness to honour pay review board
recommendations.
'The review bodies are there to protect the pay and conditions of
public-sector employees, but who is there to protect the review bodies
themselves?' asks the Income Data Services research group in a recent
report. Teachers may soon be asking the same question.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Tec protest about government red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT bureaucracy is undermining the ability of senior employers to
inject their business skills into the employer-led network of Training and
Enterprise Councils, according to an internal report by G10, the group of
Tec chairmen who act as a mouthpiece of Tecs with the government.
The report summarises the canvassed views of all Tecs on the effects of the
1990-91 budget settlement and priorities in the next white paper on public
expenditure.
When their government funding was cut last year, Tecs were given greater
flexibility in how they spent their budgets.
One disquieting finding was that Tecs felt that benefits arising from
flexibilities were being eclipsed by the 'ever-increasing bureaucratic
burden' falling on them.
That was seen to be in direct conflict with the secretary of state's stated
objective of vesting the nation's training and enterprise system in
private-sector leadership.
The report said that Tec boards - which are mainly composed of senior
executives from the private sector - had interpreted the government's aim as
an invitation to 'use their well-tried business skills' in an attempt to
generate a greater return than the public-sector approach had so far been
able to deliver.
'In reality, they are finding it increasingly difficult to exert such
leadership as they sink into a quicksand of bureaucracy,' the report said.
Tec directors 'are in no doubt that if they have to operate in a
public-sector system they will do so less effectively than those who
practised in it, and the government will have the worst of both worlds.'
So far as the issue of funding is concerned, the report said that Tecs
believed that a return to the funding levels of 1989-90, adjusted for
inflation, was necessary if Tecs were going to make any significant impact.
Rising unemployment was causing Tec boards to have doubts as to whether they
could satisfy government guarantees of training to the unemployed.
There were indications in some areas that employers were reneging on
agreements to contribute towards the cost of training unemployed people.
That may put increased pressure on Tec funds, the report concludes.
In evidence to the House of Commons select committee on employment, Mr Eric
Dancer, G10 chairman, called for an acceleration in attempts to reduce
bureaucracy.
Mr Dancer, chairman of Devon and Cornwall Tec, also called for a minimum
three-year operational contract between the government and Tecs to replace
one-year arrangements. The annual recontracting process was too lengthy and
too complicated and handicapped strategic decisions and investments.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): MSF asks more members to contribute to
political fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MSF, the general technical union, yesterday launched a drive to persuade
more members to contribute to a political fund financing its affiliation to
the Labour party and some of its campaign work, writes Michael Smith.
It is likely to be the first in a series of similar initiatives among unions
as a prelude to 1995, when all will be required by law to ballot members on
whether they should have a political fund. Ms Barbara Switzer, MSF assistant
general secretary, said yesterday that achievement of a positive vote in
four years' time would be made easier if more members contributed to the
fund now.
She pointed out that about 39 per cent of the union's 650,000 members were
contributors. That put MSF in the bottom quarter of unions, and the aim was
to raise the proportion to 60 per cent. Full union dues paid by MSF members
are Pounds 5.13 a month, including 24p for the political fund. One part of
the campaign will be to ask members if 'you will give 6p to help win a
better future'.
Members will also be told that among MSF's campaigning priorities are equal
pay for women, better child care, improved health and safety regulations and
a higher level of research and development in British industry.
The MSF campaign will be directed in particular at white-collar members, who
are less inclined to contribute than other groups.
Before MSF was formed three years ago through the amalgamation of the ASTMS
and Tass unions, 66 per cent of Tass members paid into a political fund but
only 25 per cent of those of ASTMS, Ms Switzer said.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Older staff are found to be more
reliable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLDER workers are better with customers, more reliable, more responsible and
less likely to take time off sick than their younger colleagues, according
to the preliminary findings of a study of Tesco employees by the World
Health Organisation.
The supermarket chain, which employs more than 7,000 staff over the age of
55, has pioneered the employment of older workers. Demographic changes and
the fall in the numbers of school leavers have led some sectors, including
retailing, to examine the active recruitment and retention of older
employees.
The WHO study is part of a research programme into the prevention of what it
terms 'retirement disease' - the acceleration of ageing associated with lack
of stimulation, motivation and purpose.
A survey of 80 workers aged between 50 and 71 and 10 under 25 at five Tesco
stores found the older employees were much more satisfied with their work
and conditions than the younger workers. A quarter of the older age group
said their health had improved since starting their jobs - most had been
with Tesco for two years or less.
Forty of 50 managers and supervisors at the same five stores said the older
workers were better with customers and more reliable.
Similar numbers rated the older employees as more responsible and less
likely to be absent.
Many of the 50 managers and supervisors questioned at the stores said that,
while older workers might be slower than the younger employees, their
greater reliability, responsibility and efficiency meant they were just as
productive.
The majority commented on reliability, trustworthiness and good customer
relations as the most valued attributes of older workers.
The WHO says the findings have implications for other sectors. Several
studies have shown that older job applicants face prejudice from employers -
it is only when organisations are confronted with recruitment shortfalls
that they are prepared to 'try' older workers.
Campaign for Work, the pressure group, yesterday called for legislation to
ban age discrimination in employment in a report detailing how older workers
were bearing the brunt of redundancies in the recession.

FT  18 APR 91 / PowerGen wins Pounds 200m of new business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the recently privatised generator, has increased its electricity
sales turnover by 60 per cent after winning new business worth Pounds 200m
from industrial and commercial customers. They include British Rail, Tesco,
Kellogg, Cadbury Schweppes and British Gas.
The generator's sales rose from Pounds 300m last July to Pounds 500m this
month as the second round of annual negotiations between electricity
suppliers and their large customers drew to a close.
The company for some time has been actively courting customers taking more
than 1MW of electricity, as they are free to choose their electricity
supplier. It kept 90 per cent of its existing customers and now supplies 149
companies compared with 100 this time last year.
Regional electricity companies said PowerGen's bargaining approach towards
customers and suppliers had been aggressive.
In most regions of England and Wales it is close to the maximum allowed
market share, which ranges from 7.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent.
PowerGen said it had not succeeded in increasing its market share in certain
regions, notably those of Southern Electric and Eastern Electricity.
The company plans to reduce its dependence on British Coal and to import
about 10m tonnes of low-sulphur coal by 1994 to comply with new European
Community law on sulphur dioxide emissions.
Gladstone Dock at Liverpool, about 15 miles from the company's Fiddler's
Ferry power station, is being upgraded to take 5m tonnes of coal, and some
Pounds 14m has been spent upgrading the company's Kingsnorth terminal on the
River Medway in Kent, where PowerGen has a power station. The terminal can
handle 5m tonnes.
The company is pursuing plans with National Power and Associated British
Ports which will lead eventually to the expansion of the Humberside
Immingham terminal.

She claimed some companies had been allowed 'blanket relaxations of toxic

FT  18 APR 91 / Living standards found less costly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILIES had to spend less in February this year than in August 1990 to
maintain the same living standards, according to a survey published today.
The biannual cost-of-living survey for March by the Reward Group, an
employment consultancy, was carried out before the Budget. The survey
therefore excludes the effects of the VAT increase and the poll tax
reduction.
Its measure of 'required income' to maintain unchanged living standards
includes the cost of housing and National Insurance.
'Over the last six months, required incomes have actually fallen, albeit by
a nominal 0.4 per cent, and have only risen by 3.1 per cent over the last 12
months,' the survey says.
That adds an extra dimension to official inflation data which this week
suggested that underlying inflation remained troublesome in spite of falls
in the headline rate measured by the retail prices index.
The mortgage rate last month was 14.5 per cent, exactly the same as the rate
a year ago, so that the Reward's Group's cost-of-living rate is relatively
undistorted by housing costs.
The costs of goods and services, the survey suggests, has risen by 3.7 per
cent during the past six months, and by 7.9 per cent during the last 12
months.
According to the all-items RPI, inflation was rising at an annual rate of
8.2 per cent in March.
The Reward Group also finds that the 'corner has been turned' on house
prices, which are not falling as fast as they were six months ago.
The average price of houses for sale is falling at an annual rate of 5.2 per
cent in February, after 6.1 per cent in August.
House prices in the South West are rising fastest, with more modest
recoveries reported in East Anglia, the south-east and Greater London.

FT  18 APR 91 / Public-sector deficit exceeds expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT recorded a deficit on its public-sector finances last month
of Pounds 3.1bn, the highest for three years.
The figure, released yesterday, illustrates the deterioration in
public-sector finances in recent months, largely as a result of the
recession.
It underlines fears in the City that the government's forecast Pounds 8bn
deficit in 1991-92 may be over-optimistic. Some economists believe the
deficit will turn out as high as Pounds 12bn.
The deficit for March, the last month of the 1990-91 financial year, was
roughly Pounds 600m higher than anticipated in the City.
It was caused mainly by a surge in local-authority borrowing and lower tax
revenues than expected. Borrowing by local authorities was Pounds 1.4bn last
month against Pounds 118m in February and Pounds 901m in March 1990.
Total local-authority borrowing for 1990-91 came to Pounds 3.5bn, more than
for the four previous years combined. Councils have been forced to borrow
more, largely as a result of difficulties arising from the poll tax.
Tax collected by the Inland Revenue in March amounted to Pounds 5.3bn,
against Pounds 5.7bn in February.
Growth in total tax contributions is likely to fall off over the next year
as a result of slower growth in incomes and a fall in company profits.
For the whole of 1990-91, the government showed a surplus on its
public-sector finances of Pounds 400m, as against a surplus in 1989-90 of
Pounds 7.9bn. In last month's Budget, the Treasury forecast a surplus for
1990-91 of Pounds 800m.
The projected deficit in the current financial year will be the first since
1986-87.
Net spending by government departments in 1990-91 came to Pounds 181.4bn, 16
per cent up on the previous year. Much of the extra spending was due to
bigger outlays on social security payments.
Privatisation proceeds for 1990-91 amounted to Pounds 5.3bn, of which Pounds
1.6bn were received in March, mainly from the first instalment of the sale
of PowerGen and National Power, the electricity generators.

FT  18 APR 91 / Pension funds press for action on sex equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTEEN of Britain's biggest pension funds have called for the government
to take urgent action on equal treatment of the sexes. That follows last
year's Barber judgment in the European Court, which said men and women must
receive the same pension benefits, and a recent industrial tribunal ruling
that implied heavy extra costs for pension funds.
In a letter to Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, ICI's pensions
chief Mr Michael Swift, for the 18, says the government must:
equalise state scheme pension ages, with which so many occupational schemes
are linked, and legislate to help schemes to implement equal rights without
being challenged by losers;
amend the existing guaranteed minimum pension rules for occupational schemes
contracted out from the state earnings-related pension scheme, to remove
inequalities;
delay any imposition of limited price indexation of benefits, as in the
Social Securities Act, 1990, but not yet implemented, until schemes'
liabilities in implementing equal treatment are clear;
change Inland Revenue rules on equality of treatment and on scheme
surpluses.
The signatories include the Post Office and many of Britain's leading
companies, including the big four clearing banks, British Telecom, British
Gas and Hanson group.
Mr Swift says government and industry must agree a programme for action so
that pension schemes can comply with article 119 of the Treaty of Rome,
which requires equal treatment of the sexes.

INSTITUTIONS consider a company's environmental record before deciding
whether to buy its shares, according to a survey released yesterday by Dewe
Rogerson, the public-relations and marketing group.
Dewe-Rogerson said that, of 80 senior fund managers interviewed, 40 per cent
said the question was an important factor in their decisions.
A further 58 per cent said a coherent and effective environmental strategy
enhanced their view of a company, Dewe-Rogerson continued.
It said 67 per cent believed environmental factors had a significant effect
on a company's business.
Only 11 per cent believed they were unimportant, said Dewe-Rogerson.

FT  18 APR 91 / Power sale attracts 2m applicants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 2m people have reg-istered to receive application forms to buy shares
in the two Scottish electricity companies to be privatised by the government
at the end of May.
The registration figure, similar to that achieved at this stage of the much
larger flotation of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies,
was disclosed yesterday, with details of incentives for people who buy
shares. The breakdown of those registering from England, as opposed to
Scotland, is not being announced.
The May 30 flotation of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric is
expected to raise between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn if, as expected, the
government sells 100 per cent of the companies.
Incentives and conditions for Scottish electricity customers who buy shares
in their electricity companies are similar to those offered to the regional
company customers.
For a minimum investment of Pounds 250 with a first instalment of Pounds
100, customers can have Pounds 18 of vouchers to set against electricity
bills, or one free bonus share for every 10 shares allocated, provided they
hold the shares until June 1994.
The first vouchers will be issued before Christmas, well before the second
of the three instalments is payable in May 1992. The third instalment is due
in April 1993.
Non-customers will have to apply for a package of shares in the two
companies and make a Pounds 750 minimum investment with a first instalment
of Pounds 300. They will be offered a loyalty bonus of one share for every
20 shares, up to a maximum of 150 bonus shares, to be held until June 1994.
The two companies are being floated simultaneously at the same offer price.
Applicants for the package will be allocated shares in each on what is
expected to be a ratio of about 2 1/2 shares in Scottish Pow-er to one in
Hydro-Electric.
Customers who apply for the package must make a Pounds 750 minimum
investment with a first instalment of Pounds 300, and will be offered Pounds
18 worth of electricity vouchers for every 100 shares in their own company
or a loyalty bonus of one share for 10. In the other company they are
entitled to a one-for-20 loyalty bonus.
The Pounds 750 minimum for non-customers and people applying for the package
compares with the Pounds 525 minimum for the package of National Power and
PowerGen, the generating companies floated in February.

the barometer of the domestic economy - has been laid bare by the
government.
In a book published yesterday, the Central Statistical Office examines 'the
ups and occasional downs' of inflation; the purchasing power of the pound;
and the composition of the RPI's traditional shopping basket of goods and
services.
The so-called shopping basket reveals most about technological innovation
and trends in consumer spending since 1914, when the government started
monitoring the cost of living. Candles, corset lacing and mangles were part
of the 1914 index.
The CSO reviews the basket each year to accommodate fashion, new products
and changing markets. Candles and mangles have long been replaced by
ready-cooked meals, satellite dishes, microwave ovens and compact-disc
players. When sales of black-and-white television sets declined, for
example, they were dropped from the index.
Since 1947, prices have increased 18-fold. One pound sterling in 1914 had
shrunk to between 2p and 3p in terms of purchasing power by 1990.

FT  18 APR 91 / CBI welcomes parts of Labour industrial plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday described Labour's strategy
for industry as 'closer to the real world' than it had been for many years.
However, the organisation said it retained serious doubts about the party's
ability to tackle inflation and control public sector wages.
Mr John Banham, the CBI's director-general, was speaking in London at the
launch of its manifesto for business, which is intended to provide a
framework for economic progress over the next decade.
He said Labour's proposals for strengthening Britain's industrial base and
raising training standards would be considered by the CBI council next week.
A preliminary assessment suggested that there were areas of common ground,
though big questions remained about aspects of Labour's economic competence
and its ability to deliver.
The CBI, he said, would support proposals for a partnership between
government and industry intended to strengthen the nation's manufacturing
base, although it did not want a return to the 'sham' of a corporate state.
Mr Banham suggested that the party's proposals for stepping up investment in
national infrastructure, supporting smaller businesses and pursuing a more
creative approach to competition policy also appeared welcome.
He emphasised that there were notable omissions in Labour's plans. It was
not clear, for example, how Labour intended to contain inflation to the low
levels demanded by Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism, while
the party's manufacturing strategy was in danger of drawing a potentially
damaging distinction between services and manufacturing.
Mr Banham also criticised the party for failing to acknowledge the need to
reduce the tax burden on businesses and said there were significant
questions about the financing and staffing of new organisations proposed by
Labour, including the National Investment Bank, the regional development
councils and technology trusts.
In its business agenda, the CBI singles out several prior-ities for the
decade, including controlling inflation, raising investment in equipment,
skills and infrastructure to levels achieved by Britain's leading
competitors, and bringing about a change in national attitudes towards
manufacturing.
The CBI calls for a refocusing of the activities of the Department of Trade
and Industry. It says that the DTI is currently regarded as ineffective in
helping the process of communication between business and government.
Instead, the department should provide a focus within Whitehall for the
formulation of policies aimed at improving Britain's industrial performance.

FT  18 APR 91 / Papers may advertise less on TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S national newspaper proprietors are investigating the possibility
of advertising less on television and promoting the use of each others'
publications instead.
The press - primarily the tabloids - has sometimes spent nearly Pounds 50m a
year on television advertising, but this has had little long-term effect on
circulations.
Mr Robert Maxwell, the chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers, said yesterday
that the industry was convinced that advertising on television was a mug's
game.
'We intend to spend far less money on television than we have done in the
past,' Mr Maxwell said.
Newspaper industry executives point to the poor impression advertising on
television creates - newspapers try to sell advertising to others and then
go on television to promote their own products.
There have already been preliminary discussions at the Newspaper Publishers
Association. A group under Sir Tim Bell, the advertising industry
specialist, is looking into the issue of the cost and effectiveness of
newspaper advertising. Centralised ways of promoting the concept of
national-newspaper advertising are also being considered.
It is not clear whether the fiercely independent national newspaper owners
would ever collectively agree to abandon television advertising. It might
even be illegal under competition law if they did.

FT  18 APR 91 / Loyalists in Ulster announce 'ceasefire'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOYALIST paramilitaries in Northern Ireland last night said they would
enforce a qualified 'ceasefire' to coincide with the start in less than two
weeks of formal talks on the province's political future.
An unexpected statement issued in Belfast by the so-called Combined Loyalist
Military Command said the suspension of operational hostilities was a
genuine attempt to assist the talks initiated by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern
Ireland secretary.
The statement said loyalist groups retained the right to take 'defensive or
retaliatory action' - assumed to mean in response to action by the IRA.
Although the gesture comes from organisations abhorred by the government and
the province's constitutional parties, it gives a further fillip to Mr
Brooke, who defied the expectations of many in winning agreement last month
for round-table talks. Loyalist murder gangs in Northern Ireland have been
behind far more killings in the province this year than the IRA.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, a minister at the Northern Ireland Office, had earlier
announced that talks would start on April 30. They will cover alternatives
to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement as well as devolution in the province.
Details of the three or four-man negotiating teams are expected to be
announced shortly by the four political parties involved - the Democratic
Unionist party, the Ulster Unionist party, the mainly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance party.
The ceasefire move follows meetings between leaders of the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association, which is still legal in
the province.
The UVF, sometimes using its flag of convenience, the Protestant Action
Force, has been behind 11 murders in recent weeks. One incident last month
in which two teenage girls and a young man were shot dead in County Armagh
horrified all sections of the community.
British and Irish ministers will hold a meeting a week to-morrow under the
1985 agreement. Then the workings of the agreement will, in effect, be
suspended for about 10 weeks while talks take place.

FT  18 APR 91 / MMC to investigate Isle of Wight ferries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRY SERVICES between the mainland and the Isle of Wight are to be
investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the government
announced yesterday.
The Office of Fair Trading said it had received complaints over a long
period about the prices charged by cross-Solent ferry operators.
Islanders on the Isle of Wight are wholly dependent on ferry services which,
they claim, are among the world's most expensive in relation to the length
of the crossing.
The biggest operator in the market is Wightlink, part of the Sea Containers
group, which operates three car ferries between Lymington and Yarmouth, two
passenger-only catamarans between Portsmouth and Ryde, and three car ferries
between Portsmouth and Fishbourne.
Wightlink's main competitor is Southampton-based Red Funnel Ferries, which
operates three car ferries and four car-carrying hydrofoils between
Southampton and Cowes.
The only other operator is Hovertravel, based on the Isle of Wight, which
runs two passenger-only hovercraft between Portsmouth and Ryde. Wight-link
yesterday quoted Pounds 22 to take a Ford Fiesta and two adults one way
across the Solent. Red Funnel Ferries quoted Pounds 23.20 for
Southampton-Cowes on a car ferry.
The Office of Fair Trading said its main concern was the dominant position
of the ferry operators in a market where there appeared to be limited scope
for new entrants.
Sir Gordon Borrie, the OFT's director general, said: 'I am not convinced
that there are no barriers to other entrants to the market and I have
received complaints over a long period.
'The companies do have a dominant position, and regular travellers between
the Isle of Wight and the mainland are almost totally dependent on ferries.
'I have therefore concluded that the issues can be resolved only through an
investigation by the MMC.'
The commission has until December 17 to report.

PARTICIPANTS ON the London insurance market yesterday announced agreement on

companies, Richard Lapper writes.
Live use of the system is expected to begin in April 1992.
It will allow brokers to place through computers policies currently written
on a subscription basis with underwriters. Such risks are offered to Lloyd's
syndicates and companies outside the Lloyd's market, each of whom subscribes
to part of it an agreed premium rate.
The new system was agreed by the London Insurance Market Network.

FT  18 APR 91 / Bush meeting with Dalai Lama risks Chinese anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has held a meeting in Washington with the Dalai Lama,
the exiled spiritual leader of 6m Tibetans, risking an angry reaction from
Peking.
The Tibetan leader, forced to leave his homeland by China in 1959, has
frequently had meetings with members of the US Congress which has voted over
the years against Chinese actions in Tibet, but his first meeting with
President Bush was politically significant.
The White House attempted to play down the meeting held at the White House
on Tuesday evening. Reporters and photographers were not allowed to record
the start of the meeting, as is customary, and no details of the talks were
released.
After the meeting, the Dalai Lama expressed satisfaction with the visit, and
warned that China had escalated its suppressions of Tibet. He said he found
President Bush to be a man of 'warm, human feelings.'
Since the US and China normalised relations more than a decade ago, the
White House has snubbed the Dalai Lama on previous visits.
US-Chinese relations are now under strain because of reported arms sales by
Peking to the Middle East and the possibility Washington may withdraw most
favoured nation trading status for Chinese exports.
The Chinese government has protested at the meeting, but the Dalai Lama's
supporters portrayed it as a shift from the President's previous policy of
appeasing China by remaining silent on Tibet.
For several weeks the media in Peking has been carrying almost daily stories
on what is officially known as the 'peaceful liberation' of Tibet. In the
run-up to the 40th anniversary on May 23 of the 'liberation,' which Tibetans
regard as an occupation of their country, tension is reported to be mounting
in the capital, Lhasa, where the Chinese army has applied tough repressive
measures.
Tibetan resentment against Chinese plans to erect a 70m high monument in
Lhasa to mark their rule over Tibet, and for a major celebration on the
anniversary day, threaten to lead to outbreaks of violence those who feel
there is only cause for sorrow.
President Bush's meeting with the Dalai Lama contrasts sharply with the
refusal of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, to see the
Tibetan spiritual leader on his visit to the UK last month.

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government is to launch a campaign to improve its
international standing, after last week's agreement with foreign bank
creditors on arrears payments.
'We feel we've turned a corner with this accord and can now hope for a new
climate in our international dealings,' said Mr Marcos Azambuja,
director-general of the Brazilian foreign office.
Ms Zelia Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is planning trips to Japan,
Europe and the US to try to recapture the support initially given to the
government's adjustment plan. President Fernando Collor plays host to
Britain's Prince Charles next week and, in June, will visit President George
Bush.
Brazil intends to remove the major thorns in trade relations with the US by
introducing patent protection and ending a law which prevents importing of
information technology similar to products manufactured in Brazil.
Brazil is blacklisted by the US commerce department for failing to deal with
these matters and for pirating of US films. The US, Brazil's biggest
creditor, did much to ensure the recent delay of a Dollars 350m loan from
the IADB. This loan may be released soon, following the arrears accord, but
Brazil is far from shedding its image in the international financial
community as the black sheep of Latin America.

FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: Seeking a Third World accord after a near
miss - An assessment of progress in OECD talks on subsidy reductions for
export credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEEK-LONG talks in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development have broken up without final agreement on a package of subsidy
reductions for export credits and tied-aid loans to developing countries,
but hopes remain that a deal can be struck before June.
Participants described the outcome as a 'near-miss' rather than a breakdown,
after two years of often contentious discussion. A further meeting is
expected about May 17 to see whether final agreement is possible.
They said the outlines had now emerged of a possible package which would:
Eliminate routine interest rate subsidies on export credits to all
developing countries, although a transition period would be allowed for
loans to the poorest countries.
Impose strict limits on the use of tied-aid credits (export credits
sweetened with aid funds).
The draft package lists a range of circumstances in which such credits would
be banned altogether unless they had a minimum grant element of 80 per cent,
making them prohibitively expensive.
Everything now hinges, though, on whether agreement can be reached on how
the package would be implemented. Delegates said it was still far from
certain whether hard-line governments, such as that of the US, would
consider it had enough bite to be worth accepting.
Under the draft, the 80 per cent minimum grant rule would apply to credits
for all projects which would normally be commercially viable.
Exception would be made for deals involving the poorest developing countries
as well as some slightly better-off nations that are still eligible for
concessional loans from the World Bank's IDA affiliate.
The minimum grant would also apply on all tied-aid credits, regardless of
the commercial viability yardstick, to richer developing countries. These
are defined as countries too prosperous to be eligible for World Bank loans
of more than 17 years, the ceiling now being per capita income of Dollars
2,335.
The 80 per cent minimum grant might also apply on loans for all unusually
large projects, starting with those whose value was about Dollars 100m.
Conditions such as these should be sufficient, in theory, to allay US
worries that markets for certain products, such as telecommunications, were
being spoiled by mixed credits. The US has also become worried about the way
in which mixed-credits have become necessary to win any capital goods
business at all in certain countries, such as Indonesia.
Considerable uncertainty remains, even so, about the definitions and
implementation. In particular, delegates say there is no agreement yet about
how to define the yardstick of commercial viability. Only if points such as
this can be ironed out will it be possible to present a package to finance
mninisters for ratification at the OECD annual meeting in June.
A further issue which remains to be settled is the degree to which the
package would be enforceable.
Some exemptions might be allowed, but only after detailed consultation
procedures, culminating in some cases with the donor country being forced to
make a written explanation to the OECD secretary-general.

FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: ODA out of credit funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S Overseas Development Administration (ODA) has already run out of
money for spending on mixed credits in the 1991-92 fiscal year, according to
an assessment by the Export Group for the Constructional Industries.
The current year's allocation was quickly swallowed up by a surge of
business in the Far East, notably Malaysia, the group said.
The ODA only publishes figures for past spending on mixed credits and does
not normally say how much will be available when its aid budget, now running
at a total of some Pounds 1.8bn, is established each year. Yesterday,
officials confirmed that a large number of successes so far this year means
that the forecast for spending over the entire year had been exceeded.
However, the ODA said it was still prepared to consider mixed credit deals
that would not involve government spending before Aporil 1992.

THE planned marriage between the creators of Miss Piggy and Mickey Mouse
ended in the law courts yesterday when Henson Associates, a family-run
company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit against Walt Disney,
accusing Disney of knowingly violating copyrights and trademarks of the
Muppets.
The relationship between Disney and Henson dates to 1989, when the Hollywood
studio tentatively agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the rights
to some of Henson's most popular characters, including Miss Piggy and Kermit
the Frog, in a deal valued at Dollars 150m. But the arrangement started to
fall apart after Jim Henson's untimely death last year, thoughnegotiations
for a licensing agreement covering a Muppet movie due to open on May 4 and a
Muppet stage show continued until this month.
According to Henson, the negotiations failed because Disney insisted on
exclusive control of all Muppet characters in the two productions in order
to further its domination of the theme park market.
Disney, said yesterday the suit represented 'an enormous distortion of the
facts.' It said 'each Disney concession was met by another Henson demand
until finally it became impossible and the negotiations to acquire the
Henson company ended.'.

THE severity of New York's fiscal crisis was underlined yesterday by an
official estimate that the municipal budget deficit will be two-thirds
higher this year than predicted just two months ago.
Ms Elizabeth Holtzman, city comptroller, blamed lower tax receipts, a
swollen workforce, extra overtime and higher welfare spending, for the
expected jump in the deficit to Dollars 505m (Pounds 282m) from Dollars
304m.
The current fiscal year ends on June 30. About half the expected shortfall
is due to an erosion of personal income, sales and other tax receipts. Ms
Holtzman said the recession could lose New York 110,000 jobs in calendar
1991.
Mayor David Dinkins is trying to put together a package of spending cuts,
but the city's trade unions have refused to co-operate.

FT  18 APR 91 / Safe haven plan brings relief to Turkey: Ankara let off the
hook of international criticism over refugee hard line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TURKEY'S sense of relief was all too apparent yesterday after the
announcement that the US military is to help establish safe havens in
northern Iraq for the thousands of refugees camped on the Turkish border.
Although officials emphasise it is only a temporary solution for the Kurds,
the plan clearly lets Turkey off the hook.
Turkey has faced growing criticism from the aid community for confining the
refugees to border areas inaccessible to normal relief operations - the main
reason for this week's US led-helicopter airlift to the estimated 300,000
refugees on Turkey's southern border. Ankara has argued that the nature of
the terrain makes it more practical to assist the refugees inside Iraq. As
one official explained, the Iraqi lowlands are some 10km from the border
areas while Turkey's flat lands suitable for camps are 150km away.
Voicing support for the plan, Mr Yacob Youssif, a member of the Iraqi
opposition, predicted last week that 80 per cent of the refugees would
return if their security could be guaranteed.
Ankara's worry now is that the safe havens could all too easily become a
permanent Kurdish presence on its southern borders. A main concern for
Turkey has been to avoid a repeat of the 1988 crisis when it opened its
borders to 60,000 Kurds fleeing President Saddam Hussein's chemical attacks.
Of these, fewer than 2,000 were resettled, while almost 28,000 remain in
three Turkish camps in the south-east.
The US was flying reconnaisance missions yesterday while US officials
confirmed that experts from the Disaster Assistance Response Teams (Dart)
were already inside northern Iraq surveying possible sites. Meanwhile in
Diyarbakir, UK and French officials were in talks with the US military.
One diplomat suggested the plain between Habur bridge on the Turkish border
and the Kurdish town of Zakho might prove the most suitable site.
Yesterday a US military official confidently predicted the refugees could be
back inside Iraq within 30 to 40 days.
Mr Murat Sungar, the foreign ministry spokesman, said the plight of refugees
could not just be ignored 'because there is no consensus in the UN'.
Earlier this week, Mr Kurtcebe Alptemocin, the foreign minister, said there
would have to be a UN sanction for the plan. However, the ministry said
yesterday it was unlikely the Security Council would pass 'anything more
forceful than 688' - which states that Iraq's repression of the Kurds
constitutes a threat to international peace and security.
Before Tuesday's announcement of the safe havens, Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees, said the aid community had to be
'imaginative' while conceding that a US military presence might be necessary
to secure the safe haven plan. For all that, it remains unclear how the US
can hand over the operation to the UN without further Security Council
resolutions.
Turkey says it will provide logistical support to the refugees returning
home, airbases to supply the safe havens and national TV and radio to give
information on the best routes back into Iraq.
Turkey says it has no plans for a military role inside Iraq. However, its
bases at Incirlik and Batman are likely to be used by US and other allied
aircraft to police the skies.
The local governor's announcement this week that 40,000 would be moved down
onto lower ground near Silopi was described as the humanitarian gesture, and
a not a change in policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the EC agreed last night that Europe should be 'associated' with
the Middle East peace process but both sides stopped short of suggesting the
Community co-sponsor the direct Arab-Israeli negotiations which Washington
is trying to launch.
This interim formula emerged after a meeting between EC foreign ministers
and Mr James Baker on the eve of the US secretary of state's third peace
mission to the region.
It did not meet the EC's request to be more directly involved but, diplomats
said it reflected a state of play where it was still not clear whether
Washington could get talks started at all.
Prior to the meeting, senior European diplomats insisted that the EC would
accept only full 'co-sponsorship' of peace talks, along with the US and the
Soviet Union.
Israel, which has accepted in principle the US plan for face-to-face talks
with the Arabs, objects to close European involvement because of the EC's
long-standing call for a UN-sponsored peace conference which would include
the Palestinians.
Mr Baker said after the meeting that his primary objective was 'to establish
a process that has some reasonable chance of success and of being begun in
the first place'. But he added that 'we have made it very clear to Israel
that Europe can contribute to this process and should be involved.'
The EC's usefulness is in part because it has favoured the 'international'
peace conference sought by Syria and the Palestinian Liberation
Organisation. Such a UN-backed conference would have at the top of its
agenda Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the 'land-for-peace'
formula requiring Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories in
exchange for a settlement.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK company aims to rid Kuwait of bombs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the first contracts for clearing Kuwait of Iraqi mines and unexploded
allied bombs is expected to be signed this weekend by Royal Ordnance, the UK
arms company, and the Kuwaiti government.
The deal would be valued 'in the low hundreds of millions of dollars,'
according to one British official.
Unusually, Royal Ordnance, part of British Aerospace, would sub-contract
much of the early munitions clearance to a 150-strong unit of the British
army, the 21st squadron of the Royal Engineers. Members of the unit would
receive army pay - a factor which gave Royal Ordnance a significant price
advantage in bidding for the work.
The Royal Engineers would undertake the work for the first four months,
after which it is understood that Royal Ordnance would provide its own
clearance team.
The emergency clear-up of unexploded munitions in Kuwait, which has
concentrated on main roads and civilian areas, has been conducted
exclusively so far by allied military units and is nearing completion. To
date, more than 3m munitions of various types have been cleared.
The remaining task in the state is colossal. Iraqi minefields along the
beaches and southern border of Kuwait are untouched, while hundreds of
deserted Iraqi ammunition dumps still scatter the city.
A serious problem is the clearance of unexploded allied 'bomblets', which
litter the deserts of north-east Kuwait and large tracts of the southern
oilfields, where Iraqi armoured positions were heavily bombed.
Bomb disposal experts in Kuwait estimate that millions of such bomblets
remain unexploded, largely because they fell into cushioning sand.
'Sorting out that lot will take months - to do the oil wells thoroughly may
take years,' said Lt Col Mike Brooke of the Royal Engineers, who is
co-ordinating the allied clear-up.
Kay Associates, the US ordnance group, has already won a contract to clear
up three Kuwaiti air bases. The group had close links with the emirate's air
force, for which it provided training before the invasion.
States International and UBX, two other large US ordnance companies, are
also in Kuwait vying for what amounts to the largest munitions clearance
ever attempted. Some experts reckon a full clearance would take years and
leave little change out of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 561m).

THE German government yesterday agreed a sharp increase in aid for Kurdish

Bonn.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign minister, said German hospitals would

Mr Genscher, who will fly to eastern Anatolia in Turkey tomorrow to inspect
the relief operations, said the lives of 'hundreds of thousands' were at
stake.
In an unusual display of harmony, the German Bundestag unanimously condemned
Iraq's persecution of the Kurdish people as 'attempted genocide'. A motion
proposed by the government and opposition supported the use of military
force in the region if necessary to dissuade the Baghdad regime from further
action against the Kurds.

FT  18 APR 91 / Business cool to plea for economic co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE business leaders yesterday reacted coolly to a plea for economic
co-operation from Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.
Mr Gorbachev, who is visiting Japan for the first time, made an impassioned
appeal for help in a speech to an audience of 550 Japanese businessmen.
He listed oil and gas, forestry, fishing, tourism and other fields where he
wanted Japanese collaboration. 'Let's not lose time,' he said. 'Don't hold
back from taking part in these great projects.'
But his audience showed little enthusiasm, reflecting the Japanese view that
the long-running territorial dispute between the two countries must be
resolved before economic co-operation can begin and that the Soviet economy
is in any case too chaotic to absorb much investment.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of Keidanren, the main Japanese employers'
federation and host for yesterday's meeting, gave his guest a blunt message.
Japanese business would co-operate with the Soviet Union but only on two
conditions. 'Our two countries must solve their political problems. And
since the economic conditions and infrastructure in your country are
inadequate, there must be movement towards developing the foundations for an
orderly market economy.'
Earlier Mr Gorbachev got a similarly cool, though less blunt, response from
Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, who also said that Japan
would not develop economic relations unless there was progress on dispute
over Japan's claim to four islands seized by the Soviet Union in 1945. Mr
Gorbachev told his business audience that Mr Kaifu had told him Japan would
look at projects on a case-by-case basis.

FT  18 APR 91 / US struggles to shake off Iraq's deadly embrace: Review of a
reluctant policy shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's hopes of a quick, clean departure of all US forces
from the Gulf lie shattered.
By committing between 5,000 and 10,000 troops to northern Iraq to set up
refugee camps to shelter, feed and clothe hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Mr
Bush has been forced reluctantly into a fundamental shift in US policy.
Until just a few days ago, he hoped to contain relief efforts to the
Iraq-Turkey border zones - with the United Nations rather than the US taking
charge. Now, under mounting pressure at home and abroad, he has been been
pressed into a commitment which seems at best open-ended.
The risks of GIs being lured into renewed clashes with the remnants of
President Saddam Hussein's army are obvious. One point in Washington's
favour is that Iraqi forces have not been involved in action north of the
36th parallel since the US imposed its ban last week. Further guarantees
from Iraq may have been sought via the United Nations - though this has yet
to be confirmed or denied by US officials.
'We are operating on the assumption that they (US forces) will not be
attacked with the United Nations in there. I think there would be a serious
problem for Saddam Hussein if he took on the entire United Nations,' a
grim-faced Mr Bush told reporters on Tuesday night.
The obvious caveat is that since the end of the Gulf war, Mr Bush and his
advisers have been operating on a number of assumptions which to date have
proved false.
In the afterglow of a famous victory, the White House was convinced that
someone, somewhere in the defeated Iraqi army would lead a coup against Mr
Saddam. Once again, US officials, including Mr Bush, under-estimated their
opponent's staying power.
At the same time, military and political intelligence appears to have
misread the importance of the substantial Iraqi armed forces stationed in
northern Iraq near the Turkish border throughout the war.
These forces emerged largely unscathed from the Gulf war, which was fought
in southern Iraq and Kuwait. Mr Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national
security adviser, once termed the northern army as 'defensive in nature'.
What Mr Scowcroft and others failed to predict was that these 'defensive'
forces would turn murderously offensive against the rebellious Kurds in the
north and Shi'ites in the south.
On Tuesday night, Mr Bush again sought to justify his reluctance to
intervene in defence of those he had at one time incited to overthrow Mr
Saddam's regime - an issue which Democratic critics and some Republicans in
his own party are forcing him to confront.
'We never implied that,' he said, 'All along I have said that the US is not
going to intervene militarily in Iraq's internal affairs and risk being
drawn into a Vietnam-style quagmire.'
Even Democrats who supported Mr Bush's decision to go to war - such as
Congressman Stephen Solarz of New York - are now complaining that US forces
should have pressed on to Baghdad to 'finish the job'. They have been joined
by the much larger group of Democrats, including Senator Edward Kennedy, who
supported continuing UN sanctions to remove Iraq from Kuwait rather than the
use of force.
The Gulf war was prosecuted with the perceived lessons of Vietnam very much
in mind, such as avoiding a half-fought war with unclear objectives and
ambiguous public backing. Yet the other lesson is that pulling out a
500,000-strong army at the end of a war in the Middle East - even a conflict
lasting six weeks - is unrealistic.
The US, which supported Saddam Hussein with arms, credits and technology for
much of the 1980s, has discovered that extricating itself from the deadly
embrace with Baghdad is proving a good deal more difficult than first
imagined - the famous Gulf victory notwithstanding.

FT  18 APR 91 / European Diary (Ireland): Narrowing road for Ireland's
travelling people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S travelling people do not appear in the tourist brochures. But
their caravans are parked on the roadside approaches to most of the
country's cities and towns. Clothes are hung on hedges. Children play among
bits of scrap metal and rubbish.
The travellers - also referred to as 'itinerants' or more commonly 'tinkers'
 -are Ireland's nomads. They are on the bottom rung of Irish society.
An investigation by a government sponsored body in 1986 described their
living conditions as intolerable. Half had no access to piped water, a
toilet or electricity; 40 per cent lived by the side of the road on
unofficial sites under constant fear of eviction. 'No humane and decent
society, once made aware of such circumstances, could permit them to
persist,' it concluded.
Circumstances have changed little. The infant mortality rate of travellers
is nearly three times the national average. Life expectancy is far lower.
To most of the population, the travellers are a troublesome group who turn
garden suburbs into scrapyards, and steal milk from doorsteps and washing
off the line. They drink and fight and are not to be trusted. The
traditional view, reflected in much official policy, is that travellers
should be settled and blend in with the rest of the population.
But travellers are now pressing for better treatment. They want recognition
as a separate ethnic group, challenging the view of Ireland as a
mono-cultural country, where racism does not exist - simply because, apart
from the Irish themselves, there are no races.
There are about 21,000 travellers in Ireland - half of one per cent of the
population. While much of their history is either lost or is as yet
unresearched, there are written references to them in the 12th century. The
travellers' language, called cant or gammon, is an Irish yiddish, utilising
old Gaelic words, English and words which seem to have roots in various
other European languages.
Travellers have tended to marry other travellers. There is a deep sense of
clanship and even today marriages with 'settled people' are rare.
Until recently travellers would roam the roads of Ireland, practising
various trades along the way. They would also cross to England and Scotland.
The men would make tin pots and pans (hence 'tinker') and the women would
sell. In autumn there would be potato-picking.
Travellers were also renowned as traders, in particular of horses and
donkeys. Like nomads in many parts of the world, they have seen their old
way of life all but disappear.
Plastic and aluminium ruined the tin-making trade. Increased mechanisation
meant fewer farm jobs. Door-to-door selling has become a thing of the past.
Most of all, travellers have found it increasingly difficult to find places
to park their caravans. Often there have been clashes with local residents.
Mary and Kathleen McDonagh are travellers who run, with government and
private help, a laundry service in a traveller's settlement on the outskirts
of Dublin.
Cousins in one of the more famous traveller families, they have been living
in the same area for 17 years. 'We were here before any of the houses round
here were built,' says Mary McDonagh. 'Travellers have nowhere to go any
more.' Though both women live with their families in government-built
houses, they still regard themselves as travellers.
'In summer especially, I'd want to be on the move,' says Kathleen McDonagh.
'I'd love to take off again. My children feel the same.' She admits times
were hard. She had 12 children: only six are still living.
Travellers have begun to protest about the way they are discriminated
against. They are not allowed into most public houses and they say that
recently insurance companies have begun refusing them cover for their cars
and vans. In Dublin they have to go to a special office to collect welfare
payments, unlike others who can make such collections in their
neighbourhoods. Some schools insist that travellers attend separate classes.
Mr Niall Crowley, a social worker who has been involved with travellers for
many years, says that there must be an anti-discrimination law in Ireland,
as in other EC countries. 'Settled society is destroying the travellers way
of life and making it illegal,' says Mr Crowley. 'They were once
self-sufficient. Now they have no alternative but to exist on government
handouts.'
There is some evidence that official attitudes are changing. Mr Charles
Haughey, the Irish prime minister, recently spoke of the 'depth and value'
of the travellers culture. The government realises that the travellers won't
just go away. The birth rate in the travelling community is well above
average: 80 per cent of travellers are under 25 years of age.
The young, like the old, insist on keeping their travelling way of life,
despite all the difficulties. 'It's hard to burn the wildness out of a wild
bird's nose' is an old travellers saying.

FT  18 APR 91 / EBRD: Reconstruction bank takes off into a fog - The EBRD is
launched but what its business will be is something of a mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based
international institution charged with helping the economic and political
regeneration of eastern Europe, is now officially open for business. But
quite what will be its business is still something of a mystery even after
the three-day inaugural meeting which ended in London yesterday.
The issue may be clarified later this week once the bank's board of
directors - charged with the hands-on running of the bank - ends the meeting
it is due to start today. It will begin the task of establishing the bank's
operating and lending criteria.
The picture will become even clearer when the position of vice-president in
charge of the bank's all-important merchant banking division has been
filled. Without this individual (who must be American) in place, the shape
of the division responsible for 60 per cent of the bank's activities will
not be apparent.
Despite this, the bank has aroused strong feelings for such a youthful
institution and many appear already to have written it off.
Hostility was initially stirred by what appeared to outsiders to be an
Anglo-French conspiracy which gave the bank a French president and settled
it in London.
Many question whether its president, Mr Jacques Attali, is the man for the
job. A man of ideas and an attractive figure to some, but regarded by others
as arrogant, he is emphatically not a banker, and freely admits it. He says
he can hire bankers - although the senior people so far hired are
overwhelmingly from the public sector in west and east Europe.
Mr Attali's high-flown vision of the bank seems in conflict with the more
prosaic view of its role outlined by some of its 41 shareholders - 39
governments together with the European Community and the European Investment
Bank.
Mr Attali and his mentor, President Francois Mitterrand, speak of the bank
as the first pan-European organisation: the seed corn of a greater Europe
stretching from Dublin to Moscow. The US and others would prefer it to
concentrate on a narrower role of encouraging the development of the market
economy and bolstering democracies in the region.
Mr Attali yesterday denied any conflict of views about the institution. He
said its role was defined by the articles of association, of which he was
the chief architect. There was, he neglected to say, a battle-royal last
year over these articles as shareholders, led by the US, impressed on the
bank their desire not to let Mr Attali have a free hand.
These negotiations gave the shareholders, as represented by the board of
directors, a strong role in the day-to-day running of the bank. They also
resulted in the bank having a 60-40 split between lending to the private and
the public sector sectors. More precisely, the bank must devote 60 per cent
of its resources in the early years to the commercial sector - that is,
private businesses and those still in the state sector but are being
privatised. Forty per cent will be devoted to infrastructure.
Both decisions, taken against Mr Attali's wishes, give rise themselves to
potential difficulties. An active board means a large part of the running
costs of the bank will be devoted to keeping the 23-strong board - larger
than the World Bank's - in permanent place in London. In addition, the
strictures of the bank will limit its infrastructure lending, the area in
which, according to some observers, eastern Europe's needs are greatest.
Shareholders have also expressed concern that the bank should not interfere
with the operations of other multilateral institutions in east Europe. The
International Monetary Fund is providing balance of payments support, the
World Bank project finance and help for economic sector reform, while its
sister institution, the International Finance Corporation, is helping with
the private sector. The European Investment Bank is also providing project
finance, while private financial advisers from the City of London and
elsewhere are in evidence all over the region.
Mr Attali speaks of the importance of technical assistance, but there is
little technical experience in the bank and that would involve hiring
consultants. He also stresses the bank's individuality in its lending rules:
conditions for lending will depend on political as well as economic
criteria. He speaks of a 'hierarchy of deterrence' against countries who
regress in either political or economic terms.
The bank is also the one multilateral organisation to be able to lend to the
Soviet Union - although in a strictly limited fashion to start with. But the
political and economic disintegration of the Soviet state makes this seem
like a less attractive prospect than it did even a year ago.

Italy's chamber of deputies has put off until tomorrow a vote of confidence
on Mr Giulio Andreotti's new government, in order to allow more time for
debate, writes Haig Simonian in Rome.
The decision, which came just before Mr Andreotti began presenting yesterday
the government's programme for the remaining year of the current
legislature, followed a request by the Republican party, which has decided
no longer to participate in the five-party coalition.

More money and greater care will have to be spent on the 2.2bn tonnes of
garbage put into landfill dumps around the EC each year under a plan
unveiled by the Commission yesterday, writes David Buchan in Brussels.
The plan would harmonise environmental and technical standards for
landfills, encourage the raising of disposal charges to cover the full costs
of creating proper dumps and eventually re-landscaping them, and require
each member state to set up a special fund to cover the costs of fighting
pollution from landfills.

EC LEGISLATION to end piracy of computer software leapt its final hurdle

The European Commission feared MEPs would amend the heavily-lobbied measure,
upsetting the compromise agreed by ministers four months ago. But the
amendments failed to muster the necessary votes, despite the backing of the
Socialists, the largest political grouping.
The proposed directive will extend copyright laws to computer software, but
allow a limited amount of 'reverse engineering' - the unpicking of programs
to create software compatible with the large computer companies' most
popular products.
The unamended directive will now be put before the next meeting of internal
market ministers in May for formal adoption.

FT  18 APR 91 / US arms were diverted to Baghdad says White House
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House confirmed yesterday that Jordanian companies had been used
to divert militarily useful US equipment to Iraq in defiance of the United
Nations embargo, only weeks before the bombing of Baghdad in January.
But it denied parts of a Financial Times article, published yesterday, which
said the administration had ignored warnings about Jordan's role as an
illegal pipeline for military goods into neighbouring Iraq in violation of
the UN embargo in force at the time.
According to the White House, several Jordanian companies were identified as
conduits for the illegal shipment of goods to Baghdad during a joint
investigation between the US and Jordan into middlemen suspected of acting
for Baghdad in illegal US-Iraqi arms trafficking last December.
But in a prepared statement which disputed parts of the FT report, Mr Marlin
Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said the administration had acted
'promptly and forcefully' whenever allegations of sanctions-busting had been
received. 'We feel they (the sanctions) were very successful', he added.
Mr Fitzwater said Jordan had co-operated in the effort to clamp down on
illegal trafficking of spare parts and computer equipment to Iraq.
He confirmed that Mr Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser,
received a warning last December that shipments of sensitive US military
equipment destined for Jordan were likely to be passed to Iraq.
According to past and present US government officials, the White House
failed to act on this and allowed the shipments, including diesel engine
components for armoured vehicles and electronic testing equipment, to enter
Jordan.
The officials also said that it was only several weeks later - after
hostilities had begun in the Gulf - that the warning was acknowledged.
Mr Fitzwater disputed these allegations, declaring that the Continued on
Page 24
administration had 'no intelligence information nor other information from
the Department of Commerce that diversion of items shipped legally to Jordan
was occurring'.
Mr Fitzwater also said the Commerce Department had sought broader powers to
inspect individual shipments to Jordan from the US. In the absence of any
confirmation that shipments were being diverted to Iraq, several Federal
agencies concluded it would be wrong to punish innocent Jordanian companies
along with 'the few known diverting companies who were being closely
monitored'.
The conclusion of the review was that the individual companies with special
licence privileges were not the Iraqi front companies of possible concern
for violating the sanctions.
The White House alerted other Federal agencies, including the Commerce
Department, to monitor more closely and if necessary stop all shipments
deemed to be at risk of violating the UN embargo.
Mr Fitzwater said the US asked governments to investigate more than 800
suspected violations of the UN embargo, including by companies in Jordan,
involving several Iraqi front companies.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev faces a potential challenge to his leadership
from within the ranks of his own Communist party when he returns from this
week's visit to Tokyo.
The hardline Soyuz (Union) parliamentary group meets in Moscow this weekend
to consider calls by many members for Mr Gorbachev to step down as Soviet
president.
At the same time, his opponents in the party apparatus are threatening to
call for his resignation as party general secretary at a central committee
plenum on Wednesday.
Mr Leonid Kravchenko, the Soviet broadcasting chief who is a close associate
of President Gorbachev, said in Tokyo yesterday that the plenum would not
'go smoothly'.
'There is a certain unrest within the party over the fact that the general
secretary has not paid enough attention to work in the party,' Mr Kravchenko
said. 'Some speeches might be harsh and opinion might be unpredictable.'
The Soviet president is already under severe attack from the nearly
two-month-old political strikes engulfing the country.
Independent trade unions in the Russian Federation yesterday agreed to stage
a one-hour warning strike on April 26 to show support for the miners'
demands, which include the resignation of Mr Gorbachev. This is likely to
involve for the first time workers from the vital oil and gas industries.
Opposition forces led by Mr Boris Yeltsin and backed by striking coal miners
want the Continued on Page 24
Icy politeness, Page 4
Soviet leader to hold 'round table' talks as a prelude to a coalition
government, an idea which Mr Gorbachev's aides say he is considering.
Now Communist party hardliners, borrowing the slogan 'resign' from the
democrats, are accusing the president of indecision in tackling labour
unrest, economic collapse, and rebellious republics.
Mr Boris Gidaspov, head of the Leningrad Communist Party, has accused the
Soviet leader of 'unforgivable passivity and inconsistency' in handling the
economic crisis.
Mr Stanislav Girenko, the Ukrainian party chief, said Mr Gorbachev should
not combine the two posts of president and general secretary.
The threats are tempered by the awareness of many Communists that getting
rid of Mr Gorbachev could lose the party whatever authority it has left.
Mr Nikolai Stolyarov, a central committee member and a senior official of
the hardline Russian Communist Party, said yesterday: 'I think and hope that
the plenum will show enough political realism to understand a simple truth -
you cannot put all the responsibility for what is happening in the country
on the shoulders of one leader.'

FT  18 APR 91 / NatWest puts Dollars 150m into troubled US subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank has injected Dollars 150m (Pounds 84.2m) in fresh
capital into its troubled US subsidiary to cover mounting losses caused by
the recession and a heavy exposure to the depressed New York real estate
market.
New York-based National Westminster Bancorp, which is wholly owned by the
British clearer, yesterday reported a Dollars 190.9m loss in the first
quarter, and disclosed that almost a tenth of its total loan portfolio is
non-performing. Its loan loss provisions have risen sharply to Dollars
221.9m, from Dollars 55.9m a year earlier. The latest setback follows losses
totalling Dollars 488m in 1989 and 1990. The British parent contributed
Dollars 200m in new capital last year.
Mr John Tugwell, who took over less than a week ago as chief executive of
NatWest Bancorp, said that the first-quarter performance was 'clearly
unacceptable'. He cautioned that 'until the economy improves, it would be an
imprudent banker who says that the end (of the problems) are nigh'.
But the British bank also affirmed continuing support for NatWest Bancorp.
Mr Tugwell, who was in charge of NatWest's international division and who
still sits on the main board in London, said: 'We have the basis of a good
business here, and are looking forward to the day when the economy turns
around and the problems are behind us'.
Mr Tugwell replaced Mr Bill Knowles, who resigned last month. Several other
changes have taken place in the senior management ranks, including the
appointment of a senior vice-president for credit policy.
NatWest Bancorp, with assets of Dollars 22.5bn, has 260 offices in New York
and New Jersey, where it serves mainly the retail market and mid-sized
businesses with annual revenues below Dollars 250m. The bank entered the US
market in 1979 with the purchase of the former National Bank of North
America.
The problem property loans, which account for 45 per cent of the bank's
total non-performing portfolio of Dollars 1.47bn, are centred on residential
and office projects in New York City. The bank is obtaining independent
appraisals on all the buildings to determine what write-offs may be
necessary.
Mr Tugwell said the rest of the non-performing portfolio consists of a
diverse mix of business which has been affected by the general economic
downturn.
NatWest Bancorp is forging a new strategy of strengthening its profitable
consumer and small-business operations, especially by developing new sources
of fee and other non-interest income.
The bank already has some 100,000 credit card holders, and may enter the
insurance and investment-products business when regulatory barriers are
eased.

FT  18 APR 91 / Top pay deals exceed inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S top businessmen are still awarding themselves pay rises well in
excess of inflation and the growth in company profits.
This is in spite of calls for pay restraint in the light of the recession
and the need to control costs following the UK's full membership of the
European Monetary System.
A survey of top pay deals by Hay Management Consultants for the
Confederation of British Industry showed an average rise in base salaries of
14 per cent from August 1990 to January this year, compared with the same
period a year earlier. Bonus payments showed an average rise of 10.6 per
cent.
The continued rise in top executive pay compares unfavourably with inflation
and the growth in company profits. Over the same six month period, the
retail prices index rose by an average rate of 10 per cent. Company profits,
by contrast, fell by more than 6 per cent, according to government figures.
The growth in executive pay, following the economic boom of the late 1980s,
has become a boardroom issue. ICI directors' pay was cut last year and this
week Lloyds Bank froze the pay of executive directors and general managers.
Publication of the survey has threatened the relationship be-tween Hay and
the CBI, which yesterday 'disassociated' itself from the survey, saying it
had not seen the results or the press announcement.

US TROOPS yesterday moved into northern Iraq to begin surveying sites for
six or seven refugee centres for Iraqi Kurds under the protection of US,
British and French forces.
Initial Pentagon plans envisage between 5,000 and 10,000 US soldiers
building, running and guarding the camps.
Protection against possible Iraqi attack will be provided mostly by 'quick
reaction forces' of army and marine units based outside Iraq, probably in
Turkey, and mainly US combat air patrols.
Britain is expected to send about 2,000 troops. The UK 1st Battalion, the
Cheshire Regiment, was last night on standby. France is to supply about
1,000 troops.
Mr Pete Williams, Pentagon spokesman, said it would be two weeks before the
camps were 'ready to go'. He added that the refugees would probably be
disarmed to prevent the camps becoming bases for Kurdish rebels.
Iraq denounced the move as a continuation of unwarranted foreign
intervention in its affairs. It said it would hamper what Mr Ahmed Hussein
Khudayer, foreign minister, described as Baghdad's own efforts to resolve
the refugee problem.
A ceremony at which United Nations and Iraqi officials would have signed an
agreement on a plan for UN relief camps was abruptly cancelled at Iraq's
request.
An Information Ministry official said it 'needed to study further' some
parts of the plan, which would establish 'humanitarian centres' operated by
civilian UN personnel in northern and southern Iraq.
In Luxembourg European Community foreign ministers last night backed US
insistence that the return to Iraq was justified under the UN's resolution
688.
But the Anglo-US-French move took senior UN officials off guard. Ambassador
Eric Suy, who heads a UN team visiting Iraq to discuss the refugee crisis,
described the allied plan as 'absolutely a new element in the light of which
we will have to reconsider our position'. Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN
Secretary General, said in Paris that the western plan to deploy troops in
northern Iraq would require Baghdad's permission.
'We would like first to be in contact with the Iraqi authorities, to see
what would be their reaction to such a military presence on their
territory,' he said.
Mr Perez de Cuellar said that, if the troops were to be deployed under the
aegis of the UN, 'it would be necessary to obtain the agreement of the
Security Council'.
Britain stressed its desire for the work of allied troops to be transferred
to the UN as soon as possible. Downing Street indicated it would support
another UN resolution to that effect if necessary.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said his motive had been to take action
as swiftly as possible. 'We do not have a long time to leave the Kurds where
they are at the moment,' he said.
The prime minister received support from opposition parties for his
persistence in pushing his plan for havens.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (16): Why the institutions
are reluctant - Property Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION FUNDS rescued the property industry from the crash of the early
1970s. But this time round, they are being viewed more as scapegoats than
potential saviours.
The evaporation of institutional demand for property, however justified, has
been a source of dismay for the overbuilt and often overborrowed property
industry.
'The British property industry has to some extent been abandoned by its
traditional investor base, namely the institutions,' said Sir Nigel Mobbs,
chairman of Slough Estates, at a recent dinner for the British Council for
Offices.
From the viewpoint of the property industry, it seemed as though the funds
have been looking for any excuse to limit their investments (with a few
notable exceptions, part- icularly among Scottish funds). In the early
1980s, they were deterred from property invest- ment by the strong perform-
ance of equities.
After the equity market crashed in 1987, funds were unwilling to invest in
property because the proportion of property had already risen in their
shrunken portfolios.
Property's share of pension fund portfolios fell from 20 per cent at the
start of the 1980s to 8 per cent today, according to Richard Ellis,
chartered surveyors. The pension funds' cash flow into property has been
falling from Pounds 509m in 1985 to an outflow of Pounds 118m in the nine
months to September 1990, according to Debenham Tewson Research.
The meagre inflow of pension fund cash going to property is nowhere near
enough to mop up the new developments coming onto the market - particularly
as some of the most prominent investors such as Friends Provident, Norwich
Union and the Prudential have their own development programmes to mop up
cash flow.
Some estimate that it will take 15 years for the institutions to absorb the
speculative property financed by the Pounds 40bn of debt outstanding to the
property industry.
If this overhang of property was not a sufficient deterrent to investment,
property's traditional virtues of stability and counter-cyclicality have
been dented by the current downturn, when its volatility and timing have
matched the equity market. 'Historically  .. property could be regarded as
stable, and to some extent counter-cyclical but this seems no longer to be
the case,' says Sir Brian Corby, the Prudential's chief executive.
Some funds, such as the Norwich Union, have also been influenced by
historical performance figures. Looking at statistics going back to the last
century, it reckons that equities have performed better than property.
The issue is not, however, cut and dried. Property, like UK equities, has
been the best-performing asset class for four years since 1973. Property has
performed better than UK equities over the short term, although worse over
the medium term of five to 15 years.
The pension funds' attitude towards property is partly a result of changes
in their circumstances since the early 1970s, when they were looking for a
hedge against inflation and, in addition, they were underweight in property
after a period of rapid growth.
Their policy towards property has also been affected by the shift in the
nature of pension funds. The large funds which have traditionally been big
investors in property have had to make earlier-than- anticipated payouts as
a result of workers taking early retirement.
This has sometimes led to a shorter-term perspective, which has discouraged
investment in a rela- tively illiquid medium like property.
At the same time, market share has been won by smaller funds, which are less
likely to invest in property because of high management costs and the
difficulties of creating a sufficiently diversified portfolio.
But perhaps the most important change for the pension funds' property
holdings was the inroads made by overseas equities, following the abolition
of exchange controls.
'Property was in the 1960s and 1970s the 'third asset' in institutional
portfolios, providing long-term security and inflation hedging to complement
holdings in equities and gilts  .. Deregulation has introduced overseas
investment, principally in equities as a contender for third place,' argues
the Investment Property Databank, a research body.
These factors have contributed to an unprec- edented rise in yields, the
yardstick which measures the risks and prospects attached to an investment.
After a slow increase for most of the 1980s, yields shot up from 7.7 per
cent in December 1988 to 9.6 per cent today, according to the Investment
Property Databank, a research body.
Many investors and their advisers now believe that yields have moved out
sufficiently to take account of bearish factors, although the recovery is
expected to be slow because of the amount of property overhanging the market
and pressure on rents. Some of the Scottish funds, which have maintained an
interest in property during the slump, are particularly prominent.
'I would like to think that yields have gone as far as they will go,
particularly looking at retail warehousing which at yields of 12 per cent is
basically self-financing.
'With a sensible tenant and a good location, there is only upside to come,'
says Mr Mike Perkins, a director of Commercial Union.
These arguments will not sway every institution. For instance, Norwich
Union, one of the most prominent institutional investors in property, has
decided to bring the proportion of property in its portfolio down to the
average in its industry.
However, anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been an increase in
allocations to property - and not just because the recent outperformance of
equities has left funds underweight in property.
'We have seen in the last three months a significant increase of buying
requirements from the pension funds and insurance companies and estimate
that it has virtually doubled since the start of the year,' says Mr Robert
Farnes, investment partner of Hillier Parker.
The problem is that, despite the quantity of property overhanging the
market, there is not much available that the institutions want to buy.
Partly, this is a matter of size - most new office projects and shopping
centres are too large for all but a handful of pension funds. It is also
because little good quality property is coming onto the market at these
yields. Even banks have delayed putting companies into receivership until
the market improves.
'Leaving aside obvious areas of over-supply such as central London offices,
the availability of income producing stock of suitable value size, securely
let to stable tenants, is likely to remain restricted,' says Mr Andrew
Hearn, a partner at Richard Ellis.
He cites, as examples, industrial and shop units where many pension funds
have relatively low weightings and there are very few forced sellers.
That leaves a 'black hole' of property where sellers' aspirations and
buyers' requirements are funda- mentally mismatched.
Even if institutions do start to buy more real estate, the property industry
may have to find the bulk of its funds elsewhere.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (17): For a few dollars
more - Performance Measurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Maurice Stonefrost of the British Rail pension fund was commissioned
more than a year ago by the National Association of Pension Funds'
Investment Committee to head an independent inquiry into performance
measurement, it was at a time of intense controversy over so-called
'short-termism' by City fund managers.
There had been a series of hostile takeover bids for British companies.
Industrialists were quick to allege that fund managers were too ready to
accept a few pence more per share from a takeover bidder rather than back
existing managers. Moreover, they wanted ever-higher dividends, regardless
of the year-by-year fortunes of companies. A lot of captains of industry
were eager to suggest that the quarterly performance measurement to which
British pension funds are typically subjected was a prime source of
short-termism.
In the event, when the Stonefrost Committee reported in January this year it
became evident that (as in previous inquiries) such prejudices had failed to
stand up to detailed scrutiny. Performance measurement emerged primarily as
a technical matter rather than a key controversial theme of industrial
politics.
Nevertheless, the committee made several important points:
First, the background. Two performance measurement services are dominant in
the UK pension fund business. The bigger is that of the World Markets
Company, originally a soft commission service of Edinburgh stockbrokers Wood
Mackenzie, but now owned by the US financial giant Bankers Trust.
In 1990 WM, still based in Edinburgh, analysed 2,464 pension fund portfolios
in the UK, and more than 2,000 were regarded as suitable for inclusion in
the aggregate data relating to WM's 'universe' of funds. At the end of 1990
these WM-measured funds were valued at Pounds 209bn, representing, according
to WM, some 77 per cent of the UK pension fund industry (which by
implication was worth about Pounds 270bn at market value on that date).
The second company is Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) which
was formed some years ago out of the separate measurement operations of the
actuarial firms Bacon &amp; Woodrow, R Watson and Mercer Fraser, and was later
enlarged by the incorporation of the Noble Lowndes service.
During 1990 Caps measured 1,495 UK pension funds in its Trustee Service,
worth Pounds 127bn. Though the Caps service is smaller, its results are in
some ways more representative of the externally managed company pension
funds.
The WM Pension Fund Service, for its part, includes more of the giant Pounds
1bn-plus public sector schemes which in certain respects have different
characteristics, with much higher investments in directly-owned property,
for instance. At the end of last year the typical Caps fund held only 2.3
per cent of its assets in property, but the corresponding WM figure was some
9 per cent.
Nevertheless, the overall investment performance indicated by the two
services was almost identical in 1990: minus 10.6 per cent for WM and minus
10.5 per cent for Caps. Over 10 years WM shows an average annual return of
15.1 per cent, Caps of 15.4 per cent.
In addition there continue to be one or two independent performance services
run by consultants such as Godwins and Wyatt, although these are confined to
fairly specialist roles.
There are good technical reasons for measuring performance frequently - at
least quarterly - to achieve accuracy in the rate of return calculations.
But nobody suggests that fund managers should be assessed on such a
short-term basis (let alone on the monthly basis on which US funds are often
measured nowadays).
The Stonefrost Committee was concerned that fund managers should not be held
to account more frequently than once a year, and that trustees should fully
understand the meaning of the performance numbers, ideally with the help of
an annual briefing by the measurers.
It was also convinced that greater effort was needed to relate performance
measurement to the individual benchmarks or objectives which, more and more,
are being laid down for particular pension funds. The broad 'league table'
approach, relating to median-beating objectives or top quartile targets,
though still popular, is being rendered increasingly obsolete by the
diversity of benchmarks.
According to Mr Stonefrost: 'It is up to the funds themselves to seek to be
measured against like funds.' One result may be an increasing segmentation
of the performance measurement process. 'We don't think that the median is
going to go out of vogue,' says Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Caps, 'but
there may be a proliferation of medians.'
Aside from short-termism, the most controversial aspect of pension fund
performance measurement is probably the use (or rather, misuse) of
performance data by the fund managers themselves. The ability to outperform
over periods of three to five years has become absolutely fundamental to the
success of fund management companies in winning new business (even though
statistical evidence suggests there is little connection between past and
future performance). There is in consequence tremendous pressure on managers
to manipulate the data for marketing purposes.
Thus the Stonefrost Committee commented critically on a survey which
indicated that two-thirds of managers claimed to beat the median. It called
for an industry committee to be set up to establish standards for
performance statistics in advertising and marketing by investment managers.
The sort of manipulation which goes on is that managers leave out of their
records the funds from which they have been sacked (these tend, of course,
to be the bad performers), and they may leave in or out, on a subjective
basis, according to whether it suits them or not, funds on which there is a
restricted brief. Also, they may advertise performance over odd periods,
thus contriving to minimise the impact of particular bad years.
A new committee is now being formed, through the NAPF and the fund managers'
trade body, the Institutional Fund Managers' Association, to establish a
code of conduct and thus clean up one of the murkier corners of the
performance measurement business.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (15): A sea change for
futures and options - Derivative Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the more interesting developments in recent years in pension fund
investment has been the increasing use of the equity derivative markets.
Until the late 1980s, futures and options were something that cautious
pension fund trustees avoided. The possibility of having a substantial part
of one's portfolio wiped out by what was viewed as extremely risky and
speculative products meant that most pension funds gave derivatives a wide
berth.
The prospect of unlimited losses filled trustees with horror. The
spectacular losses in some of the commodity futures traders confirmed their
suspicions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into the Chicago
futures market also created worries among the larger institutions that they
would be fleeced by unscrupulous floor traders.
The expense of introducing new computer systems which track the performance
of futures and options and the sheer technical difficulty of understanding
some of the derivative markets - particularly options  - has been a
deterrent. Finally, the inability of equity futures markets to operate
smoothly during the stock market crash of 1987 led to a disillusionment
among some fund managers, who were unable to use the markets to hedge
against their holdings of shares.
But there was one other important reason why pension funds avoided futures
and options. Until last year, futures transactions - those made to hedge a
portfolio - were liable for capital gains tax. Others - which were classed
as trading - were liable for corporation tax.
All that changed in the 1990 budget, when Mr John Major, then chancellor of
the exchequer, bowed to years of lobbying and exempted pension funds and
authorised unit trusts from tax on trading income from futures and options.
The Finance Act of July 1990 cleared the way for traded options and futures
to enjoy a more favourable tax treatment than that of their underlying
securities. Now, gains from futures and options are treated as capital
rather than income.
These important regulatory change have been the catalyst for a major sea
change in pension funds' use of futures and options. 'These changes had a
big impact in making trustees feel more comfortable about the use of
derivatives,' says Mr Andrew Maclaren of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management.
'Before it was a bit of a grey area and that was enough to deter some funds
from those markets.'
One clear reflection of the changes has been the increased turnover of FT-SE
100 index futures on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. It
rose by more than 40 per cent in 1990.
According to Mr Nick Weinreb, deputy market secretary at Liffe, the tax
changes showed that the government believed futures and options were
important. 'Now there is much more awareness from trustees who are giving
approval to fund managers but also learning how they work.'
Liffe has organised three workshops over the last six months for trustees on
the use of futures. Mr Weinreb says the interest has been 'staggering.'
Fifty to 60 people have attended each workshop and with a further one
planned next month, over 200 trustees will have attended in total - which
represents a significant slice of the trustee community.
While it is true that trustees who attend Liffe's workshops must already
have an interest in derivatives, the questions being asked give an
interesting indication of the level of awareness among trustees - and the
results are surprising.
Rather than asking basic questions about how the markets work, trustees
tended to be interested in administrative and logistical problems. How are
futures and options accounted for and how are they valued, are the sorts of
points raised, says Mr Weinreb. Understanding how to manage the additional
paper flow; and the measurement of performance of futures are other common
questions.
Actuaries and fund managers agree that returns are enhanced only marginally
by the use of futures. The real benefit comes when a fund is seeking to
alter its exposure to different countries. As Mr Maclaren explains: 'The
historical industry practice has been to change asset allocation by buying
holdings in individual shares, whereas as now the trend is towards using
futures as a direct means of asset allocation, which is quicker and more
flexible. The futures positions can be unwound as attractive individual
holdings are built up if desired.'
The changes that have taken place are reflected in a recent survey by KPMG
Management Consulting of leading pension funds. Seven out of the 10 it
surveyed expected to increase their use of futures and options over the next
year. Meanwhile, eight out of 10 use derivatives for asset allocation trades
and only seven out of 10 use them for hedging purposes.
However, while there has been an increased use of derivatives by pension
funds the changes have been gradual. Practitioners say there has been no
'big bang'. So far only a minority of funds uses futures. While most of the
larger funds are using derivatives, of these only a handful have a majority
of their funds using derivatives.
The hesitancy of trustees has still not been totally overcome. As one fund
manager says: 'Derivatives still have something of a bad name and trustees
are suspicious about getting something for nothing.'
The hesitancy is not just on the part of the trustees. While some of the
larger pension fund management groups have encouraged clients to make use
derivative markets, if an individual fund manager has a long-standing
relationship with a particular fund and does not want to use derivatives,
such a change is unlikely to forced on him or her by the group.
There are still difficulties in devising systems which can monitor the
investments and also clear and settle trades. Several medium-sized fund
managers still have considerable problems in this area. Finally, the changes
so far have benefited futures. Options are still not widely used by funds.
The difficulties in valuing a widely diversified options portfolio has
discouraged some funds, while others lack the expertise to explain its uses
to trustees.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Professional
controversy remains - The impact of asset liability modelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER URWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing new in the principle that pension fund investments should
be selected having regard to the liabilities. However, the emergence of
asset liability modelling has enabled this axiom to be quantified, so
setting in motion a new debate of vital importance for pension fund health.
The average pension fund during the 1980s increased its equity exposure from
about 60 per cent to closer to 80 per cent. However, this shift has come in
for particularly close scrutiny from many quarters. Some suggest that the
growing maturity of pension funds argues for reducing equities and
increasing bonds. Pan-European comparisons make the British pension fund
distribution stand out as extremely aggressive. On the other hand, many
still argue that pension funds should be prepared to commit all their assets
to equities, given their long-time horizons.
Debates on these issues have been difficult without a clear framework. Until
recently, discussions were wholly subjective and firm conclusions were hard
to draw. Asset liability modelling has now emerged as a credible, if
somewhat controversial, framework to address these questions.
Most asset liability modelling work has been carried out by pension fund
actuaries. According to the Greenwich Associates 1990 Survey, 30 per cent of
funds now use an actuary or consultant to help in their asset allocation
policy. This is a proportion that has grown rapidly from a very low base. By
starting to give advice on investment policy, the actuary has appeared to
encroach on the territory of investment managers. This redrawing of the
demarcation lines has created tensions.
In the 1988 FT Pension Fund Investment Survey, about the time when asset
liability modelling was starting to be debated in earnest, Barry Riley wrote
of these professional tensions, suggesting that 'irritation will turn to
resentment if actuaries attempt to strip the asset allocation responsibility
from balanced managers.' In practice, the involvement of actuaries since
then has been confined to setting long-term asset allocation over a horizon
of 10 years and longer, leaving balanced managers to get on with the job as
before (stock selection and short-term asset allocation), albeit relative to
a new benchmark.
Over this recent period, the separation of long-term policy decisions from
short-term tactical decisions has become better understood and is now widely
used. As a result of these developments, the managers' irritation has not,
as yet, turned to resentment. The majority of managers have welcomed the
clearer objectives that have been derived from this work.
The other area of controversy relates to scepticism with the process itself.
Asset liability modelling systems are complicated but the principles of
their application are straightforward. Modelling involves making projections
as to the future financial position of a particular pension fund. The
calculations reveal the likely funding position of the scheme (the value of
assets in relation to accrued liabilities) and the contribution rate at some
future date five years, 10 years or further out. These modelling systems
compare the most likely position with the extremes in terms of the worst
case expectations and the best case expectations. The latter information is
used to gauge the uncertainties implicit in any scenario and therefore the
risks the employers and trustees actually face. For example, a projection
might show that the current investment policy is most likely to lead to no
change in the contribution rate in 10 years' time, but the worst case
possible would involve a much higher rate applying. Such information would
be used to decide whether the current policy should be changed.
Modelling results are used in two respects. First, they illustrate the
implications of adopting any particular investment policy. Secondly, they
identify superior investment policies that improve the chances of a scheme
achieving its particular objectives. Proponents would certainly claim that
the process allows higher returns to emerge without a corresponding increase
in risk.
While the process has improved and matured over the years, professional
controversy still remains. Like most long-range modelling processes, there
is considerable scope to question the interpretation of results. The
principal difficulty lies in setting the assumptions about future market
returns with sufficient prescience to obtain robust answers. In practice,
assumptions cannot be set with great precision so the results of the process
need to be interpreted with care. There are those who believe this
difficulty is sufficient to invalidate the whole process.
Early models were essentially backward-looking and built largely on the
premise that history would repeat itself. Latterly, more forward-looking
models have emerged which rely partly on historical evidence and partly on
more traditional economic judgments. These appear more credible and answer
some of the criticisms. Most converts to modelling tend to believe in the
philosophy that 'models are to be used and not believed' and study the
results to provide a disciplined quantitative framework for qualitative
discussions on investment policies.
Perhaps the most important benefit seen from modelling is that funds can
become more individualistic using this framework and can fully reflect their
own characteristics and ambitions. For example, fast-growing schemes with
limited numbers of pensioners can be easily differentiated from declining
mature schemes. This means that in practice, the policies that emerge from
modelling studies are certainly not identical from one scheme to the next.
This begs a number of practical questions about how performance will be
measured in future. Some have questioned whether or not the days of
performance 'league tables' are numbered if individual objectives start to
predominate. This would appear to be very unlikely. The performance league
table has fulfilled a very important role for most trustees and is unlikely
to be replaced. In trying to anticipate the changing mood of the industry,
performance measurers are now hard at work creating a new style of reporting
in which sub-groups of funds can be properly compared in a 'peer group'
league table.
What of the future? Further refinement of asset liability modelling will
inevitably occur with both actuaries and investment managers taking active
roles. At present, asset liability modelling is carried out by a small
minority of funds (albeit influential ones), no more than 100 in total. The
way seems clear for it to become a majority practice as natural as
performance measurement has become.
The writer heads the specialist investment practice at R Watson &amp; Sons,
consulting actuaries.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): Why dirty fees are
hard to rub out - Managers' Charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a bad year for investment managers. As stock markets (and the value
of most pension funds) fell in 1990, managers' incomes, based on ad valorem
charges, faced a similar decline. Few tried to sustain their income by
increasing charges - and fewer still succeeded.
Any sympathy should be stifled quickly, though: managers still make
extensive use of implicit, or 'dirty', fees to boost their income, and some
last year appear to have been able to use these to support their earnings.
'Dirty' fees come in three main forms: charges for in-house unit trusts,
levies to meet the higher costs of overseas transactions and soft
commissions.
The growing use of in-house unit trusts has been the most obvious
contributor to investment managers' revenues. True, a greater proportion of
pension fund assets may be dedicated to specialist areas list overseas
equities or bonds, and true, these investments may be better handled on a
pooled basis. But does this justify an annual charge of, say, 1 per cent,
rather than the 0.2 per cent typically paid for balanced funds or 0.5 per
cent for funds actively managed by a specialist?
As Mr Tim Gardener, head of asset planning at Mercer Fraser, says: 'I can
see the reason for using unit trusts, but not for the extra charges implicit
in them. I fail to see why unit trusts need to charge more.' Whatever the
justification, the use of unit trusts is becoming far more common.
The second type of 'dirty' fee - transaction fees for overseas bargains - is
more easily justified, given the higher costs of settling such a
transaction. However, there are signs that here, too, managers may use
implicit charges to enhance their own income.
There are different ways of levying these overseas transaction charges. Many
managers impose a flat charge per bargain (say, Pounds 50). But the method
is imprecise, and is not usually matched to a precise analysis of costs.
'Most managers levy more than it costs them,' says Mr Gardener. 'They use
these charges as a source of income.'
The third type of dirty fee, the use of soft commissions, was sanctioned
recently by the Securities and Investments Board - although the SIB said it
would keep a close eye on fund managers' behaviour and may yet ban the
practice (which involves brokers paying for services for fund managers, such
as the provision of computer terminals or information services, in return
for a set amount of commission-bearing business each year).
'In the long run, this area will be revisited by the regulators,' says Mr
Malcolm Kemp, a partner at Bacon &amp; Woodrow. 'It still has an air of
artificiality about it.'
The SIB has insisted on minimum levels of disclosure of soft commission
arrangements, so trustees should at least be able to see what is going on.
But simple disclosure gives no idea of the pressures under which fund
managers operate, and which may lead them sometimes not to put their own
clients' interests first.
Implicit fees like these are estimated to add as much as 0.5 of a percentage
point to the costs of pension fund management, compared with the typical 0.2
per cent 'clean' fee. Why do plan sponsors continue to put up with the
practice?
In part, because it makes their own lives easier, says Mr Gardener. Dirty
fees, he explains, are levied on the assets in a fund rather than a plan
sponsor. By insisting on clean fees, a sponsor is shifting the direct costs
onto himself, and to recover this may reduce contributions into the fund - a
route often fraught with political difficulty.
The abandoning of dirty fees, long predicted, may be taking a long time
coming. Nevertheless, experts report that charging practice is still turning
 -albeit slowly - against such habits.
Meanwhile, fund managers' incomes are benefiting from the second general
trend in investment management charges: the gradual replacement of balanced
fund management with index and active fund management. For the fund which
splits itself between the specialists, aggregate charges are generally
higher than for the one that remains with the balanced fund manager (though
this should be outweighed by the greater ability to control a fund's
performance).
Funds tied to an index frequently find their way into an in-house unit
trust. It is cheaper and easier for the manager to index one pool of money
of, say, Pounds 1m to an index, rather than five pools of Pounds 200,000.
However, the result may be higher charges.
Active managers, meanwhile, have largely moved over to the use of
performance fees, to the extent that is now thought to be the exception to
find an active manager charging a simple flat fee.
For this and other reasons, suggests Mr Kemp, overall costs of pension fund
investment have crept up slightly over the past year - though nowhere near
enough to compensate managers for the loss of income from the stock market
slump. Many managers cling to the belief that fee scales are set to rise:
but then, as Mr Kemp says, 'many thought that a year ago.'

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (12): Performance is
starting to matter - The impact of the rapid ageing of Japan's population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S PENSION funds have often been viewed by outsiders as designed more
to lubricate the country's complex and cosy network of corporate
relationships than to benefit the actual members of company funds.
That interpretation has not been discouraged by funds such as the Japan
Securities Dealers' Employees Pension Fund, which announced that its money
would be divided neatly among the fund management arms of securities
companies and indicated that the shares would be maintained regardless of
performance.
But there are hopes among foreign fund managers in Japan and among the more
aggressive Japanese managers that the 'silver wave', the rapid ageing of the
country's population, will force company funds and the Japanese government
to put more emphasis on performance.
A second hope is that companies with new funds or funds that cover numerous
companies within an industry will be less shackled by traditional corporate
relationships and more open to using independent investment advisers,
including foreigners.
The industry groupings, such as the Tokyo Electronics Sub-Contractors
Association, could be more fertile territory, as they should dilute an
individual company's obligations to, for example, its bank, which may want
pension funds to be handled by an affiliated trust bank.
Last financial year, Japan's legally-recognised corporate pension plans
totalled about Dollars 230bn, and nine foreign-affiliated trust banks were
among the 38 trust banks and life insurance companies allowed to manage
Japanese pensions. And, from last April, 133 investment advisers, 36 of them
foreign, were given access to some of the new money flowing into the system.
The foreign companies would like greater access to pension funds, having
calculated that they now manage only 0.3 per cent of the total, and they
want an easing of the restrictions on fund employment. Principal secured
assets must comprise at least 50 per cent of funds invested, domestic stocks
up to 30 per cent, foreign currency denominated securities up to 30 per cent
and real estate up to 20 per cent.
One foreign manager said that these restrictions 'limit the ability of
foreign companies to show their particular strengths'. While foreign
companies are unhappy about the pace of liberalisation, they are reluctant
to be identified when criticising the system for fear of antagonising the
all-powerful Finance Ministry.
Foreign companies hope that the government's own concern about the financial
burden of expected demographic changes in Japan will provide a stimulant for
further reforms of fund management. About 11 per cent of Japanese are now
aged 65 or over, but the ratio is expected to jump to 16 per cent by 2000.
One change in the year to end-March was the sharply increased allotments by
the state-run Pension Welfare Service Corporation to life insurance
companies, which received 30.1 per cent more than in fiscal 1989, while the
trust banks received only 13.7 per cent more. Trust banks must manage funds
individually, while the life insurance companies have the advantage of being
able to pool all incoming funds for management.
But Mr Tokuo Banba, assistant general manger of planning and co-ordination
at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, says that the importance of
trust banks has not diminished, and that 'yield is not everything.' He
emphasises that Japanese companies want stable fund management, and that
high yields in the short term will not necessarily impress them.
According to Mr Brian Matthews, president of Jardine Fleming Investment
Advisers, building long-term relationships is particularly necessary in
Japan. He says his firm has been helped by pension fund appointments from
two government-related organisations and that these contracts are important
because when other quasi-government funds look to make appointments, 'our
name will be on the list.' He estimates that establishing a significant
presence will take five years from the liberalisation last April, and is
'surprised that we have had these successes so quickly'.
Jardine Fleming Investment Advisers is 51 per cent owned by Jardine Fleming
Investment Management and 49 per cent by Yasuda Trust and Banking. Mr
Matthews says the idea is 'to combine the asset management capabilities of
the Fleming group with the domestic marketing capabilities of Yasuda'. The
venture, he says, has been a success.
Mr Shoji Yamada, director of pension fund management at Yasuda Trust,
reckons that the Japanese industry may be '15 to 20 years' behind the US,
and admits that foreign companies have valuable expertise: 'We have studied
the western style of fund management, and are interested in new skills.'
Given the problems in Japanese financial markets in the past year and the
realisation that stock prices can fall as well as rise, Japanese managers
have become more wary about the deployment of funds. They have been
noticeably absent from the Tokyo stock market in recent months, and have
warned companies that uncertainty over stock prices has made dividends all
the more important.
Mr Shigeyuki Araki, investment planning manager at Dai-ichi Mutual Life,
says that his company's hidden stock profits fell by half last year, and 'we
are telling companies that they must increase dividend payments if they want
us to buy.'
If performance is becoming more important in Japan, the question remains as
to how the government intends to measure that performance. The Finance
Ministry has hinted that private firms could be allowed to establish a
performance scale of sorts, but there has been no formal indication as to
when such a system will be introduced.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (11): Why prefunded is
preferred - Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNIE ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCUPATIONAL PENSION schemes in Europe are generally financed in one of
three ways: prefunded arrangements - insured or non-insured - as in the UK,
Ireland and the Netherlands; book reserves as in Germany and Austria; and
pay-as-you-go, as in France.
Book reserves and pay-as-you-go may work very well while population and
economy are growing, employment is high, and interest rates are low. But
with an increasingly ageing population in western Europe and many countries
in recession, prefunded arrangements will not only give greater security to
the workforce but will become more necessary as company profit margins are
squeezed and individuals are required to contribute more towards their
pensions.
The European Community, keen to promote the idea of funded pensions, is
working on draft directives to encourage them. Several European countries
(other than those with a tradition of funded schemes) have recently been
dipping their toes in the water.
Following legislation in Portugal in 1986 which required the external
funding of any new pension plans, tax incentives were introduced in 1987 to
encourage the funding of existing plans as well. Double tax relief was given
for a one-year period and according to Mr George Clare of Euracs (European
Actuarial Consultancy Services), this incentive worked. However, investment
portfolios must include at least 50 per cent of state-issued securities.
Spain introduced pensions legislation in 1988 with tax incentives for
'qualified' - funded - plans. However, the fact that labour representation
on the control commissIon which governs the pension scheme must be greater
than employer representation has not gone down well with employers. Tax
relief for employees at an upper limit of Pta500,000 (cPounds 2,500) is also
reckoned to be too low while employers can receive tax relief on their
contributions only if that to each individual is identifiable. As a result,
very few schemes have registered.
In Belgium, a royal decree in May 1985 prohibited the future establishment
of book reserve schemes, mainly due to concern over lack of employee
protection in the event of bankruptcy.
The most commonly used financing methods in Belgium are group insurance
contracts, self-administered funds (ASBLs) and deposit administration
contracts. Insurance companies have slightly more freedom in their
investments than pension funds but many of the larger companies choose to
fund their pensions through ASBLs.
Austria, which in the past has relied heavily on book reserves, plans to
achieve 50 per cent capitalisation of its book reserve schemes over the next
20 years. To encourage implementation of the process, employers receive
favourable tax treatment. For example, if at least 1,000 employees are
members of a pension fund and total contributions are limited to 10 per cent
of total payroll, then employers' contributions will be fully
tax-deductible.
Pension monies in Switzerland are now required by law to be deposited in a
foundation and administered separately from the company. Restrictions on
pension fund investment were lifted in 1989 so that 30 per cent of fund
assets may now be invested in foreign shares (previously 10 per cent). As a
result, it has been suggested that Switzerland's stock exchange could be
dominated by pension fund money by the year 2000.
The same is true of Sweden. In the past the range of pension investments has
been controlled by SPP, an insurance company regulated by the government,
and the unions - 'an unholy alliance,' says Mr Clare of Euracs. 'Imagine a
situation in the UK where the employers had no say,' he says. (The SPP also
administers a book reserve scheme). There is talk of freeing restrictions on
investment in equities and again it is believed that this could lead to the
stock exchange being dominated by pension funds money.
Even the situation in France and Germany is changing. In France, while the
modified pay-as-you-go scheme, repartition, still provides the bulk of
pension provision, according to Mr Jonathon Heller of Prudential Corporate
Pensions, an increasing number of pension plans - both final salary and
money purchase - are being financed on a prefunded basis.
Although nearly 70 per cent of German companies provide pensions on a book
reserve basis, there are a few pension funds (pensionskasse), similar to
those in the UK. Some are old: for example, that of the giant chemical
company, Hoechst, dates from the 1880s and has 75,000 members.
But development of pension funds in Germany has been hindered by
restrictions on investment. Only 20 per cent of a fund may be invested in
equities. Recent moves to increase this amount to 30 per cent were rejected
by the government after lobbying by the BAV (the insurance regulatory
board).
However, the ageing population, and perhaps more importantly, the costs of
reunification are likely to lead to demands for employees to contribute to
occupational schemes (they cannot contribute to book reserves) with a
consequent demand for separate funding.
There are about 60 EC draft directives affecting pension schemes and benefit
practice and these are currently going through at the rate of one a month.
In July last year a directive on the freedom of capital movements was
followed by a keynote speech from Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner responsible
for financial institutions and competition, which outlined three goals: that
there should be full freedom to provide the services of managing pension
funds; that there should be full freedom of cross-border investment and
pension fund assets and that there should be full freedom of cross-border
membership of pension funds.
With the experience that UK fund managers have of unrestricted investment,
they should be well-placed to take advantage of any easing of restrictions
in this regard.
A study carried out by consulting actuaries R Watson last year showed that
the total assets of UK pension funds exceeded the sum total of all the rest
of the EC members' pension funds put together. It is perhaps ironic that at
the same time that other European countries are moving towards funded
schemes, Britain with its earnings cap is placing some companies in the
position of having to set up unfunded schemes for high-flying executives.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (9): Flood of gilts issues
likely - The prospects for sterling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING BONDS barely feature in the UK pension fund's portfolio these days:
they have been crowded out by equities.
However, given the government's borrowing requirements in the next couple of
years, a flood of gilts issues is expected. As a result, pension funds may
well be tempted to increase their holdings in sterling fixed income bonds.
UK pension funds have run down their holdings in UK fixed interest
investments in percentage terms over the last decade. In 1978, a typical
pension fund had its assets split as follows, according to figures from
Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps): 29 per cent in UK fixed
interest; 56 per cent in UK equities; 4 per cent in overseas assets; 4 per
cent in sterling cash and 7 per cent in property.
At the end of 1990, a mere 4 per cent was invested in UK fixed income and 2
per cent in index-linked investments. UK equities accounted for 57 per cent
while the proportion held in overseas assets had risen to 27 per cent.
According to one manager, the main reason why pension funds ran down their
sterling bond holdings, particularly over the last five years, was because
of the equity market boom which tempted them to invest in foreign and UK
equities at the expense of fixed income.
The government's privatisation programme also attracted equity investors,
while the shortage of gilts as the Bank of England was buying back stock
meant that the supply was reduced.
However, there was a very sharp turnaround last year in which bonds
outperformed equities. Caps figures for 1990 show that the median return for
pension funds was -10.5 per cent while the return on UK equities in their
portfolios was -9.5 per cent, the return on UK fixed interest was +8 per
cent.
Some fund managers believe this could encourage pension funds to increase
their holdings in bonds again, especially now that the government is
borrowing in the market again.
In the Budget last March, the government forecast a public sector borrowing
requirement for 1991-92 of Pounds 8bn. Many economists believe this is an
underestimate and put the figure at closer to Pounds 12bn. The result is
that the government has returned to issuing gilts: already there have been
three mini-taps and more issues are expected in the next two years. The
question is: will pension funds buy them ?
Midland Montagu, one of the leading market makers in gilts, reports an
increased interest by pension funds, though this is yet to materialise in
substantial purchases.
However, some pension fund managers say they are reluctant to commit money
to gilts at the moment. One manager points out that the attractions of
sterling fixed income were more apparent at the start of the year than now:
in his view, corporate sterling bonds (non-gilt fixed income) look more
attractive than gilt fixed income because they are relatively cheap. One
reason for this is that in a recession, many investors are worried about the
creditworthiness of corporate bonds - especially given the number of
companies which have either collapsed or which are facing serious
difficulties in servicing their debt.
Despite the Bank of England's plan to issue gilts again, not everyone is
convinced that the new supply of gilts will be eagerly sought by pension
funds.
For a start, fund managers consider the prospective real returns available
from other European bond markets - particularly France and the Netherlands -
as more attractive than from sterling bonds. Fund managers are optimistic
about prospects for the global bond markets this year as interest rates in
most of the main world economies are expected to fall.
Mr Lionel Hoare of Whittingdale, the fund management group, points out that
with sterling's entry in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS, investors
should see higher yields available in sterling without suffering from
currency risk, and so cannot see the advantage of investing in foreign bonds
over sterling bonds.
He thinks pension funds will have to increase their weightings in sterling
bonds to match their assets with their liabilities. As the average age of
the UK population is rising, pension funds may put their money into more
secure investments such as fixed income.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): The dollar's
turnaround - A look at foreign bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONALLY equity-oriented and domestically-minded UK fund managers are
becoming more active in foreign bond markets, but their participation is
still low compared with pension funds elsewhere in Europe.
Last year, concern about the effects of economic recession on equity
performance persuaded more fund managers to invest in fixed income products.
The strong performance of foreign bond markets, especially for
sterling-based investors, in the first quarter of 1991 has increased their
readiness to buy foreign bonds.
According to the WM Company's UK Pension Fund Service, the proportion of UK
pension fund assets in the foreign bond market rose to 3 per cent in 1990
from 2 per cent in 1989. Yet only two-thirds of the funds surveyed hold any
foreign bonds at all, so funds with foreign bonds hold around 7 per cent on
average. But, even including fixed-rate gilts, straight bonds accounted for
less than 10 per cent of pension funds' assets in total at the end of last
year.
Nevertheless, the research showed Pounds 2.9bn of fresh investment in
foreign bonds last year, funded partly by an outflow of Pounds 1.5bn from
the UK gilts market.
Figures for 1991 are not yet available, but some analysts estimate that the
net shift will not be substantial, considering the dramatic effect of
currency movements on bond returns since the end of last year. The recent
strong performance of equity markets may well reverse some of the shift into
fixed-income products prompted by the prospect of a long and deep recession.
'It is time that UK pension funds assessed what is the proper bond element
in a portfolio and how to constitute it,' says Mr Howard Flight, managing
director of Guinness Flight Global Asset Management.
While most international bond fund managers see European currencies as one
bloc, following sterling's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, UK
pension fund managers remain very domestically oriented by comparison.
The increase seen in pension funds' exposure to foreign bonds since the bull
market for bonds started near the end of last year has come partly from
cash, where many funds found a safe haven in the wake of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait last August. In addition, there was some movement out of equities,
since the bonds perform better in recession than stocks, and also out of the
gilts market.
Because of the strong performance of bond markets across the board during
the first quarter, the most crucial decision for fund managers was on
currency rather than the bond market. Though Spain and Italy provided the
highest returns measured in local currency, according to the JP Morgan
government bond index, the strengthening of the dollar had a dramatic effect
on returns for UK-based funds.
Consequently, the largest shift since the end of last year was from
underweight to overweight positions in dollar securities, reflecting, in
large part, the dollar's turnaround in the foreign exchange market.
There are two different approaches to investing in foreign bonds. One is to
view currency and bond markets as two separate components. Fund managers who
adopt this approach may take one position in a currency and a conflicting
position in the bond market. Thus, some managers are now overweight in
dollars in the foreign exchange market, but underweight in dollar bonds. The
currency position may have been taken in the spot foreign exchange market
and held on deposit. One fund manager says he has taken a position in French
government bonds, a market which he expects to perform well, but has hedged
exposure to the franc.
Other fund managers - in the UK perhaps the majority - take currency
considerations into account when investing in foreign bonds, and do not
hedge currency exposure to a significant degree.
Those who take a separate view on currencies are generally still overweight
in the dollar and underweight in European currencies. Others have stepped
back somewhat from the US bond market, which is now widely considered to be
quite expensive. In Europe, high-yielding bond markets such as Italy remain
in favour.
'The currency decision will become increasingly important, given the high
degree of volatility of foreign exchange compared with bond markets,' says
Mr David Shaw, director of bonds and currency at Legal and General.
In sterling terms, Canadian government bonds posted returns of 16 1/2 per
cent in the first quarter, according to Kemper Investment Management
Company's Seventeen Markets Database of International Bond Markets.
New Zealand was the second best performer, returning 16 1/4 per cent. For
fund managers who focus on the most liquid markets, the US market returned a
handsome 12 1/4 per cent.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): Growing appeal of
overseas assets - Why managers are succumbing to the attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK PENSION funds have been steadily expanding their holdings of overseas
assets during the last decade. At the end of 1979 - the year in which
exchange controls were dramatically lifted by the incoming Conservative
government - only 6 per cent of the average UK fund's portfolio was
represented by overseas equities.
By 1986 this had jumped to 20 per cent, and though the UK subsequently swung
back into favour again, the upward trend in the overseas asset mix now looks
set to resume.
Latest figures from the WM Company show that in 1990 the proportion dipped
from 21 per cent at the start of the year to 18 per cent by end-December:
this was mostly due, though, to the sharper fall in overseas stock markets
than in the UK during the period.
Since 1987 overseas bonds have also begun to attract interest - accounting
for 2 per cent of average assets by the end of 1989. In the view of many
observers - though by no means all - they are set to become a permanent
asset class in their own right in the 1990s.
The growing proportion of overseas holdings can partly be explained by the
greater percentage of cash flow being earmarked for non-UK assets by pension
fund managers, and partly by the relatively strong investment performance of
non-UK markets during the last 10 years. Both domestic UK and foreign
equities have shown far superior returns to UK gilts and property since the
early 1980s.
Overseas investment is justified by pension funds on the grounds that it
enables them to spread their risk through diversification, and obtain
exposure to strongly performing markets. 'We take the view that it dampens
the volatility effect,' explains Mr Richard Fitzalan Howard of Fleming
Investment Management. 'History shows that the effect of having a
diversified portfolio in different markets is to lower the risk, without
having to have a lot of bonds and cash.'
Fleming, whose Pounds 14bn of UK pension fund assets were roughly 25 per
cent invested in overseas equities and 6 per cent in overseas bonds in
mid-March, reckons that a weighting of more than 50 per cent could be
justified outside the UK if full investment freedom were granted by
trustees. As it is, the group is aiming for 35-40 per cent in the medium
term.
In the early days of overseas investment the US tended to be the most
popular home for the overseas part of a pension fund portfolio. Relative to
the world index, funds have always tended to be underweight in Japan. To
some extent this has reflected prejudice on the part of trustees, though who
can say that they were wrong in 1990 when Japan was the poorest performing
equity market of all, turning in a negative 42.7 per cent return?
Continental Europe, meanwhile, previously neglected and little understood,
is now the most popular region outside the UK for pension fund managers.
According to WM, no less than 38 per cent of the average overseas pension
fund portfolio was invested in Europe at the end of 1990, against 29 per
cent in the US, 18 per cent in Japan, and 15 per cent in other Asian
markets.
The big question for the 1990s is likely to be the impact on thinking of
sterling's full entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS. This is
merely the latest - but at the same time the most striking - sign of the way
in which European economies are becoming more closely integrated into a
single market. The 1992 programme has set Europe firmly on a new course; the
plan to turn the EMS into a single currency by the mid to late 1990s has
provided an exciting pointer to the final destination.
If currency risks are diminished - either through even narrower bands in the
ERM or through the ultimate triumph of the ecu - the distinction between UK
and European equities will lose much of its significance. Some pension funds
are already beginning to consider the UK and continental Europe as one
geographical area rather than two when setting investment constraints and
guidelines. The more interest rates, inflation and economic growth rates
converge, the more sensible that policy is likely to look.
Fund managers seeking to buy the best insurance companies, for example,
would hardly be wise to confine themselves to the five leading UK
composites. They are not only medium-sized by European standards, they are
arguably less capable than their continental rivals of meeting the
challenges which will be posed by an increasingly unified insurance market.
With many British companies already earning a considerable proportion of
their profits in continental Europe, the case for looking at the European
Community as a single investment bloc can only get stronger. But where does
one stop? A typical UK pension fund now invests around 57 per cent of its
assets in UK equities, a proportion which would have to be more than halved
if one looks at the relative market capitalisations in different European
countries.
There are many other questions for pension fund managers to address in the
1990s. How, for example, can they improve their country and stock selection,
which has been distinctly mixed to date. When the percentage of funds
invested overseas was relatively low in the early 1980s, this was not a
particularly serious issue. With a fifth of assets outside the UK today, it
certainly is.
It is noteworthy that pension funds which put their money into an equity
index fund would have done much better overseas than most of its peers in
the last decade. As market efficiency increases, stock selection gains will
be more difficult to achieve.
There is also the question of how emerging markets - the Pacific Rim, Asia,
Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe - fit in. Such
markets exhibit different risk/reward characteristics but hold the promise
of much faster growth and better returns than developed countries.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): The good and the
not-so-well-managed - Pooled Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CERI JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been so much discussion about mammoth pension scheme surpluses
built up over decades that it is sometimes easy to forget that for many
thousands of small pension schemes that have been going for relatively few
years, the outlook is not quite as cushioned.
Small pension funds are usually invested in pooled or mixed funds run by
life companies and fund management boutiques. Only when they are around
Pounds 10m plus do they warrant segregated management where the fund's
liabilities and objectives can be taken into account more precisely.
Pooled pension funds recorded negative overall returns last year. The
average pooled fund fell by 11.8 per cent in 1990, according to the annual
survey of 63 funds conducted by Combined Actuarial Performance Services
(Caps).
Another survey, by consulting actuary Wyatt, puts the average loss at 12.6
per cent. Such figures are the worst since 1974 when the average fall was
about 20 per cent.
The figures even compare unfavourably with the performance of segregated
funds, which lost an average of 10.5 per cent last year.
Unfortunately, these poor results come at a time when all pension schemes
face substantially increased costs as a result of the Barber ruling on
equality. Final salary scheme costs will also be pushed up by the measures
on limited price indexation introduced by the Social Security Act 1990.
Experts estimate that these twin burdens will push up pension scheme
liabilities by 30 per cent.
Clearly, the importance of selecting a good fund management group has never
been greater.
Topping the 1990 pooled fund charts was National Mutual's fund, valued at
Pounds 36m, which fell by 5.7 per cent.
The top managers at National Mutual meet fortnightly to set asset
allocations. Not surprisingly, the overall strategy was defensive - at one
stage the fund held 14 per cent in cash and 7 per cent index-linked.
Stock selection concentrated on blue chip companies, particularly in the UK,
and the fund was underweight in smaller companies. But the single most
significant factor in last year's outperformance was the office's decision
to quit Japan in late 1988, though it is now moving back in cautiously.
Other good results in 1990 came from Zurich Life (-5.8 per cent), Gartmore
(-6.4 per cent), Crusader (-6.7 per cent) and Provident Life (-6.8 per
cent).
Wyatt also cites AES pooled unit trust, valued at Pounds 2.6m, which lost
6.3 per cent.
In 1990 Guardian Royal Exchange's mixed fund, valued at Pounds 370.8m,
trailed the field with a loss of 21.8 per cent. This was largely due to
over-commitment to equities, particularly smaller companies.
Two other, smaller funds also fell by over 20 per cent during 1990. AEtna's
managed fund, valued at just Pounds 0.3m, tumbled by 28 per cent and
Thornton's fund, worth Pounds 8.5m, dropped by 21.1 per cent.
Other disappointing results for 1990 were turned in by Equitable, Fidelity,
John Govett, Martin Currie, Midland Montagu, MIM and National Provident
Institution. All plummeted by over 16 per cent.
But it is not enough to look at the results for just one year. The manager
who performed well in last year's tricky conditions may not necessarily be
able to pick the most attractive stocks in a bull market.
Over the past 10 years, the Caps survey shows that the highest annualised
return was achieved by Confederation Life, up 18.1 per cent, followed by
Scottish Widows with 17.3 per cent, Stenhouse exempt unit trust with 17.2
per cent and Provident Mutual with 16.8 per cent.
At the other extreme, the lowest 10-year return came from Legal &amp; General,
up by 13.5 per cent per annum, and Commercial Union, up by 13.9 per cent.
Of course, basic annualised returns cannot reveal performance volatility.
Certain investment houses are very erratic, and it is no consolation to know
that the house can perform superbly in certain market conditions if you buy
in just before a bad spell.
The best way of judging an investment house's consistency is to look at its
quartile rankings over the years, and to examine the fluctuations and
success in loss limitation when conditions are tough.
This also reveals the underlying trend. It may be, for instance, that a
house's greatest gains were made in the first few years of the last decade
and performance has since tailed off, or vice versa.
Confederation Life, for instance, made it into the upper quartile for six of
the last 10 years. But three of the years it failed to achieve the upper
quartile were 1981-83. And its return for 1990 was relatively encouraging at
 9.5 per cent, ranking it 14th of the 63 funds in the Caps survey.
Stenhouse exempt unit trust and Provident Mutual also achieved upper
quartile results for six of the past 10 years. This year's market leader,
National Mutual, made it into the upper quartile five times since 1981.
Mr Jeremy Bishop, National Mutual investment manager, says: 'A key part of
our approach is to restrict risk. This means that over the long term, we
should get more decisions right than wrong, but more importantly any
decisions we get wrong won't penalise us unduly.' Many others have a more
volatile record, so the aim should be to select a group with a house style
that will work in any market.
And as long as a pension fund is too small to warrant segregated management,
it cannot be sensible to put it with a house that specialises in particular
sectors - the typical specialisms are smaller companies and south-east Asia.
The size of the fund should also be taken into consideration. Though two of
the three worst performing funds in 1990 were relatively tiny, that is an
exception rather than the rule. More often, new funds perform well in the
early years because they are more flexible and nimble but this wanes as the
fund attracts new money over the years and grows less wieldy.
As one manager put it: 'A small fund may take risks and if it all goes well,
it soon has a good track record. If it all goes wrong, there is an attitude
that you can lose the fund quietly.' Although the 1990 pooled fund results
are dire, they are not disastrous. Certainly, the median 10-year annualised
return, at 15.3 per cent, is acceptable compared with the 6.4 per cent
increase in price inflation and an 8.5 per cent increase in average
earnings.
But equally, now is the time to throw out the common misconception that
investment management involves some kind of mystique. The reality is that a
house's performance is more about overall management strength than it is
about the whims and fancies of individual fund managers. This is
particularly true in an uncertain climate, and so next year's winners are
also likely to emerge from a rigorously managed stable.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Equities back in
favour - A look at the typical exposure of UK managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the start of this year, the UK equities market has been characterised
by strong upward movement, with progress to record levels apparently
unhindered by a string of rights issues. Funds which last year backed the
view that the market was historically cheap have reaped the rewards, but the
average exposure to UK equities is as steady as ever.
In recent weeks, the institutions appear to have been calling the shots as
companies with urgent needs to strengthen their balance sheets have asked
for cash. But there have been exceptions. Tesco, for example, timed its
Pounds 572m cash call to perfection, and provided a coherent explanation of
what the money was to be used for. Since January, its shares have performed
in line with the rising market.
Even weak stories have had a sympathetic reception. The market was not
convinced by the explanation from Bass of how its Pounds 558m cash would be
spent, but it took up its rights issue just the same. Distress calls, such
as that from Costain, actually sent the company's share price higher.
Cash calls and dividends have focused attention on the old question of
short-termism. Institutional calls for dividends to be maintained through
the recession have captured plenty of headlines, but the case is hard to
fault if it is applied to the market as a whole.
It is already obvious that dividend growth in the 1990s will be at a lower
rate than the astonishing advances seen in the 1980s. Long-term growth
should be a function of inflation plus growth in gross national product. Now
that the UK is in the ERM, inflation should stabilise at a level well below
that of recent years, so dividend growth might become more a function of
GNP. Put another way, lower inflation will make real dividend growth easier
to achieve.
A quiet 1991 could be followed by a pick-up in economic activity next year
as corporate profitability bounces back from the recession. In addition, the
growing utilities sector, with built-in dividend growth from the privatised
electricity and water companies, is helping to prop up the market's average
dividend.
Taking up their rights might be a convenient use of the institutions' cash
and a cheap way of getting it into a rising market, but they are perhaps
demonstrating a degree of humbug when they claim that industry was
short-termist in running down its financial strength. Steady dividend growth
may be the price companies have to pay for institutional loyalty.
Recent figures from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) showed
that the median UK pension fund had a UK equities exposure of between 54.9
and 56.7 per cent last year. The data was based on returns from 83 per cent
of the full sample of 1,500 funds, but it seems clear that funds were making
marginal increases to their exposure towards the year-end.
Whether they changed their asset allocation in time to benefit substantially
from the unexpected strength of the market so far this year remains to be
seen. After an uninspiring January, the All-Share index powered ahead and
managed a total return of 16.5 per cent in the first quarter, with smaller
non-FT-SE stocks outperforming the biggest shares after a long period of
underperformance.
As for performance in 1990, the median UK equities fund returned a 9.3 per
cent loss. That was much better than the 27 per cent negative return on
overseas equities, but interestingly it was worse than the return on
property assets. However, it seems there is little change in prospect for
the dominance of UK equities as the favoured asset class.
1990 was a year in which it was possible for fund managers to claim
significant outperformance of the UK market, simply by virtue of missing out
on such corporate casualties as Polly Peck and British &amp; Commonwealth. Mr
John Emly, Robert Fleming's investment director, beat the median performance
by 2 per cent, returning -7.3 per cent. Fleming not only avoided the key
disasters, but also scored by taking big positions in specific leading
stocks.
Mr Tom Crombie, who runs equities portfolios for Scottish Equitable, thinks
that pension funds have too much exposure to UK equities and not enough
diversification in overseas markets. He uses the analogy of the private
investor - just as a stockbroker would advise a sensible spread of assets,
so funds should have assets across a spread of markets.
The bunching of UK funds' asset allocations is certainly remarkable - over
20 years, there has been little change in the 55-60 per cent held in UK
equities, yet the returns have been variable.
Few managers now doubt that pension funds should hold equities as the most
sensible long-term asset class, but Scottish Equitable, for example, has
half of its 90 per cent equity exposure overseas. According to Mr Crombie,
Scottish Equitable actually managed to outperform the international indices.
But its expertise overseas has been built up over a number of years. Funds
going abroad for the first time can come unstuck.
Last year Scottish Equitable's mix was very different, with 20 per cent
cash, 10-15 per cent gilts and only 60-65 per cent in equities. 'The big
asset allocation decision is the vital one, but too many UK funds flunk it,'
says Mr Crombie.
Mr Emly takes a rather different line. Robert Fleming is prepared to take
weightings significantly different from the median depending on the client's
tolerance for risk. The asset allocation decision is based on the customer's
comfort level, but when there is clear value in UK equities - as there was,
for example, when the yield ratio fell as low as 1.9 - the case for
increasing exposure is strong.
However, Fleming also believes that UK equities are the natural asset base
for domestic funds with their sterling currency base. Equities give the
appropriate emphasis to real assets, but fund managers can make tactical
deviations into cash and bonds when the conditions are right.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): A small shift
overseas - The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS, there has been speculation that the US pension fund industry
would start to invest serious portions of its collective portfolio in
overseas markets. And, for years, there has corresponding little action.
But now, it seems that the sums which investment managers are willing to
devote to overseas holdings are finally becoming meaningful. According to
the annual survey conducted by Greenwich Associates, the Connecticut-based
consultancy, the 2,000 largest US tax-exempt pension funds held around 4.5
per cent of their assets in international stocks by end-1990. In money
terms, that amounts to around Dollars 87bn.
True, this still compares poorly with the percentages invested abroad by the
likes of the UK pension industry. Nevertheless, recent progress towards more
geographically diversified portfolios by US funds should not be understated.
For example, the public sector pension funds, the most laggardly element of
the pension sector in this respect, held around 1.7 per cent of their funds'
assets in international stocks back in 1987. Today, the figure is 3.2 per
cent.
And most observers reckon that the trend has considerably further to go.
Greenwich Associates itself concluded that by 1993, around 7.7 per cent of
US pension funds' assets might be invested internationally.
Quite why US pension fund managers have seen the light recently is a matter
of debate. Some observers suggest that the trend results largely from the
development of overseas markets themselves, with the result that a
substantially larger spread of investment opportunities has been created.
Equally, it may be worth noting that certain traditional domestic investment
areas, like real estate, have hit well-publicised problems, at least in the
short term. This may have stimulated the search for prime opportunities
elsewhere. Greenwich Associates, for example, notes that the percentage of
funds planning to start investing in equity real estate has been declining
over the past few years 'from 9 per cent in 1988, to 6 per cent in 1989, and
to 3 per cent in 1990.'
Nevertheless, most players involved with the pension fund sector concede
that this international thrust is not without problems. 'Many fund managers
are wrestling with currency management,' comments one large mutual fund
group - although it adds that 'the lag on the learning curve is disappearing
fairly quickly.'
Another factor worth considering is the fact that net cash flows in the US
pension fund sector are currently negative, by a fairly significant margin.
This, in turn, may stimulate the search for asset growth.
Distributions last year were estimated at around Dollars 89bn, compared with
contributions of about Dollars 83bn. In 1989, cash flow was negative to the
tune of some Dollars 1bn. The pressure is noticeably greater among the
corporate pension funds - in contrast to the public sector, where
contributions still outweigh distributions.
Quite separately, the sector is tussling to establish what role it should
play in corporate governance. It could be argued that US investors have
woken up to the excesses of the 1980s somewhat belatedly, but a general
stirring among pension fund managers is now perceptible. The latest proxy
season has not be a comfortable one for some US companies, and a number of
high profile public pension funds - like Calpers - can take some of the
credit.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): The recipient bears
the risk - Money purchase schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETA HODGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT LEGISLATION and legal cases have raised the potential costs of
providing final salary related pensions for a large number of occupational
pension schemes. As a result, many in the industry expect to see a shift
away from final salary (defined benefit) schemes to money purchase (defined
contribution) schemes.
Indeed, a survey of intermediaries conducted by Prudential Corporate
Pensions suggests as many as a third of all final salary schemes may switch
to money purchase.
It is easy to see why an increasing number of employers is attracted to the
switch. In a defined benefit scheme all the risk is borne by the employer.
Whatever happens, he must pay the level of benefit promised at retirement.
With a money purchase scheme, it is the scheme member who bears all the
risk. There is no benefit promise; the employer and employee simply make
contributions into the scheme. These are invested, and the scheme member
receives the value of these investments at retirement in the form of a
pension.
Although a money purchase scheme may be administered and invested on a group
basis, it is essentially a series of individual arrangements as far as
investment risk is concerned. There is no cross-subsidy between scheme
members.
This question of who bears the risk is the key to understanding the
differences between the investment policies of money purchase and final
salary schemes.
Money purchase benefits are usually determined by the build-up of each
member's personal account; all contributions made on the member's behalf are
credited to an account in his name. This is typically achieved by each
contribution buying units in the fund, in a similar way to investing in a
unit trust.
The need to unitise investment if the individual's benefits are to be valued
accurately is one reason why the majority of money purchase schemes are
invested in off-the-peg life office managed funds or pooled funds which
already have the systems for unitising investments in place.
To the extent that both money purchase and final salary schemes invest in
pooled managed funds, the asset spread and performance of the two types will
be identical.
The individually tailored option of segregated management favoured by many
final salary schemes has not been generally adopted by money purchase
arrangements. This is not only because of the problem of unitising
investments, but is also a function of size. A fund really needs to be worth
at least Pounds 10m - some would say Pounds 20m or Pounds 30m - before
segregated management becomes an economical option. In the past, most money
purchase schemes have been considerably smaller than this.
It may be that if the prophecies are fulfilled and more and more managers
choose the money purchase option, there will be more defined contribution
funds of a size to consider segregated management.
Mr CW Fraser Low, director of benefit consultants Willis Consulting, agrees
there is nothing to stop money purchase schemes opting for segregated
management. However, he admits Willis has only four money purchase clients
of sufficient size to receive individual investment advice and all of these
opt for the pooled investment route.
Willis does, however, have a couple of final salary scheme clients which
operate on a unitised segregated basis. These are conglomerates with
subsidiaries in a number of diverse industries which want to give different
benefits to members in different subsidiary companies while investing all
contributions in the same way.
'These show, in principle, there is no reason why money purchase schemes
should not have segregated management,' says Mr Low. But he adds: 'If you
are going to buy segregated management you probably want to go to a manager
with unit trusts or unitised managed funds. They are in a better position to
run the fund because they already have the computer programme in place to
unitise the investment.'
The Prudential survey asked intermediaries how they thought segregated final
salary schemes switching to money purchase would maintain the power which
goes with operating a segregated portfolio.
The intermediaries - said to represent the advice being given to 83 per cent
of all pension funds, measured by asset value - thought most schemes would
either transfer all their assets to a life office or invest in a single
managed fund.
The third investment solution suggested by Prudential is to have a
segregated or managed fund with its own bonus series. The intermediaries
surveyed thought that around 20 per cent of schemes switching to money
purchase would choose this option.
According to Mr Jonathan Heller, head of research at Prudential Corporate
Pensions, this would mean running the fund as a 'mini insurance company',
with 'reversionary' bonus levels being announced every year to reflect the
underlying growth in investments.
In this way the individual member would be protected from fluctuations in
the investment markets. As with a life office with profits policy, a
terminal bonus might be payable in addition on retirement.
Investment performance is clearly more important for a money purchase scheme
than for one operating on a final salary basis because of the direct link
between investments and the level of benefits received. But Mr Robert Baker,
senior consultant at Mercer Fraser, believes the underlying investment
objectives are very similar in many cases.
He says: 'The objective of most money purchase schemes is likely to be to
beat the median. The money purchase scheme has no liabilities to take
account of. The investment policy of a final salary scheme should take
account of liabilities, so you would expect the investment policy to differ.
In practice both funds probably just want to beat the median,'

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Leaders far ahead of
pack - Balanced Accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAIN Saunders, chief executive of Robert Fleming Investment Management,
has a fight on his hands to get his company back among the top dogs of the
balanced pension fund management business.
Only four years ago Fleming was second in the annual FT league table of
funds under management, but by the end of last year it had slipped to
seventh place.
Though even a short period of indifferent performance can spell big trouble
in the context of the intense competition that now rules in the pension fund
arena, Mr Saunders claims he is winning. In 1990 Fleming achieved a return
some 1 per cent ahead of the median for pension funds. The fund management
structure has been reorganised, with teams focused upon different types of
funds. 'We feel we are very much back on track,' he says.
A handful of successful managers is now winning almost all the new business
in balanced accounts. Mercury Asset Management, Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management, Schroders and Prudential Portfolio Managers are drawing away
from the rest, along with a single rising star, Gartmore.
Five years ago the then top three managers accounted for 31 per cent of the
aggregate business of the Top 20. This year's top three hold 39 per cent of
the total funds.
'I've never known the business to be so concentrated,' says Mr Paul Myners,
chief executive of Gartmore. He concedes this is in some respects worrying,
but of course it suits the likes of Gartmore, which is currently getting on
most of the short lists.
A typical case was that of the Merchant Navy pension funds, focus of the
most spectacular bust-up in the industry in recent times, when they threw
out their in-house manager Argosy Asset Management a few months ago.
Gartmore and PDFM duly picked up most of the business when external
management contracts were offered.
Although dozens of managers are still in theory in the hunt for new balanced
mandates, some are starting to lose heart. For instance Bankers Trust
Investment Management, a long-standing operator in the British market, has
decided to relinquish its remaining UK balanced accounts and to focus on
specialised international briefs.
Meanwhile the remarkable Mercury Asset Management continues to lead the pack
by a long way. It is secretive about its investment performance, probably
because with hundreds of clients there is significant divergence and any
mention of a MAM average performance would provoke complaint from those who
had done worse.
However, it plainly succeeds in keeping most of its clients happy, although
the highly publicised loss of a small specialised UK equity contract for the
Marks &amp; Spencer unit trust last year illustrated the problems that big
managers can have with small, fussy clients. MAM has retained its much
bigger contract with the M &amp; S pension fund, however.
In general, management contracts have not been changing especially fast in
the pension fund sector recently. According to Mr Roger Hunt, marketing
director of Prudential Corporate Pensions, 'pension fund trustees may be too
absorbed with the consequences of the Barber judgment to consider manager
changes this year.'
The Pru is the sole insurance company to have broken through into the big
time in the external pension fund management business. PDFM is the only
ex-stockbroker to have done the same (although nowadays it is an
independently constituted offshoot of Union Bank of Switzerland).
MAM and Schroders Investment Management have come from the merchant banking
sector. Gartmore, now owned by Indosuez, was originally an independent
manager of investment trusts. Elsewhere Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment
Management is the market leader in index funds, and naturally manages the
Pounds 5bn-plus Barclays Bank pension fund.
But many famous names have fallen by the wayside over the past 10 years or
so. According to Mr Paul Haines, investment director of consultants Noble
Lowndes, the reason is the breakdown of the old City of London connections,
and the rise of the consultants, who have developed a much more competitive
selection process involving beauty contests.
'Fewer appointments are made because of banking or stockbroking connections,
or because someone is owed a favour,' he says. 'The short lists will tend to
be the same. Greater concentration is an inevitable consequence.'
It is performance over several years that counts, but 1990 appears to have
been a particularly good year for PDFM. According to information collected
by the magazine Equity International, PDFM was the top performer last year,
albeit in the sense that it lost less of its clients' money than any other
major manager.
Its return of -8.4 per cent (including property) was some 2 percentage
points better than the industry median. Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management,
which turned independent after the water industry privatisation, was close
behind, and Rothschild and Gartmore also did well.
Such figures can be selective and incomplete (the Pounds 4.7bn ICI pension
funds, for instance, achieved a rate of return of -7.7 per cent in 1990), so
it is the ability of managers to score well and consistently in the league
table of funds under management that is the real indication of lasting
quality.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): More talk than action
 -Barry Riley doubts if there is a vogue for specialist managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OSTENSIBLE rise and rise of specialist pension fund managers in the UK
has been one of the major themes of the institutional investment business in
the past few years.
Certainly one or two major pension funds have hired a string of specialists.
Rolls-Royce is one famous example, with 14 managers listed for the Pounds
1.2bn fund. IBM UK, in the American way, has 10 to manage Pounds 1.1bn. But
it is hard to avoid the conclusion that in general there has been a lot more
talk than action.
According to one of the two main performance measurement firms, Combined
Actuarial Performance Services (Caps), only 40 of the 1,495 UK pension
schemes it measured last year were managed primarily on a specialist basis.
It is true that they were larger than average, but even so they represented
only some 8 per cent of the total assets. The average number of separate
managers was four.
One of the leading balanced pension fund management companies, Phillips &amp;
Drew Fund Management, carried out its own survey of the trend towards
specialisation last year. It focused on the big funds, with a median size
among respondents of Pounds 300m.
About a third of these big funds turned out to be using a specialist formula
of one kind or another. But only for funds worth more than Pounds 500m did
the average number of managers rise to three.
Hiring specialist managers to maximise performance is most logical in the
more esoteric areas such as emerging markets, venture capital and direct
property investment, but arguably rather less so in UK equities or global
bonds where balanced managers are expected to have reasonable levels of
expertise.
From the other side of the fence, many management houses are quite keen to
promote their specialist expertise when their records in balanced management
are no longer of a top quartile quality.
For instance, Lazards is one of a number of City merchant banks which have
faded in the balanced fund management business but which is still active in
international equity management for a variety of private and institutional
clients. It is thus emphasising a good track record in continental European
equities as the basis for winning specialist mandates from UK pension funds.
But competition is fierce. A wide variety of managers is focusing on the
potential of the UK pension fund business. Overseas contenders such as JP
Morgan, Swiss Bank Corporation and Lombard-Odier are promoting themselves as
specialist operators to the trustees of UK pension funds.
Domestically, too, the Pounds 300bn pension fund business is an obvious
target for managers who have succeeded in other areas. For example
Perpetual, the unit trust company, is at present gearing itself up to attack
the pension fund market, primarily on the basis of specialist equity
mandates.
Mr Bruce Mackintosh, a marketing consultant to Perpetual, says the company
is seeking to bring its expertise in unit trusts to bear on another area of
business. But he recognises that it will take three to five years to get on
the short lists of the pension consultants.
One reason why the trend towards specialist management has been so slow is
that the asset allocation responsibility - covering the split of assets
between, say, UK and overseas assets, bonds cash and property - has to be
handled some other way, rather than being bundled up within a balanced
mandate.
Mr Anthony Steel, who runs an asset allocation boutique called Advice on
Investment Strategy, has for the past four years or so been trying to fill
this very gap. After all, he says: 'The specialist route puts an asset
allocation responsibility on the pension fund's trustees which they don't
feel they can handle.'
He provides a panel of assorted experts who meet periodically, and he claims
that their advice has potentially added between 1 and 2 per cent a year, on
the basis of quarterly rebalancing recommendations (though whether clients
take the advice in practice is up to them).
But does specialisation really work, in the sense of adding performance?
Caps has done some calculations which suggest that there is not a lot in it.
Last year the specialists slightly underperformed balanced managers in UK
and overseas equities, but outperformed in the less important categories of
UK fixed interest, property and index-linked gilts.
Caps refuses to come to any overall conclusions about performance because it
says that schemes which have adopted a specialist structure have often done
so as a result of asset/liability modelling exercises, so allocations may
have been decided very largely on grounds other than the maximisation of
performance. Crude figures for overall performance could therefore be
misleading.
Meanwhile the asset allocation problem is being tackled in various ways. At
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management Mr Lindsay Tomlinson, a
specialist in quantitative management, says that risk-averse trustees (often
those who have picked several unsuccessful balanced active managers in the
past) are going for specialist index funds plus a consensus asset allocation
formula. That is, they seek to copy what everybody else is doing as
precisely but as cheaply as possible.
At the same time, various quantitative models are being promoted, though
US-style switches between bonds and equities are less relevant to UK funds
which regard themselves as scarcely investors in bonds at all.
A new London boutique, Allingham Anderson, offers techniques for hedging the
risks between various asset classes, using the derivative markets. It has a
formula for achieving a return in line with the best asset class over a
defined period - in effect, a more refined and less risky version of
portfolio insurance, which came unstuck on Wall Street during the October
1987 crash.
Whether the UK pension fund market is ready for such techniques yet is
doubtful. It seems that for the time being specialisation, with the extra
responsibilities it implies for trustees, will be more widely discussed than
practised.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): A better tale for
1991 - After last year's investment setback, equity market buoyancy in the
first quarter of 1991 has dramatically changed the pension fund picture.
But scheme surpluses are likely to fall, partly because of the European
Court judgment on sex equality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT WAS important to get 1990 out of the way. After a brilliant decade for
investment performance during the 1980s, UK pension fund managers were
overdue for a market setback. In fact, the minus 10.5 per cent median rate
of return was the first negative result in nominal terms since 1974.
But fund managers will now be hoping that the shake-out in the markets has
been left well behind. Certainly the first quarter of 1991 has presented a
dramatically different picture, with equities buoyant around the world: the
FT-Actuaries World Index jumped 21 per cent in sterling terms in the three
months, a highly encouraging statistic given that the average UK pension
fund held around three- quarters of its portfolio in equities at the end of
last year.
This stock market strength has been of considerable commercial importance.
The fees of external fund managers are generally calculated on the basis of
the value of portfolios at the end of each calendar quarter. When stock
markets hit their low points at the end of the third quarter of 1990, fund
managers were squeezed nastily, while their costs were rising quite fast. It
was not much better in December. But March will have brought a substantial
recovery in income.
For UK pension schemes themselves, however, the arithmetic of poverty or
prosperity is done very differently. Surpluses and deficiencies are
calculated on the basis of actuarial rather than market valuations. In
general, these are income- based, certainly for UK equities, which make up
more than half of most portfolios.
Therefore, because dividends continued to be buoyant for much of last year,
with a rise of 11 per cent for the year as a whole, many schemes stayed
comfortably in surplus.
In a curious way, this turned out badly for fund manage- ment companies. The
over- funded pension schemes very often enjoyed contribution holidays, thus
choking off much of the cash flow into their funds.
According to the WM Company's performance measurement service the new money
flowing into UK occupational pension schemes in 1980 was equivalent to 19
per cent of their initial value, whereas 10 years later it was less than 4
per cent, implying net shrinkage after adjustment for investment income.
The strange 1990 picture of bloated funds and squeezed fund managers will
now change quite quickly, however. Not only have market values risen, thus
increasing the investment managers' revenues quite sharply, but the scene is
set for a very rapid rundown of pension scheme surpluses.
This is firstly because dividend growth is bound to slow down very sharply
this year. After averaging an extraordinary 16 per cent a year during the
second half of the 1980s, the rate of increase may well drop to under 5 per
cent for 1991 because of the economic squeeze on companies. This increase is
likely to be less than the underlying growth of average employee earnings
(still running at 9.5 per cent).
Another important consideration is that large unfunded liabilities are
crystallising for many pension schemes. These relate in part to the
so-called Barber judgment in the European Court on equal treatment for the
sexes, which could impose equal retirement ages and other expensive
adjustments on schemes. At the same time, the Social Security Act 1990 laid
down that partial inflation-proofing of benefits (limited price indexation,
or LPI, of up to a limit of 5 per cent a year) must be applied in future,
after a certain A-Day, the date of which has yet to be announced. In
addition, to the extent that there are surpluses in the scheme, this LPI
protection must be backdated to cover past service.
What is bad news for schemes could nevertheless be good for pension fund
managers, as extra contributions and top-ups begin to roll in; at least,
this will be true unless the pressure on final salary-linked schemes becomes
so intense that companies decided to wind them up in favour of cheaper
arrangements.
In these potentially troubled times, however, UK pension fund managers can
justifiably point to the very high returns that they have succeeded in
generating over many years. According to the other main performance
measurement service, Caps, the average rate of return achieved by the median
fund over the past 10 years has been 15.4 per cent.
This is a considerably high return than has been enjoyed by typical funds in
the US or on the Continent, even after adjustment for currency changes. The
uniquely aggressive strategy of UK funds, relying heavily on equities, has
paid off handsomely. The one bad year, 1990, has only made a small dent in
this record.
In the latest edition of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management's Pension Fund
Indicators, perhaps the best source-book on UK pension fund investment, Mr
Jim McCaughan, a PDFM director, argues: 'The long-term investor might
justifiably regard the unsettled market conditions of 1990 as a blessing
since opportunities were presented to acquire investments at favourable
prices.'
Yet the equity orientation of UK pension funds has relied heavily on the
willingness of British companies to adopt a high pay-out strategy. That has
led to criticism from the UK corporate sector on the grounds that
continental and Japanese companies do not face the same pressures from their
own institutional shareholders.
Moreover the entry of the UK to full membership of the European Monetary
System six months ago posed the possibility of fundamental structural
change. Has the focus of UK funds on equities been merely the consequence of
persistent UK inflation? Will bonds be much more attractive if they offer a
reliable real rate of return? But Mr McCaughan does not see UK fund managers
going back to government bonds, in which they invested heavily during the
1970s. 'Pension funds no longer see themselves as natural buyers of gilts,'
he says.
Moreover, UK company schemes have the flexible long-term actuarial and
accounting procedures which permit them to accept the volatility of equity
returns. In the US, the pension fund accounting standard FAS87 focuses much
more upon temporary market values, which have to be reflected in company
profit and loss accounts, whereas in the UK SSAP24 embodies long-term
smoothing.
These accounting influences, together with the much greater incidence of
defined contribution schemes, explain the high proportion of bonds in US
pension fund portfolios. In the UK nearly all large schemes have a defined
benefit (or final salary-linked) structure, although there is concern that
the coming pressures from Barber and LPI may cause a number of companies to
switch over to defined contributions.
In mainland Europe, meanwhile, funded occup- ational pension schemes are
beginning to grow in import- ance, and could become much more popular given
the demographic pressures on many of the pay-as-you-go (unfunded) state
schemes. Moreover a new EC directive proposes that the single market should
apply to pension fund management: national investment restrict- ions, such
as on bond/equity proportions, should be swept away, and foreign managers
should be allowed to compete freely across borders.
As their confidence recovers in line with the rise in equity markets, the
UK's pension fund management companies are beginning to reassess the scope
for exporting their skills to Europe.

FT  18 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: New York sets the pace for London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market was content to follow New York's lead yesterday, and
although the FT-SE Index rose sharply to close just below its all-time high,
the mood was somewhat lethargic. Hints of an impending bid for a stock in
the Footsie list, re-vitalised by fund-raising moves by Hanson and Roche
Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, provided some impetus for gains
in the blue chip internationals. However, there were worries that another
large rights issue from a leading listed company could be pending.
Trading volume was slow, however, particularly in the first couple of hours
of the session when the big institutions usually dominate the market. Share
prices were marked higher at the opening in response to Wall Street's gain
of 54 Dow points overnight. In the absence of buying support the gains were
soon more than halved, until London began to position itself ahead of the
new Wall Street session, which was widely, and accurately, expected to open
higher.
With the Dow Jones Industrial Average just touching the 3,000 mark as London
closed for the day, the FT-SE Index ended at 2,545 for a gain of 25.5, the
best of the day, taking it to a mere 0.3 below the closing peak achieved on
April 5.
Seaq volume of 477.6m shares, while marginally better than Tuesday's 446m,
was unexciting by recent standards. Data from the London Stock Exchange
shows that on Monday retail interest in UK equities fell to 804m, the first
session for some time in which the retail total had fallen below Pounds 1bn.
UK economic news continued to discourage the equity market which has turned
less confident on the near term outlook since the beginning of the second
quarter of the year. The March Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds
3.1bn, announced yesterday, was higher than expected in the City of London.
Today will bring the latest numbers on UK unemployment and industrial
production. Further consideration of the increase last month in UK
manufactured goods also underlined concern in the market over domestic
inflationary pressures.
At Nomura Research Institute, which has been notably bullish on UK equities,
the economics team yesterday warned that 'any further interest rate cuts
will have to be reversed over the course of the next year'. It expects the
fall in UK inflation to be reversed later this year and that sterling could
weaken by the end of 1991. 'Indeed, after falling to 11 per cent in the
summer, we expect base rates to return to 12 per cent by December.'
At an investment strategy conference this week, however, Mr Roger Palmer of
Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, reiterated the firm's forecast that
the Footsie will reach 3,000 by the year-end. He believes that Wall Street
will be an important factor, although he also predicts an upturn in UK
corporate earnings in the autumn, followed by real growth of earnings and
dividends through 1992.
Yesterday's gain in the Footsie Index reflected strong gains among Wall
Street-influenced stocks, with BAT Industries, Reckitt &amp; Colman and Reuters
all to the fore. Oil shares remained firm but a less certain trend in crude
prices counterbalanced the effects of Wall Street's strength. Stock
shortages inspired sharp gains among some consumer issues.
In the banking sector National Westminster provided a strong feature at the
close, dispelling some earlier nervousness regarding the results from the US
arm of the bank.

FT  18 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON derivatives traders were once again caught out by the strength of US
shares and by the close of trading there were signs of a squeeze developing
in the cash and futures markets.
June FT-SE futures got off to a strong start as locals who had carried a
short position overnight were forced to cover their books following the
large gains in the previous session on Wall Street.
But doubts about the ability of US shares to continue to rally prompted a
setback in futures, which traded for much of the morning below the 30 point
fair value premium to the spot index.
Instead, it was the cash market which led the way, absorbing the selling
pressure and moved towards its all-time high. A squeeze developed in the
futures market just before the close, which gave a boost to the stock
market.
June FT-SE contract closed at 2,582, up 33 points on the day, while its
premium to the spot index expanded to 39 points against 30 the previous day.
Glaxo options were actively traded as one broker crossed a large block of
June 700 calls. But options specialists were surprised by the 7,474 lot
turnover, equivalent to 7.4m shares and double activity in the underlying
securities. Hanson August 240 calls and Grand Met April calls were also
busy.

FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises above
27,000 on heavy arbitrage buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY arbitrage buying pushed share prices up yesterday and, while hopes of
monetary easing subsided with no clear action from the central bank, the
overnight rally on Wall Street boosted sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average opened at the day's low of 26,859.35, topped 27,000 for
the first time since March 19 for a day's high of 27,092.02, and closed
167.07 higher at 26,980.37.
Domestic institutions stayed away, but volume rose from 380m to 450m shares.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that the rise in volume
reflected the return of investors from smaller markets to the first section.
Advances led declines by 619 to 372, with 158 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section issues rose 9.99 to 2,028.82 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.59 to 1,540.42.
Companies gained on heavy business exposure in the US. Bridgestone, the tyre
maker, added Y30 to Y1,150, and Makita Electric Works Y50 to Y2,150. Mr Nick
Cant at Baring Securities said that the activity indicated that investors
were willing to commit money into companies on hopes of an early recovery of
the US economy.
Electricals were also strong on Wall Street. Sony added Y150 to Y6,790, and
TDK Y200 to Y5,880. Electrical machinery makers were stronger on the labour
saving theme. Fanuc rose Y200 to Y5,790 on sales of its industrial robots,
and Fuji Electric, the most active issue of the day, added Y20 to Y910 on
growth in automation equipment.
Pioneer Electronic climbed Y230 to Y5,050 on reports that it will launch a
compact disc recording system. Taiyo Yuden, an electrolytic capacitor maker
which is expected to supply the blank compact discs, also rose Y101 to
Y1,090.
Interest rate sensitive, large-capital issues fell on profit-taking, Nippon
Steel by Y6 to Y489 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries by Y6 to Y633.
Sanwa Shutter rose Y60 to Y1,710 on strong earning forecasts thanks to brisk
sales of its shutters, sliding doors and doors. Buying spread throughout the
sector, with Bunka Shutter adding Y50 to Y2,300 and Sankyo Aluminium
Industry climbing Y10 to Y1,720.
Nippon Oil rose on higher oil prices. Rumours that some countries in the
Gulf will join up with Japanese distributors in new projects also encouraged
investors, but the issue fell on profit taking and ended down Y10 at Y1,130.
Cosmo Oil fell Y9 to Y810.
Retailers gained on good earnings results for the year ending last February.
Ito Yokado, the supermarket chain which posted 11.4 per cent in pre-tax
profits, rose Y20 to Y4,370, and Seven Eleven Japan, which announced a 26.2
per cent rise in pre-tax profits, added Y230 to Y7,300.
In Osaka the OSE average rose 98.62 to 30,156.12 on volume of 46.2m shares.
Rohm, a semiconductor equipment maker, added Y80 to Y3,030 on heavy buying
by a major Japanese brokerage. Investors were attracted to forecasts of a 20
per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year.
Roundup
THE ENTHUSIASM of the region's response to Wall Street's overnight gains was
blunted by airport fears in Hong Kong. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were still
closed for a public holiday. Bombay was also closed.
HONG KONG talked about the stalled airport talks, added fears about a
planned rail strike in the US, and accepted that consolidation was in order
after the market's recent dramatic gains.
The Hang Seng dropped 30.45 to 3687.01 as turnover eased from HKDollars
1.12bn to HKDollars 992m. Banks posted the sharpest losses, followed by
properties and the commercial and industrial sector. Utilities declined
moderately.
NEW ZEALAND, a recent form horse, was given an additional boost by news that
the domestic consumer price index rose by only 0.6 per cent in the quarter
ended March 31, the smallest quarterly rise since 1969. Equities rose 2.3
per cent as the Barclays index closed 33.08 higher at 1,458.73, and turnover
rose from NZDollars 30.8m to NZDollars 35.7m.
Fletcher Challenge led from the front, 10 cents higher at NZDollars 3.90 in
volume of 3.2m shares. Brierley Investments, which has tended to lag behind
other stocks during the recent rally, picked up 3 cents to NZDollars 1.09 on
the heaviest individual volume of 5.3m shares.
TAIWAN rebounded from Tuesday's 6.3 per cent fall. The weighted index rose
137.75, or 2.6 per cent, to 5,451.06. Turnover, however, fell from TDollars
78.7bn to TDollars 58.7bn.
SINGAPORE came back from a holiday to a gain of 1.9 per cent, the Straits
Times index closing 27.62 higher at 1,513.52 as turnover climbed from
SDollars 137m to SDollars 194m.
AUSTRALIA rose 1.3 per cent, with the accent again on industrials as the All
Ordinaries index finished 18.9 higher at 1,490.6, its highest level since
last September and the market's fifth consecutive rise.
Activity was concentrated in the leaders, and turnover was not high in spite
of a rise from ADollars 164m to ADollars 237m. The property, civil
engineering and finance group, Lend Lease, rose 35 cents to ADollars 16.55
as it said that it would form a joint venture with State Bank of New South
Wales in the life insurance and retirement savings business. News Corp
gained 28 cents at ADollars 9.06, largely following a rise in the stock on
Wall Street.
MANILA saw more profit-taking as the composite index fell 9.53 to 1,080.93,
after a decline of 5.44 on Tuesday.

FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Institutional interest shows revival -
Turnover continued its recovery in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN equity turnover continued its steady recovery in March. The
receding spectre of the Gulf war and cuts in interest rates in some
countries encouraged institutional investors to return in force.
Mr James Cornish at County NatWest, which provides the monthly figures, says
that in general volumes were highest at the start of the month, with another
run-up before the Easter holiday.
The UK was the month's star performer as turnover rose 15.3 per cent from
February to Pounds 36.76bn, its best monthly figure since the Pounds 39.7bn
of January 1989. Investors were attracted back to the UK by a relatively
neutral budget, a further half-point cut in interest rates and a more
positive perception of the economy.
According to the FT-Actuaries indices, the UK has risen 18 per cent since
the start of the year in local currency terms, marginally ahead of the
Europe index which shows an advance of 17.8 per cent. Mr David Roche at
Morgan Stanley believes that it is time to shift out of the UK and into
Germany, which shows a smaller rise of 13.3 per cent so far this year. He
argues that a lot of liquidity in the UK is being swallowed up by rights
issues and that the market is no longer looking cheap.
'Common perceptions of the costs of unity have driven the German market
below where it was in November 1989 in terms of relative performance to the
UK,' Mr Roche says. Turnover in Germany rose a mere 1.7 per cent to
DM122.90bn in March, but this was still its best performance since August
1990's DM142.8bn.
After the UK the Netherlands showed the largest monthly rise, with a 10.2
per cent climb to Fl 15.30bn, also the highest level since last August's Fl
17.90bn. Mr Rob Sweers of Banque Paribas Nederland NV attributes the
improvement mainly to the stronger dollar which helps the dollar-denominated
earnings of Dutch companies. The rise on Wall Street also played its part,
since shares which account for 50 per cent of Dutch market turnover (Royal
Dutch and Unilever being the two leading shares with ADR programmes) are
actively traded in the US.
The FT-Actuaries indices show that Amsterdam has risen 19.2 per cent in
local currency terms so far this year, but in March alone it rose 7.8 per
cent. Mr Sweers notes that while there was evidence of fresh investment in
Dutch shares in March, this has been less apparent so far in April, with
options activity on the increase.
Spain continued to advance in March, with turnover 8.2 per cent better at
Pta803.60bn, the highest level since July 1990 when it reached Pta834.4bn.
Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities says that investors were attracted
by signs of continuing improvement on the inflation front and the sustained
downward movement of interest rates. Renewed takeover speculation in the
utility sector also provided interest.
The only bourse to show a drop in turnover last month was Italy, down 3.4
per cent. However, volume had risen 80 per cent the previous month.

THE CONTINENT was encouraged by Wall Street's overnight performance, and
high levels of liquidity among international investors, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS ignored poor company results and, thanks to Wall Street, the CAC 40
index finished up 26.54 or 1.5 per cent at 1,829.45.
Thomson-CSF added FFr6 to FFr152. Late on Tuesday the defence electronics
company reported a fall in 1990 profits but held the dividend. Michelin, the
tyre maker, put on FFr1.40 to FFr89.60 in spite of loss last year and
warnings of further losses in 1991. Peugeot, with earnings scheduled for
release early today, rose FFr2 to FFr538.
In the retail sector, Nouvelles Galeries fell FFr79 or 8.9 per cent to
FFr801 with a small 2,200 shares traded after news that the Swedish company
Proventus sold its 25 per cent stake to Galeries Lafayette and CCF, the
bank, defusing speculation of a possible takeover bid. Galeries Lafayette,
which now has a stake of 38.39 per cent in Nouvelles Galeries, lost FFr35 to
FFr1,730.
FRANKFURT climbed to its highest levels so far this year, the FAZ index
peaking 5.62 higher at 686.01 and the DAX hitting a new 1991 high of
1,623.83, up 20.47.
Volume climbed again, from DM6.5bn to DM8.2bn. Daimler led the market up,
putting on DM17.50 to DM704.50 on the German motor industry's relatively
strong performance, and on the excellent sales of its new 'S' series, said
Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf.
Chemicals rose further on yield considerations, with BASF up DM3.90 to
DM250.90 ahead of today's supervisory board meeting, at which the dividend
will be decided. In pharmaceuticals, Altana rose DM20.50 to DM573 on higher
profits and dividend.
Special situations saw Continental up another DM8.50 to DM233; observers
suspected more Italian buying of the Pirelli target. PWA reflected good
prospects for the world paper industry with a DM9 rise to DM274. Bilfinger &amp;
Berger, the construction group, came late in the day with a two-for-eleven
rights issue at DM500 day, leaving the shares, DM3.50 higher at DM897. Funds
raised would be used to finance its expansion in eastern Germany.
AMSTERDAM recouped Tuesday's losses with Wall Street and some positive
company statements boosting sentiment. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to
97.3, just below the day's high of 97.4.
In the paper sector, KNP put on Fl 2.70 or 5.0 per cent to Fl 56.40 after
the company forecast a rise in first half 1991 net profit. Buehrmann
Tetterode, which has some joint ventures with KNP, put on Fl 2.50 or 4.2 per
cent to Fl 62.
Wolters Kluwer, the publisher closed Fl 2.10 or 3.8 per cent higher at Fl
56.50 after saying that it expected 1991 net profit to rise at least 15 per
cent and that it was negotiating to buy a major European legal publisher.
MILAN was led higher by banks and insurers on the first day of the May
trading account. The Comit index rose 7.25 to 594.91. Generali gained L440
or 1.2 per cent to L37,340 on persistent rumours that it planned to buy Toro
from Fiat and in spite of a denial from Fiat. Toro jumped L445 or 1.7 per
cent to L27,155.
Demand for banks focused on three state-controlled institutions. Banco di
Roma, soon to be merged with Banco Santo Spirito, climbed L58 to L2,733 and
Credito Italiano put on L36 to L2,606. Banca Commerciale rose L50 to
L94,730.
BRUSSELS featured Societe Generale de Belgique, which jumped BFr100 or 4.5
per cent to BFr2,340. It announced a divestment programme, and sharply lower
profits on Tuesday. The Bel20 share index rose 2.75 to 1,212.15.
VIENNA saw trading boosted by the surprise anouncement that magnesite
producer Radex had bought a majority stake in Veitscher, the other main
Austrian producer. But the index eased 1.1 from its third successive high
for the year to 594.95 as Radex and Veitscher each slipped Sch45, to Sch925
and Sch810 respectively.
COPENHAGEN was restrained by losses at Hafnia, the insurer and a rights
issue at Sophus Berendsen which controls the London-listed Rentokil.
Hafnia 'B' shares fell DKr20.50 to DKr509.50 and Baltica, in which Hafnia
has a 30 per cent equity stake, by DKr20 to DKr740. Berendsen lost DKr20 to
DKr1,480 but the CSE index, reflecting management changes in the AP Moller
shipping group, still managed to close 1.07 higher at 350.93.
STOCKHOLM ended lower on news that new orders dropped 11 per cent in
February. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 3.8 to 1089.1. OSLO was
lifted by higher oil prices. The all-share index climbed 7.02 to 482.11 in
turnover worth NKr272m.
ZURICH saw recoveries in pharmeceuticals as the Credit Suisse index rose 3.9
to 558.2.

FT  18 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR and sterling rallied in subdued foreign exchange trading
yesterday. Against a confused interest rate background, the dollar moved
higher as traders squared positions ahead of today's German Bundesbank
council meeting and looked for further evidence about the timing of any cuts
in US and Japanese rates.
US trade figures for February will be published today and are expected to
show a smaller deficit than January's Dollars 7bn, with some economists
looking for a trade gap of less than Dollars 6bn. If this proves correct it
would help to underpin the dollar, but would be regarded as largely historic
and unlikely to clarify the timing of any US move out of recession.
Attention has focused on interest rate trends and a possible rise in German
rates at a time when the US and Japan may be about to ease.
The Federal Reserve did not intervene on the New York money market
yesterday. There had been some speculation that the Fed would add liquidity,
to offset pressure at the end of a two-week maintenance period, but the
authorities stayed out of the market as Federal funds traded at the assumed
target of 6 per cent.
Speculation has increased this week that the Bank of Japan intends to nudge
short-term interest rates lower, but Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank
governor, said yesterday that there has been no change in Japanese monetary
policy.
Nervousness ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting and rumours about
lower Japanese rates pushed the D-Mark up against the yen. The German
currency rose to Y81.50 from Y80.95 in London.
The dollar held in a tight trading range but gained ground against European
currencies and the yen. At the London close it had climbed to DM1.6725 from
DM1.6650; to Y136.35 from Y134.80; to SFr1.4270 from SFr1.4175; and to
FFr5.6550 from FFr5.6275. The dollar's index rose to 64.6 from 64.5.
Sterling eased against the stronger dollar, but was otherwise firm. It
stayed the second strongest member of the European exchange rate mechanism,
supported by lack of pressure for any further cut in UK bank base rates.
The pound fell 65 points to Dollars 1.7820, but rose to DM2.9800 from
DM2.9775; to FFr10.0775 from FFr10.0650; to SFr2.5425 from SFr2.5350; and to
Y243.00 from Y241.00. Its index was unchanged throughout the day at 92.9.
The Spanish peseta was strong, at the top of the ERM. Tuesday's news that
Spain has scrapped nearly all exchange controls, allowing residents to open
foreign currency accounts while lifting the limits on lending pesetas to
non-residents, failed to reduce demand for the currency. High interest rates
in Madrid, and the failure of the Bank of Spain to ease its monetary stance,
kept upward pressure on the currency.

FT  18 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES had a slightly softer tone in London yesterday, with news of
a bigger than expected March UK public sector borrowing requirement of
Pounds 3.1bn having little impact. A further decline in bank base rates is
expected,but not in the immediate future.
June short sterling futures continued to discount a cash three-month
interbank rate of slightly less than 11 1/2 per cent at delivery. In quiet
trading on Liffe the contract opened a little higher at 88.68 and finished
at 88.67 compared with 88.66 previously.
On the cash market three-month interbank eased to 11 7/8 -11 3/4 from 11
29/32 -11 27/32 per cent, while 12-month money fell to 11 3/8 -11 1/4 from
11 1/2 -11 3/8 per cent.
The Bank of England initially forecast a money market credit shortage of
Pounds 250m, but revised this to Pounds 350m at noon.
The authorities did not operate in the market until the afternoon, when help
was given via the purchase of Pounds 307m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16
per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 145m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 75m and bank balances below target Pounds 105m. These
outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 75m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.80 from 8.85 per cent after the
Bundesbank added a net DM800m at this week's securities repurchase agreement
tender. The central bank accepted bids totalling DM25.9bn at a two-tranche
tender, offsetting expiring pacts of DM25.1bn. It provided DM16.8bn of
DM28-day funds at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent and DM9.1bn of 63-day money
at variable bid rates, mostly 8.90 per cent.
Tax payments will keep credit conditions tight in the immediate future, but
this will be partly offset by redemptions and interest payments on
government paper.
The Bundesbank does not plan to hold a press conference after today's
regular council meeting, and sentiment in Frankfurt suggested that a rise in
official interest rates is unlikely, despite the recent speculation.
Credit policy was tightened a notch with a rise in the fixed rate at last
week's securities repurchase agreement, but there has been no similar move
this week.

exports up 30%

INDIAN raised its earnings from exports of leather and leather goods by 30
per cent to Rs26bn (Pounds 712m) in the year to the end of March.
However, earnings fell Rs2bn short of the target, which many felt to be
over-optimistic. The export target for the current year of Rs34bn also
appears unrealistic.
The Council of Leather Exports believes that the volume of exports in
1991-92 will not be much more than last year.
It points to adverse developments such as the difficulty in opening letters
of credit for the import of raw materials, the acute foreign exchange crisis
and the delay in support payments and duty drawbacks to exporters.
The council considers highly encouraging the 45 per cent growth in exports
to Germany, which accounts for more than 20 per cent of total Indian leather
exports
Germany has banned the import of leather containing pentachloraphenol (PCP),
which has been found to be carcinogenic.
However, the chemical is still used by some tanneries in India in the early
stages of leather processing.
The use of PCP, in however small a quantity, could create a crisis of
confidence among other foreign buyers.
Following the example of Germany, the US and the Soviet Union are also to
ban the import of leather containing PCP.

FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU dual-pricing plans backed
by wildlife charity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK National Farmers' Union's proposal for a dual-pricing system for farm
produce as an alternative to the European Commission's blueprint for reform
of the Common Agricultural Policy has won enthusiastic endorsement from the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
The RSPB, Europe's largest wildlife charity, has long been pushing for a
system of 'cross-compliance' based on the US model.
Such a system aims to cut overproduction by offering the farmer a choice
between setting aside land and receiving prices for produce at the full,
subsidised support rate, or producing to maximum capacity but without price
support.
The NFU plan envisages that those farmers who do not take land out of
production would receive reduced support.
Mr Jim Dixon, RSPB agriculture spokesman, said: 'We are delighted that the
NFU is seriously considering this principle as its own alternative CAP
reform.'
He said the EC plans had established the principle of cross-compliance. They
call for sharp price cuts, with full compensation for small farmers and
partial refund to large farmers, but only if they set aside land.
The RSPB seeks an alliance of environmentalists, farmers and politicians to
'strip the (EC) proposals of the discrimination in favour of smaller farms -
who are not necessarily the best conservationists'.

FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Potash market shows signs of
recovery
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD potash market, depressed in 1989 and most of 1990, is showing
signs of a comeback. Canada's biggest producer has won a Dollars 9.50
(Pounds 5.30) per tonne price increase from Japan and Korea and believes
China will accept the new base price of Dollars 110.50 per tonne.
Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, which normally sells more than 50 per cent of
its yearly output of nearly 4m tonnes abroad, asked Japan and Korea for a
rise of Dollars 12. It will be satisfied if the lower price helps to
stabilise the market in the North American market, says Mr Charles Childers,
chairman.
PCS, with five mines in Canada's biggest wheat province, is a low-cost
producer with mine capacity of 9.2m tonnes and reserves of 4.7bn tonnes or
100 years. The deposits are of the easily worked flat-bed type and
extraction is highly automated.
The market turnabout started late last year when China made a big order. The
favourable shift in the first quarter this year had a dramatic impact on PCS
after two successive years of declining sales and earnings from the 1988
peak.
Offshore sales were up 54 per cent for the first quarter and North American
30 per cent. Earnings more than tripled to about CDollars 12m (Pounds 5.8m).
Mr Childers says that in spite of growing demand for potash as a fertiliser,
especially from Asia and Latin America, balance between world supply and
demand is several years away. Production and demand have been falling
steadily in the Soviet Union and former Comecon countries for two years, and
half the 12 east German mines have been closed.
Mr Childers says the former eastern bloc producers are now active in Asia,
particularly India, and demand hard currency in place of bilateral
agreements and barter deals. 'The trend towards market-driven economies in
many areas will tend to firm world prices,' he says.
The Soviet Union is the biggest potash producer with 34 per cent of world
output; North America is next with 31 per cent; Europe, including reunified
Germany, 27 per cent; and Israel and Jordan 8 per cent.
The consumption figures are different: 23 per cent for the Soviet Union;
Europe, 32 per cent; North America, 20 per cent; 16 per cent in Asia; and 7
per cent for Latin America.
China is now buying about 2m tonnes a year as it reduces nitrogen use. This
is expected to rise to an estimated 6m tonnes by the year 2000, says Mr
Childers.
The World Bank estimates an annual rise in demand of up to 2 per cent.
Mr Childers sees little chance of new mine production coming on stream
anywhere yet. 'A 1m tonne yearly mine and processing plant costs around
Dollars 350m in North American terms and the return on investment is very
slim,' he said.

FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ore tests delay nickel project
for second time
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish state-owned base metals group, and Australian
Consolidated Minerals (ACM) have delayed for a second time giving the
go-ahead to the Mt Keith nickel project in Western Australia.
The scheme would produce 28,000 tonnes annually of nickel in concentrate,
adding about 5 per cent to western world supplies.
Tests have shown that some of the ore has a higher level of magnesia than
showed up previously and this might affect operating costs at the proposed
mine and/or treatment charges at the smelter.
Outokumpu said yesterday that tests to determine the precise levels of
magnesia will take at least two months to complete.
Pending the outcome, the commercial agreements between the partners may have
to be reviewed.
Agreements between Outokumpu and ACM expire in September if a decision to
develop Mt Keith has not been made by then.
Mr Graham Mascall, business development director of Outokumpu Metals and
Resources International, said it was still too early to determine if the
magnesia found in the orebody was due to a procedural error.
'There may be big or small amounts of magnesia (in the orebody). Tests may
prove that it may not be a problem after all,' he said.
In 1989 large-scale pilot plant samples taken from Mt Keith indicated that
nickel concentrate assaying 20 per cent nickel could be produced at 75 per
cent metal recovery rates.
Outokumpu is also considering mining nickel at its joint venture with
Forrestania, the Australian group in which it has 50 per cent shareholding.
Forrestania's mine, about 200 miles south-east of Perth, is expected to
begin production at the end of next year and would produce annually between
7,000 and 8,000 tonnes of nickel.

<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government has raised the export limit for sugar in the 1990-91
season by a further 100,000 tonnes to 525,000 tonnes.
Up to the end of March, the industry produced 9.2m tonnes, 800,000 tonnes
more than the corresponding period of the previous season, and has been
seeking to export at least 500,000 tonnes in order to maintain prices in the
domestic market.
The government has only gradually increased the amount it is prepared to see
exported, and has been reassured by the fact that sugar prices have not
moved up even after export releases.
However, the low domestic prices have kept the pressure on sugar mills,
which have not been able to clear their cane bills.
The Indian Sugar and General Industry Export Import Corporation, which is
now handling exports independently of the state, has finalised procurement
of 125,000 tonnes of sugar from mills in Maharashtra, 65,000 tonnes from
Tamil Nadu and 35,000 tonnes from Karnataka.
Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for the corporation, said it should be possible to
ship 225,000 tonnes of sugar by May. Sugar export was reviewed at a recent
meeting of the corporation. Sales contracts settled so far are for delivery
to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Belgium and the US.

FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Large surplus of copper
concentrates forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER DEMAND is growing more strongly than previously expected but the
supply chain is getting out of balance, according to Mitsubishi Materials
Corporation.
Substantial surpluses of copper concentrates, an intermediate material, are
likely in the next 10 years, says Mr Shigeki Yabuta, Mitsubishi's general
manager, ore department.
Among the projects contributing to the concentrates surplus are Escondida in
Chile (owned by a consortium including BHP of Australia and RTZ Corporation
of the UK and Mitsubishi); the expansion of Freeport Copper's Etsburg mine
in Indonesia; and the potential re-start of Bougainville, operated by CRA of
Australia, in Papua New Guinea.
Mr Yabuta says that if all known new smelter projects go ahead as planned
there would be enough smelting capacity to meet projected demand during the
1990s.
However, some will probably be delayed because of environmental pressures
and the problems of raising capital. Delays would worsen the concentrates
surplus.
Copper demand in the west (excluding the former and present Communist
countries) is likely to grow by 8.7 per cent between 1990 and 1995 and by
nearly 20 per cent between 1990 and the year 2000, Mitsubishi forecasts.
This would increase annual consumption by 776,000 tonnes to 9.708m tonnes in
1995 and 10.672m tonnes in the year 2000.
Mitsubishi suggests that former and existing Communist countries will show a
0.4 per cent annual consumption increase raising total world copper demand
in 1995 to 12.107m tonnes, and 13.119m tonnes in the year 2000.
Mr Yabuta, in a paper prepared for a meeting of the International Wrought
Copper Council, suggests that 824,000 tonnes of the additional demand by
1995 will be met by cathodes produced by the solvent
extraction-electrowinning process and 132,000 tonnes by the increased
recovery of scrap metal.
This leaves a balance of 317,000 tonnes of copper to be provided by
concentrates.
Projects already under way would provide an extra 528,000 tonnes of copper
in concentrates by 1995, giving a surplus of 210,000 tonnes. He suggests
that the surplus will rise to at least 860,000 tonnes by the year 2000.
To meet forecast extra demand an additional 449,000 tonnes of smelting and
refining capacity is required by 1995 and by 2000 an additional 1.462m
tonnes - 'equivalent to 10 large-scale smelters of 150,000 tonnes each'.
If all planned projects went ahead, there would be 540,000 tonnes of
additional smelting capacity by 1995 and an increase of 1.45m tonnes by
2000, 'almost enough to meet forecast increases in refined copper
consumption'
Refined copper consumption last year rose by more than 2 per cent to a
record 8.87m tonnes while production increased by less than 1 per cent to
8.402m tonnes, according to the International Wrought Copper Council.
This implies there was a supply deficit of about 200,000 tonnes.
Consumption will be flat this year, predicts the IWCC, while production
should continue to grow, suggesting there will be a small supply surplus,
'to be followed by a larger surplus in 1992'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORECASTS for sugar production in both China and Thailand this season have
been revised upwards by Czarnikow, the London brokers, writes David
Blackwell.
It was feared that Thai production would fall well below the 3.5m tonnes of
last season, but by the first week of this month that level had been
surpassed. It now appears that final production could reach just under 4m
tonnes in raw value, Czarnikow says in its latest Sugar Review.
The Thai government has encouraged farmers to reduce paddy planting and they
have opted for cane.
China has been encouraging sugar planting with price incentives and by the
end of February production was 1.5m tonnes above the previous year.
If this gain is maintained, internal requirements, estimated at 7.2m tonnes
raw value, 'could be almost entirely met with indigenous supplies', says
Czarnikow.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices paid for wool at Australian auctions continue to move gradually
upwards. The market indicator reached 467 this week, nearly 10pc above its
recent low point. Wool auctioned in other countries is also meeting with
good trade demand, and occasional mention of purchases by China, Russia, and
Eastern Europe are encouraging. There is however no clear recovery from the
textile recession which coincided with the wool crisis. In the UK activity
is no worse but hopes of an all-round improving trend are certainly not
being rapidly realised. Prices remain competitive for this reason and only
just reflect raw wool's strength.

<TEXT>
AEGON, the Dutch insurance company, may lower the price at which investors
can convert Swiss franc notes into shares, to discourage them from
exercising a put option which falls on June 30, writes Tracy Corrigan.
Investors must give notice of their intention to exercise that put option
between May 16 and May 31.
Holders of two convertible issues totalling SFr310m, launched by Swiss Bank
Corporation in 1986, are likely to demand early redemption under the put
option at par plus a premium of 10.25 per cent for one deal and 11.5 per
cent for the other, unless the share price improves substantially by that
time.
The share price is currently DFl 130, so conversion at the set price of DFl
126 does not appear attractive.

FT  18 APR 91 / International Bonds: Roche US unit in Dollars 1bn innovative
warrant deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROCHE Holdings, the US subsidiary of the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, added
to the supply of equity-linked paper yesterday, launching an innovative
Dollars 1bn warrant bond issue.
The deal is Roche's first debt issue in the international market and is
structured to protect warrant holders from any serious decline in the share
price of the Swiss parent company.
Priced at par, each bond pays a coupon of 3 1/2 per cent and was issued with
73 warrants attached. The European-style warrants are exerciseable on May
16, 1994, with each 100 warrants entitling the holder to receive one share.
However, holders have the option of taking a SFr7,000 cash payment if Roche
shares are below this level.
The cost of this protection is that the company has the option of making a
SFr10,000 cash payment in place of shares. Hence both the risk and the
reward of the warrants are moderated by the structure. This is the first
time that 'bull spread' warrants on the shares of a single company have been
issued in the international market.
Lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said that the minimum annual return was
1.7 per cent and the maximum return 14.6 per cent. Roche shares yield around
0.56 per cent on the Zurich stock market and yesterday closed slightly
higher on the day at SFr7550.
Participants said the structure appealed to Swiss institutional investors,
many of which have to meet minimum investment return targets under law. SBC
also expects to sell paper to retail investors through its branch network.
Issued at par, the bonds were trading at 100.25 bid by late afternoon with
syndicate members reporting a good response.
A very different equity-linked transaction was launched by Credit Suisse
First Boston for the PT Inti Indorayon Utama, an Indonesian pulp and
textiles firm.
The Dollars 60m convertible bond issue is the third by an Indonesian company
in the international market. Indorayon is Indonesia's fifth largest company
with a market capitalisation of around Dollars 1bn.
However, the deal follows the weak performance of the last convertible deal
from an Indonesian company, a Dollars 125m deal launched earlier this year
by PT Astra. Issued at par, Astra bonds were yesterday trading at around 95
bid.
The Indorayon deal will be priced on Monday at an indicated conversion
premium of between 6 per cent and 10 per cent over the current share price.
The coupon will be fixed at between 7 per cent and 7.25 per cent. The lead
manager commented that the smaller size of the deal should ensure firmer
price performance for the bonds, although the issuer hopes to lift the deal
to Dollars 75m if market conditions allow.
Elsewhere, Sears, the UK retailing group, launched a Pounds 100m five-year
deal lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The deal will be priced
today at an indicated yield spread of 135 basis points over the benchmark UK
government bond.
Sweden has announced a tender offer to buy back up to Dollars 1bn of
Eurodollar and US bonds via Salomon Brothers. The Pounds 250m 8 5/8 per cent
Eurobond maturing 2016 will be bought back at a fixed spread of 60 basis
over US Treasuries. Four US issues will also be bought back at a fixed
spread over Treasuries. The offer is open to April 24.

FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Chile changes the rules for
conversion - The central bank has responded to pressure from investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S central bank, under pressure from foreign and Chilean investors, has
relaxed the rules of its debt-equity conversion programme.
Foreign companies who used debt swaps to invest in Chile can now repatriate
capital after three years, instead of the 10 years stipulated in the
original debt-conversion contracts.
But those who wish to unlock their investments before 10 years will have to
pay a penalty. The central bank says it will charge an exit fee based on the
length of time the company has been in Chile, and on the bonus the company
gained through the purchase of Chilean debt at a discount on the secondary
markets.
The central bank says the exit fee will put companies who invested through
debt swaps, otherwise known as Chapter XIX of the Compendium of Foreign
Exchange Regulations, on an equal footing with foreign investors who brought
their own capital into Chile.
The central bank adopted these more flexible rules due to the difficulties
two large foreign investors are having in trying to pull out of Chile.
Carter Holt Harvey, the New Zealand forestry group, is seeking a buyer for
its Dollars 500m stake in Copec, Chile's largest private industrial group,
and Security Pacific, the US bank, has been unable to sell 60 per cent of
its Chilean bank.
Both companies were among the first to take advantage of the incentives
offered by Chile's debt swap programme. Carter Holt bought into Copec in
1987 with a Dollars 161m debt swap.
It later expanded its Chilean holdings in forestry, cellulose production and
fishing with Dollars 135m of its own resources. It also launched a Dollars
1.2bn investment programme with Chile's Angelini group, the other main
shareholder in Copec.
Given that the bulk of these investments will begin to bear fruit next year,
when Copec's Dollars 600m Arauco II cellulose plant comes on stream, Carter
Holt's plans to sell its Chilean assets came as a surprise. The New Zealand
group said in February that the sale would ease the company's debt burden
following a series of acquisitions in Australia and at home.
But under the old Chapter XIX rules, Carter Holt's divestment plans hit a
snag: it had signed a pact with Mr Anacleto Angelini in 1987 giving his
group the first option to purchase Carter Holt's Copec shares if the New
Zealanders ever decided to pull out of Chile. And by selling to a Chilean
group, the proceeds would remain tied in Chile until 1997.
So Copec joined the growing chorus of corporate critics against the central
bank. 'It is grossly unfair to forbid Chileans from taking over these
investments,' says Mr Jose Antonio Guzman Dumas, Copec's vice-president.
Security Pacific says it is in a different boat. It set up operations in
Santiago in 1987, converting Dollars 68m of Chilean debt that it held in its
own books. 'The subsidy issue therefore does not arise,' argues Mr Rodrigo
Munoz, the general manager at Security Pacific Valores.
The US bank, which has closed operations in several European capitals in
order to strengthen reserves at home, says it would not be pulling out of
Chile completely. It wants to sell 60 per cent of its Chilean assets to the
bank's local employees. This has already been approved by Chile's banking
regulators.
With the new Chapter XIX rules, both Security Pacific and Carter Holt will
be able to unlock their investments in Chile, subject to the central bank's
exit fee.
The new rules effectively spell the end of Chile's debt-conversion
programme, which has retired Dollars 3.6bn of debt over the past six years.
For the past year, critics have argued that the usefulness of the scheme had
run its course and that the central bank was deliberately blocking Chileans
from participating in the country's investment bonanza.
With Chilean debt now trading at close to 85 per cent of par value in the
secondary markets, there is very little to gain from Chapter XIX swaps. They
have all but ceased. Direct foreign investment, however, totalled over
Dollars 1.4bn last year.
The critics argued that with so much money pouring into the country, the
central bank could afford to be more flexible in its foreign investment
rules. By easing restrictions now, at a time when the country's net
international reserves total a record Dollars 5.73bn, the central bank will
be averting a sudden swell of capital repatriation in the second half of the
decade.

THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange will launch trading in options on its
one-month Libor (London interbank offered rate) futures contract on June 12.
The futures-options will add a fresh dimension to the one-month Libor
future, which has become the most successful new contract launched by the
exchange since its Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index future started trading
in 1982.
As of April 15, open interest in the Libor futures stood at 15,931 - a
record. Trading volume has also steadily increased, with the March monthly
total reaching nearly 35,500 contracts.
Apart from the Libor futures and the proposed Libor options, the exchange's
interest rate products include futures and options on 90-day Treasury bills
and Eurodollars. One-month Libor options will be listed on the first three
consecutive contract months on June 12, pending approval by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulators.

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy's liberalised rules on bank branching, introduced at the
end of March 1990, have resulted in the green light for 2,562 new bank
outlets in the first year alone.
According to the central bank, which previously kept new branch openings in
Italy under very tight control, 1,225 of the new outlets are already
operative.
Despite the relaxation of the previous system, under which the Bank of Italy
would adjudicate on requests for new branches at roughly four-year
intervals, around a quarter of the applications it received in the past year
have been rejected.
Of the 3,789 cases of banks informing the Bank of Italy that they wanted to
open new units, the central bank blocked 912. A further 315 requests were
still under consideration as at end-March, it said.
As expected, the bulk of the failed applications came from small banks with
expansion plans which the Bank of Italy has judged to be too grandiose in
relation to their size and resources.
Jafco, the Nomura Securities subsidiary which is Japan's leading venture
capital investor, is taking a 1 per cent stake in Sofipa, the Italian
venture capital group.
The investment, Jafco's first initiative in Italy, will come via a capital
increase at Rome-based Sofipa, which is raising its fully-paid up share
capital to L120bn.
Sofipa, set up in 1982, has investments with a book value of L79bn. Two of
the companies in which it has invested have gone public in recent years.

junk bond deals
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SWEDISH investment management firm, Carlson Investment Management, has
completed two deals backed by portfolios of junk bonds and placed with US
insurance companies. Further deals, to be placed with European investors,
are planned.
The US high-yield or junk bonds were repackaged to create two issues of
collateralised bond obligations (CBO). The first, a Dollars 115m CBO, will
be managed by Saudi International Bank. About Dollars 85m of senior bonds
were placed with US investors, while Dollars 10m of lower-ranked bonds were
bought by Saudi. Carlson will hold the remaining equity.
The portfolio yields around 15 per cent, while the new bonds pay interest of
just over 10 per cent, providing a substantial cushion for defaults.
Although economic recession in the US has increased the level of corporate
defaults, many investors now take the view that the worst is over, and are
becoming hungry for yield, said Mr Bjorn Carlson, the president of Carlson
Investment Management.
The second deal was a Dollars 225m package arranged in conjunction with
Massachusetts Mutual Life. An issue of Dollars 180m bonds was placed with US
insurance companies, with the two arrangers holding the equity. Both issues
were rated Double-A2 by Moody's and have an expected life of about eight
years.

issue

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KINKI Nippon Railway, a leading Japanese private railway company, launched
the first straight bond issue by an industrial company for two years
yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The nine-year bonds are worth
Y10bn with a coupon of 7 per cent.
This will be the first domestic straight bond issue by a industrial company
since Mitsubishi Estate's flotation in November 1988, only a month after the
market was opened to industrial companies.
Japanese companies have since relied on equity-linked funding, such as
warrant bonds and convertible bonds, and kept their distance from the
straight bonds.
Government restrictions preventing companies with low ratings from financing
had partly stemmed the flow, as had the high commission costs, which had
made the bonds less attractive than equity-linked issues.
The result has been that only a select group of utilities companies, such as
electrical power companies and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, have used
straight bonds.
But tighter lending policies enforced by Japanese banks and a realisation of
the risks linked to equity financing in a volatile stock market have
prompted companies to seek other sources of financing.
Leading industrial companies are expected to turn to the straight bond
market. Mitsubishi Estate has again filed applications with the Ministry of
Finance, and plans to issue a total of Y200bn within the next two years.
Mr Mitsuru Nagai, director and general manager at Kinki Nippon Railway's
finance and accounting division, said that the sluggish stock market has
made the company cautious about equity linked financing.
'And you can't get a bank to lend Y10bn on the spot these days,' he added.

EUROPEAN bond holders owed a total of USDollars 1bn by Australia's teetering
Bond Corporation are due to hold their delayed meetings next month to vote
on a proposed reconstruction of the group in which they would take about 70
per cent of the equity.
The bond holders were given some hope yesterday that Bond Corp would survive
until the meetings when the liquidator to subsidiary J. N. Taylor agreed in
an out of court settlement to delay winding up proceedings against Bond Corp
Finance, the Bond Corp finance arm. BCF owes J. N. Taylor Dollars 180m. When
J. N. Taylor was placed in liquidation last year it also triggered the
collapse of Bond Corp.
The J. N. Taylor liquidator, Mr Richard England, agreed yesterday to
temporarily withdraw his action to seek a provisional liquidator to BCF
while he examined BCF's books. He has agreed to stay his hand until next
Friday.
Yesterday's proceedings in the Supreme Court of South Australia, the state
in which J. N. Taylor is incorporated, were adjourned until Monday week
pending the outcome of Mr England's examination.
He is expected to decide then whether to press ahead with his winding up
application against BCF, or take part in the reconstruction.
Bond Corp's largest single creditor, Bell Resources (now known as Australian
Consolidated Investments), which is owed Dollars 430m, has tentatively
agreed to take part in the scheme of arrangements and exchange its debt for
equity in Bond Corp.
Bond Corp executive director Mr Kim McGrath, said yesterday the company
would begin advertising the dates of the bond holders' meetings in European
newspapers today.
Convertible bond holders will be asked to meet in London on May 9, the Swiss
debt holders in Geneva on May 16 and the German Eurobond holders in
Frankfurt on May 31.

FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Queues form for Japanese ships -
Domestic buyers are having to look abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Yusen, the flag carrier of Japan's shipping lines, has always bought
its ships from domestic companies. But the long queue of buyers at Japanese
yards has just forced even the patriotic Nippon Yusen to turn to Taiwan for
a new bulk carrier.
'We haven't bought a ship from outside Japan since the end of the Second
World War. This is quite a historic thing. We would have to to wait three
years in Japan so we chose Taiwan. Anyway, it's cheaper there, about 10 per
cent cheaper,' a Nippon Yusen spokesman said.
Shipbuilding companies now complain that the biggest problem is not a lack
of orders, but a shortage of staff, and they are known to be routinely
turning down orders in the confident expectation that ship prices, up 17.9
per cent in the year to end March, will continue to rise.
At the NKK Corporation yard at Tsu on the central coast, the order books are
full until April 1994, and Mr Heiichiro Miyazaki, the company's managing
director, suggested that increasing demand is likely to mean supply
shortages and strong prices in the second half of the decade.
Having experienced a severe slump in the mid-1980s, the shipbuilders are
determined that price-cutting and other examples of 'excessive competition'
will not interfere with their long-term profit plans.
A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) said that production
facilities will not be increased, even though the company could take orders,
and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), with its facilities booked
until 1993, said that it built 10 ships last year, will build 10 ships this
year, and plans to build 10 ships in financial 1992.
'We don't have plans to increase our capacity, mainly because we have
problems finding workers. The other problem is that the low level of profits
we are now getting does not justify the level of capital investment needed
to increase capacity,' an IHI spokesman said.
Sumitomo Heavy Industries predicts a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profit
for the year to March 1991, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which reported a
loss in 1988, expects a 20 per cent profit increase for the year. Mitsui
Engineering and Shipbuilding, which had operating losses in 1987 and 1988,
is likely to announce a Y4bn (Dollars 29m) pre-tax profit, about 5 per cent
up on 1989.
While the labour shortage is a serious problem - Japan's jobs to applicants
ratio is 1.46:1 - an automation drive has reduced the number of manual
working hours by about 70 per cent since 1973. As well, the companies and
the transport ministry are co-ordinating a campaign to improve the image of
shipbuilding to attract young workers.
The ministry is contributing to the image renovation campaign by sponsoring
the development of a futuristic cargo vessel, while it is presumed that
diversification into areas such as aerospace will help to change the
public's general impression of the heavy industrial companies.
Japanese shipbuilders are generally relieved that the era of savage
competition with South Korea is over. One company official said that there
is now pricing 'harmony' among the world's two largest shipbuilding nations,
which have close to 75 per cent of the market - Japanese companies estimate
that they have about 48 per cent and South Korean firms about 25 per cent.
While Japanese companies insist that supply has been limited by a 24 per
cent cut in capacity administered by the transport ministry, modernisation
of facilities has allowed the yards to build more ships per dock. About 80
per cent of the building is now done outside the dock itself, giving
companies the potential to increase capacity, if such an increase was
thought to be in the companies' best interests.
It is clear that Japanese builders are not planning such an increase, as it
would conflict with the general perception in the market of limited supply
and with hopes for a steady increase in prices over the next few years. As
prices increase, shipbuilding will become a more important revenue source
for the diversification-minded heavy industrials.
MHI said that shipbuilding accounts for about 9 per cent of sales, with
power plants, aircraft and other industrial equipment now more important
sources of incomes. But shipbuilding still accounts for about 36 per cent of
sales at Hitachi Zosen. This company expects pre-tax profits to more than
double to Y5bn in the year to March 1991.

ITOMAN, the debt-ridden Japanese trading company, has started legal moves to
seize the assets of one of its biggest debtors, Mr Ho Yong Chung, a Korean
businessman.
The company's action yesterday forced the closure of Kansai Shimbun, a
newspaper which is one of Mr Ho's main operating companies.
Itoman's action followed Kansai Shimbun's failure to meet deadlines for the
repayment of Y62.5bn (Dollars 463m) it borrowed from Itoman last year to
finance speculative investment in art. The paintings which were handed over
to Itoman as security for the loan have been found to be worth considerably
less than was originally claimed.
The Osaka District Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the deal and
other aspects of the relationship between Mr Ho and Itoman. Mr Ho was until
early this year Itoman's largest shareholder with a 19 per cent stake and
great influence over Mr Yoshihiko Kawamura, the Itoman president.

A SPECIAL fund set up by China and Britain to provide reserves for Hong Kong
when it returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 has bought a 6 per cent stake
costing about HKDollars 800m (USDollars 102m) in Hongkong International
Terminals, the colony's biggest container terminal operator, from Hutchison
Whampoa, which is controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing.
Hutchison retains a controlling 60.5 per cent stake in HIT which last month
linked up with its main local rival, Modern Terminals, to develop Hong
Kong's container terminal number eight at a cost of about HKDollars 7bn.
The deal is significant because the fund - known as the Hong Kong SAR Land
Fund - is basically a Peking-run organisation. Peking-controlled China
Resources already has a 10 per cent stake in HIT and another Peking company,
China Ocean Shipping Corporation, is involved with HIT.
This illustrates how China is increasing its investments in Hong Kong's
leading infrastructure projects, despite its current opposition to detailed
plans for the colony's proposed HKDollars 100bn airport.
The SAR Land Fund - SAR stands for Special Administrative Region which will
be Hong Kong's status after the 1997 handover - was set up in 1986. It
receives a 50 per cent share of the proceeds from government land sales.

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE March gold quarterly results released this week by four of South
Africa's mining houses testify to the extremely difficult times the industry
is experiencing.
Mines in the Gencor and Rand Mines groups were particularly badly hit.
Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group, saw after-tax profits fall 33 per
cent to R63.6m in the three months ended December 1990.
A one-off retrenchment payment at Harmony mine pushed the Rand Mines group's
gold operations into an after-tax loss of R30.4m (Dollars 11.19m), against
an R11.2m loss last time.
Gengold admits that with the group having reached the limit of cost-cutting
measures, it is now virtually beyond management's ability to do anything
about the declining trend in profits. Gold production fell by 3.5 per cent.
The one-off payment at Rand Mines' Harmony was for 6,000 redundancies. The
group's Durban Deep mine continued to recover though, earning R2.7m after
tax. Harmony would have broken even but for extraordinary expenses.
Randfontein and Western areas, two of the mines managed by Johannesburg
Consolidated, suffered from unexpected production disruptions during the
quarter.
Randfontein made a profit of R31.1m, against R32.5m, but Western Areas saw
profits drop by 29 per cent to R6.6m following power supply problems. The
developing mine Joel continued to show improved development grades.
The four mines managed by the Anglovaal group maintained profits at R39m,
due mainly to a decreased tax charge at Hartebeestfontein, the group's
leading mine which made a profit of R39.8m. The marginal producer Loraine
made a loss of R5.2m despite stringent measures aimed at cutting costs.

Technologies sharply down
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE impact of the US recession on the airline, building and automotive
industries has severely hurt first-quarter earnings at United Technologies,
the diversified engineering group, which turned in results significantly
worse than expected.
Although it had warned that earnings in the first half of 1991 would
decline, the first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 40.2m, or 25 cents a
share, were sharply below the 75 cents anticipated by most analysts.
'I had expected a bad quarter and reduced my estimates to 50 cents a share,'
said one, 'but these figures were terrible'.
In the first three months of 1990, UTC had net earnings of Dollars 134.5m,
or Dollars 1.01 a share. Revenues were flat at Dollars 4.8bn.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman and chief executive, said harsh economic
conditions had a severe impact on first-quarter performance. 'Airline
travel, building construction and automobile production; all are down
sharply. This is the first time all three of these core commercial markets
simultaneously have been at the bottom of their industrial cycles.
'We are not running our businesses on the assumption that the recession is
nearing an end,' he added.
Operating income in UTC's power segment plunged to Dollars 113m from Dollars
249m a year ago.
At UTC's Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, which recently said it would
cut between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs by the end of June, revenues from its
lucrative spare parts business dropped 25 per cent in the first quarter. The
company blamed this on sharply reduced airline travel and poor results at
the airlines.
Profits from UTC's building systems dropped to Dollars 31m from Dollars 90m.
Almost half of this was attributed to the Brazilian operations of UTC's
Carrier air conditioning company where volumes fell sharply.
The industrial segment suffered a loss of Dollars 5m against profits of
Dollars 15m a year earlier, which was blamed on the 18 per cent decline in
North American car and light truck production in the quarter.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph reaffirmed its determination to acquire
computer maker NCR at the AT&amp;T annual meeting in Chicago yesterday.
Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T chairman, said, however, that the Dollars 110 per
share sought by NCR 'is a price we're not willing to pay'.
The proposed acquisition remains a key aspect of AT&amp;T's strategy, Mr Allen
said. 'AT&amp;T is firmly committed to a strategy for growth. Leadership in
telecommunications is no longer enough.' AT&amp;T must expand its presence in
the market for networked computers, Mr Allen said.
Networked computing has become 'a driving force behind the worldwide
exchange of information', he noted. 'I want AT&amp;T to be a part of that
business. This acquisition would make us the leader in network computing.'
This month AT&amp;T succeeded in ousting four directors of NCR, the
fifth-largest US computer manufacturer, including Mr Charles Exley, its
chairman. AT&amp;T had tried to win control of NCR's 12-member board of
directors as part of its hostile takeover bid.
AT&amp;T originally offered to buy NCR for Dollars 90 per share but NCR
responded with a request for Dollars 125. NCR dropped its request to Dollars
110 a share but AT&amp;T said it would be willing to offer Dollars 100 per share
if NCR dropped its opposition to the bid.
AT&amp;T has already spent Dollars 12m in legal fees on the takeover attempt, Mr
Allen said.
AT&amp;T also reported its first-quarter results yesterday. Earnings for the
quarter rose 6.6 per cent to Dollars 712m, or 65 cents a share, from Dollars
668m, or 62 cents, in the first quarter of 1990. Revenues increased to
Dollars 9.19bn from Dollars 8.9bn in the year-ago period.
AT&amp;T's earnings were boosted by a one-time gain of Dollars 43m from the sale
of 20 per cent of its Unix System Laboratories computer software subsidiary.

DEPRESSED markets for pulp, paper and wood products brought an 87 per cent

or 26 cents a common share in the first quarter of 1990 when the recession
was already biting into forest products companies' earnings.
Sales were CDollars 678m, against CDollars 781m.
After preferred dividends, there were no earnings attributable to the common
shares in the latest quarter.
Newsprint markets were weak and a price increase posted on January 1 failed
to hold. Advertising volume in the western US market has fallen drastically
this year. Pulp and containerboard prices continued to decline.
MacMillan said the brighter spots included offshore and speciality timber
markets and the Netherlands fine paper affiliate KNP made a good profit
contribution.

THE Canadian forest products industry is reporting continued losses for the
first quarter and warns that little relief is likely until well into 1992.
Canadian Pacific Forest Products, a fully integrated group and one of North
America's biggest newsprint producers, reported a first-quarter loss of
CDollars 50.1m (USDollars 43.1m), or CDollars 1.14 a share, against a profit
of CDollars 4.8m or 11 cents a year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 526m
from CDollars 623m.
The company cited low market pulp prices, now down about USDollars 200 per
ton from the recent peak, and also poor newsprint prices. Tonnage volumes
were also sharply lower.
CPFP is reviewing all its operations and will keep only those businesses
where it has 'competitive strength'.
But it is completing a CDollars 350m modernisation at Thunder Bay in Ontario
and will invest a further CDollars 210m for a new pulping unit and paper
machine modernisation at Gatineau in Quebec.
Donohue, another big market pulp and newsprint producer, suffered a net loss
of CDollars 1.3m, or 5 cents a share in the first quarter against profit of
CDollars 10m or 31 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 131m, against
CDollars 158m. The only bright area is lumber where lower interest rates and
higher North American stocks are beginning to firm prices.

<TEXT>
GTE, which operates the largest non-Bell telephone system in the US,
yesterday revealed a sharp fall in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 200m,
compared with Dollars 407m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per
cent share slipped from 46 cents to 22 cents.
However, the market was already aware GTE would take a one-time charge,
resulting from its merger with Contel, and had expected the bottom-line
reduction.
GTE said that, exclusive of the Dollars 245m one-off charge and a
compensatory gain on the transfer of minority interests in certain cellular
properties, net income worked out at Dollars 404m, or 45 cents a share.
This, it said, represented a 7 per cent advance on the first quarter of 1990
 -once the previous year's results were also adjusted to include a full
period of operations for the cellular properties bought last year.
Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 5.22bn, with Dollars 3.79bn
coming from the telephone operations.
GTE said the reduction in revenues from its telephone operations reflected
the weakening economy. Operating income in this division improved by 7 per
cent to Dollars 964m, largely due to cost control and a reorganisation of
operations.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which is trimming its sails to
adjust to lower military spending, suffered a small drop in earnings from
continuing operations in the first quarter.
Net earnings tumbled to Dollars 57m, or Dollars 1.37 a share, from Dollars
124m, or Dollars 2.97 a share, a year earlier. Last year's figures however,
included a large gain from the settlement of an anti-trust suit against AT&amp;T
and other telephone companies.
Earnings from continuing operations were Dollars 63m in the first quarter of
1990. Sales dipped to Dollars 2.3bn from almost Dollars 2.5bn, and the order
backlog plunged to Dollars 22.7bn from Dollars 27.7bn. In both cases, the
drop was blamed on the Pentagon's decision to scrap the A-12 attack aircraft
programme.
General Dynamics took a large charge on the A-12 last year to reflect the
uncertain outcome of legal claims it has launched against the US government.
Mr William Anders, chief executive, said the earnings 'are right in line
with our plan'. Mr Anders' strategy includes an emphasis on cash flow, which
has resulted in a far-reaching austerity drive to maintain margins in a
declining market.
General Dynamics cut its workforce to 90,900 from 98,100 during the first
quarter, and is chopping capital spending this year by 46 per cent. The
research and development budget has been trimmed by 18 per cent in the past
year to an annual rate of about Dollars 200m.
As domestic defence business slips, the company is working hard to expand
its penetration of the international market.
Thiokol, another defence and space contractor, posted a small increase in
net income in the March quarter to Dollars 11.6m (60 cents a share) from
Dollars 10.5m (54 cents) a year earlier. Sales climbed by 7.8 per cent to
Dollars 307.9m.
A 25 per cent tumble in operating income from space business was offset by a
strong performance in some military sectors and higher interest income.

THE strength of the worldwide drugs industry was reflected in the the
first-quarter results of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Warner Lambert which both
yesterday reported higher earnings and sales. The groups were helped by
improved drugs sales and the weakness of the dollar overseas.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's second-biggest drugs company which was
formed after an Dollars 11.5bn merger in 1989, turned in a 20 per cent
improvement in first-quarter net earnings on an 11 per cent improvement in
sales.
In the three months ended March, the New York-based company had net profits
of Dollars 492.6m or 94 cents a share on sales of Dollars 2.73bn, compared
with income of Dollars 409.1m or 78 cents on sales of Dollars 2.46bn a year
earlier.
Sales were helped by favourable foreign exchange translations, which
contributed two percentage points to the improvement in the 1991 quarter.
Earnings before taxes rose 18.4 per cent to Dollars 703.7m from Dollars
594.6m.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman and chief executive, said international sales in
the 1991 quarter increased 14 per cent, compared with a 9 per cent
improvement in domestic sales. Sales of pharmaceuticals and medical devices
were particularly strong.
Warner-Lambert, a US pharmaceuticals and non-prescription health products
group, also reported strong first-quarter earnings.
Net income grew 16 per cent to Dollars 139.5m or Dollars 1.04 a share from
Dollars 100.3m or 90 cents a share in the first quarter of 1990. Sales rose
11 per cent to Dollars 1.22bn from Dollars 1.1bn. Excluding the benefits of
foreign exchange translations, sales advanced 8 per cent in the latest
quarter.
During the 1991 first quarter, sales of Warner-Lambert's prescription
pharmaceuticals went ahead by 17 per cent to Dollars 421m, led by Lopid, a
cholesterol regulator, whose sales increased 45 per cent to Dollars 111m in
the quarter.
Sales of the company's non-prescription health care products rose 8 per cent
to Dollars 383m in the latest quarter, led by Listerine antiseptic mouthwash
and Halls cough tablets.
Worldwide sales of gums and mints improved 3 per cent in the three months to
Dollars 257m.
Warner-Lambert is waiting for the Food &amp; Drug Administration to approve its
Cognex drug to treat Alzheimer's disease. If the approval is forthcoming,
analysts believe Cognex will make a substantial contribution to
Warner-Lambert's earnings in the 1990s.
The company recently submitted additional data on Cognex and new analysis of
clinical data to the FDA.

PHILIP Morris, the huge tobacco and food combine, yesterday reported a 21.5
per cent increase in after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 1991, to
Dollars 942m.
Earnings per share rose by a similar amount, to Dollars 1.02, compared with
84 cents, although the advance in operating revenues was slightly greater,
up 24.9 per cent.
Figures for the first quarter of 1991 include results from Jacobs Suchard,
the Swiss-based coffee and confectionary group which Philip Morris bought
for Dollars 4.1bn in the autumn of 1990.
In terms of operating profits, the sharpest advance was seen in Philip
Morris' international tobacco division.
Here, profits rose to Dollars 509m from Dollars 382m, and Mr Hamish Maxwell,
the company's outgoing chairman, said unit volume - including the relatively
high-margin export business - increased by 23.4 per cent year-on-year.
On the domestic tobacco front, operating income rose by 12 per cent to
Dollars 914m, with 'slightly higher unit volume'. The US tobacco market has
been in decline for some years.
At Kraft General Foods, operating income surged by 24.5 per cent, but the
results partly reflect Suchard's inclusion. Mr Maxwell said General Foods
USA saw significant profit improvements, and KFG International also saw
higher volumes and margins in Europe.
Miller Brewing Company reported a slight improvement in operating income,
but volumes were affected by trade buy-ins ahead of the excise tax rise on
January 1.
American Brands, the tobacco, drinks and consumer products group, yesterday
reported a more modest 10.9 per cent advance in net earnings, at Dollars
216.7m, in the first quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 1.4bn merger between General Cinema, the US cinema and retailing
group, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the loss-making publishing and
insurance company, appears to be on the verge of collapse.
General Cinema said yesterday that it had failed to reach an agreement with
Harcourt bondholders over the purchase of their securities, and that no
further talks between the two parties had been scheduled.
The takeover of Harcourt by General Cinema, first revealed on January 24, is
conditional on 90 per cent of Harcourt bondholders accepting General
Cinema's offer of between 32.4 cents and 93 cents on the dollar for
Harcourt's junk bonds.
General Cinema has said it will terminate the merger agreement if a deal
with the bondholders is not struck before the deadline on the offer expires
today at 5pm, New York time.
General Cinema, which has twice extended the expiry date of its tender
offer, said it was willing to raise its bid for the bonds. However, the
company said the price demanded by the committee representing Harcourt
bondholders was too high.
The price of Harcourt's stock and junk bonds fell sharply on news of the
breakdown in talks. On the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt shares had
fallen Dollars  3/16 to Dollars  3/8 and its 14.75 subordinated debentures
due in 2002 had slipped 5 points to 32 by midday yesterday. General Cinema
shares were down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 23 7/8 .
Industry analysts said yesterday if the merger deal collapses, another buyer
of part, or all, of Harcourt would have to be found quickly if the
publishing and insurance group were to have a long-term future.

MICROSOFT, the personal computer software publisher, said Apple Computer
intends broaden its legal action to include claims that its Windows 3.0
program infringes upon Apple copyrights.
Windows 3.0, the latest version of a Microsoft program which gives
IBM-compatible computers ease-of-use features similar to those of Apple
Computer's Macintosh, is one of Microsoft's most successful products. Close
to 3m copies have been sold since it was introduced last May.
A spokesman for Apple said, however, that there had been no new filings in
the case and Apple has not made any formal changes to its complaint, which
also names Hewlett-Packard.
In its original suit, Apple claimed an earlier version of Windows 'and all
derivative works' infringed its copyrights. 'We consider Windows 3.0 to be a
derivative work,' Apple said.
At issue in the case are Apple's claims that computer screen graphics
produced by Microsoft's Windows duplicate the screen images of its Macintosh
personal computers.
Microsoft maintains it has not infringed any Apple copyrights.

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software publisher, reported record
revenues and profits for its third fiscal quarter, exceeding analysts
expectations, writes Louise Kehoe.
Third-quarter net income was Dollars 123.8m, or 98 cents per share, an
increase of 65 per cent over Dollars 75.2m, or 62 cents, in the
corresponding period a year ago.
Revenues for the quarter jumped 57 per cent to Dollars 486.9m from Dollars
310.9m in the same period last year.
Net income for the nine months rose 63 per cent to Dollars 324.3m, or
Dollars 2.61 per share, from Dollars 199.2m, or Dollars 1.69, a year ago.
Revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 1991, period were Dollars
1.3bn, 56 per cent more than the Dollars 846.5m recorded for the same period
of fiscal 1990.
Microsoft's performance is remarkable in light of slowing sales growth in
the personal computer market, particularly in the US.
The company said it achieved record revenues from both its retail sales of
applications programs and from sales of operating system software through
computer manufacturers.

tax

<TEXT>
SCOTT PAPER, the world's largest producer of toilet tissue, paper towels and
napkins, combined news of a 51 per cent slump in first-quarter net earnings,
with details of top management changes.
Scott said it made Dollars 29.3m after tax in the three months to March 30,
on sales of Dollars 1.23bn, compared with Dollars 60.1m on sales of Dollars
1.29bn last time. However, the 1991 figures exclude earnings and sales from
those 'non-strategic' businesses which Scott has put up for sale.
If these were also excluded from the 1990 results, sales would have risen
year-on-year by 10 per cent, while operating income would have declined by
17 per cent. The 1990 contribution to net income from these was negligible.
Scott blamed the profits drop on the depressed US economic environment, and
on the repairs to the recovery boiler needed at its Somerset mill in Maine.
These factors, it said, caused a sharp earnings fall at SD Warren, the
printing and publishing papers subsidiary.
By contrast, it suggested that Scott Worldwide, the personal care and
cleaning business, showed improved results, while the international
operations had 'an excellent quarter'. Earnings in Europe advanced by 70 per
cent.

<TEXT>
THE LIFE insurance subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, db Leben, signed up DM4bn
(Dollars 2.4bn) of new business in its first full year of operation,
incurring a loss of DM14.9m in the process.
The new venture, started in September 1989, completed 71,000 contracts, and
collected gross premium income amounting to DM143.5m during 1990.
By the end of March this year, the value of principal sums assured reached
DM6.1bn on a total of 108,000 contracts.
New business across the sector in Germany last year amounted to DM282bn,
giving Deutsche no more than a 1.4 per cent share of the market. However, db
Leben pointed out that it was offering only a very restricted range of
products - with the aim of broadening its selection this year.
New lines will play heavily on classical banking products - thus including
life products linked to credit packages and to investment products.
In the latter area, db Leben is keen to play on the fiscal advantage, where
it can offer a yield of 6 per cent free of tax. Deutsche's decision to
branch out independently into the insurance world caused a furore at the
time from the biggest established insurers, one of which suggested that such
a venture would take 10 years to turn a profit.
db Leben maintains it will be in the black 'considerably sooner'.
It says its network of 1,400 domestic branches has made a decisive
contribution to reaching new customers. This year's loss is covered by a
special fund set up by Deutsche Bank to meet start-up costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemical group, yesterday announced a 5 per cent dip in
net profits to BFr15.9bn (Dollars 463.5m) for 1990, but a BFr30 a share
increase in its dividend to BFr500.
Baron Daniel Janssen, executive chairman, said Solvay was bucking the trend
among European chemical companies, which have tended to maintain or lower
their dividends due to retained profits. It was insulated from the cyclical
downturn for most of its products.
Turnover was virtually unchanged, with 1990 sales amounting to BFr255bn. Mr
Janssen blamed cheap PVC imports from eastern Europe, which was only just
learning about market methods, and from the US, together with the difficulty
of recouping the increased cost of ethylene inputs and austerity measures in
Brazil, for the poorer performance of the group's plastics division.
The group's largest product group remains alkalis, including chemical soda
ash, of which Solvay is the world's largest producer. Mr Janssen said the
EC's action last autumn in removing anti-dumping duties from imports of
American soda ash, which is found naturally in Wyoming, would undoubtedly
increase competition from the US.
Mr Janssen, who summed up the company's philosophy as 'don't do much, but do
it well', said expansion would be focused on pharmaceutical and health
products, which had been Solvay's best performer last year. In the
veterinary field, he cited a recent strategic alliance with Abbott
Laboratories of the US. In terms of geographical diversification, Solvay is
focusing on the US, Asia and central Europe.
Solvay is negotiating with the Treuhandanstalt, the body responsible for
privatising eastern Germany's industry, for the return of its Bernberg
plant, seized by the Nazis in 1939. Yesterday it announced that it had,
together with Wienerberger of Austria, acquired the polyethylene pipes
division of Orbitaplast, near Leipzig in eastern Germany.

BILLITON, which includes most of the mining and metals operations of the

year, from Dollars 262m in 1989 to Dollars 170m.
The group said lower alumina and aluminium prices had a significant impact
on the 1990 results.
At the operating level aluminium profits fell by 65 per cent to Dollars 73m.
Downstream operating profits fell by 80 per cent to Dollars 17m, reflecting
prolonged start-up difficulties at Tiofine in the Netherlands and the impact
of lower prices, reduced margins and stock write-downs at most other
operations.
Marketing and trading operating profits fell by 60 per cent to Dollars 26m.
Exploration and mining operating profits rose by 33 per cent to Dollars 90m.

MR GIANCARLO Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, has been ousted
as chairman and chief executive of Pathe Communications.
He has been replaced by Mr Cesare De Michelis, a professor of letters at the
University of Padua and younger brother of Italian foreign minister Mr
Gianni De Michelis.
Mr Parretti will remain a majority shareholder of Pathe and will keep a seat
on its board. Hollywood has been buzzing with rumours about financial
malaise at MGM-Pathe almost from the moment MGM was acquired for Dollars
1.3bn last year by Mr Parretti's Pathe Communications. MGM-Pathe is facing
an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition from six creditors who claim
they are owed more than Dollars 11m.
MGM-Pathe said its main lender, Credit Lyonnais of France, has agreed to
provide Dollars 145m in additional loans if the involuntary bankruptcy
filing is dismissed. The studio plans to file a motion to dismiss the
petition within days.
However, Credit Lyonnais would not comment on the announcement and sources
close to the creditors voiced scepticism about the existence of the
financing. It is believed that the creditors would drop their bankruptcy
petition if MGM-Pathe paid them in full.
Earlier this week, the studio and its parent company said they would post
significant losses for 1990.
The studio is so strapped for cash that it had to delay the release of
Delirious, a new film starring John Candy, because it could not fund the
Dollars 7m promotional budget. MGM-Pathe said a release date for the film
would be announced shortly.
Credit Lyonnais has been an important backer for Mr Parretti and his
Geneva-based partner, Mr Florio Fiorini for several years. The bank
originally helped the partners to acquire Cannon Pictures in 1987 and Pathe
Communications in 1988.

THE COMBINED pre-tax profit of Finland's publicly quoted forest groups fell
by over 60 per cent in 1990 when compared with the previous year, according
to the Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries (CAFFI).
Mr Heikki Parnanen, a CAFFI vice-president, blamed the poor result of the
country's forest groups on high labour and production costs.
He said that the industry's debt level was also a big strain. 'The net debt
of all Finnish forest companies amounts to around 60 per cent of their
turnover; 6 to 7 per cent of their turnover goes to only paying the
interests on the loans,' he added.
Mr Parnanen estimates that it will up to 2 years before the situation
improves.
'This year will be even worse than 1990. The operating margin of all Finnish
forest companies is expected to drop from 13 per cent of turnover to under
10 per cent this year,' he said, adding that export earnings could also fall
by 10 per cent in 1991.
The sector employs between 70,000 and 75,000 people. Of these, 6,500 have
already lost their jobs with another 6,500 working a shortened week. By the
end of 1991, however, Mr Parnanen estimates the number of unemployed will
drop to 10,000-15,000.

<TEXT>
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial conglomerate, has acquired the
tyre division of Monarch, the North American rubber manufacturer owned by
the Teledyne group, for an undisclosed price. As a result Trelleborg claims
it is the world's biggest maker of solid industrial tyres.
The company estimates that its sales of industrial solid tyres will reach
Dollars 60m, 20 per cent of the world market, as a result of the
acquisition.
Monarch is one of North America's leading solid industrial tyre makers with
annual net sales of around Dollars 30m. Mr Sven-Gunnar Schough, president of
Trelleborg Tyres, said yesterday that the purchase of Monarch would
strengthen the company's position in that market which accounts for about 30
per cent of the industrial tyre industry.
The new purchase, which covers Monarch's production facilities at Hartville,
Ohio, will be added to the company's existing industrial tyre plants in
Belgium, through its subsidiary Bergougnan, and in Sri Lanka.
Mr Schough stressed yesterday that Monarch, like Bergougnan, would be able
to act independently in the market and continue to have its own marketing
operation. He believed there would be synergy effects in certain areas of
product development and co-ordination.

195.6m loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, one of the two biggest US carriers, yesterday kicked off
a dismal quarterly reporting season for the US airline industry by
announcing that it lost Dollars 195.6m in the first three months of the
year.
The figures bear the full brunt of the traffic slump, which resulted from
the Gulf War and the deepening domestic recession.
In addition, Mr Bob Crandall, American's forthright chairman, pointed to the
uncertainty created by difficult labour negotiations. The airline also
suffered from the loss of around 450 pilots called up to serve in Operation
Desert Storm.
'The net effect was to make our first quarter uniquely unhappy,' he said.
Wall Street, however, was braced for red ink, and American itself had
already warned of a significant first-quarter loss. Analysts were predicting
a loss per share of around Dollars 3, with the actual figure of Dollars 2.96
falling closely in line with expectations. Shares in AMR, the parent
company, gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 61 1/8 at midday.
American's hefty first-quarter loss compares with a Dollars 19.3m deficit in
the first three months of 1990, and a Dollars 215.1m deficit in the
October-December quarter. The first quarter of any year is traditionally a
weak period for the airline industry, although in 1989 and 1988 American did
make significant profits during the first three months.
AMR's revenues during the first quarter of 1991 rose marginally, from
Dollars 2.69bn to Dollars 2.77bn, but there was a significantly sharper
increase in operating costs, up by 11.6 per cent at Dollars 3.01bn. Labour
costs rose by 12.3 per cent, while fuel expenses were 11.1 per cent higher
than in the previous year, at Dollars 476.4m.
Capacity, in terms of available seat miles, increased by 2.5 per cent
year-on-year, but the passenger load factor fell from 59.9 per cent to 56.5
per cent. American said that the break-even load factor for the first
quarter was 63.5 per cent, up from 60.6 per cent a year earlier.
However, Mr Crandall struck a brighter note over future prospects. 'Fuel
prices have declined,' he said, 'and we anticipate lower costs for the
remainder of the year.' Sales, he added, had been picking up recently and he
suggested that there was 'some evidence' that the economy is strengthening.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: River &amp; Merc Extra launches Pounds 16m cash
call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIVER &amp; Mercantile Extra Income Trust, a split capital investment trust, is
making a rights offer to shareholders in an attempt to raise Pounds 15.9m.
The offer represents the latest attempt by an investment trust to exploit
the fact that its shares are trading at a premium to net asset value. Trusts
cannot make rights issues when the shares are at a discount, without further
diluting net assets per share.
Shareholders are being offered one new share at 106p for every two they
hold, although they will be able to apply for excess shares. The issue is
not being underwritten and there will be no trading in nil paid rights.
If the rights are not taken up in full, the trust may attempt to place the
excess shares in the market, or issue unused shares to new PEP investors.
The total number of new shares that will be issued will not exceed 15m.
The net asset value of the trust was 105.95p per share as of April 11,
compared with 103.47p per share fully diluted at the end of March. Net
revenue in the six months to March 31 fell to Pounds 944,000 (Pounds 1.65m)
and earnings per share were 3.15p (5.48p).
The second interim dividend is 1.96875p (1.875p) and at the offer price for
the rights shares, the prospective gross annual dividend yield is 9.9 per
cent.
The Extra Income Trust has, in addition to its ordinary shares, a class of
zero coupon debenture stock which was issued at a discount and is repayable
at par.
The rights offer will, depending on the take-up, reduce the gearing of the
ordinary shares by lowering the growth rate in assets needed to repay the
debenture stock.
The shares were unchanged at 110p.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman plans significant US
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, the Leicester-based machine tool manufacturer, plans a
significant expansion of its US activities through the acquisition of Rhode
Island-based Brown &amp; Sharpe Grinding Machines (BSGM), a joint venture
between J&amp;S and Brown &amp; Sharpe of the US.
J&amp;S has reached agreement in principle to acquire Brown &amp; Sharpe's share of
BSGM, which was set up in 1989 to provide a marketing and servicing facility
for the two companies in North America.
No terms for the deal were disclosed, but the sum is unlikely to be large.
At the end of last month Brown &amp; Sharpe, once the largest US machine tool
maker, announced it was pulling out of the industry to concentrate on its
metrology products.
Mr John Wareing, J&amp;S managing director, said the acquisition would make the
Leicester company solely responsible for sales and service of its machines
in North America.
Additionally, J&amp;S will acquire the rights to Brown &amp; Sharpe's Hi-Tech
creep-feed grinders and Techmaster surface grinders. Production will be
moved from Rhode Island to Leicester.
Creep-feed machines grind the workpiece at a slow pace but with deep cuts,
and are ideal for composite materials and ceramics which would crack under
normal grinding. J&amp;S will now be able to compete with three European
manufacturers of creep-feed grinders, which are heavily used by the
aerospace industry.
Mr Wareing said the deal would add at least Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m to annual
sales. In the 15 months to end-March 1990, the company made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.1m on sales of Pounds 30.9m.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Gearing up in preparation for a change of
culture - Scottish Privatisation / The prospects for Scottish Hydro-Electric
as privatisation nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH nature and the privatisation process have been bountiful to Scottish
Hydro-Electric, and agile management is making the most of that endowment.
The consequence is one of the more attractive companies the government has
ever brought to flotation.
Hydro-Electric is easily the smaller of the two vertically integrated
Scottish electricity companies, generating, transmitting and distributing
power, which are to be floated at the end of May.
It serves the northern two-thirds of Scotland, a quarter of the UK landmass
but with only 600,000 domestic customers. A low 18 per cent of its Pounds
435m turnover comes from industrial users. That might not seem a very
promising basis for a successful electricity company.
Until privatisation loomed Hydro-Electric concealed its promise. As the
junior partner of the much larger Scottish Power, which called the shots in
Scottish electricity, it tended its network of 53 dams and their related
hydro-electric power stations in the Highlands, but also built a large power
station at Peterhead which can be run on either gas or oil.
It saw itself as a utility with a social function, taking power up the glens
and out to the islands, though the bulk of its customers live in Aberdeen
and Dundee. It had an agreeable public image which persists to this day, and
which few other electricity companies in Britain can match.
The run-up to privatisation brought separation from Scottish Power and a
swapping of generating assets. In the new British electricity industry, in
which generators compete and Scotland's ample surplus capacity is now
available to England, Hydro-Electric is well placed.
Consider its advantages: in power generation its 2,800MW of generating
capacity includes 1,000MW of hydro-electric plant, highly dependent on
rainfall but operating at with zero marginal cost. Hydro-Electric has access
to Scottish Nuclear's nuclear plants and a share of Scottish Power's
coal-fired capacity.
Peterhead is being adapted and increased to take relatively cheap untreated
gas from British Petroleum's Miller field in the North Sea from 1992.
Between 50 and 70 per cent of Peterhead's 1,300MW output is committed for
sale to Scottish Power.
This low cost and flexible mix of power sources enables Hydro-Electric to
offer the lowest average domestic tariffs in the UK and competitive tariffs
for commercial and industrial customers.
Since it has relatively few industrial customers taking more than 1MW it
faces little threat from other generators and last year lost only 0.6 per
cent of its industrial customers to rivals.
The retirement of most of the former management enabled Mr Roger Young, the
chief executive who came to Hydro-Electric from the manufacturing company
Low &amp; Bonar, to create an almost entirely new senior management mainly from
the private sector.
With the help of consultants the new team embarked on a big reorganisation,
aimed at switching Hydro-Electric from being a state-owned utility to a
profit-oriented business.
The difficult change of culture, given Hydro-Electric's background, was
helped by the fact that it is a relatively small organisation, employing
only about 3,700 people, a number which has fallen faster than any of the
English regional electricity companies.
Roger Young, an affable but intensely determined manager, perceived from the
start that most of Hydro-Electric's growth would have to come from outside
its own relatively small area, where power consumption is likely to rise by
between 1.5 and 2 per cent a year.
Hydro-Electric was quicker than some companies in adapting to the new power
trading regime in England and Wales when it began a year ago, and also
achieved a coup by signing an options contract with BOC, the industrial
gases group, as well as Wiggins Teape, the paper manufacturer.
Power sales to England have added about 11 per cent to Hydro-Electric's
sales in terms of volume and may be worth an extra Pounds 50m on top of
expected 1990/91 sales to its own region of about Pounds 430m.
But as with Scottish Power, exports from its surplus capacity are limited by
the size of the interconnecting power lines to England, with only 300MW of
capacity available to Hydro-Electric. Although planning permission is being
sought to increase the size of the interconnector, which would give
Hydro-Electric an extra 500MW of export capacity, the company has other
plans to develop south of the border.
Its most promising project is a planned 51 per cent stake in a 700MW
combined cycle gas turbine plant to be built at Keadby near Scunthorpe, in
partnership with Energy Resources, a north of England company.
So far financial backing, gas supply and customers have not been announced
but Hydro-Electric believes the Pounds 300m scheme will go ahead.
The Keadby project has overtaken the Neptune project for a 1,000MW plant on
Teesside, where Hydro-Electric is involved with Northern Electric (BOC
recently pulled out of it). If Keadby goes ahead and the interconnector
expands, Hydro-Electric could in five years time be selling as much power in
England as in Scotland.
It is from England that most growth in Hydro-Electric's profits is likely to
come. Profits growth in Scotland may be sluggish, with Hydro-Electric being
obliged by the regulator to keep its increases in domestic tariffs to just
below the rate of inflation (unlike the English regional electricity
companies), entailing further improvements in efficiency, though production
costs will fall with Miller gas coming onstream from 1992.
The government is expected to float Hydro-Electric with a stiff gearing
ratio of nearly 50 per cent, knowing that it needs no large new generating
plant in Scotland and that it made a respectable Pounds 50m operating profit
in 1989/90.
That gearing may intially fall but is then likely to increase as
Hydro-Electric invests in expanding the interconnector, bears its share of
de-sulphurisation costs at Scottish Power's coal-burning plant and tests its
management skills in building new generating plants in England.

1990.
Although that was down on the Pounds 400,000 forecast at the time of the

businesses which were acquired and started up in the final quarter of 1990
which did not form part of the forecast.
Excluding the two companies, profits before tax for the year to December 31

Prestwick Holdings, the printed circuit board manufacturer, swung into a
deficit of Pounds 741,000 in the six months to January 31.
The outcome, which compared with profits of Pounds 527,000 at the interim
stage last time and Pounds 1.2m for the full year, was struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 345,000 related to reorganisation costs.
Mr Wayne Osman, chief executive, said that the losses were incurred in the
first quarter and that the Scottish-based group had returned to the black in
the second quarter.
Gearing at the year-end was 11 per cent.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 11.89m (Pounds 13.66m). The interim dividend is
maintained at 0.5p from losses of 3.5p per share (earnings of 1.5p).

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fitter Britons cause 9% downturn at Great
Southern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT SOUTHERN Group, the USM-quoted funeral director, suffered a 9 per cent
downturn in pre-tax profits in 1990, reflecting a 14 per cent decline in the
national mortality rate.
The resulting fall in sales of funeral and cremation services left the
taxable outcome at Pounds 3.22m, down from Pounds 3.54m last time. The
setback came in spite of an overall gain in market share.
Turnover increased from Pounds 22.13m to Pounds 25.14m, and operating
profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 4.92m to Pounds 5.18m.
Mr Eric Spencer, deputy chairman and chief executive, said that high
interest rates and the depressed property market were continuing to affect
profit and debt levels.
Borrowings at the year-end stood at some Pounds 12.97m, leaving gearing
almost unchanged at 114 per cent. It was hoped to reduce this to less than
100 per cent by the end of 1991, he said. The interest charge rose from
Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 1.97m.
During the year a number of properties had been sold, realising some Pounds
688,000, although following a rationalisation programme the company still
had premises for disposal with a book value of about Pounds 1.75m.
Mr Spencer added that goodwill arising on past acquisitions totalling Pounds
15.4m had been written off to reserves. If this figure was added back to the
balance sheet, gearing would stand at below 50 per cent, he said.
The bulk of the profits came from the funeral services side, where four
acquisitions had been made in the year. Profits from this activity rose from
Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3.8m.
Crematoria and cemeteries put in Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.01m), while the
contribution from ancillary services fell from Pounds 339,000 to Pounds
288,000.
Chosen Heritage, Great Southern's pre-paid funeral plan, continued to grow,
and total plans sold now total more than 30,000 with a face value of some
Pounds 19m.
A final dividend of 5.5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 8.5p
(8p) and comes from earnings per share of 13.9p (16.9p).

conditions
</HEADLINE>

   By STEVEN WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Copymore, the USM-quoted office equipment supplier, rose
from Pounds 142,000 to Pounds 931,000 during 1990. Sales improved by Pounds
1m to Pounds 29.52m.
Under worsening market conditions, measures to restore profitability
included centralising management and administration, tighter controls on
working capital and the reduction and restructuring of borrowings.
The two small regional dealerships acquired in March 1990 had increased the
company's installed base to 22,000 machines. Both traded profitably but the
writing down of goodwill reduced retained earnings by Pounds 530,000.
Mr Stephen Matthews, chairman, said 'the group remains fundamentally strong
and optimistic', having made an encouraging start to the current year.
An extraordinary loss of Pounds 225,000 represented the discontinuation of
two underperforming business lines.
Earnings per share rose from 0.8p to 4.9p. A proposed final dividend of 1.7p
leaves the total unchanged at 2.5p.
Borrowings at the year-end totalled Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 5.1m).

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: 74% contraction to Pounds 6.8m at Higgs and
Hill - Call for Pounds 24.8m adds to growing list of companies in the sector
opting for rights issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGGS AND Hill yesterday became the latest British construction company to
announce a rights issue. So far this year construction and property groups
have called for more than Pounds 700m in 11 rights issues.
Higgs, which also unveiled a 74 per cent fall in pre-tax profits last year
to Pounds 6.84m, is seeking to raise Pounds 24.8m. It is offering
shareholders two shares at 260p each for every seven already owned.
Higgs' share price fell from 340p to 332p following the announcement.
At the beginning of 1991 the company's shares stood at 264p.
Sir Brian Hill, chairman, said the cash from the rights issue would be used
to invest in commercial property in continental Europe; expand the company's
recently formed UK civil and water engineering business; buy more land for
UK housebuilding; and for seedcorn investment to encourage construction in
eastern Europe.
Higgs said it had just received a letter of intent for a Pounds 50m contract
to redevelop the Hotel Praha in Prague into a five-star Hyatt Regency Hotel.
It was the first private sector order to be won by the company's recently
established Prague office.
Sir Brian said the group was also considering two small acquisitions by its
civil and water division. He added: 'It is better to take advantage of our
share price now and raise money through a rights issue, rather than wait
until we have specific deals to announce and maybe have to raise loans
instead.'
At the end of last year Higgs had net debts of Pounds 18m - equivalent to 20
per cent of shareholders' funds. In addition, it has guaranteed about Pounds
5m of borrowings out of total debts of Pounds 31m in two joint-venture
property companies.
Sir Brian warned that a recovery prompted by lower interest rates would take
time to work through and that trading would remain difficult this year.
Pre-tax profits in 1990 fell from Pounds 26.55m to Pounds 6.84m, the first
decline in a decade. The figures included provisions of Pounds 7.37m against
possible future losses, principally against three of the group's
housebuilding sites acquired in 1987 and 1988 when the housebuilding boom
was its peak.
Turnover rose to Pounds 487.98m (Pounds 419.13m) and earnings worked through
down at 10.2p (52.2p).
The collapse of the UK commercial property market has also led the group to
write down, by Pounds 5.4m, the value of its commercial property investments
against reserves. This the group's joint venture, Shipgates retail centre in
Bolton, previously classed as a trade investment.
The taxable profits would have been even lower if Shipgates had not been
re-classified.
Profits in the first six months of last year were reduced by a Pounds 4.1m
provision against Shipgates.
In the event, commercial property profits, despite solid performances from
France and Spain, fell to Pounds 4.48m (Pounds 12.13m) . Construction
profits also fell, to Pounds 8.28m (Pounds 8.57m). Housebuilding in the UK
saw a decline to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 7.06m).
Higgs is proposing a reduced final dividend of 14p (15.6p) for a maintained
total of 20p. It forecasts a similar pay-out this year on the enlarged share
capital.
COMMENT
A discount of 19 per cent and a yield of 8 per cent on an ex-rights price of
322p should ensure that the issue will be a success. The yield rises to 10
per cent on the issue price of 260p. There are, however, better recovery
stocks around. The group which has the reputation of being one of the UK's
best contractors will on its own admission continue to struggle this year.
Construction margins and orders should continue to dwindle in the face of
the flight by investors from UK commercial property. Higgs and Hill by
comparison is not strong in UK housebuilding which is likely to be one the
first sectors out of the recession. Commercial property may be stronger in
continental Europe but has lost some of its shine as interest rates have
risen. Profits could be about Pounds 8m this year. The company is safe and
secure but is unlikely to prompt a rush to buy at this stage of its
development.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: TT launches Pounds 6.8m hostile bid for
Magnetic Materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the industrial holding company which last year won a five-month
battle for Crystalate, has launched a Pounds 6.8m hostile bid for Magnetic
Materials, the USM-quoted maker of magnetic components.
The 37p per share bid was rejected by Magnetic yesterday as 'derisory,
unsolicited, unwelcome and totally inadequate'.
It was below the market price, which closed down 2p at 41p, and at a
substantial discount to last June's net asset value of 61.8p per share.
More than 40 per cent of Magnetic's shares lie in the hands of Mr Eduard
Michaelis, the non-executive deputy chairman, and his family. Mr Michaelis,
who will be 90 on May 19, was replaced as chairman by Mr George Doust in
January.
The company's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 220,000 (Pounds 704,000) in the
six months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 8.3m). Mr John
Emmanuel, chief executive, said yesterday that things were 'coming right'
and the management was confident about the future.
TT already controls 16.2 per cent of the equity, having bought a 9.4 per
cent stake at 37p on Tuesday, 2p above this year's low point.
Mr Nicholas Shipp, a TT director, described the market price of the shares
as notional because there was so little trade.
He said Magnetic was providing a dismal return on net assets of about Pounds
11m. It had a similar customer base to Crystalate, the maker of electronic
components acquired in a Pounds 34m deal completed last September.
TT, which increased pre-tax profit by 25 per cent to Pounds 10.5m in 1990 on
sales of Pounds 100.3m, had year-end gearing of 40 per cent, which would
rise to 50 per cent if the Magnetic bid went through at the current offer
price.
In November, TT raised Pounds 9.7m in an issue of convertible preference
shares. Its market value at yesterday's closing price of 134p was Pounds
95.2m.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Panel gives Empire more time to issue
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPIRE STORES Group, the mail order company fighting a Pounds 49m takeover
bid from Redoute Catalogue, a French mail order group, has had to delay
publication of its defence document because of a technical omission on the
bidder's side.
The defence document should have been posted yesterday but the Takeover
Panel has given Empire until Monday April 22 to send it out.
Redoute Catalogue, part of the La Redoute retail group which is in turn 54
per cent owned by Au Printemps, had failed to mention an agreement between
Au Printemps and Gecos, an Italian supermarket company with a 24.2 per cent
stake in Empire, covering the two companies' shareholdings in its offer
document published two weeks ago.
The agreement was made in February 1989 and Redoute had thought it had
fallen into disuse. Redoute and Gecos have now agreed that the agreement has
ceased to have effect.
Empire's shares were unchanged yesterday at 126p, 1p above the final 125p
per share cash offer. The chance of a white knight appearing seems slim as
Redoute has 37.8 per cent of Empire's shares and could block a rival bidder
from gaining full control.
Empire's shareholders appear to have a choice between accepting the cash or
keeping the group independent with a large minority holder.

FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: ADT shares rise on Laidlaw peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction group, saw its shares rise
yesterday following a peace agreement late on Tuesday with its main
shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada, that has led to a shake-up of the board.
The shares rose 5p to 89p.
Analysts said investors were encouraged that ADT was now more likely to be
run as a service group focused on its core businesses. The agreement, which
involves Laidlaw dropping allegations of fraud in a New York court, means Mr
Michael Ashcroft, ADT chairman and chief executive, and four other ADT
insiders will be outnumbered on the board by four independent and four
Laidlaw-nominated directors.
'If you believe ADT is now going to be a straight operating company and that
asset shuffling and stake building are to end, the market will give the
company a higher p/e,' said Mr Mark Shepperd, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew.
The market appeared to believe that ADT was less likely to fly off at a
tangent with investments like those in Christies International, the auction
group, and BAA, the former British Airports Authority.
ADT is faced with a Pounds 40m paper loss on its 24 per cent stake in
Christies and still holds a 4 per cent stake in BAA after it sold a similar
stake last December.
The new board might also recommend the sale of some of these non-core
investments, though ADT also holds a 27 per cent stake in the Lep Group
which has a significant US security business in addition to freight
forwarding.
Laidlaw insists it has only withdrawn, not dropped, its case against ADT and
that investigations into the alleged fraud will continue through an audit
committee set up by the new independent directors.
The decision to remove the conflict from the public gaze would help protect
Laidlaw's 28.4 per cent stake in ADT on which it is currently facing a
Dollars 400m paper loss, analysts said.

FT  18 APR 91 / Lloyds Chemists in Pounds 55m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Chemists, the chemist and drugstore group which has expanded rapidly
through acquisition, yesterday announced its biggest deal yet and a Pounds
71.1m rights issue to finance it.
Lloyds is paying Pounds 55m for Kingswood-GK, a chemist chain, and Holland &amp;
Barrett, the health food shops, both owned by Booker, the food distribution
and agribusiness group.
The deal will add 163 chemist shops to give Lloyds a total of 617. Lloyds
has 181 drugstores (which do not sell prescription drugs), and H&amp;B has 191
outlets. Mr Allen Lloyd, Lloyds chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are
very confident this acquisition is earnings enhancing.'
The rights issue will raise Pounds 71.1m net of expenses and is on a 1-for-2
basis at 230p. Lloyds shares rose 3p to 278p yesterday, while Booker's
shares were up 11p to 480p.
Booker will receive Pounds 37.5m in cash from the deal, including the
repayment of intra-group debt. Another Pounds 19.2m will go to Mr Gus
Kiamtia, founder of GK Chemists, and his family, who had kept a 40 per cent
interest in Kingswood-GK.
Mr Jonathan Taylor, Booker chief executive, said the deal would cut Booker's
gearing on a pro forma basis from 112 per cent at the end of 1990 to 85 per
cent, excluding the effect of a Pounds 25m share placing since the year end.
Booker had decided to leave retailing, and is expected to sell L'Herbier de
Provence, a herbal cosmetics chain.
Mr Lloyd said negotiations with Booker began in earnest four weeks ago.
Lloyds is paying Pounds 48m for Kingswood, which has net assets of Pounds
10.3m, and Pounds 7m for H&amp;B with net assets of Pounds 8.3m. Together the
two businesses made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m in 1990.
Mr Lloyd said that Lloyds could cut about Pounds 2m of costs from Kingswood
and Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m at H&amp;B by integrating head office and distribution
systems with Lloyds' before any improvement in sales and margins.
However, there would be redundancy and other costs of about Pounds 500,000
at Kingswood, and Pounds 500,000 would be spent changing Kingswood stores to
Lloyds.
Mr Dick Steele, Lloyds finance director, said Pounds 16.1m remaining from
the rights issue would be used to repay the group's debt - Pounds 18.2m on
April 5. Thereafter a sale and leaseback deal on a new warehouse should
raise Pounds 6.5m-Pounds 7m giving the group net cash by the June year end.

FT  18 APR 91 / GPA warns on profits despite 66% rise in lease revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation (GPA), the world's largest aircraft leasing company,
warned yesterday that it would show a modest growth in profits compared with
the previous year, despite a 66 per cent rise in lease revenues.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's president, said the company's rate of profits growth
had slowed significantly. 'Unless there is a remarkable last quarter, our
profit this year will be relatively modest,' he added.
He also said it was unlikely, although not impossible, that the company
would be floated on the stock market this year. Mr Foley suggested that a
flotation was more probable next year.
Although the company will not release its results for the latest 12 months
until June, it decided to announce its aircraft lease revenue figures for
the year ended March 31, 1991 in an effort to bolster confidence in its
business prospects.
Mr James King, head of the company's aircraft leasing division, conceded
that the past year had been particularly difficult for the airline industry.
The sector is estimated to have lost about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in the
past six months because of the combination of the Gulf crisis, higher fuel
prices and the general economic slowdown.
But he argued that some City forecasts were excessively pessimistic. Mr Tony
Ryan, GPA's chairman, also added: 'There has been an over-reaction to the
short-term factors which have adversely affected many airlines in recent
months. As a result, some commentators' perceptions of the future prospects
of the civil aviation sector have been unduly gloomy.'
Contracted lease revenues rose 66 per cent from Dollars 5bn to Dollars
8.3bn. GPA said it sold or leased 176 aircraft to its airline customers, a
17 per cent increase over the year before. It also sold a further 40
aircraft to investors on whose behalf it continues to manage the related
aircraft leases.
At the end of the latest financial year, the company owned or leased-in 306
aircraft compared to 240 during the previous 12 months. GPA took delivery of
82 new aircraft in the last year, all of which it said had been placed with
customers. The company said only two available aircraft were not leased at
the end of March.
After-tax profits of the Shannon-based group showed a 9 per cent rise to
Dollars 196m for the nine months to December 31 compared to the previous
year.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Michelin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement from Clermont-Ferrand confirms that Michelin
workers are being asked to pay a heavy price for the ill-timed acquisition
of Uniroyal Goodrich. Investors, though, have already had to count the cost.
At last night's close of almost FFr90, the shares are trading at a quarter
of their all-time high before the 1987 crash, while their value has roughly
halved since autumn 1989 when the Dollars 1.5bn purchase of north America's
second largest tyremaker catapulted Michelin to the top of the worldwide
league.
There are, of course, explanations besides Uniroyal for last year's dreadful
figures and the company's own acknowledgement that it will not be back in
the black until 1992. The global tyre business continues to be dogged by
gross overcapacity, and Michelin has had little choice but to drive prices
lower in a grim battle for market share. The sharp decline in the US dollar,
moreover, certainly did not help.
Having said that, though, the cost of financing the Uniroyal deal is, to a
very large extent, responsible for the dire state of the balance sheet.
Gearing is already 280 per cent if the FFr5.5bn of subordinated loans is
treated as debt, and is likely to go well beyond 300 per cent before the
year is out. Interest charges of around FFr3.1bn compare with operating
profits of just FFr1.9bn. The burden is enormous even with a promised 12 per
cent cut in employee numbers, a substantial reduction in capital expenditure
and a fairer wind from the market place.
However urgent the need for new capital, it is hard to see how balance sheet
pressures can be quickly relieved. Existing shareholders would be badly
diluted by a rights issue and any would-be industrial partner is certain to
be put off by the company's cumbersome, consciously bid-proof ownership
structure. So much can yet go wrong that only real risk-takers should ride
this one for the recovery.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's UK public sector borrowing requirement figures for March are a
little worrying given that the recession looks likely to haunt the Treasury
for some time yet. But bearing in mind that the Pounds 8bn deficit projected
on Budget day looked out of date even then, the implications for government
funding should not be exaggerated. With the British Telecom stake flotation
up its sleeve, the government has plenty of room for manoeuvre. Its biggest
concern might be the pressure placed on institutional liquidity by the
competing demands of gilts, rights issues and give-away privatisation
shares.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Chemists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not the average company that can announce a one-for-two rights issue
and see its share price rise. Lloyds Chemists' success is all the more
remarkable because its story is really rather dull.
There may be plenty of mileage left in the strategy of buying up independent
chemists, sticking on a new shop-front and pushing own-label products from
an efficient distribution system. There is even a clear pool of desirable
acquisitions in what remains a fragmented sector. But it is hard to get too
excited about the long-term potential of the business as it stands, even if
EPOS is successfully installed. As Boots has discovered, diversification
when it comes can be painful.
The acquisition of the Kingswood chain from Booker is a typical Lloyds deal,
though the addition of the troubled Holland &amp; Barrett chain of health food
stores at a cost below net book value was unexpected. No doubt Booker
insisted on the package. Certainly the commercial logic is elusive unless
Lloyds wanted to begin its own diversification. Cost-cutting will probably
start with directors' salaries, but H&amp;B will be marginal to the group's
success. It might make Pounds 4m next year; the group could make Pounds 40m.
Lloyds' shares have outperformed the market by nearly 70 per cent over three
years. But at 278p, they remain on a cheap rating given the underlying
profits growth and promised 50 per cent dividend increase. One is
nevertheless left with the nagging question of why shareholders should stump
up more than the cost of the acquisitions simply to clear the balance sheet
of debt. Whatever happened to cash generation?

FT  18 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Mr Maxwell's second coming
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,545.0 (+25.5)
The Mirror Group flotation gives the investing public its second chance in a
decade to become minority shareholders in a Maxwell-controlled company. Past
experience might suggest that no investor in his sober senses would bother.
But Mirror Group differs from Maxwell Communication in some important
respects. It has less debt, even if its gearing net of intangibles will be
around 150 per cent. It is much more transparent, since its circulation and
advertising revenues can be readily calculated. And if only for that reason,
it is perhaps less likely to be the chosen vehicle for Maxwellian escapades.
Nevertheless, the presence of Mr Maxwell as chairman and controlling
shareholder remains the most important consideration in pricing the stock.
Shareholders must brace themselves for unpredictable changes in strategic
direction, adventurous accounting policies and no more disclosure than is
good for them. This might suggest that the shares should be priced on a
yield basis with reference to MCC. But that is tricky, since the
extraordinary and opportune recovery in MCC shares shown in the chart has
taken their yield from 15 per cent to 8.5 per cent in a couple of months.
The initial target of the flotation appears to be a multiple of somewhere
around 10, giving a total market value of Pounds 500m. On the basis of a
twice-covered dividend, that would give a yield of 6.7 per cent. Even under
more conventional management that might not seem unduly generous, given that
the newspapers now operate at full efficiency in a relatively mature market.
On the other hand, the fact that the massive Pounds 500m capital expenditure
programme is virtually complete has obvious benefits for future cash flow.
But however the issue is priced, it is unlikely to be one for the stags. The
essence of stagging is to intercept shares on their way to the institutions;
and there will be some UK institutions, at any rate, who would be reluctant
to go for this one at any price.

Sir, Dominic Hobson objects (April 16) to the inclusion of the poll tax in
the RPI by saying it is not a price and therefore has no place in a retail
prices index.
The real issue is not the name of the index but its purpose.
We believe that the purpose is to measure changes in costs to the consumer,
and as such, tax burdens which are not a function of earnings should be
included.
Our own Consumers Price Index has always included these taxes since its
inception in 1972.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A. SCOTNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have no doubt that many of your chemically trained readers
experienced the same delicious frisson as I when they read Clive Cookson's
item 'Nitrous Acid gets last laugh' (April 10).
Suffice it to say that intractable confusion between nitrous oxide (laughing
gas) and nitrous acid (an entirely distinct compound known only in an
aqueous solution) rendered the entire article largely meaningless.
Nitrous and nitric acids are present as pollutants in atmospheric water
droplets largely as a result of emissions of two other oxides of nitrogen
(nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) from petrol combustion and other
chemical processes.
However, I was particularly entertained by the prospect of dentists using
nitrous acid in high concentration as an anaesthetic.
It would be unlikely to induce the last (or any other) laugh, but I can
confidently predict the last gasp, the last rites and the last will and
testament in that order.

FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Blind spot on the Dark Ages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CLERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Richardson, a tenant himself, appears to have a blind spot
('Tenant farmers fear return to Dark Ages', April 16). There is currently a
massive subsidy in value terms from landlord to tenant. This is beyond doubt
as the price of agricultural land subject to agricultural tenancy is
generally half the value of the same land with vacant possession.
The minister of agriculture is proposing freedom of contract (on new
tenancies only). For would-be tenants to claim some further rights over a
landowner's freehold property is impertinent and illogical.
If the minister's proposals go through, it is likely that there will be
considerable opportunities for new lettings on a freely agreed basis. One
might even arrive at the position, as is the case in commercial lettings,
where a farm let to a good tenant is worth as much as it would be if in
hand.
This point appears to have been missed by Mr Richardson and the tenant
farming lobby which seeks a degree of influence over landowners' property
completely unjustified by the circumstances.

Sir, In the Brussels discussions about the future of political and monetary
union, one important item has been left out: the future and effectiveness of
the European Commission.
The Commission seems to have few friends in high political places. It is
therefore worth bearing in mind how vital an effective Commission is to the
Community's well-being.
The Commission is the only European institution which represents the
interests of the Community as such, rather than those of the nation states.
There are times when all states benefit from the assertion of this wider
perspective.
The Commission has played a crucial role in the remarkable progress we have
made towards a single market. Further, we would not be as close as we are to
agreement about monetary union if it had not been for the Delors Report and
the efforts of M Delors himself.
Whatever the nature of the new constitution which emerges from the
inter-governmental conferences, the role of the Commission is likely to be
more important than ever. There will be more majority voting in the Council,
which enhances the Commission's role; there will be new fields in which the
Commission will acquire the right to make proposals, a right which has been
in part the basis of its influence.
But if the Commission is to perform these enhanced duties effectively, it
must function better than it does now. The number of commissioners is too
large.
I am told that on important issues a preliminary tour de table takes
two-and-a-half hours. And there are doubts about the cohesion of the
Commission as a body.
In 1979 the Spierenburg Committee (of which I was the British member) was
set up to review the working of the Commission. Two of its central
recommendations were to reduce the number of commissioners and to split the
duties of the presidency.
We recommended that there should only be one commissioner per member state.
There are now 17, two for each of the larger states. If and when Austria,
probably Sweden, and possibly others join, the college will become
unmanageable.
We also recommended that, to relieve the burden on the presidency, there
should be a deputy president. The president would be concerned with strategy
and represent the Commission on important matters inside and outside the
Community; the deputy president would be responsible for organising and
co-ordinating the Commission's internal work.
These recommendations are as relevant as ever. They should be revived as an
important practical contribution to the future of the Community.

FT  18 APR 91 / A fresh chapter in print: The background to the flotation of
Mirror Group Newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Robert Maxwell, the international media baron, the flotation of his
UK tabloid Mirror Group Newspapers, announced yesterday, is something of a
hat-trick. Mr Maxwell's empire has been built on three pillars: the Pergamon
publishing company, Maxwell Communication (MCC) and the Mirror group. Last
month he sold Pergamon to the Dutch group Elsevier; in three months he
resigns from the MCC board; and now the Mirror group is going public.
Whatever the 67-year-old Mr Maxwell has in mind with all this, it is
certainly not retirement. Though he is leaving the board of the
publicly-quoted MCC, he remains the controlling shareholder and is
installing his son Kevin in his place. Another son, Ian, will be his deputy
at Mirror group.
Asked yesterday why he intended to retain a majority holding of Mirror group
after flotation, Mr Maxwell termed that a silly question. 'I will not,' he
said, 'so long as I am alive, be in a public company in which I or my family
have less than 51 per cent. I learned my lesson from Pergamon' (of which he
briefly lost control in the late 1960s).
In which case, it might fairly be asked why Mr Maxwell wants to return to
the public arena at all. The answer may never be known in detail: for such a
high-profile figure, Mr Maxwell has a remarkable talent for secrecy. Part of
the answer, though, can be summed up in one word: debt.
It is impossible to be precise here, since Mr Maxwell's public and private
finances are inextricably entwined and his private affairs, as he will
forcefully tell the enquirer, are his own business. But at the root of it
lies MCC's Pounds 1.5bn acquisition of the US publisher Macmillan in 1988.
Like his rival Mr Rupert Murdoch, Mr Maxwell was swept up in the rush for
media assets in the late 1980s. Like Mr Murdoch, he borrowed hugely to pay
for them. And like Mr Murdoch, he nearly came to grief as a result.
Late last year, MCC had to come up with Pounds 210m of short-term debt
repayment. Most of the money was produced by the simple expedient of selling
assets from Mr Maxwell's public pocket - MCC - into his private one, Mirror
group.
This left Mirror group heavily borrowed. Indeed, the balance sheet as it now
stands shows almost no tangible net worth at all. Of the proceeds of the
forthcoming flotation, Pounds 210m is to be devoted to debt repayment. The
investing public, in other words, is being asked to help pay for Macmillan
at one remove.
It cannot be denied, though, that Mr Maxwell's peculiar financial
arrangements have given him a certain flexibility. Mr Murdoch came up
against the same crisis of debt repayment at around the same time last year
and had to throw himself on the mercy of his bankers. As Mr Maxwell
pointedly remarked yesterday, 'you will notice that Mr Maxwell has not been
having any meetings with his bankers. My next meeting will be in October
1992'.
On the assumption that the flotation and the Pounds 440m sale of Pergamon
finally put Mr Maxwell's finances back on an even keel, it is a good time to
take stock of his empire. The best place to start is the Pergamon publishing
business, which formed the empire's foundation.
There can be no question that Pergamon represents a significant achievement.
It was founded on the perception - simple with hindsight, like all the best
ideas - that academic and scientific journals represent an ideal commercial
marriage between contributors who write for free and subscribers who pay in
advance. Elsevier, which has just bought Pergamon, is one of the shrewder
European publishing houses. Its price of Pounds 440m therefore represents
the best evidence of Mr Maxwell's ability to create value from scratch.
The history of MCC is perhaps a little more chequered. Its roots lie in the
old British Printing Corporation, which Mr Maxwell took on when it was on
the point of collapse in 1981. Mr Maxwell is wont to claim as his proudest
achievement the rescue of the UK printing industry. There is a degree of
exaggeration here - for example, he relied partly on plans laid down by
others - but his energies were vital to the project's success.
But almost all of this was jettisoned in 1988 to raise cash for the
acquisition of Macmillan and Official Airline Guides in the US. This was
neither a rescue nor building from scratch, but an exercise - characteristic
of the late 1980s, though on the whole uncharacteristic of Mr Maxwell - in
gaining control of businesses built up by others and using other people's
money to do it.
The result of this has been mixed, in stock market terms particularly. Those
who had bought shares in the near-bankrupt BPC at the time of the rescue
would have profited handsomely. But since the mid-1980s, the share price
performance of the renamed MCC has been fairly catastrophic.
In the past few weeks, ahead of the Mirror flotation, they have produced a
remarkable and slightly mysterious recovery. Even so, they have lost half
their value relative to the UK market since their peak in 1984.
That leaves the Mirror itself, whose recovery under Mr Maxwell is detailed
below. Here again, as with BPC, Mr Maxwell's achievement is undeniable.
Judging by the prospectus, the business is running at a fair pitch of
efficiency; though for investors, of course, this raises the obvious
question of how much scope there still is for rapid growth in profits.
At present, Mr Maxwell is engaged in his latest high-profile rescue, that of
the New York Daily News. Very probably, he will succeed at that as well.
Given the history of achievement, the question naturally arises of why he
remains such a distrusted figure in British commercial life, so remote from
the establishment centre.
The answer given by Mr Maxwell himself at yesterday's press conference -
that the British hate success - does not bear inspection.
The real reason probably has more to do with Mr Maxwell's highly complex
personality: the secrecy, the deviousness and the refusal to conform to
expected behaviour. His sons appear much more conventional figures, so
perhaps the Maxwell empire will form part of the establishment in the long
run. British commercial life will be the duller for it.

By the age of 13 most of us had forgotten those joke questions like 'Please
sir, do you mean the natives were revolting?' But they were all remembered
by Talbot Rothwell who went on to write the scripts for most of the Carry On
films. If you are one of those rare people who have never seen one, you can
judge the general standard by watching Carry On Up The Khyber (6.00 BBC2),
remembering that this is among the better ones.
Sadly it looks as though television's tendency to turn moderately personable
presenters into hysterical show-offs is beginning to affect Keith Floyd. He
used to be a natural enthusiast, but in his new series about cookery in
Australia, Floyd On Oz (8.00 BBC2), he looks as though he has overdosed on
uppers.
Revelations about Chernobyl have been occurring virtually since the
explosion. The latest come from This Week (8.30 ITV) on how radioactive
debris was removed. Channel 4 repeats the 'controversial' documentary about
the killing of unarmed IRA terrorists in Gibraltar, Death On The Rock
(9.30).

FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Matador - Queen's Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mortal combat of man and bull has a seedy sexiness that draws bellows of
indignation from animal liberationists, a straggling, overwhelmingly female,
row of whom lined the pavement outside the Queen's Theatre. This detail is
not lost on Peter Jukes, the young English writer brought in to furnish a
book for Michael Leander and Edward Seago's musical of the corrida. Jukes
lingers conscientiously on the objections of the two principal women in the
bullfighter's life: his homely Andalucian sister (Caroline O'Connor) and his
glamorous American lover (the top-billed Stephanie Powers) who together
carry the doubts of the moral majority.
But the sexiness remains - a rank, male quality inextricably linked to the
will to make something of hum-drum lives. Domingo, who is based on the
legendary bull-fighter El Cordobes, is a boy from nowhere on a hiding to
nothing until he catches the opportunistic eye of a fixer called El Panama,
at which point he becomes The boy from Nowhere.
The storyline - of a fighter's pride and fall - is entirely predictable, and
played out in flashback. As two of the characters are permitted to remark,
people love a rags to riches story but they love a tragedy even more. Though
the Spanish Civil War hovers in memories, and Franco himself makes a brief
appearance, it is a politically and thematically unsophisticated piece,
distinguished by a really rather sophisticated attempt to stylise its
subject through an equation of bullfighting with flamenco.
The bull is a stunningly animated conglomerate of six dancers, black and
glittering, whose menace comes not from any thunderous momentum but from an
evocation of the moments before the charge, when time is suspended between
stamping hooves and lowered horns. Fransisco Perez Arevalo brings the
ineffable style of the real flamenco dancer to bear on the head of the
beast, somewhat overshadowing its nether regions and underlining the old saw
that true flamenco dancers are born and not made. Elsewhere, the rhythmic
intensity and formal elegance of the dance is cleverly gestured at in Elijah
Moshinsky's refreshingly people-centred production, which is designed with
an exquisite restraint by William Dudley.
It has its share of long, lean limbs - two of the longest and leanest of
which belong to John Barrowman's Domingo. Although he looks every inch the
part, Barrowman succumbs to the synthetic song-and-dance texture that
emerges from the fragmentation of the scenes and from lyrics (Seago) which
tend to hamstring Leander's score with a banal sentimentality. Nicky
Henson's tubby impresario El Panama gets - and makes - the best of them with
with the roguish 'I'll take you out to dinner,' while the key numbers, 'No
Way out of this Town' and 'Children of the Sun', accumulate a certain
anthemic impetus through repetition.
As if to underline that that this is a man's world the women do rather badly
out of it. Domingo's childhood sweetheart (Jackie Dunn) is peremptorily
matched and dispatched, while Stephanie Powers seems under-employed as the
American movie actress.

FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Falstaff - Theatre Royal, Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falstaff is one of the supreme comedies about the relations between men and
women - about the capacity for self-delusion of the former (at almost all
ages) and the clear-eyed wisdom and grace of the latter. Ian Judge's
dreadful new Verdi production for Scottish Opera (shared with Bremen, where
it was first shown) is about costume and setting, and the schoolboyish japes
that can be had with ringing the changes on both.
Mr Judge is a producer who always puts on an ingenious, fast-moving show;
sometimes, though, his Bright Ideas for updating are insufficiently followed
through (remember the ENO Cav-Pag set in the Lawrentian coalfields?), and
then the feats of ingenuity become strained and tiresome in the extreme.
This super-English 1920s Falstaff, designed by Mark Thompson, is set in a
Thames Valley hotel, and dressed in tweeds, tartans, plus-fours and other
Mapp-and-Lucia finery (gosh how we roared at Falstaff's yellow top hat and
cape]), with the odd ruff and full-petticoated Elizabethan gown thrown in to
provide an element of fashionable time-travelling.
Maids scurry about with hotel linen, waiters with glasses of sherry; Robin
the page is a fat, bespectacled Bunter. The weakness of all this, and much
much else, is not intrinsic (after all, David Pountney's semi-updated ENO
Falstaff is tough, peculiar, and full of interest). What appears to be the
problem is that the producer's ambitions confined themselves to having jolly
larks with equivalent-finding. The result is that almost all of opera - its
enchanted knots of conspiracy, its blissful moments of concord, its brief
outpourings of pain and anger, even violence - plays like a particularly
disheartening brand of whoops-a-daisy farce.
The staging trades shamelessly on our recollections of a certain kind of
English television comedy. There is no threat of real sexuality in Gordon
Sandison's Falstaff, a white-haired old party clearly more interested in his
grub than anything else - he goes to the midnight revels with Thermos and
tuckbox in hand. The Ford monologue, perhaps the nearest the opera comes to
tragedy, is enacted in terms of slapstick, of bumping into tables and
knocking over chairs (and vocally Steven Page is ill-cast, tight-throated
and dry-toned). The final scene is a sort of decorous fancy-dress party on
the patio, and at the end of the fugue everyone dons a red nose: so much for
Verdi's pessimistic wit and wisdom.
The superficiality of the production is breathtaking, overwhelming: as an
immature response to an adult comedy I'm hard pressed to recall its equal.
It doesn't help that on Tuesday John Mauceri's conducting lumbered along so
much of the way. Mr Mauceri can be a vital, stylish Verdian; here he seems
to be aiming more at conducting a semi-animated Falstaff lecture than a
theatrical event. His tempos are moderate (fine), his rhythms lifeless; the
readiness to broaden the phrases with allargando and rubato (also fine in
principle) pays no heed to the in some cases limited vocal capacities of the
singers on stage - and, since on this occasion so much untidy ensemble was
in evidence, the overall effect was of undersinging and uneasy plod.
There are good elements in the cast, here wasted. One would be particularly
glad to encounter Sarah Walker (Quickly), Fiona Kimm (Meg), Anthony Mee (Dr
Caius), and David Gwynne (Bardolph) in another small-house Falstaff; Maria
Prosperi, a young Italian Alice with a plump, smiling charm and a voice of
lustre and sparkle, is a real find. The young lovers, Susannah Waters and
John Mark Ainsley (who shows that a really good Mozart tenor will always do
well by Fenton's music), are 'English' in the best way - they are, indeed,
the show's saving grace.
Mr Sandison, an able character baritone, seems on this showing right out of
his league in Verdi. But one says 'seems': when one of the great roles of
opera has been presented in such a trivialised reduction, who can tell for
sure?

FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Tippett's Byzantium - Carnegie Hall, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Georg Solti ends his 22 seasons as conductor of Chicago Symphony with a
concert Otello (Pavarotti singing the title role for the first time) and
with the premiere of Michael Tippett's Byzantium, commissioned jointly by
Carnegie Hall and the Chicago orchestra to mark their centenaries. After
Chicago performances, both bills have come to New York (where both will be
recorded), for two performances each. Byzantium had its Carnegie premiere on
Monday.
Yeats's poem, five stanzas of chiselled, charged imagery, is generally read
as a parable of artistic creation; in a preface to the score, Tippett writes
of 'artefacts enshrining values that can be set against the impermanence of
the everyday world and the complexities of the human beating heart.' Other
readings in other lights are possible; in one of them, Nietzsche seems
uncomfortably close. Familiar Yeats images reappear: the Emperor; the Tower;
the bird from Sailing to Byzantium, 'of hammered gold and gold enamelling,'
singing now a more terrible song; the purging fire, 'flames begotten of
flame'; finally 'that dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea'.
Tippett's piece, which lasted 27 minutes, is not so much a 'setting' of the
poem as a tone-poem, for soprano and large orchestra, based upon it. The
score follows the five-stanza structure, dividing them with instrumental
passages. Words, lines, isolated syllables are freely repeated; the bird
'planted on the star-lit golden bough,' which 'can like the cocks of Hades
crow,' breaks into a page of unaccompanied 'cocorico]' Tippett writes of the
'challenge in setting the verbal imagery to music' but also finds licence in
Yeats's lines 'Those images that yet/Fresh images beget' to let his own
musical imagination fly free and create abundantly.
As in the poem, familiar images reappear: deep, complicated, pregnant chords
recurring as punctuation; little tonal fanfares bright against alien
harmony; episodes of linear scurry and flurry; near-reckless cantilena. I'd
like to say that they are used with a precision, economy, and discipline to
match the poet's. After one performance, I feel unsure. The piece sounded
different from what the printed score had led me to expect: more constantly
loud, insistent, and busy, without the episodes of gentleness suggested by
pages of two-part invention, or merriment in episodes marked 'light,
dancing'. Well, the performance may have had much to do with that. Sir Georg
was an eager, insistent conductor - unrelaxed, never playful - and the
Chicago Symphony is a tense, high-powered precision instrument.
The vocal writing calls for a Flagstad - a soprano who combines amplitude
and majesty with the bright swiftness that Flagstad brought to Grieg's
Haugtussa cycle. It was composed for Jessye Norman's voice and lies mostly
on the staff, with A-flat or A as the high-climax notes, just two passing
B-flats, and eloquent recourse to the lower register that is Miss Norman's
special glory. But ('for personal reasons', the announcement said) Miss
Norman withdrew, and Faye Robinson - who is billed for the Prom premiere of
Byzantium, in September - took over. She is a conscientious and attentive
interpreter, and a 'creator' in The Mask of Time. She is not yet 50. But her
soprano is an imperfect instrument - not full, ample and shining in its
flow, but weak in the lower reaches, and under stress pushed, unsolid and
impure. And in Carnegie scarcely a word that she sang could be caught.
So this can be only a guarded, not a 'rave', review. But that Tippett's
invention is still afire, that the poem has stirred him to create 'images of
abounding, generous, beauty', is not in doubt. And that, of course, is
enough, and more than enough. Later performances, more refined and various,
less unrelentingly emphatic, will reveal whether Byzantium is, as I think it
may be, more than confirmation and consolidation of its composer's unfailing
creativity: a late masterpiece that, like Schutz's and Verdi's late
masterpieces, breaks new ground.

FT  18 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): 'An entire
organisation focused on the market' - Independent Insurance / The winner of
a CIM award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, Allstate Insurance, the US group, sold its general insurance
business in the UK for Pounds 6m to a group of investors called New Scotland
Insurance.
Allstate's business in the UK had never got off the ground. It had been
making losses since 1982 and required regular capital injections amounting
to more than Pounds 21m to maintain solvency margins. In 1986 it made a
Pounds 1.6m loss on premium income of Pounds 27m.
This week, the business, renamed Independent Insurance, reported 1990
profits of Pounds 8.5m on premium income of Pounds 80.1m, its fourth
successive year of increased profit amid a generally grim industry
performance.
The company's transformation has been achieved - according to the Chartered
Institute of Marketing when it was presented yesterday with a 1991 national
marketing award* - because of its 'ability to focus its entire organisation
towards the marketplace'.
When Michael Bright, deputy chairman and managing director of Independent,
arrived from Lombard Continental in 1987 to establish a senior management
team, he found confusion among staff about corporate objectives. There was
no marketing department and only a limited product range; no formal staff
appraisal, training or development programmes. Staff morale was low and
turnover high.
Bright immediately brought in Robert McCracken, a Lombard colleague and
marketing professional, to establish a marketing department. A detailed
corporate plan was set out - backed with research carried out by the
marketing department as well as outside agencies.
The prime objective was to establish the company within five years as a
distinctive and professional organisation in the highly competitive general
insurance sector: 'A long-term player with a consistent approach and
something special to offer,' says Bright.
Two ways of gaining competitive advantage were identified. Research
confirmed that the overall service provided to brokers - the intermediaries
through which Independent intended to channel its business - was generally
poor. So high quality service was to be an essential part of the strategy.
Cost advantages were to be achieved by improving underwriting practice to
reduce the ratio of claims to policies; and by cutting administrative
expenses through extensive and efficient automation.
With the company's objectives and strategy laid down, the first priority was
to communicate them to its staff. Morale had to be rebuilt, motivation
renewed, and the business focus switched to the market.
Initial presentations to all staff, backed up with a booklet, set out the
changes being made and where the company was going. They were given detailed
information on the company's structure, underwriting philosophy, marketing
approach and personnel policies.
Regular briefings by management and the establishment of a staff magazine
followed. Employees were invited to join in a competition to find a new name
for the company. Independent Insurance was launched, with the logo of a
high-flying kite.
A formal personnel policy was adopted. Recruitment procedures were
tightened. The emphasis of pay policy was switched to rewards for results. A
staff appraisal system was introduced, mainly to identify training
requirements. A training department was set up and formal courses begun in
management development, supervisory skills, communication, and customer
care.
Alongside these internal efforts to give the company a new sense of purpose
and direction, work also began on implementing the external marketing
strategy.
Independent had inherited a panel of almost 10,000 agents. It rapidly became
clear that this was a costly and inefficient set-up. Many agents produced
little business and dismal levels of profitability.
'The company looked to deal only with those that were highly professional,
whose business ideas were similar to our own, and who had good relations
with their own clients,' says Kevin Pallett, marketing manager.
Unprofitable accounts were closed immediately. Further weeding has now
reduced the agency base to 3,200 - classified according to the type and
quality of the business they handle, and their potential growth.
Independent sought to establish closer relationships with about 150 brokers
within this total. They were identified as having the best potential for
profitable development of commercial business.
'These brokers are the most professional in the way they present risks to
us,' says Pallett. 'Fire risks are obviously great in plastics
manufacturing, for instance. But the risks are much lower in a company whose
management has adopted a proper safety policy. These brokers provide us with
that sort of information.'
Independent Club was formed to provide the brokers with a range of benefits
and incentives in return. They are given a higher commission and participate
in profit-sharing schemes. They are given round-the-clock access to
Independent's staff; their mail and computer records are coded to identify
them as priority customers. In some of Independent's regional offices,
special units were established dealing exclusively with club brokers.
Independent offers free training for brokers' staff on its courses; and its
marketing department supports them in direct mail campaigns, advertising,
exhibitions and the production of sales brochures.
Assured of the brokers' expertise, Independent was able to launch new
products exclusively through them - policies to cover high risk businesses
such as jewellers and demolition contractors.
Independent claims brokers had never before been offered such a
comprehensive package. Since its launch, the club partnership has been
reinforced through a regular newsletter, weekend entertainments, and senior
management get-togethers.
The marketing initiative has paid off. Premiums from club brokers increased
from Pounds 2m in 1988 to Pounds 11.2m in 1989. Two-thirds of all new
commercial business, and a quarter of all premium income, now comes from
club members; and it results in relatively fewer claims. The claims ratio on
club business is 37.8 per cent against a company average of 47.9 per cent.
The success of this initiative led Independent to launch another scheme,
Merit, for the best of its brokers dealing with home and motor insurance.
Some 500 initially joined. They were offered exclusive products - such as
policies targeted on low-risk and high-risk drivers  - and given greater
authority to quote premiums and speed the settlement of claims.
Backed by Independent's general marketing support, these brokers found
themselves better equipped to face the intense competition in their sector.
Independent was repaid with a doubling of new business proposals between
1989 and 1990; and with an increase in retained business from 70 per cent to
80 per cent.
Costs also fell as more business came from the more professional brokers. In
1988, almost half of proposal forms had to be returned to brokers because of
inadequate information. The proportion has now fallen to 25 per cent.
Independent has backed the marketing thrust through the brokers with a wide
range of other promotional activity. It has designed simpler proposal forms,
and introduced its products through wittily-illustrated brochures. Its
salesforce has been increased fourfold and is supported by telemarketing.
Advertising and public relations are focused on raising the company's image
within the industry. Sponsorship - of school sports and other activities in
its Cheshire base - is used almost solely as an aid to recruitment.
Independent's overall approach had resulted in 'an impressive study of
profitable growth and customer satisfaction,' Sir Patrick Meaney, president
of the CIM, concluded yesterday.

<TEXT>
This morning some 1,000 travel agents from all over the world will fly into
London on what is described, by British Airways which is organising the
trip, as the 'World's Biggest Educational' - travel trade jargon for
encouraging agents to book clients on British holidays.
The move will hardly attract the same sort of publicity as BA achieved for
its 50,000 free flights promotion which takes off on St George's Day next
Tuesday.
But in BA terms it is just as important. While the free flights offer has
generated an unprecedented degree of consumer awareness in a promotion -
some 5m people applied for tickets worldwide - BA is anxious to ensure that
it builds on its marketing coup.
'It's only the start of a sustained promotion this summer to bring back the
business,' says Liam Strong, BA's director of marketing and operations and
no stranger to the world of razzmatazz consumer promotions.
BA's marketing response was not a knee-jerk reaction to the current intense
competition and the dramatic slump in airline travel when the Gulf War broke
out. The groundwork was laid a year ago when BA first felt the chill of the
US and UK recessions. It reviewed its operations extensively (some 50,000
man-hours were spent on this, according to Strong) and came up with a more
integrated structure (bringing marketing and operations together) as well as
over 700 cost-saving proposals. 'We wouldn't have been able to put together
our current marketing programme without having reduced our cost base,'
insists Strong.
Although Strong's marketing plans were aimed at meeting transatlantic
competition head-on in the face of recession, BA, like everyone else, was
still caught out by the onset of the Gulf crisis last summer. 'We realised
that we had to do something to revive international travel when the world
got back to normal,' he recalls.
A planning team, consisting of nine senior executives from all parts of the
airline, was set up last autumn to plan for the post-war world. The group
met intensively while also doing their normal jobs: 'It was exhausting but
also very stimulating to brainstorm ideas,' says one of the team.
Insiders remain tight-lipped about who actually came up with the grand
scheme of giving away all the airline's seats for one day. 'It was a team
effort,' insists Charles Gurassa, BA's head of leisure, and one of the
group.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, was told in a car on the way to
Gatwick airport: 'He didn't bat an eyelid,' says Strong.
The very boldness of the move was its great appeal. 'I think there is a
problem in large companies that too often they are afraid of being bold,'
suggests Strong. 'One of the factors about marketing in the late 20th
century is that most companies are quite sophisticated in their marketing
techniques; so there is a real need to come up with something that makes you
stand out from the rest of the pack.'
BA brought in - in conditions of great secrecy - specialist help to
implement the programme; Saatchi and Saatchi did the advertising and a
couple of promotional companies were also retained.
Planning was based around an assumption that the war would last longer than
it actually did; the give-away flights were due to be offered in late May or
early June. The end of hostilities meant the whole programme was advanced a
couple of months.
The impact of the promotion surprised even BA. 'I think it came at the right
psychological time for people after the gloom in the early part of the
year,' suggests Strong. The cost of the promotion was about Pounds 16m -
including the Pounds 11m cost of flying its fleet free for two days (there
and back). Strong declines to say how big a chunk out of his marketing
budget this will take, but insists it has been very cost-effective: 'At a
highly conservative estimate, we've had more than Pounds 30m worth of media
publicity worldwide.'
Today's arrival of key travel agents from Europe, North America, and the Far
East, however, is just the first of a series of initiatives BA is taking.
These include:
A Keys to Britain promotion overseas to encourage holidays to be taken in
Britain. A charge card for travel and entertainments expenses which helps
companies keep track of these costs launched earlier this week jointly with
Diners Club.
Special offers to popular destinations if holidays are booked before 10 am
through a travel agent.
A frequent flyer programme for regular travellers - called Lattitudes -
which uses BA's existing Air Miles operation to enable travellers to
accumulate points for a free flight.
Strong and his colleagues have a number of other ideas for keeping interest
alive during the summer months which he is keeping under wraps at present.
But trade speculation suggests they are likely to include special offers
this summer for the 5m people who applied for the free flights.
'Although initially there was euphoria after the war ended, we know it's
going to be a tough summer for the travel business,' admits Strong. 'The war
only brought to a head the problems caused by the recession in the US and UK
and a slow-down in the Japanese market.'
Moreover, after many years when BA has faced little effective competition on
the lucrative North American routes, it now has to compete against American
Airlines and United, two of the US's strongest carriers.
The real test will come over the next few months. But Strong is confident
enough to believe at this stage that no similar initiative will be needed in
the autumn of this year. But he already has teams working on marketing plans
for late 1992 when the competition across the North Atlantic will be in its
second year and even more intense. 'We can't afford to rest on our laurels,'
he insists.

FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Barley chews the fat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most people do not eat barley - they drink it in beer or whiskey. But David
and Victor Lewis, who run an independent research and development operation
for food products and processes called Byron Agricultural, of Sydney, intend
to change that.
Waxy barley - so called because it has opaque waxy-looking grains - may be
just what the fibre-conscious, cholesterol-cutting public wants. The barley
contains high levels of beta-glucan, a soluble fibre which has been shown to
help reduce cholesterol levels.
David Lewis has developed a process for making expanded products (like
puffed wheat and rice) from waxy cereals. Rex Oram, a plant breeder at
Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
(CSIRO), provided Lewis with waxy barley to try out his process. One type
worked well and they named it Waxiro.
Kellogg Australia entered into a deal with CSIRO and Lewis to use the grain
in its cereal products. 'The key thing is that Waxiro is high in soluble
fibre, as high as oat bran,' says Geoff Houldsworth, Kellogg's product R&amp;D
manager. 'But this is a whole grain. It is much nicer to eat a whole grain
than bran.'
Kellogg made a barley oat bran-flake known as Balance, although the
marketing still focuses on the oat content. The flake product is relatively
easy to make because the whole grain and bran bind together easily. Waxiro
also has a relatively low fat content - 1 per cent compared with 9 per cent
for oats, and is cheaper than oat bran.
An interesting aspect of the technology is the use of enzymes. 'We've found
we can get unique effects on crispness and texture of grains by using
enzymes at very low moisture content,' says David Lewis.
The method is a straight-line process, not a batch process, and uses similar
enzymes to those which convert the starch in barley to malt. This is what
makes the flakes light, he says, and allows them to be made with whole grain
products.

FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Cat-scan takes on a new life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1971 EMI scientist Godfrey Hounsfield's brain-scanner gave neuro-surgeons
their first glimpses inside a living brain without breaking the skull.
Computer-assisted tomography (Cat) was the invention for which Hounsfield
shared the Nobel prize for medicine in 1979.
In the 1980s Cat-scanning using X-rays was displaced in medical diagnosis by
the safer method of magnetic resonance imaging which uses no radiation. But
Cat-scanning continued to be developed as a non-destructive test process for
peering deep inside complex assemblies, especially when they are encased in
metal.
The essence of Cat-scanning is to take several X-ray images of the object
from different angles, and process the information on image density by
computer. In this way a 3-D simulation is created which can reveal, for
example, the location of a brain tumour.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, one of the US
Department of Energy's nuclear weapon design centres, has developed novel
scanners for examining specific situations.
With explosives, for example, the technique can find cracks or voids that
would impair the efficiency, can verify its density and ensure that the
substance had been properly mixed. One of several different Cat-scanners
designed at Lawrence Livermore examines the insides of nuclear weapons.
Another collaboration is with the University of California at Davis.
Experiments are under way to determine what substances a Cat-scan might
reveal in soil samples. So far, tests have shown that the scan can detect
cotton seed and locate voids as small as 300 microns across.
Another topical challenge is the rapid inspection of large drums of
radioactive waste before their long-term disposal, to provide assurance on
their radioactivity level. Much of the waste from US sources is incorrectly
identified at present, because the customary means of characterisation
cannot certify that they can be classed as low-level or non-radioactive.

FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Eat at home or take away / A look at whether you
should buy in IT services or turn your computer department into a business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate computers are being subjected to a wave of intense scrutiny as the
recession underlines the importance of getting value for money. Harsh
conditions have forced IT departments in both private and public sectors to
renew their efforts to cut costs and to reassess their potential for making
their parent organisations more profitable.
Since January, British Rail and Barclays Bank have turned their IT arms into
commercial businesses offering services to external clients as well as to
their own companies; while at the Post Office, the computer department has
laid itself bare to outside consultants who are studying whether computer
users within the group's three main businesses would be better off going to
an independent computer services supplier.
Handing the day-to-day running of IT to another company in this way is known
as facilities management (FM). Such deals are still the exception rather
than the rule - though a recent surge in FM, from a Pounds 60m UK market in
1987 to a forecast Pounds 270m this year, according to market researchers
Romtec, has increased the pressure on IT departments to prove their worth.
Some IT managers see FM as a threat to their own internal empires - being
asked about it by the company board may be a catalyst for internal
rejuvenation.
In the public sector, FM has grown particularly fast. The local government
IT managers association (SOCITM) has set up a working party to evaluate FM.
The Computing Services Association, a trade body with many FM suppliers
among its members, has prepared guidelines which it plans to publish this
month designed to weed out cowboy operations.
Some clients feel FM gives them more control of their IT - by taking items
off the balance sheet and pinning down costs with fixed-price contracts. For
other groups, however, IT is seen as so central to the business that
contracting it out like the canteen food is unthinkable.
If a company is reluctant to bring in an outsider for reasons of control or
security, but still wants to benefit from the commercial ethos of FM, it may
consider turning its own IT operation into an FM supplier.
Just over a month ago, Barclays Bank did just this. Barclays says the new
unit, Barclays Computer Operations (BCO), is a 'quasi' company - a profit
centre that will bid for work outside the Barclays group. The unit's main
objective, however, is to improve the provision of computer operations to
Barclays itself.
The IT department provides computer power to the whole Barclays group with
the exception of investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd and consumer finance
division Mercantile &amp; Credit.
'One of the big problems I have had as a monopoly is that my (internal)
clients don't perceive that they're getting value for money - they think
they may be getting ripped off,' says Bruce Hotter, BCO's managing director.
'If you tell them: you've got to reduce your cost base but, by the way,
you're locked in to the Barclays IT department, they'll just say - what do
you expect me to do about it?'
Some of Hotter's internal clients have already achieved savings through
tackling user inertia - making sure new technology is actually used as it
becomes available. There have also been concerted drives to iron out the
inefficient peaks and troughs of computer use that tend to reflect monthly
financial cycles. But, despite measures like these, there was a growing
feeling that clients should be allowed to contract out, and Barclays took
that as its cue for putting the whole computer operation on to a more
commercial footing.
BCO will try to make a profit only from its external clients. Internal users
will continue to be charged on a pure cost basis, but they will face
changes. In particular, pricing will become more differential so that users
will be able to choose between cheaper and more expensive options.
A company with a different perspective on the merits of FM is BOC, the UK
industrial gases group. In the 1960s the company decided to sell spare
capacity on its mainframe by acting as a bureau service to other companies.
When BOC decided to withdraw from this market in the 1970s, it sold the
operation, Datasolve, to Thorn EMI, and became the spun-off company's
largest customer.
However, when the contract came up for renewal in the early 1980s BOC
decided the time was right to bring IT back in-house. Today, it believes
that IT's place is under the fingertips of the board, though there are
certain individual activities which it says it would still consider
contracting out.
Paul Bosonnet, BOC's deputy chairman, believes that the company made a
considerable savings by bringing IT back in-house, but he says this was
secondary to the gains in competitive advantage. 'In the 1980s the use of IT
in our business became much more intensive. Originally it was fairly mundane
 -paying creditors and running the payroll. But then when we started doing
on-line order entry and planning our distribution, IT became much more
critical. You can probably get by without paying a supplier for a day or two
 -but if something goes wrong when you're working on-line with a customer
then there's a feeling that you've lost business.'
BOC's computer activities have become spread around the world on a number of
different systems from different vendors - whereas 10 years ago it was all
concentrated on the UK mainframe. 'If we went back to Datasolve, where they
would have dominated our business 10 years ago, they would now have a much
smaller part of the total.'
The British Broadcasting Corporation is also determined to run its own IT.
It considered and rejected FM two years ago but believes the process of
putting IT out to tender was an invaluable exercise.
The IT department's customers are computer users in various parts of the
corporation who develop applications using the raw power which the IT centre
provides. They have to pay to use the IT service, but are free to go
elsewhere. 'We don't expect to make a profit for the BBC but we are expected
to recover our costs,' says Bryan Parlett, IT operations manager.
Several FM companies tended for the BBC contract and Parlett drew up a list
of the most common financial benefits that they claimed to offer. He
concluded that all of these savings could equally be obtained in-house.
Most of the FM companies saw potential savings in moving the BBC to more
modern, powerful hardware and through cutting staff by about a third. The
BBC agreed - and followed this course independently. In the last two years
it has replaced its ICL 2900 mainframes with newer Series 39 machines from
the same manufacturer and has reduced its computer operations staff from 64
to about 50 people.
BBC staff themselves, he concedes, might have benefited from an FM deal.
Career opportunities are enhanced by moving to an organisation which runs a
broad range of computer operations on many different kinds of hardware and
software.
Leading FM suppliers such as Hoskyns, EDS, Sema, ITNet, and Andersen
Consulting offer a variety of deals. A traditional FM contract may involve
buying the computer department and its staff lock, stock and barrel, and
then running it more cheaply - first on the customer's premises and later
moving it alongside other clients' processing at the FM company's own data
centre.
Pure FM, despite its recent growth, has a limited lifespan. Many clients in
local government, for example, have sold their mainframes to FM companies as
a cleverly disguised step towards winding them down completely. Their real
intention is to move to smaller minicomputers which are constantly striding
ahead in terms of power.
'FM is a bit of a sunset industry,' according to David Andrews, head of
systems management at Andersen Consulting. 'We're moving beyond it. What's
important now is not the operation but the systems that deliver the services
surrounding business operations. The boundary between IT and the uses of IT
has to be broken.'
For EDS, FM is part of a wider concept for which it uses the American term
'outsourcing'. This umbrella covers systems development, systems integration
and consultancy, as well as the traditional managing of a company's
mainframe.
The budget for IT operations will only come to about 2 or 3 per cent of a
company's revenue points out Ranald Bain, director of financial and
insurance sales at EDS. Small cost savings within the IT department are
immaterial when put next to what IT can achieve for company-wide profits.

FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Getting the best out of IT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you cut the costs of running your computer operations without
jeopardising the long-term efficiency of your business?
As the recession continues to dog companies of every size, consultants and
academics have devised their own formulae for getting the best out of IT at
the least cost.
'Cancel the purchase of any more PCs and make better use of the ones you
already have,' is at the top of the list compiled by Martin Healey, of
Technology Concepts, in Cwmbran. 'Fifty per cent of PCs are not used to
capacity. Healey points out that the costs of just supporting PCs is Dollars
2,000 (Pounds 1,100) per user per year.
Rationalise your storage media, says Joe Wilson, sales director for PA
Consulting. Companies with several levels of disc back-up should question
whether they are really necessary.
Do not duplicate information in a number of places - on a central database
and on locally-held files, for example. And if programs are out of date get
rid of them.
Check that cache memory and discs are only used to store information which
employees need to use quickly. Put all archive data on less expensive tape
or other long-term storage media.
Question whether you really need that processor upgrade. 'You can almost
guarantee that it can be put off,' says Wilson.
Healey also recommends focusing on the business function when introducing
new systems. If the task is not central to the business strategy, then delay
implementing new systems.
If a new system is needed - to exploit a new business opportunity - go for a
cheap and simple system, says Wilson. 'There are often desk-top solutions
these days which can do the job. It's worth looking at PCs even as just a
short-term solution - to see if it works out.'
Most consultants also point to outsourcing, or facilities management to
introduce a mechanism for the control of spending (see main story).
To pin costs of new systems down more accurately Healey says you should
calculate the cost of the complete system, not just the cost of computers.
Training, for example, can prove an expensive cost.
Streamline the software you have. Spending some cash to convert the software
to run on a compiler can cut the costs of maintaining the software quite
drastically.

FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Committee considers recalling
governor - Harrods Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMONS committee is considering provoking a constitutional row by
recalling the governor of the Bank of England to give evidence for a second
time on action being taken against Harrods bank.
The trade and industry committee has taken advice from legal counsel on
whether the Bank's governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, was right earlier
this year to insist that banking confidentiality laws prevented him from
detailing what measures had been taken.
Several MPs on the cross-party committee are angry at what they see as a
defiance of their powers to summon witnesses to answer questions. The legal
advice is believed to support those who argue the powers of parliament
transcend banking law.
The committee will debate what action to take next week. Members could
decide Mr Leigh-Pemberton has already given as much information as could
reasonably be expected. However, some believe there is a point of principle
and a constitutional anomaly at stake.
The long-running controversy stems from the damning report by government
inspectors on the takeover by the Fayed brothers of the House of Fraser, of
which Harrods bank is a subsidiary.
Several senior Conservative MPs want the Fayed brothers to be removed from
control of Harrods bank to protect the interests of its depositors.
Reflecting that anxiety, Mr Kenneth Warren, Conservative chairman of the
committee, issued a strong challenge at the end of last year to Mr
Leigh-Pemberton to give evidence about Harrods bank, saying it was 'high
time' he responded to the committee's request to do so.
During a tense evidence-taking session in February, Mr Leigh-Pemberton
repeatedly refused to answer questions about Harrods bank or the Fayed
brothers.
He cited section 82 of the 1987 Banking Act which makes it a criminal
offence for anyone, including the Bank's governor, to disclose information
received under the act relating to the business or other affairs of any
person without their consent.

FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tory peer aims to extend scope of
bill - War Crimes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT IRAQI war crimes and Second World War crimes in Japanese-held
territories against UK subjects could be covered in the government's war
crimes bill, if the bid to extend its remit succeeds.
Lord Campbell of Alloway, the Tory peer who led the successful revolt
against the bill last year, has tabled a motion to extend the bill to
include war crimes committed in Iraqi-held territories since its invasion of
Kuwait and in areas held by the Japanese during the Second World War.
The motion would also allow amendments to try to ensure fair trials. This
was a particular concern among peers in previous discussion of war crimes.
It is the first time this arcane tactic of extending the scope of a bill in
the Lords has been tried for more than 80 years. It was last used
successfully in 1899.
The move would meet the criticism that the bill is selective in the war
crimes it brings within the jurisdiction of the UK courts. It is currently
confined to war crimes committed in German-held territories during the war
by people who are now British citizens or residents.
But the rarity of the procedure invoked by Lord Campbell may deter some
peers from supporting it.
The bill is to be debated in the House of Lords at the end of this month. If
peers throw it out, it will automatically become law under the Parliament
Acts procedure as it has twice been passed by the Commons in successive
sessions. The Lords rejected it last June by 207 votes to 74, a majority of
133.
But if it is given a second reading the proposed extension of the bill could
complicate its further discussion. Some of the arguments against it,
relating to the difficulties of a fair trial so long after the crimes were
committed, would not apply in the same way to trials for war crimes
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last summer.
The Home Office said yesterday that the Geneva convention of 1957 already
gave the UK courts wide jurisdiction in respect of war crimes committed
after the Second World War.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Ace plan would trump the 'Budget for
business' - Corporation Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEVEREUX and HAROLD FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S Finance Bill contained the details of the 'Budget for business'
announced by the chancellor last month. The main elements concern
corporation tax: the rate is to be progressively cut to 33 per cent and
losses may now be carried back for up to three years instead of one.
The aim of these measures is, according to the chancellor, to 'help business
through the recession in the short term' and to 'encourage them to invest in
the long term'. But he needs to be far more radical to achieve either of
these goals.
In the short term, as much as Pounds 2bn of companies' corporation tax
liabilities is a tax on inflation, not on profits; it arises only because
there is no indexation relief to provide against the tendency of historic
cost profit (on which corporation tax is based) to overstate true profit.
The cuts in the tax rate, worth only Pounds 380m this year, do little to
address this problem.
Reducing the tax rate has only a tiny impact on the incentive to invest  -
mainly because the value of tax allowances is also reduced. Nor will it
really increase Britain's attractiveness to foreign investors. The tax
incentives to inward investment, as international companies know well, go
far beyond a comparison of tax rates.
The chart gives the costs of capital for inward investment in various
countries - a measure of tax incentives to foreign investors. It also
compares them to statutory tax rates. It is clear that the UK already had a
relatively attractive tax system, with the lowest cost of capital among the
G7 countries, and that the latest cut in the tax rate did not alter its
ranking.
But between the Budget and the bill the Institute for Fiscal Studies capital
taxes group published a new proposal which would have radical effects on
business in both the short and long run - and which could be implemented
without loss of tax revenue.
The basis of the proposal is a new corporation tax relief - an 'allowance
for corporate equity' or Ace. The relief would be very similar to that given
for interest payments: a notional return to equity would be calculated by
multiplying the amount put into the business by the interest rate. The
allowance would then reflect the amount which the shareholders could have
earned elsewhere - in economists' jargon, the 'normal' profit.
The Ace would replace the current imputation system, which is defective in
two ways: it gives relief on dividend payments, but not on retained
earnings, and it gives relief only at the imputation rate of 25 per cent,
not at the full corporation tax rate of 33 per cent.
Under the Ace, tax would only be paid when profits exceed a 'nominal' rate -
perhaps the rate on a medium-term gilt. This is already the case for
debt-financed investment, so that the Ace system treats all investments in
the same way, regardless of the method by which they are financed.
Because the Ace 'levels up' the treatment of equity, it also removes the
current disincentive to invest. Any investment that is expected to earn more
than a 'nominal' profit before tax will still earn more than a 'nominal'
profit after tax, and should still be worth undertaking.
Finally, there is the effect of inflation on the tax base; inflation pushes
up nominal interest rates and hence the value of the new allowance, so that
there is no need for specific indexation provisions.
The aim of the Ace relief is fiscal neutrality, removing tax distortions.
The advantage of the scheme is that it is based on familiar measures of
profit, and that the timing of tax receipts is more convenient for the
government.
Of course, the 1984 reforms were also aimed at fiscal neutrality. Some argue
that neutrality is best achieved with a broad tax base and a low tax rate,
along the lines of the current system. But the Ace system would not
substantially reduce the size of the tax base and may even widen it.
If the chancellor really wants a radical 'Budget for Business', rather than
a few cosmetic changes, he should study the Ace proposal carefully.
Important tax reforms usually take place just after elections rather than
just before, so, electorate permitting, he has up to 14 months to do just
that.

is an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Both are members of the
IFS capital taxes group.
