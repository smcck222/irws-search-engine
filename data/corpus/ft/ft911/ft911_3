FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Currency movements hit S&amp;N in opening
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare and medical products group, reported pre-tax
profits down 8 per cent, from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 27.2m, for the first
quarter of 1991.
Adverse currency movements reduced the outcome by about Pounds 2.5m.
But Mr Eric Kinder, chairman, issued a confident statement with the results.
'Overall our trading in the first quarter was on plan and sales showed
continuing underlying growth,' he said. 'Despite weaknesses in many of the
world's economies our core businesses continue to perform well.'
Turnover for the three months was almost unchanged at Pounds 171.5m.
Excluding the effect of exchange rates and the disposal of the Watson Marlow
infusion pump business, underlying growth was 10 per cent.
Sales and profits of medical products such as wound dressings and bandages
'continued their excellent growth in continental Europe and the US.' Sales
to UK hospitals were still constrained by the shortage of cash in the
National Health Service. Profits from manufacturing specialised gloves began
to recover, following last year's decision to withdraw from the loss-making
examination gloves business.
The UK consumer business - including brands such as Nivea, Elastoplast,
Lillets and Dr White's - suffered from the recession, with sales and profits
lower than a year ago.

FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Radio City agrees to Pounds 10.6m bid from
Emap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAP, the magazine and newspaper publisher, is buying Radio City (Sound of
Merseyside), the USM-quoted commercial radio company, for about Pounds
10.6m.
Radio City's A shares leapt from 285p to 377p yesterday on the recommended
cash bid of 385p per share, or an all-share offer equivalent to 395p. For
the 400,000 non-voting ordinary shares, the cash offer is 460p.
This will be the first whole radio station that Emap has bought, although
the group, which has a market value of Pounds 311m, has stakes in London's
Kiss FM, East Anglia Radio and Trans World Communications, which includes
Piccadilly Radio in Manchester.
Mr Tim Schoonmaker, Emap's managing director of radio, said that
deregulation had increased the number of stations and that radio's share of
UK advertising revenue was set to grow substantially from about 2.4 per cent
last year.
Outside the East Anglia/east Midlands area, where the group had local
newspapers, there were few restrictions on its entry into the commercial
radio field. It was also likely to apply for the new radio licence for York.
However, it was losing its keenness to bid for the first national
independent radio station because of the restrictions set on the type of
music that could be broadcast. Its early plans for a rock or easy listening
music station had been thwarted by the 'non-pop' stipulations.
The 385p offer is 18 times Radio City's earnings per share in the year to
September 1990 when it was already being affected by the national
advertising recession. The launch costs of City Talk, on an AM frequency,
drained the company of cash. The station has now been converted into a
'gold' rock and pop music format.
The paper offer for the A shares is 345 for 200; for the ordinary shares, it
is 206 for 100. Emap's closing price was 229p.
Radio City was the first commercial radio station to come to the market. It
floated at 77p in 1982 and the share price has fluctuated between 18p early
in 1986 and 577p in September 1989. Since January this year it has recovered
from 165p, helped by bid speculation.
Emap is also part of a consortium bidding for the Anglia television
franchise.

<TEXT>
MIDLAND &amp; Scottish Resources, the USM-quoted oil production company,
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.8m for 1990 - the company's first
positive result since 1983 - reflecting the sale of two drilling units for
Pounds 9.7m.
The results are the first to be announced since the company launched a
Pounds 149m rights issue last year to fund the purchase of the world's
largest floating production rig for the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland.
The rig is due to be delivered in 1993.
But the company was unable to produce any oil last year following the late
delivery of a similar rig from Davy, the contractor. Midland has now
received a preliminary court judgement on its case claiming damages against
Davy and been awarded full legal costs.
The rig will now be hooked up in mid-June with production to start later
this year.
In addition, the company is seeking to acquire additional oil acreage and
has agreed terms to buy a North Sea block with recoverable reserves of 30m
barrels.
Turnover was Pounds 3m compared with Pounds 735,000 in the previous year.

FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Maxwell's Pounds 142.5m offer for sale
closes oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 142.5m offer for sale of Mr Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group
Newspapers was oversubscribed when it closed yesterday morning.
Members of the public accounted for at least 100,000 of the applications for
shares in the company, which owns the Daily and Sunday Mirror and other
newspaper titles.
Advisers to the offer yesterday estimated that the overall UK subscription
was not likely to have been higher than 1.5 times the 114m shares on offer.
But receiving bankers had not yet arrived at an exact level.
It was thought that the public had asked to buy up to two thirds of the
shares available, with institutions accounting for the balance of the
applications.
Through the UK offer and a separate overseas placing, Mr Maxwell is selling
49 per cent of the company to raise Pounds 245.5m.
There was speculation yesterday that part of the demand for the UK offer may
have come from overseas institutions which had been unable to obtain as many
shares as they wanted via the international placings.
This followed reports by Salomon Brothers, lead manager for the sale outside
the UK, of strong demand especially from the US.
Basis of allocation would be announced once counting of applications had
been completed, said Samuel Montagu, financial adviser to the flotation.

FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: UK shoe side underpins Hi-Tec advance to
Pounds 8.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HI-TEC SPORTS, the South-end-based designer and distributor of sports shoes,
yesterday announced record pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.23m, up from Pounds
6.4m, in the year to February 3.
Three months ago the group said that, despite the downward pressure on UK
consumer spending generally, it would announce profits 'comfortably in
excess' of the Pounds 7m achieved in 1988-89.
Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, said the result was underpinned by a strong
performance in the core UK shoe operations. He thought Hi-Tec's
middle-priced products might have benefited from people trading down from
more upmarket training shoes.
Additionally, part of the growth came from Bad Boys, the Dutch leisurewear
business acquired in August 1989.
There was a substantial increase to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.58m) in interest
payable, although the company pointed out that interest costs were more than
four times covered by profits before interest.
The rise in borrowings was partly a consequence of the terms of trade with
Hi-Tec's Far Eastern suppliers, which require the company to pay for goods
before it has passed them on. Also, the company built up stocks towards the
year-end on concerns about the duration and scope of the Gulf war.
Borrowings net of cash at the year-end stood at Pounds 16.1m against
shareholders' funds, depressed by a goodwill write-off for Bad Boys, of
Pounds 22.3m.
Turnover rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 119.78m (Pounds 83.65m). Earnings per
share were up at 14.8p (11.5p) and the final dividend is 3.5p making 5p
(4.5p) for the year.
Mr van Wezel said that during the year the company had progressed its
strategy of diversifying both in product range and geographically.
Footwear diminished as a proportion of turnover from 86 to 77 per cent.
Aside from sports clothing, the balance was made up of Bad Boys.
By geographical region, the UK accounted for about 60 per cent of sales. The
other two main markets were continental Europe, with some 19 per cent, and
North America with about 14 per cent.
Elsewhere, Mr van Wezel said that the company had made substantial progress
in Japan.
COMMENT
Hi-Tec has had a rather dull profits history since it joined the market in
1988 and that has been fully reflected in a dreadful share price record:
even after a recent smart rally the shares still stand, at yesterday's 142p
close, 18p below the price at which they were offered. But if Hi-Tec can
keep up the momentum after last year's impressive performance - achieved
against ghastly market conditions - it will get harder to dismiss the
company as a minor player not doing a great deal in a small part of the UK
footwear market. Then again, the company's avowed aim of turning itself into
a broadly-based international leisurewear company is still far from being
realised. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the gearing and with Mr
van Wezel owning 70 per cent the shares are hardly the most marketable.
Still, assuming pre-tax profits rise to Pounds 9.5m this year the
prospective p/e is hardly demanding at about 8.5.

FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Receivers are called in at Warringtons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS have been appointed at Warringtons, the commercial property
company. The shares were suspended last month at 17 1/2 p.
Yesterday the company said its bankers had appointed joint receivers, Mr N
Hamilton and Mr W Martin, from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm.
The share suspension was made pending the outcome of talks with the
company's lenders.
Midland is its principal bank.
Warringtons first informed the stock market that it was in financial
difficulties in February, when it said that it was involved in refinancing
talks.
The company has not reported results since June last year when it announced
a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.03m).
Alfred McAlpine, the construction group, said last week that it had fully
provided for its 37 per cent stake in Warringtons in its 1990 accounts.
Warringtons' shares hit a low of 7p earlier this year, before recovering
slightly to the suspension price. The company expanded rapidly after
emerging in 1987 from an earlier incarnation as a building contractor.

FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Frogmore brands Southend offer as effort to
solve gearing problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frogmore Estates, the subject of a Pounds 130m offer from Southend Property
Holdings, yesterday accused its bidder of being in a 'financial
strait-jacket'.
'Southend's offer is no more than a thinly disguised attempt to overcome its
very real problem caused by an alarming level of gearing,' said Frogmore in
its defence document.
Southend responded with a claim that it was 'particularly disappointed and
concerned to note the complete absence of any valuation of Frogmore'. 'Could
it be that Frogmore is worth less than shareholders believe?' asked Mr
Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend.
Southend's own net asset value came under attack in Frogmore's document. It
said that Southend's net assets of 147p would be reduced by 9p if it had not
assumed the 'extremely questionable' conversion of preference shares,
ignored the placing and open offer currently being made to shareholders and
included Pounds 7m of warrants which have not been exercised.
Frogmore also said that Southend's financial performance had 'run out of
steam' and its last two dividends had not been covered.
It said that Southend would have reported an attributable loss last year
were it not for a change in accounting policy. It also attacked Southend's
claim about its net asset growth, saying that the majority of the growth in
the last five years was the result of issuing shares.
Frogmore contrasted its share price performance, which has seen a 2 per cent
rise above its pre-crash price, with Southend's which has fallen 69 per
cent.
The defence document said that Southend was offering Frogmore shareholders
an immediate capital loss of 7.3 per cent and a reduction in dividend income
of 12.1 per cent.
Frogmore advised shareholders that rather than take on Southend's portfolio,
the company would do better by buying other properties below their balance
sheet values. It described Southend's assets as 'unattractive', as many were
in locations where rental and capital values could be vulnerable.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Sears warns of tough times ahead as profits drop 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the retailing conglo-merate, yesterday revealed a 37 per cent drop in
annual pre-tax profits and warned that the difficult trading times were
likely to continue.
The company - which owns a host of high street stores including Selfridges,
Freeman Hardy Willis, Olympus, and Adams - maintained its total dividend but
gave strong hints that it would cut the pay-out this year unless the trading
environment improved.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 231.4m to Pounds 146.9m in the year to
January 31. Sales moved ahead marginally from Pounds 2.09bn to Pounds
2.16bn.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, the chairman, said the 'unbelievable' cost
pressures in the retailing sector had worsened in the second half of the
year. But rent, rates and wage pressures should begin to ease by 1992, he
added.
The decline in Sears' profits was mainly attributable to its withdrawal from
housebuilding activities and a substantially reduced contribution from its
footwear and menswear divisions. The latter two units were hit by the
recession and continuing restructuring.
Sears trimmed 140 shops and thousands of jobs from its footwear division and
vacated 20 per cent of its floorspace. Sears said these measures had reduced
the division's annual costs by Pounds 10m.
Fifty shops and concessions were also cut from the menswear division, but
Sears opened 139 sports and leisurewear outlets and 26 childrenswear stores.
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 75m (Pounds 95m) and Sears ended the
year with 3,781 outlets.
Mr Maitland Smith said real progress had been achieved by the company's
womenswear, sportswear, childrenswear, home shopping, and continental
European retailing operations. But in total, retailing and home shopping
activities saw trading profits slip to Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 139m).
Sears' property arm fell from Pounds 42.6m to Pounds 31m. Trading profits
from Sears' jewellery and housebuilding activities fell sharply from Pounds
18.8m to Pounds 1.7m.
Sears benefited from a net exceptional item of Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 35.9m)
stemming mainly from the surpluses on property disposals. But the company's
withdrawal from housebuilding resulted in an extraordinary charge of Pounds
15.2m.
Earnings per share fell sharply from 11.1p to 7.6p. The company proposed a
final dividend of 3.83p, which leaves the the total pay-out unchanged at
5.355p.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Pretoria and ANC move to end township violence: Mandela and
de Klerk reach a 'broad consensus' on measures aimed at halting the
bloodshed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH African govern-ment and the African National Congress have reached
outline agreement on measures to end violence in black townships, only hours
before the ANC had threatened to pull out of talks on the country's
political future.
The agreement, which has still to be finalised, represents the best hope yet
of halting violence which has left nearly 10,000 people dead in black
townships since 1984.
According to a statement released last night by the government, 'broad
consensus' was reached on most issues after six hours of talks on Wednesday
night between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president
of the ANC.
Officials from the two sides met yesterday to finalise details of the
agreement, which involves a ban on the carrying of almost all so-called
'traditional weapons' in public.
The statement said some remaining issues required further discussion, with
talks to take place urgently. Those close to the talks said disputes over
details - such as the convening of a planned conference on violence - could
still sabotage a formal agreement.
But there was no sign last night that the ANC intended to carry out its
threat to boycott talks on a post-apartheid constitution, at least while
negotiations continue.
In an ultimatum issued last month, it had set a May 9 deadline for agreement
on measures to end violence.
Flexibility from Pretoria on the issue of 'traditional weapons' appears to
have made it possible to avert deadlock.
The Inkatha Freedom Party claims that Zulu culture requires the carrying of
weapons such as knobkerries (clubs), assegais (spears) and pangas (machetes)
at certain gatherings. But the sight of Zulus marching through black
townships armed with such weapons has provoked confrontation, leading to
hundreds of deaths.
In a meeting on Tuesday, Mr de Klerk appears to have forced the Zulu leader,
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to agree that all such weapons apart from spears
should be banned. Carrying such weapons in designated 'unrest areas' will
now be prohibited while legislation covering the country as a whole will be
reviewed.
The statement made clear that agreement had yet to be reached on what
constituted a cultural occasion at which spears could be carried and whether
party political meetings qualified. It also indicated the two sides had
failed to finalise arrangements to convene a multi-party conference on
violence.
Pretoria had said it would convene such a conference on May 24 and 25, but
this was rejected by the ANC; the meeting now looks likely to be hosted
jointly by the ANC, Inkatha and the government, under the auspices of a
multi-denominational group of church leaders.
Compromise has been reached, either before or during the talks, on six of
seven demands contained in the ANC's ultimatum. So far, Pretoria has refused
to act on the last one, the sacking of two ministers - General Magnus Malan
at defence and Mr Adriaan Vlok at law and order.
The statement said Mr de Klerk reiterated 'the standing policy of government
requiring professionalism and the absolute impartiality of the police in
maintaining law and order, in protecting lives and property and in crowd
control'.
The latest agreement itself may do little to achieve peace, however, until
bilateral contact is resumed between the ANC and Inkatha, which severed
relations last month. Although an obstacle to constitutional talks appears
to have been removed, there is also likely to be little progress on this
until the ANC has elected a new leadership at its planned national
conference in July.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Competition in telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH P ARMITAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hugo Dixon's 'A Failed Connection' (May 8) is an excellent resume of the
apparent stalemate, vis-a-vis the government's white paper on
telecommunications deregulation in the UK, and the subsequent 'flurry of
inactivity' since its publication.
Perhaps, despite its stated policy of introducing competition, the
government is dragging its feet to safeguard the value of its shareholding
in BT.
The point is that if any real competition is to be encouraged to provide
alternate telecommunication networks, and thereby provide choice to the
customers, then problems associated with access connection charges must be
resolved at the earliest opportunity and not by any interim solution until
1993.
The local networks around towns and cities were already in place before BT
was privatised and, while some may be in need of replacement now and in the
future, the cost of new network cabling should not have to be borne entirely
by the alternative service network operators as currently appears to be
suggested. Therefore, any charge for connection to BT local networks should
be restricted to a conveyance fee only.
One must question whether government really is committed to providing
telecommunication network customers with choice.

Sir, I sympathised with your leader ('No FT, no comrades', May 3). The
Institute of Directors also featured in that Wednesday night party political
broadcast by the Labour party, with the implication that any criticism of
government policy means support for the Labour party.
It is perhaps no coincidence that in the speech of mine to which Labour
referred in the broadcast, I too had quoted, with approval, Mr Samuel
Brittan's remark: 'Unfortunately, it is still not possible for market
economists to support Labour with a straight face.'
The IoD can certainly see nothing to laugh at in socialist policies. Under
socialism we are promised higher taxation, not lower taxation; public
intervention, not private initiative, public capital, not private capital;
renationalisation, not privatisation and regulation rather than
deregulation.
No one should think that the IoD supports socialism.

<TEXT>
Sir, John Gapper's report on the Usdaw conference ('Usdaw votes for and
against pay restraint policy', May 1) stated, with reference to the national
economic assessment, that 'opposition to the idea in the TUC has been led by
the AEU engineering union'.
Your readers should be aware that, while the AEU sought changes to the first
draft of the document, in the course of a debate at the TUC general council
on April 26 unanimity was reached on the content of a TUC statement on
collective bargaining, including a section clearly setting out the role of
the national economic assessment.
The only amendment to the draft being considered by the general council was
moved by Bill Jordan, president of the AEU, and seconded by Rodney
Bickerstaffe, chairman of the economic committee and general secretary of
the National Union of Public Employees.
This was incorporated in the text and the statement was then adopted
unanimously.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Partnership can deliver vocational education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SELLARS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding your report 'Agency attacks funding of courses' (May 2), your
readers will be interested to hear of further developments in our
relationship with the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and the
progress of the government's programme to develop vocational education.
I reported to the select committee on employment that a successful working
partnership has been established with the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ), leading to recent accreditation for some of our
courses. The first diploma in business and finance - to introduce vocational
education into schools - was accredited last month.
NCVQ accreditation is the key to recognition by the Tecs for funding
purposes. Our courses need NCVQ accreditation to gain listing by the
Training, Enterprise and Education Division (TEED). This listing in turn
frees Tecs to fund students on BTEC-validated vocational courses.
My comments about the need for a national strategy for vocational education
were made in support of the present government's, and indeed the
opposition's, declared intention to put in place a system of vocational
education which is linked to vocational training in the workplace.
We welcome the prospect of a white paper from the Department of Education
and Science on education for 16-19-year-olds. We anticipate that it is
likely to create the second pillar of a national strategy which will link
schools and colleges with the activities of the 82 Tecs.
An especially welcome development from BTEC's point of view is the growing
consensus across the political spectrum in favour of vocationally-based
education. We believe that the successful delivery of a national vocational
education system can only be achieved if there is a positive partnership
between education and employers, with government giving the lead.

Gonza1ez's official visit to London. I believe that on most matters his
views and opinions are correct and clearly there is much common ground which
should enable Spain and the UK to play important roles in the enhancement of
the European Community.
However, the British government should continue its present position with
regard to Gibraltar. Britain should not, under any circumstances, consider
changing the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht until such time as Spain
indicates its willingness to relinquish its sovereignty of Ceuta and Melilla
to Morocco. By the same token, I can see no harm in permitting the Spaniards
to use the airport in Gibraltar - after all, it is closer to the town hall
in La Linea than it is to Government House]

Sir, Observer's comments on the shrinking market for gold analysis in London
('Golden Goodbyes', May 8) might have carried a little more weight, if he
had not effectively destroyed his entire argument in his last sentence by
suggesting that the Consolidated Gold Fields annual survey ought to be
revived. It never ceased.
The survey, on which I have worked as a consultant each year since the late
1960s, continues to be produced by Gold Fields Mineral Services, whose
shareholders are the major gold mining groups that previously formed part of
the Cons Gold empire. The next one is due out in a couple of weeks.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Leading Article: How to control pay at the top
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SO often over the past few years, the late spring spate of annual reports
is proving open season for people to snipe at the large sums of money which
many top managers are paid these days, on both sides of the Atlantic. This
year, unusually, some good may come of all the criticism.
There are several reasons why this year's brouhaha is different in
character. First and foremost, for the first time since the early 1980s,
revelation of some sharply rising mega-salaries comes against an almost
universal backdrop of falling profits.
Second, many of the same companies are also expecting lesser managers and
employees to moderate their salary and wage claims sharply in the face of
the recession. Third, some of the companies have suffered especially
embarrassing business failures.
Fourth, some of this year's toughest sniping is coming from insiders: late
last month the head of the British Institute of Management laid into UK
directors for increasing their pay but reducing that of their managers for
the first time since 1984. He warned that this might 'damage the
relationship on which good leadership is based'.
A further reason for the pitch of this year's debate is the salutary example
of so many of yesterday's highest paid (and supposedly best performing)
executive stars biting the dust.
Finally, it is becoming crystal clear that the issue is not just one of
basic salary and bonuses, but also of a bevy of other benefits: extra
pay-offs to departing directors, big adjustments to pension benefits and
housing subsidies.
Performance incentives
Some of the criticism contains a degree of both exaggeration and delusion.
The idea that top directors of large UK companies are always paid at
astronomic rates is by no means borne out by all the available surveys. Some
have also taken big pay cuts in the latest 12 months.
Nor is the concurrence of slumping corporate profits with sharp pay rises
for directors always as illogical as it seems: a growing proportion of top
executive pay, especially in the US, is rightly based on medium or long-term
performance incentives, which at present relate back to better years: in
1991, they reach back to 1989 or even earlier.
US counterparts
Then there is the much-touted global (or at least transatlantic) market for
top executives which, it is often argued, means that British bosses'
earnings should grow even closer to those of their US counterparts. In
direct terms, this factor applies only to certain international industries;
it can hardly be claimed, even indirectly, to be a justifiable factor behind
remuneration levels at UK insurance companies and building societies, for
instance.
In recent years, the most popular prescription for improving the control of
top executive pay has been to give more power to non-executive directors and
corporate audit committees; that view was expressed again last month by
Britain's Institutional Shareholders Committee.
Such an approach is inadequate. Audit committees run by 'independent'
non-executive directors (a questionable concept in itself) certainly have an
important role to play. But, in the US, company boards with a majority of
non-executive directors, plus the high prevalence of audit committees, have
not solved the problem.
The most effective solution would be to force public companies to create
much greater transparency in the service contracts which they give their
main board directors. Current legislation allowing shareholders to search
out such information at short notice should be strengthened by requiring
companies to send details of every such package (existing and proposed) to
all shareholders, and thereby to the public, well in advance of the annual
general meeting, at which all packages should be voted upon.
Few shareholders take much interest in these issues at present, but a
requirement for full disclosure and approval, plus all the attendant
publicity, would create much more effective pressure on companies.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Elisa Monte - Gardner Centre, Brighton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have, in the past , been much indebted to the imaginative choice of dance
offered by the Brighton Festival. This year three American modern dancers
have been invited - Bebe Miller, Molissa Fenley, and the Elisa Monte troupe
whom I saw on Wednesday night.
Miss Monte performed with Martha Graham; more significantly she also danced
with Pilobolus and Lar Lubovich, and her work has some clear links with
these latter enterprises. The four works on show on this Brighton visit are
vexatious in the extreme, not least because their scores are of the most
miserable and deafening, ranging from the mindless clangings of Glenn Branca
to Steve Reich churnings. And true to her accompaniments, Miss Monte
produces choreography - if that is not too high-falutin' a word - that
matches an uninspiring sound-track with the nicest judgment of flat movement
ideas.
Miss Monte's procedures - across the past decade in which these pieces were
made - are eminently clear. She is an advocate of the 'follow my leader'
style of creativity, in which one slender idea is repeated, facing one way
then another, then set off against another little movement thought, with the
dreariest of results. She produces dance for the simple-minded, in which the
predictable is sought and unerringly found. In her numbing Dextra Dei, four
men pass enfeebled steps amongst each other in semi-darkness, and
occasionally strike supportive attitudes. It has the sentimental air of yet
another 'Buddy ballet' in which chaps are called upon to face up to the
concept of losing one of their number while being tremendously understanding
and compassionate.
Two other pieces , under the inexplicable titles of Pigs and Fishes and
Dreamtime, are the aerobic classes in hell. The dancers jiggle and wrench
their torsos, writhe and slouch their way about the stage, while mindless
noise is played far too loudly, and though this may seem suitable as a
system of calisthenics, it is nowhere to be accepted as serious
choreography, save by those for whom choreography is the obvious,
ceaselessly re-stated.
Miss Monte's Pilobolus experience is evident in Treading, a dull duet in
which Danita Ridout and David Brown show us that they have control over
their muscles in slow-motion extensions of their limbs. Nothing much else
happens. But nothing happens on any serious level during the evening: this
is posturing thinking itself art, choreography as doodling.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Tokyo &amp; Endellion Quartets - Queen Elizabeth and
Wigmore Halls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The qualities of the Tokyo Quartet are rare and precious: tone as supple as
fine leather, each note precisely directed, each line drawn taut with an
athlete's muscular control, the ensemble faultless in blend and balance. In
a Tokyo concert one soon learns to take for granted standards of execution
out of the reach of all but a few quartets; but the quest for technical
exactitude no longer inhibits the artistic freedom of the performances as in
the early days of the group's existence it sometimes seemed to.
The conversational side of Tokyo quartet-readings has blossomed; the four
players achieve both unanimity of purpose and individuality of character. In
Monday's South Bank recital their Beethoven (Op. 18 no. 1, in F) and Mozart
(K575, in D) made for a gripping first half. Neither performance could be
described as 'European', or steeped in the manners of the 18th century:
there was little intimation of the Haydn-like sleights-of-hand that
Beethoven was setting out to equal (or even outdo), and, in the Mozart,
little attempt to search out nuances of gentle wit or smiling suggestiveness
beneath the courtly facade.
In the performances of less remarkable quartet-groups these limitations
might be regretted. Because the Tokyo playing was so strong and so masterly,
one accepted the style on its own terms - without qualification, with
pleasure and admiration. A similar experience was offered by the Brahms
Piano Quintet after the interval, with Barry Douglas a virtuoso pianist
unfailingly sensitive to his string-playing partners. It was not subtly hued
Brahms, shaded with nostalgia, hesitation, and regret; but it was definite,
superbly disciplined, and ringingly powerful.
The Endellion Quartet is this month embarked on a Wigmore Hall Beethoven
cycle. The first instalment, on Wednesday, was very much a mixed bag: even
after one had succeeded in drumming the long-lined beauty of the Tokyo sound
out of mind and memory, it did seem that the players were falling prey to an
unusual amount of technical flaws (the intonation of the leader, Andrew
Watkinson, can prove alarmingly insecure under pressure).
What's more, and in contradiction of the Endellion's current high standing
among English quartets, it was hard to gain any impression of real purchase
upon Beethovenian musical argument. The C minor (Op. 18 no. 4) was
unremittingly bland, the 'Harp' (Op. 74) uncomfortably out of focus; and
even though in the big B flat, Op. 130 (given with Beethoven's revised
finale), there was greater evidence of technical control and tonal
consistency, no 'long view' was presented to the listener. One hopes later
concerts in this cycle will more convincingly explain why the Endellion
decided to embark on one.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Paul Simon and MC Hammer - Wembley Arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So what's wrong with perfection? It was certainly on offer at Wembley on
Wednesday when Paul Simon brought his Born at the Right Time tour to the
capital. Here was musicianship of consummate skill; here catchy songs of
four decades, which stretch from the homesick musings of an American in
Wigan, where Simon wrote 'Homeward Bound', to a joyous celebration of the
'world music' which Simon has almost single handledly popularised; here was
an orchestrated performance which would have won the approval of the
military. And here were quite a few yawns.
For everything on stage was as sanitised and well behaved as the audience,
which sat in awestruck wonder for an hour before finally rising as a man to
'You can call me Al'. Simon was so pleased to have broken the spell that he
played the song twice.
From then on the tingle level rose steadily and by the time he had shed his
baker's dozen of supporting musicians, shouldered his guitar, and stepped
back in time three decades for the songs of his youth, you could accept his
old fashioned standards.
Simon does not come across as a member of the monster raving looney party.
He is a stocky, immobile figure in black suit and T-shirt. He obviously took
pleasure in the enjoyment of the audience but he equally obviously rules his
band with a rod of iron. Since they are mainly uninhibted African musicians,
including five percussionists, it rather hints at a party which never really
starts.
But few musicians have given so much to popular music as Simon and he is
still experimenting, not only with his dashes into Soweto and Salvador for
the rhythms for his last two albums, but also in his repackaging of chewed
over chestnuts like 'Bridge over troubled water', here revived to a reggae
beat.
This was a concert rather than a show, with no screen to magnify the tiny
star, and with an array of musical hardware on stage which severely
inhibited scope for movement. Not that there was much desire to dance - to
sway, yes, to 'Graceland'; to re-live pretty songs like 'Still crazy' and
poignant songs, like 'The Boxer', and to admire the way that Paul Simon has
made pop politically, musically and aesthetically respectable.
But not quite as respectable as Monday night on the same stage when MC
Hammer, the most successful rapper in the world, brought a very bland
version of the art to the UK. He has made money by adapting rap for Middle
America - no 'burn whitey' talk here, more love your neighbourhood cop. MC
is quite without charisma, using the hammer of a non-stop 'posse' of
dancers, singers and musicians to crack some very small nuts.

Do you believe black entertainers are so hopelessly inferior that, without
the help of special separatist enclaves which bar white participants, they
will never make it onto television? If so, how do you explain the success of
Shirley Bassey and Lenny Henry, Tina Turner and MC Hammer, Derek Griffiths
and Floella Benjamin, Rusty Lee and Gary Wilmot, Willard White and Jessye
Norman, and dozens of other black comedians, actors and musicians who seem
to have triumphed without any such system? The mystery is why broadcasting
bosses keep on setting up these insultingly condescending series and why
self respecting black people don't boycott them. Latest in the deeply
patronising tradition is The Real McCoy (9.00 BBC2). If this had been
invented in South Africa Britain's broadcasters would have risen as one man
and reviled it.
BBC1 mounts a campaign with a difference: instead of appealing for money
Light The Darkness (10.20) appeals for people and governments to observe the
provisions of the Geneva Convention.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Pal Joey - Bristol Old Vic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey (1940) was thought obscene when it transferred
to London from New York in 1954. It was doctored for the English censor, and
then further diluted into the anodyne film version: Columbia excised the
social and sexual comment by turning it into the story of a heel (Sinatra)
and two women (Hayworth and Novack). The original is a dark tale of
exploitation and ideals, and it has been delivered accurately and
energetically in a fine production at the Old Vic.
The English have never evolved an equivalent of the American musical. The
genre combines felt realities with hoped-for dreams, staples from Showboat
to West Side Story. But this strain in American music has been developed
away from the stage by Paul Simon ('American Tune') and Randy Newman ('Land
of Dreams'). The English revival of a Rodgers-Hart musical now tells us
about our own times. This production of Pal Joey puts Joey the young
opportunist, Vera the sexually assertive older woman and Linda the
idealistic girl, in the original Chicago dive. Joey is the quintessential
toy-boy and wide-boy who thinks with his loins andcalls lust ambition.
But the 'dames' are always in control. Here, the key to the evening is not
the overworked but enduring 'Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered', but 'Take
Him . . . he's free' sung by the two women in Joey's life as they decide who
will claim ownership. The sexual energies are kept hidden, but emerge in the
intimate ballads, 'What is a Man?' ('is he an ornament, useless by day,
handy by night?') and 'Den of Iniquity', a fouled version of the ideal
love-nest.
The show is sharply and wittily choreographed, with fine dancing throughout,
particularly from Sara Weymouth (Gladys) and the night-club troupe. Jill
Gascoine (Vera) acts the rich vamp superbly; at fiftysomething bored enough
to make revisiting teenage lust a delight, and attractive enough to make it
look possible. Carol Starks' Linda is her innocent counterpart who learns
fast. Cissy Collins' journalist sings 'Zip' with panache: Hart's lyric
brilliantly gathers Dali, Lippmann, Saroyan and Toscanini into one song. And
if Anthony Bowles' musical arrangement sometimes sounds thin, the show is
driven on by Ben Ormerod's substantial lighting changes which keep the
action moving.
Financial difficulties have put The Old Vic under sentence of closure. If it
continues to deliver high quality productions like Pal Joey, it deserves to
remain open.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Martini's talent revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian Art in the 20th Century at the Royal Academy in 1989 brought to
London four sculptures by Arturo Martini; 'On Classic Ground' at the Tate
last year, a further seven. The Accademia Italiana brings us 49 in an
impressive exhibition, shown previously at the Hotel de Ville, Paris. It is
nothing short of a revelation to non-Italians.
The Italians, too, have been slow in their reappraisal of one of the most
influential and innovative sculptors of the first half of the century: many
of the works here had not been exhibited since the 1920s before the major
retrospective at the Palazzo Reale in Milan in 1985 or the centenary
celebrations at Aosta two years ago. Only in the last decade has the early
20th century Classicism of the renegades of the avant-garde seen serious
critical re-evaluation.
Martini takes his bow here in 1920, the date of his first one-man show -
organised by Carra - and the beginning of his association with the Roman
journal Valori Plastici which championed the return to Classical order. His
interpretation of that order was idiosyncratic and intuitive. He sought a
primitive clarity and purity from his native past, drawing on the forms of
the 14th and 15th century Italian Primitives and the 2nd century Etruscans,
and on the timelessness of peasant life and popular myth. 'The Etruscans
made their statues the way our women make ravioli,' Martini declared. The
same could be said of him.
Massive, simplified forms, even when in low relief, suggest the volume and
rotundity of figures by Giotto and Masaccio. Bronzes have the delicacy and
the sharply outlined features of Quattrocento busts An 'Etruscan' terracotta
chimaera turns to bear its teeth. Simple peasants in archaic dress are
rooted into Mother Earth and gaze towards the heavens, in 'The Stars'. The
compact bulk of 'Fertility' recalls Picasso's nudes of 1906 that similarly
derive their forms from the ancient sculpture of the Iberian peninsula.
Allusion is favoured above narrative, but his sculpture is not without
sentiment. Lovers are melded into single figures, or sit numbed and
separated by untimely death. The Prodigal Son is reconciled with his father
in an overtly Hellenistic bronze of 1926 which Martini considered among his
finest achievements. He has emphasised the tension and the pathos: 'a Greek
could not have done it,' he said.
Eroticism frequently rears not so much its head as its bottom. It is
tempting to relate his predilection for the female posterior to a childhood
memory of watching a prostitute lift up her skirt and squat in a canal: 'A
vision of her large behind exploded in front of me, white, on her two
trunk-like thighs. It was a temple, an ecstasy.'
His terracotta sunbather - which again brings to mind Picasso and his
monumental bathers - is Woman luxuriating in the sun and opening up her body
to embrace it. She is as voluptuous as anything by Maillol. Eroticism is
rampant in 'She-Wolf'. Title and posture allude to the symbol of Rome who
suckled the twins, and to the creature of Sicilian myth of devouring
sensuality. She is also Woman depraved, at once deeply and fatally desirable
and repulsive.
Martini described himself as the greatest seismograph of his age who let
himself be influenced by the natural oscillations of his time. Undoubtedly
he was eclectic in his choice of subject matter, technique and material.
Here he shows himself sensitive to a variety of media, from varnished
plaster to polychrome terracotta and wood, bronze, stone, and marble.
The varnished plaster bas-relief 'The Lovers' makes effective but subtle use
of cast shadow. A silky fluidity of line is found for the 'Dead Lover', and
that sensual, gleaming surface reappears again in the glorious - at times
almost Mannerist - series of small mythological bronzes of the 1930s. But it
is his experimentation and feeling for stone that often produce the most
exciting results.
In 'The Convalescent', the frail figure of the young girl is an essential
part of the massive boulder of grey, pitted Vicenza stone that is her
wheelchair. The porous Finale stone of 'Thirst' is rougher and more
expressive still. Its rough-hewn quality is reminiscent of Michelangelo's
'Slave', but Martini also saw the lava bodies excavated at Pompeii in the
1930s. This sculpture could almost be a wind-eroded outcrop of rock.
Cool marble is used for the chilly 'Narcissus' who peers into the water
beneath the crook of his arm to admire his own reflection. His figure is
streamlined, taut and inviolate. Vicenza stone is selected again for what is
the climax of this exhibition: 'The Dead at Bligny of 1935', which alludes
to the involvement of Italian soldiers at the 1918 battle. The pose of the
soldier is that of the small bronze 'The Hundred Metre Sprinter' made
earlier that year. It has simply been turned upside down to serve a new end.
The exhibition, sponsored by the Commune di Milano, continues at the
Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate, SW7, until June 23.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Arsenic and Old Lace - Chichester Festival Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the elderberry wine that is deceptive. I had forgotten what a good
play Arsenic and Old Lace is. Indeed it is rather a long time since we've
seen a well-made play with two intervals, a beginning, a middle and an end,
and with so many good parts. It also seems astonishing now that this play is
American. The US must have been a much simpler place when it was written:
whites murder whites; there is not a trace nor a mention of blacks or
hispanics. If I hadn't known better, I'd put a lot of it down to Harrogate
and Agatha Christie.
Yet Arsenic and Old Lace is as American as they come. One of the characters
thinks that he is President Roosevelt: Theodore, that is. The piece is
strewn with political references, some of them by now a little obscure, but
by no means getting in the way. The Panama Canal is being built in the
cellar of a Brooklyn house. Yellow fever abounds - at least in the
imagination. Between the cast there is a minimum of 25 killings.
Somehow, however, Joseph Kesselring's play makes murder inoffensive.
Although it may run in the family, some people commit it in a more civilised
way than others. The old ladies do it with elderberry wine laced with
arsenic: their nephew, Jonathan, lacks the advantage of having been fully
house-trained. He murders all over the place: South Africa, Australia, South
Bend, Indiana and even London. His aunts, played by Elizabeth Spriggs and
Rosemary Harris, have the better of him, probably by one body.
One of the sheer delights of the play is the sustained use of dramatic
irony; almost every other line excels in it. It also comes in the form of
the double-take; for example, when a man looks behind him and sees (say)
Boris Karloff, at first his mind doesn't click. Then, as you see the thought
processes working, it does.
Annie Castledine's direction carries double-takes into triple, possibly
quadruple, and does it to perfection. The first body under the window seat
in the drawing room is subsequently replaced by another. It is a question of
who knows what, and when.
There are lots of incidental jokes. Insanity does not just run in the
Brewster family; 'it gallops'. Mortimer, the nephew who turns out not to be
a Brewster after all, is the theatre critic for a New York newspaper. He
preferred writing about real estate for the financial pages. The friendly
neighbourhood cop is writing a play of his own about 'the things you
wouldn't believe go on in Brooklyn'.
Two performances stand out: Bernard Bresslaw as the Boris Karloff
look-alike, Jonathan, who on Wednesday was cheered off the stage, and Peter
Davison as Mortimer who seems to have dramatic irony running in his blood.
The whole performance is terrific.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
High-tech weaponry stole the limelight in the recent Gulf war, but a
glorified cardboard box also played its part.
It was used to transport frozen blood for the US Air Force without the need
for mechanical refrigeration or the need for dry ice (which gives off carbon
dioxide as it evaporates).
The re-usable container stored the blood at below -40 deg C for 48 hours -
important because blood has to be thawed according to specific guidelines,
and if allowed to warm to above -40 deg C can easily spoil.
The cardboard box is lined with polyurethane foam and the packs of blood -
chilled to -80 deg C - are wedged between canisters containing a mixture of
frozen ethylene glycol and water.
Developers of the containers, Battelle, of Columbus, Ohio, and Insulated

MACHINERY used in the production of food is likely to come under strict
scrutiny in the next few months with government restrictions on the use of
mineral hydrocarbons for direct and indirect inclusion in foodstuffs.
More widely known as white oil and liquid paraffin, these hydrocarbons are
used as a wax covering for cheese rinds and a coating on dried fruits as
wells a lubricant in machines - such as for oiling the chutes down which
food tumbles.
As an alternative Rocol, of Leeds, has developed a range of machinery
lubricants based on the glyceride and ester families. (Esters are organic
compounds produce when acids react with alcohol.) The lubricants will be
available from July.

ERRORS in software could be costing British companies millions of pounds a
year because data processing departments fail to test applications
rigorously, according to a new survey.
The report carried out for the UK arm of the software testing specialist
Compuware, of Michigan, surveyed more than 600 IBM mainframe sites in the
UK. It revealed that while simple and routine testing was being carried out
on most sites, complex software testing was being overlooked.
While 86 per cent of sites routinely undertook testing of a new program in
isolation and 93 per cent undertook testing to ensure the new program worked
with existing software, only 32 per cent of sites tested the software when a
program was adapted.

A FINGERPRINT technology, already in use with the US secret service, has now
been licensed for wider use in the US, in particular in the hunt for drug
traffickers.
The technique, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New
Mexico, uses gold and silver filaments to mark out the print. It should
prove particularly useful on materials from which fingerprints cannot be
detected using more traditional fingerprinting methods. These include
plastic tape, often used by traffickers to bundle up cash or drugs.
The fingerprint detection process, which is being marketed by ODV, of South
Paris, Maine, can also be used on materials after other detection methods
have failed.
The object is soaked in a solution of citric acid that contains particles of
gold, each about one-hundred millionths of an inch in diameter. The gold is
electrically attracted to the protein in the fingerprints and binds to it.
The object is then bathed in a silver-based solution. The silver sticks to
the gold and produces well-defined prints - light on a dark surface and dark
on a light one.

PAYING an outside company to run your computer operations may make it easier
to balance the accounts. But many companies worry that this may reduce their
ability to react quickly when they need a system which will give the company
a competitive edge.
To provide the benefits of facilities management without the drawbacks,
Gatton Synthesis, of Redhill, Surrey, has introduced a service which takes
over the routine tasks of data processing while leaving the IT department to
concentrate on the strategic development work.
Such mundane jobs include everything from software maintenance,
documentation and the running of help desks to applications such as accounts

FT  10 MAY 91 / Management: Rewards and risks of 'delayering'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some companies call it 'delayering'. Others use the looser but just as
ungainly jargon term 'downsizing', or even (heaven help us) 'rightsizing'.
What they all mean, in the simple English which far too few of them use, is
'the removal of management layers'.
The pioneers of the process, led by American General Electric, first swung
into action when business was good in the mid-1980s; GE itself took out
three layers of middle and senior management.
Now, cut to the quick by the vicious pincer effect of recession-hit sales
and searing competition, big business as a whole is following suit in a mad
rush to cut costs, streamline bureaucracy, and speed up decision-making.
This week Ford of Europe confirmed that middle and senior management will be
especially hard hit in the imminent round of about 2,500 job cuts; it is
removing two of what it says is a current average of seven management
layers.
IBM is already in the process of a very similar exercise, while its
arch-rival Digital Equipment is endeavouring to follow suit.
Among purely service companies, a notable recent layer-slasher has been
British Airways, which has reduced to an average of five (from eight or
nine) the number of levels between chief executive and front line.
In principle, at least, the rewards - and the feasibility - of layer-removal
are self-evident.
The market-driven need for quick decision-taking is being made achievable,
in the most advanced companies, by: the emergence of cost-effective
information technology networks that remove the need for the traditional
battery of paper-pushers; the development of much more cross-functional
team-working, without the need for bureaucratic demarcation between them;
and the increasingly proven ability of even lowly-placed employees to take
decisions on their own account.
But the creation of flatter management structures also has its risks. They
are considerable when, as so often, a company rushes into it primarily for
cost reasons, paying inadequate attention to the accompanying need for a
radical streamlining of formal procedures, and a sharp change in the way
managers and other employees behave towards each other.
In such cases, the removal of layers can demoralise and even nearly cripple
an organisation. GE's own experience proves the point. In the first few
years after it began the process, the result among managers in some parts of
the company was overload, stress, demotivation and inefficiency.
As successive layers were removed, the number of people reporting to each
surviving manager shot up from the traditional five or eight to 15 or more.
At the same time, many existing procedures were continued as before. The
result was that more and more work was pushed down the line. Some people
thrived, but others buckled under the pressure. Many left GE.
It was not until late 1988 that GE really began to fix the problem, with a
regular, structured process called 'work-out', in which business leaders
meet 100 of their people at a time for frank sessions at which unnecessary
procedures and what GE calls 'bad habits' are brought into the open and
(usually) dumped.
Behind the process lies the notion that the job of a manager in a flattish
organisation is no longer to control people, but to empower, trust and coach
them.
Other companies have learned from GE's experience. In parallel with its
removal of two layers - leaving between three and six between its chief
executive and its front-line operators - BP Exploration, the oil-drilling
arm of British Petroleum, has run Work-out-like 'Fitness Workshops'. The
rest of BP is now following suit.
Today's hasty layer-removers must learn that relatively flat organisations
cannot operate effectively for very long on anything like the same
principles as the steep pyramids which they replace.
To put it crudely, surgery must be accompanied by a character change.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Eagle Eye): The lines stay 'open' - How AT&amp;T and
NCR will fuse their products after this week's merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NCR's marketing slogan 'Open, Co-operative Computing' rings with irony as
its executives begin the painful task of combining the proud old company's
operations with those of AT&amp;T.
Since AT&amp;T launched its hostile bid to acquire NCR last December, the
computer company has been anything but co-operative. NCR's support for 'open
systems' proved to be the fatal attraction.
The AT&amp;T takeover 'is a fact of life', Charles Exley, NCR chief executive,
conceded earlier this week. His lack of enthusiasm was hardly surprising
after months of battling AT&amp;T to maintain NCR's independence.
Exley had been masterminding a transformation of NCR. Last year the company
launched a bold move into open systems based upon industry standards
including Unix, the AT&amp;T computer operating system, and Intel's
microprocessors. It was supposed to breathe new life into what many had come
to regard as a tired old-line computer company.
NCR launched high-end personal computers and servers. A notebook computer is
due next month. The company is also developing mainframe-performance
computers in a joint venture with Teradata, a California maker of 'massively
parallel' computers.
The strategy began to pay off. But just as NCR was beginning to capture the
attention of new customers it also caught the eye of AT&amp;T. After years of
failing to fulfil its dream of combining telecommunications and computer
technology to become a dominant player in the market for networked
computers, AT&amp;T was ready to try a new tack.
AT&amp;T's strength is that it owns the world's largest long-distance telephone
network. The company has long believed that its growth lies in exploiting
that network to carry computer data.
'Networked computing is growing more than three times faster than the
computer industry as a whole,' Robert Allen, AT&amp;T chairman, said recently.
'Today the world does 50bn electronic transactions a year. By 1995 that's
expected to quadruple to 200bn. Leadership in telecommunications alone will
no longer be enough.'
Allen's logic is faultless. NCR's product strategy has been widely
applauded. Drawing the two together will, however, be a challenge. The
majority of technology mergers have failed to live up to expectations. The
current struggles of Unisys, formed by the merger of Sperry and Burroughs,
are testimony to the fact that computer industry visionaries frequently have
blind spots.
Combining the product lines of AT&amp;T's computer operations and NCR will be
made simpler by the fact that both were pursuing 'open sys-tems' strategies.
There is plenty of sorting out to be done, however. AT&amp;T, for example,
currently sells personal computers built by Intel and high-end
multiprocessor systems supplied by Pyramid Technology in addition to its own
computers.
Pyramid expects to maintain or even expand its business with AT&amp;T in the
wake of the NCR acquisition. Industry analysts agree that the Pyramid
products will provide the combined companies with a high-performance product
that NCR currently lacks.
Intel is in a more precarious position. Its personal computer sales to AT&amp;T
could be jeopardised by the merger because NCR makes its own PCs. Overall,
however, Intel stands to gain since NCR's entire product line is based upon
Intel microprocessors.
Within the computer industry many question whether AT&amp;T can smoothly execute
the merger with NCR. The months of bitterness surrounding the takeover bid
will not make the process any easier. Although Exley this week claimed to
have a hard time remembering the 'combative stage' of the takeover process,
many of NCR's employees who entered into the spirit of the fight have not
forgotten.
Who you gonna call when your personal computer network goes down? Is it a
hardware or a software problem? Whose software? Whose hardware?
Open systems standards that enable different manufacturers' computer
equipment to work together have many advantages. One drawback is that it has
become more difficult for users to get support services from a group of
vendors who point fingers at each other when something goes wrong.
To address the issue, a group of leading US computer and software companies
have formed a combined technical support alliance (TSA) to co-ordinate
support for multivendor computing environments.
The TSA members include Apple, Borland, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel,
Microsoft, NetFRAME, Novell, Oracle, Ungermann-Bass and 3Com. These
companies will co-operate to ensure that their service staffs are trained to
understand other member's products so that they can offer users a
comprehensive solution to problems.
'Our customers want the flexibility to choose products from many different
vendors, along with the assurance that we vendors are co-operating to
support them. Although most of us have been working together already, TSA
formally offers our customers the assurance that we will all co-operate on
support issues,' said Darrell Miller, Novell executive vice president.
In theory it should be easy to send data from one personal computer to
another via a phone line. Theory and practice collide when we 'road
warriors' check into a hotel and try to hook up our laptop or notebook PCs
to the phone.
Recognising this problem, the Association for Computer Training and Support
(Acts), an international mix of corporate computer trainers and computer
managers, has challenged hotels in the US to make their phone systems
'computer friendly' by the end of 1992.
'More than 1.3m laptop computers were purchased in 1990,' said Elliott
Masie, director of Acts. A large percentage of these are used by business
travellers, yet fewer than 40 per cent of hotel rooms in the US are 'modem
ready' says the group. In Europe the percentage is much lower.
Computer Products Plus, of Huntington Beach, California, offers a 'road
warrior's toolkit' - a bag of tricks including crocodile clips, screwdriver,
a magnifying glass and a device designed to circumvent hotel switchboards.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology: The mouse proves to be a boy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The single gene that makes an embryo turn into a boy rather than a girl has
been identified conclusively.
In this week's Nature, scientists from the National Institute for Medical
Research and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund publish the proof that SRY
(which stands for Sex-determining Region on the Y chromosome) - one of
100,000 human genes - is the male gene.
They created a male mouse simply by injecting Sry genes (the murine version
of SRY) into a female embryo. The animal grew up with normal male sex organs
and mated with female mice, although he was infertile.
The British scientists said last July they were nearly certain that SRY was
the male gene, after studying those rare individuals whose 'biological' sex
was different from their 'genetic' sex. They found that SRY was missing from
women who had a Y (male) chromosome; in men who had no Y chromosome SRY was
transposed to another chromosome.
The experiment reported this week is a milestone in academic genetics - not
a recipe for producing boy babies. The scientists say that it would not only
be illegal and unethical to do human genetic engineering in this way but
also completely impractical.
The technique of injecting genes into a newly fertilised egg is not
reliable. Only three of 11 female mouse embryos with Sry genes actually
developed as males; the others stayed female because Sry ended up on
chromosomes where it could not work properly. And even when it does work,
the male is infertile because he still has two X (female) chromosomes and
sperm cannot survive in mammals with two X chromosomes.
The challenge now is to find out what switches SRY on in a embryo 10 to 12
days after conception - the period when sex is determined - and to discover
how it in turn regulates the 'cascade' of other genes which control the
development of male features.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Management: Company car policy goes in for a rethink - A
still popular perk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The calls started flowing into accountancy firms within an hour of Norman
Lamont finishing his maiden Budget speech.
Had the time come, clients wanted to know, to ditch the company car schemes
most had been blithely operating since the mid-1970s, when trying to
circumvent Labour's pay freeze and high taxes first brought the perk of the
company car into being.
The answer which seems to be emerging, appears to be 'yes' - at least for
many, perhaps most, categories of employees.
Lamont's Budget did not just raise the tax scale charge on company cars by
20 per cent, but, most traumatic of all, imposed a National Insurance charge
on employers for the benefit employees enjoy from their company cars.
The Treasury will raise Pounds 1.5bn from the tax on company cars this year,
and that is just from taxing individuals who receive them. When National
Insurance on companies supplying cars and free petrol to employees of Pounds
610m is paid in 1992/93, the total amount raised by the Exchequer from
individuals and companies will rise to more than Pounds 2.3bn.
Although the personal tax on cars, which has been increased by 280 per cent
since the 1988 budget, seems high, the company car still amounts to a
considerable benefit for employees. On the Treasury's figures, the benefit
to employees of a car (and free petrol) amounts to Pounds 5.9bn this year.
The tax currently paid by employees - many of whom are higher rate
tax-payers - is equal to just 25 per cent of that benefit.
For the vast majority of companies, the evaluation process is still under
way. But detailed analysis of the subject by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte provides a firm indicator that many companies could make the switch
at no financial cost to employees and potentially large savings to the
company itself.
The issue is more complicated than money, however.
'The choices can be very, very complex,' stresses Andrew Evans, a partner
with Price Waterhouse's executive and benefits services practice. 'It's not
just a question of the tax position; it is tied in with employee motivation
and a host of other factors such as the ability to attract staff.'
Despite an initial post-Budget furore, analysis shows that Lamont would have
to tighten the taxation screw even more tightly on employees before the
company car loses its allure.
The cost/benefit equation for the companies providing cars, however, is much
more complex and involves many variables. Also, any change by a company in
its cars policy, particularly involving offers of cash to 'buy out' company
cars, has VAT and other pitfalls which could result in an increase of
taxation burdens for the unwary.
Yet the Coopers calculations show that the cumulative effect of the
increases in scale charges of the past three years, coupled with the
imposition of National Insurance for the first time from next year, have in
many cases created a clear financial advantage to the company to 'buy out'
the company car.
In the most extreme cases, such as that of a director running a 4 litre
Jaguar Sovereign, the company could provide him with the funds to buy and
operate the car at no financial net loss or gain to the individual, yet save
more than Pounds 3,000 per year.
In the table, column A represents the costs that might be incurred by a
company in providing a car for an employee's private and business use,
together with the resulting tax liability for the employee.
Column B analyses the same costs of motoring from the company's and
employee's positions, as if the employee had been reimbursed with the
running costs in column B.
Column C indicates the amount of any salary increase - and in some cases
deduction - necessary for the employee to be left neither better nor worse
off by being paid cash. The deduction can arise because the employee may
actually have a lower tax bill from using his own car at the company's
expense than from having a company car.
As Russell Thoms of Coopers points out: 'There would be some unusual winners
and losers.' The figures show that there are marginal savings for the high
mileage business user from a straightforward change to cash.
But, as Thoms points out: 'In the middle ground, the cost and tax position
for the typical manager's car cannot yet be improved by a cash alternative.'
The biggest savings, however, are clearly on the highly-paid executive's
Jaguar or similarly expensive car.
He says that savings can be increased further by 'fine tuning', such as
using company accounts at garages rather than reimbursing employees for
bills incurred, because the latter would otherwise attract employers' NIC
charges.
Yet whether the figures by themselves provide sufficient incentive for a
large-scale exodus from the company car is much more problematical.
'The car gives an employer a benefit out of all proportion to salary,' says
Paul Ives, human resources controller Legal and General, the insurance
company.
'If we could just offer salary then it would not have the same (positive)
effect when recruiting or retaining staff. A car is a very attractive
benefit and I would be loathe to scrap the thing if I thought, as I do, that
it would wrong-foot us in the recruitment market.'
Abbey National, which runs a mixed fleet of several thousand cars, is more
adamant: 'We have no intention of changing our company car structure because
of the Budget,' the company says.
Yet the imposition of National Insurance has given some companies pause for
thought. For Boots, the UK pharmaceuticals and retailing group, National
Insurance will cost it about Pounds 400,000 on its fleet of 2,200 cars. Says
John Muncie, director of development, group personnel: 'It's a figure at the
margin, but it is an additional cost.'
Clearly the Budget has focused minds; consultants predict there will be:
greater selectivity in terms of who, in future, will be entitled to cars; an
end to free fuel for employees' private motoring; imposing restrictions on
the price or engine size of vehicles allocated to even the most senior
executives; and, contracting out the management of company car fleets
through competitive tender as a way of cutting costs.
The savings in National Insurance charges alone can be considerable by
keeping below the Pounds 19,250 price band for executives, and the Pounds
29,000 band for the chairman or chief executive.
'There is a lot of looking at cars over Pounds 19,250 and at ones under 2
litres, and a lot of down-sizing is going on,' says Muncie of the
Nottingham-based Boots. 'People will also make sure that they do at least
2,500 miles. If there's any doubt about it they'll drive to London by car
rather than take the train. And that will only add to the congestion.'
Companies seeking to offer a generous settlement to 'buy out' company cars
risk running foul of a judgment, Heaton v Bell. According to this judgment,
a company's valuation of the cash benefit of a car takes precedence over the
official scale charges and would apply to all other cars in the company's
fleet.
Thus even employees opting to keep their company cars could find themselves
paying a larger tax bill than the scale charge. Of greater concern, however,
is the stance being taken by Customs and Excise on VAT in relation to 'car
or cash' options.
Customs and Excise is taking the view that, if employees are offered a cash
option, but only a few take it up, those who choose to retain their company
cars have opted to accept a supply from the company which is liable to VAT.
'What Customs is arguing', says Evans, 'is that if there is a company with
1,000 cars and if it offers everyone Pounds 5,000 a year cash substitute,
then even if only one of the 1,000 takes up the offer, there would be a VAT
liability in respect of the other 999.' In this example, the VAT payable
would total nearly Pounds 885,000.
So far, the Customs and Excise view has yet to be formally contested.
However, a number of companies has written seeking formal clarification, and
it appears now to be only a matter of time before the issue winds up in
court.

LORD STRATHCLYDE, the Scottish agriculture minister, yesterday gave no sign
that the government accepted the case for a scheme to decommission fishing
boats in the North Sea in order to reduce over-fishing, despite calls from
Conservative party members.
Mr Sandy Manson, prospective Tory candidate for Banff and Buchan, a seat
with a large fishing community held by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the
Scottish National Party, was one of several speakers urging a
decommissioning scheme. Such a scheme is backed by fishermen and many
fishing experts but has consistently been turned down by the government.
Lord Strathclyde said that no decommissioning scheme could have an immediate

MR Michael Heseltine's political rehabilitation among Conservative party
activists moved a step closer yesterday at the Scottish Conservative
conference.
The environment secretary, who has received a frosty reception from local
parties since his challenge last year provoked Mr Margaret Thatcher's

In a wide-ranging speech Mr Heseltine claimed that the Conservatives had
proved themselves the only party which could effectively safeguard the

The enthusiastic, if less than warm, reception from the conferences,
however, came after he delivered a sharp attack on Labour's policies and

FT  10 MAY 91 / Fall in building output forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION output in the UK is forecast to fall by 5 per cent this year,
its first annual fall since 1981, according to Dr Richard Roberts,
construction economist for Barclays Bank.
'All sectors of the industry will experience weak trading conditions in
1991,' Dr Roberts says in the bank's latest UK Construction Survey.
'Private-sector non-residential construction is on the brink of a prolonged
and sharp deterioration.' The bank expects commercial building output to
fall by a quarter this year 'followed by another substantial reduction in
activity in 1992'.
Dr Roberts said a recovery in commercial building could be delayed until
1993-94. The only glimmer of hope was in private housing, which had recently
seen the first signs of improvement since 1988. But any significant recovery
was likely to be delayed until towards the end of the year. 'Other
developments such as rising unemployment rates, the loss of higher-rate
mortgage tax relief and the 2 1/2 per cent rise in VAT will provide a
partial check to any improvement,' said Dr Roberts.
He said there was unlikely to be any significant increase in public-sector
building work, although some areas such as roads and education might pick
up.

aircraft landing and parking fees. It wants a formula that will enable it to
recoup revenue losses from the abolition of European Community duty-free
sales in 1992 and from additional airport security costs.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is conducting its first five-yearly
review since BAA's privatisation of the company's three airports in the
south-east of England
Like other privatised industries regulated by government bodies, BAA is
worried that the recent Ofgas decision to impose a tough five-year pricing
formula on British Gas could set a precedent. Ofgas has limited annual
British Gas price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate of
inflation.
It is expected that the MMC review, which will recommend a new five-year
pricing formula for BAA starting next April, will be completed at the end of
June and the report published in August.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which regulates BAA's airport activities, is
expected to make a final decision on the new pricing formula in October.
Under the current formula, BAA can increase its annual landing and parking
fees by up to 1 percentage point below the rate of inflation. These fees
make up about 40 per cent of the annual income of BAA's three south-east
England airports.
BAA can also recoup 75 per cent of additional security costs incurred
because of government regulations introduced in 1989/90. The company says it
takes two years to recover these additional costs which amount to Pounds 14m
a year. BAA's overall security and safety costs are approaching Pounds 100m
a year.
BAA is particularly worried by the EC's proposal to abolish duty-free sales
in the single European market, which the company believes would result in an
annual revenue loss of Pounds 50m. Duty-free sales have traditionally
cross-subsidised other airport charges.
The company is also concerned by the implications of the EC's plans to
abolish frontier barriers within the community after 1992.
It says this would lead to heavy costs to adapt airport immigration and
customs areas.
BAA argues that any new pricing formula must also take into account the
company's 15-year investment programme to increase and improve airport
capacity in the south-east. The company envisages a Pounds 1bn new terminal
at Heathrow; expanding Stansted's capacity from 8m passengers a year to 15m
and eventually building a second terminal there; and modernising facilities
at Gatwick and Heathrow.
BAA is also funding about 80 per cent of the Pounds 230m express rail link
between London Paddington and Heathrow, which is due to come into service in
1995.
The MMC review of BAA's south-east airport operations will be one of the
first important tasks facing Mr Christopher Chataway, the former
telecommunications minister, who will take over from Sir Christopher
Tugendhat as chairman of the CAA at the end of this month.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Challenge to Guinness rulings fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roger Seelig, one of the defendants in the forthcoming second Guinness
trial, has failed in an attempt to challenge rulings by the trial judge.
In the High Court yesterday two judges refused Mr Seelig, former corporate
finance director of Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, leave to seek
judicial review of four decisions of Mr Justice Henry in pre-trial hearings.
Lord Justice Russell and Mr Justice Hodgson said they could find no flaw in
the trial judge's rulings and Mr Seelig did not have an arguable case for
judicial review.
Mr Seelig, who faces conspiracy and false accounting charges, complained
that Mr Justice Henry had set aside a summons to produce documents that Mr
Seelig wanted from the Department of Trade and Industry; refused to stop the
criminal proceedings against him on the grounds of abuse of legal process,
delay and unfairness; and twice refused to reopen his abuse application and
invite the prosecution to call certain witnesses, including officials from
the DTI.
Lord Justice Russell said that Mr Seelig alleged a conspiracy between DTI
inspectors investigating Guinness who had interviewed him, DTI officials and
the prosecuting authorities.
The documents he wanted disclosed were notes of meetings between them.
The DTI had opposed disclosure, claiming that the majority of the documents
were covered by legal professional privilege and some by public interest
immunity, while others were not likely to be material evidence at the trial.
Mr Justice Henry had seen nothing sinister in those meetings and had been
satisfied that there had been no misconduct by the inspectors or any abuse
of their powers. Lord Justice Russell said Mr Seelig did not have an
arguable case that Mr Justice Henry's rulings had been seriously flawed,
unreasonable or irrational, and there was nothing to suggest that the judge
had incorrectly exercised his discretion in deciding that, despite delays
and publicity, Mr Seelig could get a fair trial.
The court had imposed reporting restrictions under the Contempt of Court Act
when the hearing began on Wednesday but lifted them to permit yesterday's
judgment to be reported.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Lloyd's controls were inadequate, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
AN American Name yesterday claimed that the Lloyd's authorities should have
taken action to avert mismanagement at Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting, and
that its regulation of the insurance market had been inadequate.
Mr James Stone, a Name, or member, at Lloyd's since 1978, was presenting
evidence on the eighth day of the case in which 33 Names are claiming that
the failure of the Lloyd's authorities to regulate the market adequately was
responsible for their losses of more than Pounds 5m. He said: 'I thought
that if something was done that was wrong somebody would ring a bell. They
didn't'
Mr Stone was particularly heavily committed to the Oakeley Vaughan agency,
eventually staking more than Pounds 100,000 of the Pounds 450,000 he wrote
at Lloyd's to OV syndicates.
Oakeley Vaughan also managed his investments in other Lloyd's syndicates,
and Mr Stone developed a close friendship with Mr Charles St George, the
chairman of Oakeley Vaughan.
Under cross-examination by Mr David Johnson QC, representing Lloyd's, Mr
Stone accepted that he had been naive in the way he had organised his
affairs at Lloyd's. 'When I joined I didn't go into it in the detail with
which I should have. I guess I was unknowledgeable about what I was doing.'
Mr Stone was 'under the influence of Mr St George', Mr Johnson said. 'The
fact is that you had no knowledge of what powers Lloyd's have over
underwriting agents.'
Mr Stone had repeatedly ignored warnings from Mr John Hayter, the agent who
initially managed his affairs at Lloyd's, about the wisdom of committing
money to the Oakeley Vaughan agencies, Mr Johnson said.
Mr Stone accepted that when he joined Lloyd's he was putting his affairs in
the hands of an underwriting agent, but said he thought 'if there had been
something wrong I would have expected to have been told about it. In our
country we rely on the integrity of the system, not the broker calling in
the stock. I've said this so many times it sounds like a broken record.'

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday urged American Hispanic groups to 'sally
forth' to Capitol Hill to lobby for his proposed North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) or risk a failure which would send an 'unconscionable'
signal to South America.
Mr Bush, who has played a big role in the administration's campaign for the
Nafta, praised President Carlos Salinas of Mexico for 'taking that country
that we all love and moving it in a direction that we can all admire.'
It would be 'a terrible tragedy' if Congress failed to grant him the
fast-track trade authority he needed for the negotiations.
Fast-track gives the president a freer hand to negotiate an agreement which
Congress cannot amend.
The president has asked for that authority for the Uruguay Round, the Nafta,
and his Enterprise for the Americas trade and debt initiative for Latin
America.
Mr Bush is expected to win the fast-track fight in the Senate but to have a
harder time in the House of Representatives. A poll released yesterday of
three-quarters of the House members found half saying they would vote
against it.

FT  10 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Albania starts to lift barriers in
investment drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East European Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBANIA will introduce foreign investment and joint-venture legislation, as
well as measures to privatise sectors of the economy, as part of the
government's plan to boost foreign trade and modernise the economy, Mr Ligor
Dhamo, president of the Albanian Chamber of Commerce, said yesterday in
London.
Mr Dhamo, who with Mr Spartak Mersini, a senior official at the Albanian
ministry of foreign trade, was on a three-day visit to the UK, said Albania
was in desperate need of foreign investment to revamp food processing, light
industry and other sectors of the economy.
Last year, Albania had a trade deficit of Dollars 200m (Pounds 118m), a per
capita annual income of Dollars 850, and over-employment of 30 per cent in
the industrial sector, or about 93,000 people.
Mr Dhamo said the prospect for a resumption of full diplomatic relations
between Tirana and London 'in the near future', and Albania's determination
to modernise its economy, would increase trade between both countries. Total
trade turnover last year was less than Dollars 3m.
Diplomatic relations were severed in 1939. Attempts to restore them failed
in 1946 after the Corfu Channel incident in which two British destroyers
were mined off the coast of Albania.
Western investors had few incentives to trade with Albania because policies
undertaken by Mr Enver Hoxha, the former communist president who died in
1985, banned foreign credits as part of his ideological policy of
self-reliance and independ ence.
But yesterday, Mr Dhamo said policies now pursued by the recently-elected
parliament, which is dominated by the Albanian (communist) Party of Labour,
would open up the country to foreign investment.
In particular, he said new draft laws would:
allow foreign enterprises, banks and foreign nationals to set up companies
in Albania;
safeguard those investments against expropriation or nationalisation;
guarantee the right for full repatriation of profits - in hard currency.
In a speech to British companies, however, Mr Dhamo said the authorities
would establish a 'system of custom duties of a protectionist character for
significant final products and sectors of the economy.
'Gradually, this system will be adjusted to the structures and levels of the
tariff of international trade organisations of Gatt, the European Community,
which we want to join.'
The parliament were drafting a tax system which envisaged tax holidays of up
to three years for foreign investors, and thereafter, rates of taxes of
between 15 and 40 per cent. 'But I think the average tax will be around 20
per cent,' he said.
Foreign companies, however, would not be allowed to own or buy property in
Albania. 'They will be allowed to rent property,' he explained.
A draft law on privatisation, expected to be unveiled later this year, will
seek to clarify ownership and property rights.
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office yesterday extended the Know-How
Fund to Romania in recognition of the country's committment to reform.
The amount of financial assistance was not specified, however. The fund
provides banking, accountancy and finance advice and expertise to help the
countries of eastern Europe in their moves towards democracy and a free
market.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Macao gets an army general for governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Vasco Rocha Vieira, arrives today in the small Portuguese enclave of
Macao on the southern coast of China to take up the post of governor. He has
the task of trying to bring some administrative stability and progress to
the territory, which returns to China in 1999.
The 51-year old army general, who has been Portugal's minister with special
responsibility for the Azores for the past five years, has an engineering
background, was the army chief of staff in the late 1970s and worked in
Macao earlier in his career.
He is regarded locally as a popular choice and brings a reputation, which is
rare in the enclave, of being a calm adminsitrator and free of corruption.
He has started well by appointing two Macao people to top jobs.
Macao's governors have a tradition of being accident-prone. The previous
incumbent, Mr Carlos Melancia, looked more durable than most but had to
resign last October after three years in the job because of corruption
allegations. His predecessor lasted only a year and left after a row with Dr
Mario Soares, Portugal's president, who directly handles Macao affairs.
As is customary when governors change, new people are to be appointed to
seven quasi-ministerial civil service jobs at the top of government
departments with the rank of under secretaries. The most senior, covering
economic affairs, is expected to be filled by Dr Vitor Pessoa, a Portugues
economist who has been working for the past five years on World Bank and
United Nations development projects.
Located 40 miles across the Pearl River Estuary from the more prosperous and
glamourous British colony of Hong Kong, Macao has a population of only
444,000 (Hong Kong has nearly 6m) on a land area of 17.4 sq km. Its economic
propserity is largely based on gambling casinos and tourism, plus a light
industrial base of textiles and toys.
But unlike Hong Kong which is being destabilised by the prospect of its
return to China in 1997, Macao seems to be gaining from the approach of
1999. A new phase of economic development has begun in the past few years,
with major infrastructure projects, including a new airport.
General Vieira's main job will be to push ahead with these developments
while speeding up long delayed preparations for 1999 including the grooming
of locals to take over the administration and translation of laws into
Chinese.

RELIEF operations for cyclone victims in Bangladesh are being hampered by
political infighting and the failure of promised international aid to arrive
in significant quantities.
A bitter political row erupted yesterday in Dhaka during a special
parliamentary debate on the cyclone when Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and her
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party came under sharp attack from the
opposition Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina.
Although the Awami League is a bitter opponent of the armed forces, which
have ruled Bangladesh for most of its 20-year history, its leaders demanded
that the entire relief operation be handed over to the army.
Sheikh Hasina, who has just returned to Dhaka after visiting the affected
areas, made a scathing attack on Mrs Zia's government for its handling of
the crisis. Much of the relief work is, in fact, being carried out by the
army, which is providing food and medical aid to the victims and tents as
temporary shelters.

FT  10 MAY 91 / South Koreans turn their backs on ageing party politicians:
Street protests and the fall in government popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S ruling Democratic Liberal Party yesterday marked the first
anniversary of its official formation. But there was a distinct lack of
celebration in the corridors of power, still less on the streets of Seoul.
Instead, 250,000 demonstrators - mostly students and workers - spilled into
the streets, demanding that the government resign, and clashing with riot
police in downtown Seoul and several other South Korean cities. The
protests, some of the worst in recent years, have been fuelled by the death
of a university student last month at the hands of riot police.
While dramatic, this spring's demonstrations are unlikely to pose a threat
to the government. But they will further add to the problems of President
Roh Tae Woo's administration which has seen its popularity fall steadily as
a result of a string of scandals, intra-factional fighting and economic
concerns.
In the latest poll conducted by Korea Gallup, the DLP received only 18 per
cent support. This is lower than that enjoyed by the Democratic Justice
Party, the former ruling party, just before it joined together with two
opposition groups to form the DLP early last year: the new party has proven
to be less than the sum of even one of its parts.
Demonstrations by students, traditionally regarded as the conscience of the
nation, should never be taken lightly by Korean governments. But dramatic as
it seems, the current round of unrest lacks the broader social support
needed to achieve the students' demands.
There is also much ritual about the protests. It would be a strange spring
in Seoul if tear gas did not fill the air and if riot police buses were not
lined up in front of the city hall awaiting the inevitable demonstrations.
'May is always the cruellest month,' notes Mr Nam Jae Hee, one of the DLP's
most influential national assembly members.
This year's protests should also be put in perspective. They have generally
been less violent than those of last year, when radical students gained
control of parts of the downtown area, setting fire to the US cultural
centre. Moreover, the spate of self immolations by students which have so
far brought three deaths reflect an extremism borne of falling support among
the population as a whole.
The demonstrations can be expected to continue at least until May 18, the
eleventh anniversary of the Kwangju massacre in which more than 200
protesters were killed by troops in the south-western city. 'But we expect
them to die down quite quickly after that' said one western diplomat.
Of greater concern, perhaps, are the problems which will remain once the
wave of protests passes. The unpopularity of the government, which has
resulted from a series of scandals, intra-party factional feuding, inflation
and rising housing costs, has caused a disillusionment with politics and
politicians in Korea's four year democracy.
The response from the government has often served to exacerbate the problem.
Since the end of last month, two cabinet ministers have been dismissed - one
to take responsibility for a pollution scandal in the south-eastern city of
Taegu, and one to take responsibility for the death of the student. But the
rapid turnover of ministers only adds to the sense of instability and the
feeling that the government lacks direction in its policies.
'There is a crisis of confidence' says Professor Han Seung Joo of Korea
University. 'But it is not the same as the crisis in 1986 and 1987 in the
sense that it doesn't really translate into opposition to the system
itself.'
The reason, argues Dr Kim Hak Joon, chief assistant to the president for
policy research, is the creation of a solid middle-class. 'They may
complain, but they are strongly committed to the system and law and order.'
'Our political parties are strongly related to the past,' argues Dr Kim.
'That is why political parties and leaders have disappointed the masses and
that is why nowadays there is much talk about the need for generational
change.'
Professor Han agrees. 'The only change is that the two Kims have got older'
he says, referring to Mr Kim Young Sam, the number two in the ruling party
and Mr Kim Dae Jung, leader of the largest opposition party and the other
Kim's perennial rival.
The opposition has failed to capitalise on the government's weakness and Mr
Kim Dae Jung has been unable to extend his support beyond inhabitants of and
migrants from the south-western province of Cholla. A poll last month by one
of Korea's leading daily newspapers found that a full 60 per cent of those
asked did not support any party.
So for South Koreans, who turned out in their millions to force the
introduction of democracy in 1987, there is disillusion. 'In the medium and
long term this means an increasing alienation of people from politics' says
Professor Han. 'This is perhaps the most serious problem.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / Blow to Hawke as jobless rate surges to 9.9 per cent
</HEADLINE>

   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to 9.9 per cent in April from 9.3 per
cent in the previous month, and is likely to rise further, the government
said yesterday.
The figures, the worst since October 1983, are a serious blow to Mr Bob
Hawke's Labor administration, which is under pressure as a result of
recession and the declining popularity of Labor governments at state level.
Mr Hawke was forced to abandon a pledge that the government would not allow
unemployment to reach 10 per cent. He said there was 'obviously a
possibility' that it would do so.
The rise in unemployment will increase pressure for a cut in official
interest rates, which fell by 6 percentage points last year, but have
remained at around 12 per cent since the start of the year. Toyota
Australia, a subsidiary of the Japanese car maker, added to the government's
difficulties by blaming 'difficult economic conditions' for 400 redundancies
announced yesterday, equivalent to 7 per cent of the company's workforce.
The opposition Liberal party blamed the worsening employment outlook on the
government's tight monetary policy, and claimed unemployment was likely to
exceed 10.4 per cent before it begins to turn downwards, probably next year.
Mr John Howard, the shadow employment spokesman, also indicated that the
opposition will use the high level of unemployment to campaign against the
government's wages Accord with the trade union movement.
Mr Howard said it would be 'insensitive nonsense' for the government to
proceed with the Accord, under which many workers are due to receive a
ADollars 12 (Pounds 5.50) pay rise this month, plus a 3 per cent increase in
pension payments and provision for further pay rises backed by productivity.
The opposition supports a 2.5 per cent across-the-board pay rise, without
pension or productivity payments, awarded by the Industrial Relations
Commission, the statutory authority which supervises Australia's wage-fixing
system.
The commission's award is opposed by the government and the Australian
Council of Trade Unions , which is planning a campaign of industrial
disruption to force employers to pay the full Accord package.
Mr Hawke's government suffered a further blow yesterday when Mr Brian Burke,
the Australian ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican, bowed to opposition
pressure to bring forward his resignation, announced last month.
Mr Burke resigned in an attempt to protect the government from embarrassment
about his relationship with business leaders while he was Labor premier of
Western Australia in the mid-1980s.
He intended to retain his post as ambassador until the end of July, but has
been under pressure to leave earlier following an appearance before a Royal
Commission in Perth, which is investigating his government's business
activities.
Mr Burke said the federal government would have been in an 'impossible
position' if he remained as ambassador. He said he was confident the
commission would establish his innocence.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Democratic seeds in the soil of absolute monarchy: The issue
in Nepal's election is whether the multi-party system itself can work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROSE HARRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no issues in Nepal's first multi-party elections in 30 years,
people say, except democracy itself.
Twenty political parites have been holding public rallies and marches
throughout the country to woo the 11.5m Nepalese eligible to vote on Sunday.
Buses loaded with pretty girls and wired with loudspeakers blare forth folk
music and campaign slogans as they canvass the tiny rural villages where
most of Nepal's 18m people live.
Politicians are promising everything from cash to land reform in exchange
for votes. Yet, almost everyone agrees, the key election issue is whether
democracy can take root in the soil of absolute monarchy.
A year ago thousands marched through the streets of Nepal's cities in a
popular call for a constitution to limit the power of the monarch, King
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dez. After three months of protest, in which,
according to official figures, 56 people died, the king agreed to a
constitution involving a multi-party system and a reduction in his power
from absolute ruler to constitutional monarch.
An interim government was appointed in April last year representing the
various constituencies of the pro-democracy movement. Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai, prime minister, led the 11-member coalition cabinet with four
representatives from his Nepali Congress Party. Three cabinet members came
from the United Left Front, representing Nepal's six communist party
factions and one labour organisation. There are two palace representatives
and two independents.
Today there are 1,345 candidates and 20 political parties contesting the 205
seats in parliament. The largest party is the Congress Party which is
contesting 204 seats. The Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist) is
contesting 177 while five other communist factions are competing for the
remaining slots. Another political force is represented by two National
Democratic Parties, reflecting the moneyed village council interests that
have in effect kept power in the hands of the king.
Most observers predict a slim majority for the Nepali Congress Party, which
has strong backing from India. A US embassy official predicted that Congress
would win 'a weak majority, if barely'.
He expected the communists to get 20-30 per cent at the most. 'And, of
course, the National Democratic parties will be able to mobilise their
vassals.' The communist strength is in urban areas, while remote rural
regions will probably keep the village council leaders in power.
A shopkeeper in the village of Dhulikhel, for instance, watched as a
helicopter carrying the prime minister circled overhead. 'We don't like him
here. Go around to the villages and see how the people live. Then you will
know why we don't like all those rich people from the Congress Party. This
town is going to vote for the Cow.' The cow is the election symbol of the
National Democratic (Thata) party, led by former Royalist prime minister
Surya Bahadur Thata.
If no single party wins an absolute majority, the Congress party is expected
to form a coalition with the right-wing parties.
'The most likely coalition is one between Congress and Thata,' says Shyam
Bahadur KC, editor in chief of Nepal's govenment-owned newspaper, The Rising
Nepal. 'Thata has a soft spot for India as do the leaders of the Congress
Party.'
Nepal learned the importance of its link with India two years ago, when
Delhi imposed a trade embargo to punish Nepal for purchasing arms from
China. The nation barely survived for 15 months by rationing everything from
petrol to salt.
'I will vote for Congress but not because I want to,' said Sunder Shrestha,
a tailor from Katmandu, 'but Nepal has to face the fact that India is its
neighbour. We learned what can happen when India cuts us off economically.
For months I had no petrol or kerosene. China cannot help us, so we have no
other choice. If Nepal goes communist, India will close our border again.'
Nepal, with a per capita annual income of Dollars 170, is one of the poorest
nations in the world. There is no foreign debt problem, but that is because
loans come on the most concessional terms. In the 1989/90 and current fiscal
year ending on July 14, foreign aid income has not lagged far behind total
tax revenue.
This dependence on foreign donors for funds and on Nepal's giant southern
neighbour India for most essential goods allows little room for fiscal and
monetary manoeuvre.
There were pledges last year of nearly Dollars 1bn from Nepal's main donors,
to be granted by July 1992. They include Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Japan, Britain and the US.
Under the new constitution the king remains supreme commander of the armed
forces and retains the right to declare a state of emergency.

The king gave us this constitution. He can just as easily take it away.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / Quebec separatist passions cooling

<TEXT>
HOPES are growing in Canada that Quebec can settle its differences with the
rest of the country without breaking away.
None of the emotive issues which led to the collapse of the Meech Lake
accord, which would have enshrined in the constitution Quebec's claim to be
'a distinct society', has yet been resolved. But recent events point towards
a greater willingness to compromise - in both French- and English-speaking
Canada - than has been evident for the past year.
The improved climate was reflected this week in conciliatory remarks by
Quebec's premier, Mr Robert Bourassa, who said he might delay a referendum
on sovereignty, scheduled to take place by October 1992, if the rest of the
country appeared close to making a binding offer on restructuring the
present federal system.
His remarks come amid evidence that the drive for a sovereign Quebec is
losing some of its steam. One recent poll showed that 48 per cent of Quebec
voters support sovereignty, down from 64 per cent last November.
Organisers of next month's St-Jean-Baptiste Day parade, marking Quebec's
national holiday, have complained that they have raised only CDollars 2,010
(Pounds 1,015) in donations this year, against a target of CDollars 500,000.
The dampened enthusiasm for independence appears to result partly from the
recession and warnings from business leaders about the economic cost of a
fragmented country.
The federal government will outline further details of its strategy for the
forthcoming constitutional negotiations at the opening of a new session of
parliament next Monday.
Meanwhile, the 'national unity' initiatives launched by Ottawa since last
autumn appear to be bearing some fruit.
English-speaking Canadians, especially in the west, still oppose a special
deal for Quebec along the lines of the defunct Meech Lake accord. But they
are being reassured that the next round of negotiations will also deal with
at least some of their concerns, including the composition of the
non-elected Senate, the much-maligned policy of official bilingualism, and
aboriginal Canadians' political and economic demands.
And despite his party's dismal showing in public opinion polls, Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney is being widely applauded for his choice of former
external affairs minister Joe Clark to take charge of the constitutional
affairs portfolio.
Mr Clark, who has the advantage of being a bilingual Albertan untarred by
the Meech Lake episode, has said bluntly that it will be impossible to meet
Quebec's October 1992 deadline. Ultimately, though, he may be unable to
satisfy everyone. Despite the government's determination to avoid a national
referendum on the issue, that may be the only way forward.

<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of tighter gun control in the US have won a rare victory over the
well-financed gun lobby, with the approval by the House of Representatives
of legislation imposing a seven-day waiting period for purchases of handguns
to allow time for background checks.
The margin, 239 votes to 186, was larger than expected after intense
lobbying and advertising. But a much closer vote is expected in the Senate,
where rural states in which the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA) is
influential have an equal say with more highly populated, and crime-ridden,
urban states.
Moreover, President George Bush, a longstanding opponent of gun control and
an NRA member, has threatened to veto the measure unless it forms part of a
much broader anti-crime package that includes an expanded federal death
penalty.
The debate over the measure has touched deep-seated American traditions.
Even if it is enacted, no one expects the bill to make much practical
difference in a country where there may be 100m guns in circulation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIGHTS may soon be going out all over New York - literally - as the City
confronts its worst financial crisis in 15 years.
Mayor David Dinkins, in a sober television address on Wednesday night, said
one in four of New York's 295,000 street lamps would have to be switched off
to save money unless all the city's inhabitants, together with the New York
state government, joined forces to help bridge the city's huge budget
deficit.
Other cuts foreshadowed by the mayor included the lay-off of 20,000 city
workers and cuts in numerous socially progressive programmes, including the
closure of several shelters for the homeless and the suspension for a year
of a scheme to recycle domestic garbage.
Even more galling for the city's first black mayor, who dedicated his
administration to New York's children, was a threat to shut the zoo in
Central Park, visited by nearly 900,000 people a year, indefinitely and not
open this summer the City's outdoor swimming pools, which are used by 1m
people a year.
There may be an element of bluff about some items on the mayor's list, but
there is no doubting the severity of the financial crisis facing the city,
already weighed down with some of the worst urban social and infrastructural
problems in the US.
For the fiscal year beginning on July 1, the city faces a budget gap of more
than Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.1bn) and is seeking help from both the state
government and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state body set up to
borrow on behalf of the city during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. Mr
Dinkins also wants the city council to approve Dollars 1bn in higher taxes
and its labour unions to agree to wage concessions.
After calling interested parties to a crisis meeting last weekend, Mr
Dinkins took his message straight to the people with Wednesday night's
television broadcast, declaring: 'The choices before us are clear. We can
act together, making sacrifices and sharing the burden for the good of this
city, or we can go forward with some of the most difficult, painful budget
cuts that our city has had to confront.'
Behind the current problems lie a severe recession in the regional economy,
including drastic lay-offs on Wall Street over the past two years and a
property market slump.
But while the administration inherited many of the problems, the mayor has
been criticised for dithering and sending out confusing signals about the
severity of the crisis.
Critics said Mr Dinkin's speech did little to address the long-term
financial problems facing the city, and the danger that a deteriorating
infrastructure, high crime rate and high costs will continue the drain of
business from the area.

<TEXT>
MR Raul Granillo Ocampo, former Argentine cabinet secretary, has rejected as
irrelevant a government investigation into a case of alleged corruption
involving Swift-Armour SA, an American-owned meatpacking company.
In January, the case made corruption a political issue after a newspaper
published a confidential letter from the American embassy complaining that
an official had demanded bribes from Swift-Armour. The scandal touched off a
cabinet crisis in which four ministers were dismissed.
A federal judge investigated the case but last week shelved it for lack of
evidence.
Mr Ocampo, who resigned after being accused of leaking the letter, said on
Wednesday that the investigations 'were nothing more than an official
formality to confirm a conclusion written and determined before its
initiation.'
He said his enemies used the investigation to further their own political
agenda, rather than investigating the claim.

FT  10 MAY 91 / From conflict to consensus: The differing styles of Brazil's
old and new economy ministers, Zelia Cardoso and Marcilio Marques Moreira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIBILITY was the word on many lips throughout Brazil yesterday on hearing
that Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, is
to replace Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello as economy minister.
A career diplomat and former banker, Mr Moreira, 59, commands respect
internationally and from Brazil's private sector. His first task will be to
escape from the current price freeze without an explosion of inflation.
Inflation last month was 7 per cent but most industries claim their prices
are now 40 per cent behind what they should be.
'He's a first world citizen with all the tools to build a good team and make
a revolution in this country,' said Mr Igor Cornelson, Director of Chartered
West LB in Brazil.
Mr Moreira's appointment signifies a shift in style of government to a more
consensual approach. Until now the government of President Fernando Collor
has failed dismally in attempts to secure an essential social pact to
support its radical anti-inflationary policies, mainly because of the
aggressive style of Ms Cardoso.
Ms Cardoso, 37, was one of the main architects of the Collor Plan, the
package of radical stabilisation measures announced 14 months ago. The tight
monetary policy, which included the freezing of 80 per cent of national
assets and savings, was initially successful in bringing inflation down from
80 per cent a month to single figures. But by the start of this year it was
back over 20 per cent a month.
The announcement at the end of January of Collor Plan 2, which included a
wage and price freeze, was widely seen as recognition that Latin America's
most radical economic experiment had failed, and credibility dropped to rock
bottom.
Many in Brazil agreed with the direction of economic policy towards
deregulation and liberalisation. The problem was always with management. Ms
Cardoso and her team (known as the Campinas boys for their university
backgrounds and youth) were academics without political or administrative
experience. They tended to lecture people on economic theory rather than
attempt to negotiate.
Asked about the government's bitter rift with the powerful Sao Paulo
business community in an interview with the FT last year, Ms Cardoso simply
said: 'We're right. They're wrong. You'll see.'
This attitude won her enemies at home and abroad. However no-one faced with
the Herculean task of stabilising Brazil's inflation-ridden economy and
ending years of protectionism was likely to win friends. One diplomat said:
'Zelia has been under tremendous attack precisely because she's been trying
to do some of the things that needed to be done and that meant sacrifices
all round.'
But Ms Cardoso was unable to convince the population of the need for
sacrifice, and her polices have produced poor results. Last year the economy
contracted 4.6 per cent, industrial production fell 12 per cent and
unemployment in Sao Paulo rose to more than 1m.
President Collor was reluctant to lose his most loyal cabinet colleague. Ms
Cardoso survived a scandal last September in which an indiscreet bolero,
danced with the then justice minister at her birthday party, led to the
revelation that the two were having an affair.
She survived and even had her powers enhanced. In recent months she secured
jobs for friends such as the infrastructure minister, which led people to
dub her Brazil's prime minister.
Her increased influence seemed to go to her head and conflicts with other
government members became increasingly open in recent weeks. Mr Collor's
brother, among others, began pressing him to dismiss her. A poll last week
showing that a clear majority of the population was against the Collor
government seems to have been the catalyst for her removal.
Mr Moreira's appointment and his own reputation gives the government a new
lease of life in terms of credibility, though this could be quickly lost if
inflation is not soon brought under control. Mr Moreira is expected to
accelerate the liberalisation process to force down prices, maintain tight
monetary control to prevent consumption and devalue the cruzeiro to increase
the competitiveness of Brazilian goods abroad.
Mr Carlos Langoni, an economist and former head of the Central Bank, said:
'Externally he will speed up debt negotiations and is very aware of the need
for Brazil to become competitive again but his great contribution
domestically will be to come back to fundamentals.
'There will be no short cuts such as freezes or radical ideas. He is a
negotiator.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / EC takes a considered view of pig manure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has been unfairly criticised for being naively
visionary and interferingly nit-picking at the same time.
On the one hand, the Berlaymont bureaucrats are trying to subsume our
nations into a 'federastical' super-state, while pretending that the
Community can swan around and resolve crises like the Middle East where real
superpowers have failed.
On the other, they carry out dastardly ambushes on icons of our cultures,
such as the smoky bacon crisp and the defenceless tilde, the 'N' with a
diacritical mark - thus n - which they want taken off Spanish keyboards.
Happily, it can be revealed that such allegations are unfounded and that
senior officials engage daily with the most intractable of our secular
problems.
Manure dominated no fewer than three lunch tables patronised by the most
senior of officials in a Berlaymont watering-hole this week. Exquisite
asparagus and mouth-watering monk-fish could not deflect them from their
grapple with pig-droppings (state aids for the processing of).
Here in a poop-scoop was the classic dilemma of the Great Market which the
EC is building: how to reconcile fair competition with the environmental
imperative of keeping the citizenry dropping-free.
It is the Dutch who have brought this burning issue to a head. The
Netherlands is a small country with a lot of people and even more pigs.
The problem is that reprocessing manure is not a going business without
state subsidies which are illegal and competition-distorting under EC laws
framed for people rather than pigs.
Dung recyclers are honoured citizens in the Netherlands. Brussels officials
were left in no doubt of this on a recent visit to a reprocessing plant,
dominated by a picture of Queen Juliana raising a toast with a glass of
water by-produced from pig manure.
Any lingering scepticism has now been dispelled by a no-nonsense letter to
the Commission, re the absolute necessity of state aid for manure
reprocessing, from Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister himself.
While the controversy rages, it may be just as well that that Mr Lubbers is
tipped as a possible replacement for head of the Commission after its
currently presiding visionary, Mr Jacques Delors. Mr Delors is an urban
Frenchman, with a rather romantic view of the countryside (he is said to
have a cousin with just six cows). Mr Lubbers, it is patently obvious, is
very sound, and prepared to get to grips with real grass-roots stuff.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Privatisation pioneers find it tough at the bottom: Local
experience cries out for co-ordinated reform throughout the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Sub-Lieutenant Vladislav Gerasimov left the navy and returned to his
native Leningrad, he decided he had nothing to lose by trying his hand at
business.
One year on, aged 29, he is the proud proprietor of one of the first shops
'privatised' as part of Leningrad city council's market reforms.
Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, in charge of Leningrad's city council privatisation
programme, says he aims to sell 80 per cent of the city's 4,000 shops, as
well as most of its restaurants and housing.
He has sold 40 shops so far but he cannot say how long the whole process
will take as this depends on what he calls the 'political situation'. One
problem is that he still faces resistance from Communist-controlled
districts and the state organisations which run most of the retail network.
But the pioneering initiative of radical city councils and of entrepreneurs
such as Mr Gerasimov also reveals the limitations of economic reform in
isolation. Their experience cries out for a co-ordinated reform programme at
all levels of government and the economy.
After giving up attempts to repair the ailing socialist system, the Soviet
leadership has come round to the view that privatisation and other
capitalist evils are essential to economic recovery.
Although the union government has not yet begun privatisatsia of factories
on any significant scale, republican and local authorities have made a start
in taking small businesses and agricultural land out of state hands.
The government's latest anti-crisis programme seeks to privatise two-thirds
of small business by the end of 1992. One of the programme's contradictions
however is that it sets no precise targets for its proclaimed goal of
breaking up monopolies and privatising state industry.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, said in an interview this
week that one of his government's most important tasks was to de-monopolise
and privatise industry. He said the government was drawing up detailed plans
to achieve this together with the privatisation of the wholesale trade
network.
If this is so, then the government will be helping those at the grassroots
level who have taken the initiative on this difficult route.
For the time being, what Leningrad's Mr Vasiliev is doing falls short of
privatisation in the traditional sense - in so far as the businesses are
long-leased, rather than sold outright.
He says that the main reason for this is because the council is afraid of
being short-changed by selling in a market where prices are still
artificially low in the absence of market mechanisms.
Politically, he adds, there is a danger of a backlash if he goes too far too
fast. This is why for instance the council reserves the right to require
that new owners continue to sell basic commodities they sold under state
ownership.
'If a bread shop starts selling jeans (and stops selling bread), this could
be the end for us,' says Mr Vasiliev, referring to the already fragile
supplies of basic commodities. 'But nothing stops a shop from expanding its
selection.'
However, Mr Vasiliev, whose great-grandmother owned a chain of hairdressers
before the Bolsheviks abolished private property, has no time for socialist
ideals of worker-management.
Although employees are given a first option on leasing businesses, he says
'they make bad managers'.
From the outside, Mr Gerasimov's shop, in an industrial suburb with an
impersonal sign saying 'Haberdashery', looks like any other grubby state
institution in the Soviet Union. Inside however, it sells a far wider range
of goods than you would expect in a haberdashery shop, including items such
as wall-paper and swim-suits. Mr Gerasimov claims turnover has quadrupled
since he took over in March.
For Mr Gerasimov, minimum requirements for what he should sell and not
having outright ownership are the least of his worries. He paid Rbs15,000
for the shop's contents, and signed a 15-year lease giving him first option
for outright purchase. The lease has been set at Rbs30,000 a year. He was
chosen to take over the shop after a laborious selection process by the city
council. This has since been replaced by an auction system.
Nor does this Communist party member have any problems with his staff. He
told the three women who worked in the shop that they were welcome to stay
on, providing they shed the bad habits of state employees: 'I told them they
were not allowed to shout at the customers any more.' He also doubled their
pay.
His main headache is more fundamental - finding goods to sell in a shortage
economy where supplies are largely controlled by the state.
He says some enterprises want to do business with him but are already
committed to selling their output to the state through the system of state
orders. Others will only dispose of their surplus production in return for
other goods or in hard currency.
'We spend a lot of time looking for goods to sell because even though there
are private shops, there are no private factories,' he said.
'All the letters we write have to start with the words 'I ask you', but I am
fed up with asking.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / Estonia moves cautiously through collectivist web
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RIHO OLBERG, a 40-year-old Estonian farmer, has never known what it feels
like to own the land he farms. Although he lives on the property his great
grandfather bought from the German Baron Arthur Konstantin Sternberg in
1897, his only proof of ownership is a deed to roughly 44 hectares dating
from the days of the Russian empire.
Mr Olberg hopes to be one of the first Estonians to benefit from
privatisation. He knows it will be an uphill struggle. 'People are afraid to
show too much enthusiasm over private property because they fear a backlash
 -that their land will be once again confiscated, collectivised and they
will end up in Siberia,' he said.
Estonia, one of the three Baltic republics set on independence, is striving
to free itself from the bonds of a centrally-planned economy.
Privatisation is widely seen as the only path by which the Soviet Union can
launch itself into a market economy. For republics such as Estonia, it is
also a barometer of the pace of economic reform for foreign investors.
Estonia launched its first modest step towards privatisation last year,
permitting the sale of state-owned service, trade and catering companies
worth up to Rbs500,000 (Pounds 164,000). The results have been modest: a
beauty parlour, barber and a florist shop were auctioned in March in the
western coastal town of Haapsalu.
The republic is planning to take another step soon by selling 17 large
enterprises. It intends to put up for sale a 10 per cent stake of all medium
and large companies under the control of the Estonian state: these would
include seven companies during the first half of this year and a further 10
later this year.
However, Mr Ardo Kamratov, head of the Estonian department of state
property, believes there are pitfalls. For example, companies' shares are to
be offered first to their workers, then to local inhabitants and only then
to outsiders, including foreigners.
The seven large companies up for total privatisation include Baltika and two
other textile companies, Talleks, which builds excavators, and TLN
Taksopark, Tallinn's taxi company.
In early April, Estonia passed legislation which attempted to set the
framework for returning land confiscated after 1940 to its rightful owners.
Those who are eligible and want to reclaim land owned up to June 1940, when
Estonia was illegally annexed by Moscow, must apply to the Estonian
authorities before next January.
As a measure against speculation, land will only be returned to those who
will make it produce, according to Mr Pajo. If the owners cannot work the
land, they will be compensated, possibly with Estonian bonds or cash.
Difficult questions such as assessing the price of land and determining
compensation have not yet been addressed. And there are fears that Estonia
cannot guarantee private property will never again be confiscated.
Mr Maido Pajo, the Estonian deputy minister of agriculture, admitted that
the privatisation process in the countryside had been hindered by the
collective and state farms, which are important social units providing
education, housing and an economic livelihood for their workers.
Fifty years ago, when 60 per cent of Estonians lived in the countryside
(only 30 per cent do so today), there were about 140,000 farms of 25-50
hectares, with a few of 1,000 hectares. Today's collective and state farms
are between 3,000 and 15,000 hectares and are home to anywhere from 200 to
1,000 people.
Most of the rural land in Estonia is controlled by collective and state
farms. As a first step towards privatisation, some of these farms have
already been made into co-operatives.
Mr Olberg has been chastised by many of his fellow farmers for believing too
passionately in private property. But he has not lost his sense of humour.
'I have been normal all my life,' he says. 'The truth is that most of the
people who live around these parts have been abnormal because they don't
believe that a human can own land.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / Brandt presses Europe to set up intervention force
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN intervention force should be established to help secure peace in
areas threatened by civil war such as Yugoslavia, or to tackle ecological
disasters like the recent Italian oil spillage, according to Mr Willy
Brandt, the former West German chancellor.
In an interview before visiting New York today to spell out proposals to
reform the United Nations and improve its world development role, Mr Brandt
strongly favoured greater security co-operation among European countries as
part of moves towards European political union.
He also favoured extending the European Community eastwards, saying it was
in Germany's own interest to support the eventual adhesion of Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary to ward off the risks of disruptive migration
towards the west.
Mr Brandt noted that the German-Polish co-operation treaty being signed next
month commits Bonn to backing Polish membership of the EC. It was vital to
give these countries the prospect of joining, even if full membership were
10 years away, he said.
Underlining a turnaround in the thinking of the opposition Social Democratic
Party, of which Mr Brandt is still honorary chairman, he said he was in
favour of military intervention in another country's affairs in cases of
gross abuses of human rights.
On the question of allowing the German army to operate outside Nato, Mr
Brandt said he supported changing the constitution to allow the Bundeswehr
to be used outside Nato in all military operations which have UN backing.
But he left open whether the SPD party congress next month would back a
limit on Bundeswehr deployment simply to UN peace-keeping.
Mr Brandt said he was against asking for a permanent seat for Germany on the
Security Council. Any attempt by Germany to promote the idea - first floated
by the Soviet Union last year - would create so much controversy that it
could easily block reforms aimed at making the UN more effective, he said.
Rather, France and Britain, the two European permanent members of the
council, should be encouraged to use their voices to represent European
Community opinion. This could be a prelude to giving the EC formal
representation on the council.
Mr Brandt returned to the headlines for his concern about world development
with the Brandt Commission report carried out at the end of the 1970s.
Looking back, he denied feeling depressed about events during the last
decade. But he conceded that, largely as a result of a lack of new lending,
international resources were now flowing from the developing to the
developed world, rather than the other way around. 'Not everything has
become worse. But everything is much more complicated.'

<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S president, Mr Vaclav Havel, yesterday called on richer
countries for 'generous help' to enable the former Communist states of
eastern Europe to rejoin the path of western 'civilisation, culture and
values'.
Speaking in Aachen, where he received the city's annual Charlemagne prize
for international relations, he said Europe was nearer than ever to
realising 'the age-old hope of becoming an area of friendship and
co-operation for all its inhabitants.'
Now, despite the tearing down of the Iron Curtain, Europe needed to find
'the courage for speedy, unconventional and sometimes risky steps' to
overcome remaining divisions.
Backing the idea of a European Confederation first suggested by President
Francois Mitterrand, Mr Havel said European integration had to take place
through an overlapping network of institutional links across the continent.
He said western aid for the post-Communist countries, comparable with that
provided for western Europe under the post-war Marshall Plan, was necessary,
and was also in the 'existential interest' of the west itself.
The one-time dissident playwright reminded his audience in the historic
coronation chamber of the Aachen city hall of the basic reasons why the
former Communist states were seeking rapprochement with the west. 'This is
not because, as countries which today stand poor and destroyed, they believe
that their rich and prospering western friends can solve all their problems
for them.'
Rather, he said, countries such as Czechoslovakia identified with and were
seeking a return to 'a certain civilisation, a certain political culture'
which they themselves in previous centuries had helped to form.
'This is not a question of (eastern Europe) being fascinated by another
world. It is just the opposite. After decades of unnaturally following the
wrong track, we are yearning to rejoin the road which was once ours too.'
Mr Havel said that the goal of European integration could not be fulfilled
without maintaining the 'Atlantic dimension' of association with the US and
Canada. Additionally, 'no future European order is conceivable without the
European peoples of the Soviet Union, who are an indivisible component of
Europe, and without the great community of peoples, into which the
present-day Soviet Union is being transformed.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / Private radio and TV to return in Malta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MALTA is to have private radio and television broadcasting after a gap of 16
years under legislation approved by parliament this week.
The legislation sanctions the creation of 10 radio stations, a television
cable operation and several non-profit-making community radios.
Radio and television stations were nationalised by the former socialist
premier, Mr Dom Mintoff, in 1975.
Radio and tv broadcasting has become increasingly politicised, with
ministers using flimsy excuses to appear nightly on television news
bulletins.
The spawning of privately owned radio stations may, however, do little to
defuse the Maltese passion for politics. Barely had the broadcasting act
made its way through parliament and Mr Eddie Fenech Adami, the prime
minister, had licensed his own ruling Nationalist party, the opposition
Labour party and the island's conservative Roman Catholic church to set up
their own radio stations.
There are suspicions that the liberalisation of broadcasting is in fact
designed to give political parties new weapons with which to wage battle as
the 1993 general election approaches.
These suspicions are fuelled by the government's decision to grant the
church a radio licence. The church in Malta is largely viewed as a
traditional foe of the Labour party whose influence, now on the rise again,
may have a telling effect on the forthcoming general election result.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Compromise shaping on bigger Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bonn Finance Ministry intends to make concrete proposals on
restructuring the Bundesbank within the next few weeks which will avoid a
proliferation of new regional central banks to take account of German unity.
An official said yesterday that Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, leaned
towards Mr Karl Otto Pohl's view that there should be a reduction rather
than an increase in the number of Land (state) central banks which help run
monetary policy.
He added that it was too early to say exactly what line the government would
take on changing the Bundesbank structure. An amended Bundesbank law to make
allowance for the extra Lander formed through unification is due to be
proposed by the government before mid-June.
A dispute over the new structure between the Bundesbank directorate and the
federal states has led to considerable acrimony.
Mr Pohl has made clear to colleagues that he would resign if the government
went ahead with a plan, put forward by the majority of the federal states,
to set up five new Land central banks in the five new east German Lander.
This would bring to 16 the total number of Land central banks.
The disagreement appears to have been one of the reasons behind recurrent
rumours on the foreign exchange markets that Mr Pohl was about to resign.
The Bundesbank denied the latest rumour yesterday.
Mr Pohl proposes cutting the number of regional banks to eight from the
present 11. A counter-plan backed by the central banks of North
Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg proposes raising the number
by one to 12.
Since the government opposes the '16 plan' but has sympathy for the Lander
objections, a compromise seems to be shaping up in favour of the plan for 12
central banks. Mr Pohl would find this unsatisfactory - but would not
resign.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (15): A steady and prudent approach -
Profile of Hamish MacLeod, the next Financial Secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN who, it is assumed, will be last expatriate financial secretary in
Hong Kong's British colonial administration, takes up his post early in
August. He is Mr Hamish MacLeod, a rather quiet and self-effacing
51-year-old career civil servant, who comes to the job from a background in
trade negotiations and civil service administration.
The post of financial secretary combines, in British terms, the role of
Chancellor of the Exchequer and permanent secretary to the Treasury. In the
past it has been filled by extrovert and powerful men such as Sir Philip
Haddon-Cave who ten years ago stood second only to the governor. The present
encumbent is Sir Piers Jacobs who is to retire in the summer and has not
measured up to that tradition.
Mr MacLeod says it is not the financial secretary's job 'to seek to be
exciting - that is not actually a virtue.' He prefers 'steady and prudent'
as an image, and he chooses to interpret the power-change more in structural
than personality terms.
'The post was more powerful when decisions were more ad hoc - the process
then was often decision-taking by delay. Now the method of allocating
resources is more structured and power is shared with other secretaries.
There is constructive tension with everyone putting their arguments into the
ring, out of which sensible conclusions emerge.'
He expects his job to be dominated by issues such as Hong Kong's economic
growth rate, control of public spending, and balancing power with emerging
political interests in the Legislative Council. He seems sceptical about
whether the official five-year annual GDP growth target of 5.5 per cent can
be sustained, though that will depend primarily on the future of the airport
project, relations with China, and US decisions on China's most favoured
nation status.
He is adamant that abandoning or changing the HK dollars exchange rate link
with the US dollar 'is not on my list of issues for review because you don't
fiddle with a system that works well.' The area he says he has to learn most
about is Hong Kong's financial markets.
Mr MacLeod started his working career as a management trainee in the British
steel industry with Stewarts and Lloyds. and then went to St Andrews for a
social sciences degree.
From there, at the age of 26, he joined the Hong Kong government as an
administrative officer and moved through housing estate management,
government expenditure control, and civil service and district
administration till he became director of trade in 1983. This was his most
enjoyable job - 'you were involved in both strategy and tactics and it gave
you the specific challenge of getting agreement with the European Community
or the US - and you also got a wider perspective outside Hong Kong'.
Since 1987 he has been the Secretary for Trade and Industry and the
Secretary for the Treasury. He has been seen as a candidate for the Finance
Secretary's job, though critics say that either a more substantial figure
should have been hired from outside, or the job should have been gone for
the first time to a local ethnic Chinese candidate.
As it is, Mr MacLeod will probably go around 1995, before his due retirement
age of 57, to make way for a local Chinese who must occupy the post - along
with about 30 other top civil service jobs - by the time China takes the
colony back in 1997.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (16): Education debate has political
overtones - System faces fundamental problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 97 per cent of school children in Hong Kong are Chinese. But for
social and historical reasons, most are taught in a foreign language -
English. The government and educationalists argue that children would do
better if taught in their own language, Cantonese Chinese.
Parents disagree, believing that English offers educational and job
benefits. Meanwhile, businessmen are worried that English language standards
are slipping and this could threaten Hong Kong's importance as an
international financial and trading centre.
The government and educationalists deny standards are declining. They argue
the problem is one of demand; they say Hong Kong's increasingly
service-based economy needs more and more English speakers, which schools
are taking time to produce.
But both sides agree that the system faces fundamental problems that need
solving. Due to sensitivities over language and identity, efforts to improve
the system have taken on political overtones ahead of 1997.
Hong Kong has adopted elements of British and Chinese thinking towards
education. Exams are very important and some students face exams or
important tests every six to eight weeks. Some educationalists complain this
sacrifices originality. Science subjects are still more prestigious than the
arts - they are perceived to offer better prospects for jobs and emigration.
The biggest problem facing the system can be traced back to 1978 when Hong
Kong drastically expanded its secondary schools to offer free and compulsory
education up to the age of 15. Before this, the system was elitist with most
subjects being taught in English to the children of the elite.
As the system expanded, it brought in children and teachers of varying
standards. But most parents still wanted their children taught in English,
even if the child was unable to learn properly in a foreign language.
As a result, about 90 per cent of Hong Kong's half a million secondary
school students attend Anglo-Chinese schools where most subjects are taught
in English. But because of varying English language standards among teachers
and students, they are happier speaking in Cantonese. With the recent
emergence of a Hong Kong culture distinct from China or Britain, Cantonese
has also gained status as a language. Many schools have therefore resorted
to a mix of speaking Cantonese in the classroom and using English textbooks
and exams.
The language mixture has fostered a perception both English and Cantonese
standards are slipping with students unable to express themselves properly
in either language. To try and alter parental perceptions, the government
has proposed compulsory language testing of children before secondary
school. Students judged to have enough language skills, probably about 30
per cent of the total, would be streamed and receive most of their
instruction in English. The rest would be taught in Chinese.
The government hopes compulsory testing will show parents and teachers that
most children would do better studying in Chinese. But business groups
believe less English teaching means poorer English standards. To combat
these fears, the government intends to improve english teaching standards.
There are also plans to introduce vocational English courses and remedial
English teaching for secondary school leavers.
The government also needs to raise the status and morale of 47,000 teachers
if its reforms are to succeed. The wastage rate among teachers in secondary
schools hit 11.9 per cent last year. Some are leaving to acquire foreign
passports while others are being tempted by better salaries. Teachers
staying on complain of heavier workloads and declining morale. Some also
question the government's commitment to education, given the other massive
spending projects underway.
One major spending project is the government's plan to double the number of
first year, first degree places available in Hong Kong's universities and
other tertiary institutions to 15,000 by 1994/1995. The plan aims to stop
students going overseas and plug gaps left in the colony's graduate
population by the brain drain.
While the government was complimented for its boldness, there are worries it
is seeking quantity at the expense of quality. Some university educators
argue that standards will have to drop if the increased numbers of
undergraduates are to be admitted.
Meanwhile, China's attitude towards the education equation remains unclear.
According to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's return
to China in 1997, Hong Kong shall 'on its own' decide education policies and
language in schools.
But with China's increasing role in Hong Kong and mounting business links,
few doubt China's official language, Mandarin, will grow in stature. Some
pro-China educators are now pushing for more Mandarin in school curricula.
There is even speculation that Mandarin will replace English as the language
of success after 1997.
Such moves would be fiercely contested by the international business
community, who fear more Mandarin means less English. It would also be
opposed by Hong Kong's liberals, many of whom are teachers, who are wary of
Chinese interference in Hong Kong.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (14): Big shift in population planned -
More skyscrapers to be built in the New Territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR it was fishponds, gently worked by rural families still farming
this area of Hong Kong's New Territories. Today, the calm has been shattered
by convoys of trucks bringing yellow rock, freshly hewn from nearby hills
for foundations for skyscrapers.
Soon the first few families will move in and, by 1997, this will be home for
150,000 Hong Kong people.
The dramatic transformation of Tin Shui Wai in the New Territories' far
north-west into Hong Kong's latest new town, complete with shopping arcades,
bowling alleys and Japanese restaurants, marks the latest step in a
remarkable population shift.
Faced with a population explosion from immigration and a baby boom in the
1960s, government planners earmarked the New Territories as the only place
left to house the overflow from the cramped areas of Hong Kong Island and
Kowloon.
Eight new towns have been built so far. The sleepy Cantonese clan villages
of the 1960s have been overrun by 30-storey apartment blocks, ring roads and
industrial estates. The population has quadrupled since 1961.
By 1997 it will have almost doubled again to 3.27m, more than half Hong
Kong's total.
In the villages around the new town of Yuen Long the effects of such rapid
urbanisation are still being felt.
Mr Tso, now in his 70s, fled here from China with his wife and cousins.
Their tiny cottage, with one living room and sleeping area above, stands
opposite the village temple.
Until last year it was inaccessible to cars. Now a major road is being built
through the village, flattening the Tsos' cottage and forcing them out into
a modern government housing estate.
Mr Tso does not want to leave and enter the 'modern' world. For a start, he
has never been in a lift.
The New Territories have rarely captured the imagination of the expatriates
and businessmen who pass through Hong Kong. It cannot offer the icons of the
future, the skyscrapers and neon on Hong Kong's harbour, nor the icons of
the past available just a few miles north in China.
But in places the tangled hills, turned an even deeper shade of green by
passing clouds, the long hiking trails popular with Hong Kong Chinese
enjoying the clean, or cleanish, air and the lolling atmosphere of life all
combine to laugh in the face of the madness that is the better-known Hong
Kong.
The area is roughly 15 miles deep by 25 wide. It was leased by Britain in
1898 when the European powers scrambled for concessions in China.
Britain wanted the land as a buffer zone to protect Hong Kong and its
valuable harbour, acquired 57 years earlier. It is the lease on the New
Territories, expiring in 1997, which forced Britain to agree to return Hong
Kong to China.
Colonial administrators largely ignored the farmers, pearl fishermen and
local traders of the New Territories, prefering to maintain order through
alliance with the Heung Yee Kuk, a powerful group of land owners.
Even in the 1960s, when the Kuk were armed against communist uprisings,
Britain assessed the political climate in the New Territories
unscientifically, by counting Chinese and Taiwanese flags flying in the
villages.
As the area has become an overflow for Hong Kong people, so valleys and farm
land have become dumping grounds for the less edifying aspects of Hong Kong
life. Remote areas like High Island in Sai Kung are home to Vietnamese Boat
People, tucked out of sight of Hong Kong taxpayers, who pay for the
accommodation, as well as hiking tourists.
In return for its support, the Heung Yee Kuk was absolved from colonial
interference. Rules governing land use were never introduced. In the 1980s
local farmers found it hard to compete against cheap vegetable imports from
China.
So instead of farming, they have hired out their land as storage areas for
shipping containers, construction materials and scrap heaps. The farmers now
watch television or gamble all day on the stock market with their profits.
Beside the tiny roads around Lau Fau Shan, once reknowned for its natural
beauty, fields full of rusting containers piled six or seven high provide a
powerful but unpleasant reminder of Hong Kong's trading status.
The government, claiming to be sensitive to environmental lobbying, has
clamped down on this new kind of absentee landlordism. Even though the
measures are half hearted, they have provoked the wrath of the Kuk, which
believes it has been betrayed.
Mr Lau Wong-fat, chairman, says his members are being deprived of their
right to use their land as they wish. The Kuk's custom of only recognising
male succession is also under attack because Hong Kong is introducing a Bill
of Rights which guarantees equality before the law. Mr Lau says these rights
and customs were guaranteed in the 1898 Peking Convention and in more recent
treaties like the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini constitution after 1997.
He says the traditionally pro-British Kuk, a force for stability in the New
Territories, will become more confrontational is its grievances are not
addressed.
Near the small town of Kam Tin, two walled villages owned by the Tang clan
still draw tourists and curious locals. The present clan matriachs, quick to
spot an earner, greet visitors with a demand for money - 'one photo, two
dollar - one photo, two dollar]'
It would be no surprise if their traditional silk gowns are donned only for
the photo call or, perhaps, are designed to conceal portable phones.
Away from the ever widening main roads there are still reminders of the
past. Near the Chinese border in the east, around Ta Kwu Ling, farming
hamlets are linked by thin concrete paths which wind through patchwork
fields of vegetables and rice paddy.
One field is lined with pot plants, soon to be packed off south to the
boardrooms of Hong Kong's businessmen. Clumps of bamboo offer shade for the
village's dogs. The same bamboo will one day support Hong Kong's
construction workers atop the colony's building sites.
On one recent Sunday afternoon, the only sounds come from an old Hakka woman
carting firewood back home and families watching the horse racing at Sha Tin
on television. Occasionally there is the clatter of a game of mahjong, a
Cantonese favourite which combines the opportunity to make lots of noise
with, hopefully, lots of money.
Near Fanling, another new town in the north east, the bus passes army camps
which act as home to the Gurkhas, defenders of Hong Kong until 1997. China's
People's Liberation Army came to visit recently and assess their future
barracks. They returned to China amazed at the number of tennis courts.
On the other side of the town is Wo Hop Shek cemetery, Hong Kong's largest,
which snakes away into the hills. Each year families return to share some
food and clean the graves of their ancestors. But as more and more Hong Kong
people head overseas for a foreign passport, ancestors are being neglected.
The tombs lie silent, cluttered with the debris of past seasons. As the
light quickly fades, photographs of the deceased on the headstones gaze
northwards across the hills towards China, awaiting the return of their
former masters.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Confidence has been enhanced -
Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG may have little control over its political destiny. But the job of
making itself attractive to the international financial community has become
even more important of late. Although the colony can rightfully claim to be
East Asia's leading financial centre south of Japan, the uncertainties of
1997 and growing competition from other centres like Singapore have forced
it to redouble its efforts.
Much of the work has centred on the stock exchange whose flaws were exposed
by the 1987 market crash and the ensuing bribery scandals. The creation of a
new Securities and Futures Commission has paved the way to a new regulatory
structure for the investment industry. The exchange itself has been
strengthened by a number of measures including a more independent-minded
council to run it.
The main steps have been to make the securities markets more transparent and
less prone to abuse. There are new disclosure rules, and the procedures for
listing companies - which was where most of the abuse occurred - have been
cleaned up.
More reforms will come later this year to bring the exchange in line with
major exchanges elsewhere. A new law against insider trading (though not
criminalising it) will come into force. Changes are also being planned to
permit listed companies to buy back their own shares, and to enable dealers
to engage in short selling. A new take-over code and set of conduct of
business rules are in the pipeline.
None of this has been particularly popular with the broking community which
complains of over-regulation. But Mr Robert Owen, the SFC chairman, says:
'If you look at the international spectrum of levels of regulation, Hong
Kong is still quite firmly at the light end.'
Mr Francis Yuen, the chief executive of the exchange, says that the
regulation phase is now virtually complete, and the next phase will be the
development of new products, such as warrants, options, and securities from
the newly privatised sector in China - 'we could have a big role to play
there,' he says.
Innovations should be helped by new electronic trading and settlement
systems which the exchange hopes to introduce by the end of this year. The
systems have been subjected to lengthy delays, largely because of their high
cost. Although they are not vital to the numerically large number of small
local brokers, they are considered to be essential if Hong Kong is to hold
its place in the international investment community. Issues such as this
have aggravated members of the international broking community who feel they
do not have a big enough voice in the exchange's affairs.
A trickier problem confronts the exchange with the steady departure of many
of its listed companies for safe havens in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.
About 30 per cent are now based elsewhere, or planning to go. Jardine
Matheson, which led the exodus, has applied for a special form of 'exempt
listing' that would enable its shares to be traded in Hong Kong, but without
being fully subject to Hong Kong rules.
The exchange and the SFC both know that permission in this case would set a
major precedent which could seriously undermine the exchange. Yet they are
keen to find a solution which would retain as many listings in Hong Kong as
possible.
Despite the corporate exodus, there has been little sign of a drift away
among Hong Kong's financial community itself. The number of licensed brokers
remains high (there are about 900 of which 700 are active), and many
international firms use Hong Kong as a regional base. GT Management, for
example, processes trades from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand
there.
The international investment community is dominated by two locally-based
firms, Wardley, the merchant banking arm of the Hongkong Bank group, and
Jardine Fleming, the joint venture between Robert Fleming of London and
Jardine Matheson.
Wardley manages about USDollars 10bn of funds worldwide, and Jardine
slightly less - about USDollars 8bn. Other leading players include Schroders
and Fidelity of the US. Jardine was one of the few investment banking firms
in the region which increased its profits last year, despite the
difficulties in the international markets. Mr Alan Smith, the managing
director, points out that his firm made more money than big London-based
names such as Schroders and Barings.
The Japanese investment community is also growing steadily. There are now 46
Japanese securities houses in Hong Kong, twice as many as there are in
London - 'it shows that worries about 1997 are much stronger in places like
the US and the UK than they are in Japan', says a government official.
Although Hong Kong must have lost some of its investment allure with the
transfer of so much of its private wealth overseas, its importance as a
regional centre has, if anything, grown with the steady opening up of the
Chinese market. The Hong Kong stock market has also surprised people with
its strength. It overcame political uncertainties to grow by six per cent
last year, and it put on another strong surge in the early weeks of this
year, pushing the Hang Seng Index close to a record high in early April.
Since then, worries about the airport have pulled it back.
Confidence has been helped by the consistency of the government's currency
strategy, which is based on the peg to the US dollar. Now seven years old,
the peg has withstood a number of political shocks as well as the pressures
of Hong Kong's recent bout of inflation. The Exchange Fund, which manages
the currency, has kept Hong Kong interest rates slightly higher than US as a
counter to the negative forces.
Among the prospects for the investment community is a new law creating the
legal framework for retirement schemes, which are the moment are funded
directly by employers. It is estimated that some 10,000 to 15,000 schemes
will have to be launched in the years ahead, providing considerable volumes
of business for the life insurance and fund management industries.
The government also intends to develop a debt market to help finance a
forecast budget deficit. The new pensions industry will play a role in that
 -'we want to build up an appetite among investors so that when we need the
money the market will be there,' says Mr David Nendick, the secretary for
monetary affairs.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (13): Straddling the markets of China
and the outside world - Profile of Bank of East Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE outside world, the Hong Kong banking scene is so dominated by the big
names of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the Bank of China and Standard
Chartered, that the smaller groups tend to get overshadowed.
One of them is the Bank of East Asia (BEA), a bank with Dollars 50bn of
assets whose headquarters nestles behind its giant neighbours in Hong Kong
Central.
The bank was founded in 1918 by a group of Cantonese merchants who wanted to
create an alternative to the British dominated commercial groups of the day.
Today, its largest shareholders are the Li family, descendants of one of the
founding families, and its chief executive is a member of that family, Mr
David KP Li.
BEA has made a speciality of straddling the markets of China and the outside
world, and this is reflected in the fact that its two largest institutional
shareholders are the Bank of China and Societe Generale of France. Mr Li
himself was British educated and holds British nationality, but is
well-connected in China.
The bank consists of two distinct sets of businesses. On one side there is
the 58-branch strong retail operation which caters to the local personal and
corporate community, and is the fourth largest banking network in the
colony. On the other is a wide range of international joint ventures.
The bank has had a branch in Shanghai since 1920, which it has managed to
keep open through all the political upheavals. Further Chinese branches are
planned. The bank is also expanding its branch network in Europe and North
America - 'Mr Li is well-known in both east and west' says a Hong Kong
banker. 'He uses his contacts well.'
Mr Li's policy has been to build the bank by means of partnerships with
other institutions. In China, BEA set up an air catering company with the
aviation authority CAAC, which also runs restaurants and supplies food to
foreign embassies. It has a joint venture in software with IBM in China too.
Elsewhere, the bank has forged links with institutions such as Aetna Life of
the US, SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, and Bank of America with whom BEA
introduced credit cards into the Hong Kong market. One of its largest
affiliates is Trilease International, a leasing joint venture company with
Bank of China and Societe Generale.
Much of what drives the BEA is a desire to create an alternative to the
dominance of the Hongkong Bank - 'the Hongkong Bank is so strong,' says Mr
Li. 'I want strong partners overseas to help us.'
Last year, BEA increased its profits by 16 per cent to Dollars 388m. But
like all Hong Kong banks, that result was after a transfer to inner reserves
so it only tells part of the story. One local analyst says the bank's heavy
exposure to China could become a liability.
Mr Li agrees that times could be tough for the colony's smaller family-owned
banks - 'I see lots of consolidation over the next two or three years.
Overheads will hurt. Profitability is not that great.' Even his own bank
could merge, he says.
But he professes confidence about the future. His bank, he points out, was
the only one which increased its branch network while the Sino-British
negotiations were going on - 'the economic prospects here are much better
than people think,' he says.
Unlike the Hongkong Bank, he has no plans to shift its base out of the
colony - 'we are basically a Cantonese bank. We'll continue to be Hong Kong
regulated because we have confidence in the future of Hong Kong.'

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): Still large and profitable -
Banking / The precautions that Hong Kong's international banking community
is making in advance of 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES

<TEXT>
ONE of the more sensitive barometers of the Hong Kong climate is the state
of its banks. On that score, the colony is holding up as well as can be
expected. Hong Kong's banking community remains large and profitable, though
it, too, is taking its precautions in advance of 1997.
The most conspicuous example of this was the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation's decision at the beginning of this year to create a new holding
company, based in London.
While such a move might have had a devastating effect on confidence a year
or two ago, it passed with barely a ripple now - a sign of either Hong
Kong's resilience or its fatalism.
Otherwise the most notable departures from the Hong Kong bank scene have
been for reasons unconnected with 1997 - such as the withdrawal by some US
banks as part of their wider retrenchment from international banking, or the
more selective strategies adopted by some European banks, such as Lloyds.
But these have been offset by new arrivals, and the decision of some banks
like Bank of America and Yasuda Trust to establish their regional
headquarters there.
According to Mr Tony Nicolle, the Banking Commissioner, the number of fully
licensed banks in Hong Kong at the end of last year was a record 168, which
'showed clearly that it was an attractive place for international banks to
establish'.
In his 1990 report, he said profitability for most banks remained good, and
their capital was well above levels set by international standards. Hong
Kong's future as an international financial centre 'seems bright', he wrote.
Although the Hongkong Bank now has a different home, its focus is still very
much on Hong Kong where it dominates the overall market and, through
subsidiaries like the Hang Seng Bank and Wardley, the merchant bank, various
market segments as well. But the bank reported its first profits decline in
recent history last year because of severe losses suffered in other markets
like the US, Europe and Australia - all the result of efforts to diversify
geographically.
Mr William Purves, the chairman, rejects suggestions that the message is
that the bank should stick to markets it knows. He says the Hongkong Bank
had made a decision to become an international institution, and he still
believed that to be correct.
However, the bank suffered a setback with last December's decision not to
proceed with its proposed alliance with the Midland Bank because of
difficulties on both sides.
Mr Purves does not rule some kind of alliance in future - 'we will revisit
that scene at the end of this year,' he says. Hongkong Bank is still keen to
strengthen its presence in Europe, the one major geographical region where
it lacks a big operation.
The other leading players on the local market are headed by the Bank of
China and its 12 'sister banks,' now headquartered in Hong Kong's tallest
skyscraper, and growing steadily as links with China become stronger.
Standard Chartered, the other note issuing bank along with the Hongkong
Bank, is fighting to recover ground lost during the turmoil of the 1980s.
Staff and strategies have been overhauled, and American expertise has been
brought in to sharpen its marketing edge.
'We are still only scratching the surface of the market,' says Mr Ian
Wilson, chief manager of the Hong Kong branch.
Among overseas banks, Citibank is an important player, as are certain
European banks such as Banque National de Paris. But the largest growing
foreign community is now the Japanese who have steadily expanded their share
of commercial banking, though they have yet to move into retail banking.
They have 31 full-licensed banks, compared to 20 from the US and 15 from
China. Hong Kong officials say their presence reflects both their eagerness
to expand their Asian and Chinese business, but also a desire to escape
their toughly regulated home market.
Although it is clear that Hong Kong banking is a profitable business, part
of the difficulty of judging the health of the banking community is the fact
that none of the leading players publishes full information.
The local banks maintain secret inner reserves - though the Hongkong Bank is
likely to start making full disclosure in a couple of years - and
London-based Standard Chartered does not break out details of its Hong Kong
branches.
Their position is also protected to some extent by an cartel-like agreement
among the main banks on interest rates.
The future of this agreement is moot. Mr Purves argues that it helps to
sustain a strong and flourishing banking industry, but government officials
say it is being undermined by innovation in the market.
Now that the government has developed ways of controlling the liquidity of
the banking market, it is not needed for monetary policy reasons either.
Apart from retail banking, the main avenues where bankers see growth are in
trade finance and services related to the growing personal wealth of the
region - such as private banking and custody services. The colony's growing
links with China also hold out prospects for a wide variety of financial
services. Citibank already uses Chinese labour to process its letters of
credit in the Shenzen economic zone.
The government can be expected to encourage the growth of the banking sector
as the Hong Kong economy shifts towards becoming more services-based. Banks
currently employ about 75,000 people, and the number has been rising each
year. However the number of banks may shrink.
Some observers expect to see more mergers among the small family-owned banks
as competitive pressures increase.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (7): Slowdown reflects uncertainties -
The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a sign of the times that Hong Kong has become the slowest-growing of
the Far East's dragons.
After pushing ahead at an average of 11 per cent a year between 1986 and
1988, Hong Kong's economy grew by only 2.4 per cent last year. In his March
Budget, Sir Piers Jacobs, the Financial Secretary, forecast that growth this
year will be about 3.5 per cent, rising to an average of 5.5 per cent a year
over the first half of the decade.
This marked slowdown to levels in line with more mature economies is partly
a reflection of more uncertain times on the world markets which are so vital
to Hong Kong's economic fortunes. But it also has its cause in the colony's
own problems, particularly the uncertainties created by 1997 and a severe
labour shortage.
Like everything else in Hong Kong, the economic slowdown can be partly
traced back to the shocks created by Tienanmen Square in June 1989. The rest
of that year saw a tailing off in growth (GDP was up only 2.3 per cent), and
any recovery that might have occurred last year was quickly snuffed out by
the Gulf crisis and deepening recession in key client economies like the US
and the UK.
Domestically produced exports rose by only one per cent last year, though
this was compensated by a 16 per cent rise in re-exports (mainly goods which
have been sent for processing in China's cheap labour markets).
Slower economic growth has not, however, helped to ease Hong Kong's
straining capacity. With unemployment at a negligible 1.8 per cent, there is
an acute labour shortage which is pushing up wage levels and contributing to
an alarming rise in inflation.
The consumer price index rose by over 10 per cent in 1989 and by 9.8 per
cent last year. The forecast for this year is 9.5 per cent, but the rates in
January and February were 10.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent with further price
rises due from tax increases in the Budget. The government has tried to ease
these strains by relaxing immigration rules. But the causes have their roots
in profound structural problems which will not be solved that easily. The
monetary levers which other countries use to control inflation are not
available in Hong Kong because the currency is pegged to the US dollar.
Interest rates must be kept broadly in line with US rates.
This suggests that inflation could become an unwelcome political aggravation
for the colony's government at a sensitive time. Externally, however,
inflation is having less impact. The currency's pegged value of Dollars 7.8
against the US dollar has been holding-up well. This is mainly because Hong
Kong's exports have remained competitive with prices rising only about three
per cent, thanks largely to the extremely low labour costs available in
China's economic zones.
The immediate prospects for the economy depend on recovery in foreign
markets. Ms Elley Mao, the government's principal economist, says that the
Budget forecasts were prepared before the end of the Gulf war and may
therefore be a bit pessimistic, particularly if the US recovers faster than
expected.
But others are more cautious. Mr Alan McLean, the chief economist at the
Hongkong Bank, originally forecast 3.6 per cent growth this year. But he
says he would shave that back a bit now - 'where is the growth going to come
from?' he asks.
Longer-term judgments need to take account of deeper shifts that are taking
place in Hong Kong's economic structures. Broadly, there are three:
First, the colony is changing from a manufacturing centre to a
services-oriented economy. More and more labour intensive industry is
migrating across the border to China where workers earn USDollars 2-3 for a
12 hour day.
In 1989, manufacturing accounted for only 18 per cent of GDP compared to 67
per cent for services. Nearly two-thirds of the workforce is now in service
industries, mainly wholesale and retail trading, tourism and financial
services.
This is clearly a sign of Hong Kong's economic evolution. But it does also
increase the colony's vulnerability because service industries can take
flight much more easily than manufacturing if the political climate becomes
unpleasant.
Mr John Greenwood, chairman of GT Management, points out that the capital
inflow which boosted Hong Kong's economy in the 1970s and early 1980s has
been reversed since the Sino-British negotiations on the colony's future in
1983-84.
The huge outflow must be hitting the pace of investment. Hence its need for
big infrastructure projects like the new airport.
Second, Hong Kong is moving steadily upmarket. As any tourist shopper
quickly discovers, it is a place for high quality and, if not high, then
certainly higher prices. Street markets which once displayed cheap plastic
goods and synthetic fabrics now offer stylish designer items, silks and
top-of-the line gadgetry. The important goal now is not just to produce but
to add as much value as possible.
Third, the structure of Hong Kong's markets is changing. Despite the setback
of Tienanmen, the China factor looms steadily larger. It is estimated that
up to 2m mainland Chinese are now processing goods for Hong Kong businesses,
helping the boom in re-exports which is providing the much-needed offset for
the slump in domestically produced exports. Hong Kong-based services
companies like banks, accountants, insurers and even the stock exchange are
peddling their expertise across the border.
This is speeding a further shift in dependence away from the US which has
traditionally taken about 30 per cent of Hong Kong's production. Japan,
Germany and even East Europe are seen as promising long-term markets.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): A severe brain drain - Emigrant
total may reach 60,000 this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is suffering from a severe 'brain drain' as wealthy and
well-educated people leave the colony in search of a foreign passport. The
problem first appeared in 1987 and the numbers of emigrants has risen ever
since. This year 60,000 people are expected to leave, or more than 1,000 a
week.
They are concerned about Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997
and what it will mean for individual freedoms, prospects for their children
and living standards. Among many other reasons, some people also say they
are worried about Daya Bay, a nearby Chinese nuclear power station due to
begin operations next year.
The number of students leaving Hong Kong to study overseas has also risen
rapidly, reflecting a shortage of places in the colony as well as political
worries. Last year nearly 25,000 left for the main destinations of Canada,
the US, Australia and the UK, compared to 19,169 in 1989 and 15,026 in 1988.
Although the vast majority of these students return after completing their
studies, there are worries that once they have gone abroad they are more
likely, and more qualified, to leave Hong Kong again.
The brain drain is a major headache for companies who face high staff
turnover, dwindling employee loyalty and competitors poaching staff. In
order to cope, companies are offering higher salaries and improved training.
Larger companies are trying to organise postings overseas. Some companies
are even offering special bonuses of up to HKDollars 1m to staff staying
until after 1997.
As talented people continue to leave, there are worries overall management
standards are slipping as less experienced people are promoted to fill
senior vacancies too quickly. Higher bonuses and salaries to attract and
keep staff continue to raise operating costs and contribute to Hong Kong's
high inflation rate.
The government hopes the number of people leaving has now plateaued after a
record 62,000 people left last year. About one-in-four were professionals or
managers. The most popular destinations are Canada, Australia and the US.
The government also hopes 'insurance schemes' like a British Nationality
package, designed to give passports to 50,000 key heads of families, will
persuade people wanting to emigrate to stay in the colony longer.
The package was less well received than expected. Just over 55,000 people
applied for 32,700 passports in the largest 'general occupational' class.
Within this class, some categories - such as lawyers and translators - were
over-subscribed in the first tranche. But the important category of managers
and administrators was 10 per cent under-subscribed. The first passports
under the package are due to be handed out in June.
The US now has a similar scheme. This offers about 10,000 employees of US
companies in Hong Kong, and their families, visas which can be delayed until
2002. About 6,000 applications have been filed so far. The US has also
doubled its quota for Hong Kong migrants to 10,000 a year and this will
almost double again in 1994.
Australia, which this year expects to take 17,000 Hong Kong emigrants, does
not offer a specific package for Hong Kong employees of Australian
companies. But under existing emigration rules some emigrants can delay
taking up permanent residency in Australia for up to five years. France and
Belgium also offer smaller packages to employees of their companies in Hong
Kong.
Singapore has a scheme to attract 25,000 technicians and skilled workers and
their families. These people can delay taking up residence for five years.
So far, 17,500 families have been approved while a further 12,500
professionals have been cleared under a separate package, according to
Gordon Seow, Singapore consul in Hong Kong.
If these schemes succeed by keeping businessmen and professionals in the 30
to 40 age group, the profile of emigrants in the next few years is likely to
shift towards both younger and older people, who are less economically
active. Even so, the government does not expect the overall number of
emigrants will decline from around 60,000 a year for the next few years.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Companies seeking domicile overseas
 -Corporate Exodus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS HONG KONG people head overseas in search of a foreign passport, Hong Kong
companies are also looking abroad for their own type of 'insurance policy'.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Jardine Matheson and, two of the best-known
companies in Hong Kong, have announced plans to distance themselves from
Hong Kong. Other companies are moving legal domicile, applying for overseas
listings and investing overseas. These measures combine a desire to protect
overseas assets with a natural diversification in search of new investment
opportunities.
A total of 68 of Hong Kong's 306 listed companies have switched domicile to
places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Taking into account companies
now planning to move, bankers estimate that a third of Hong Kong's stock
market will soon be domiciled overseas.
Hongkong Bank's decision last December to set up a new holding company in
London was the most significant switch of domicile since Jardine started the
flow in 1984 and went to Bermuda. Hongkong Bank said it was moving to
reassure customers and banking partners worried about 1997.
Jardine Matheson, controlled from London by Mr Henry Keswick, is asking Hong
Kong to create a special category of 'exempt listings' for big international
companies. This would allow Jardine's shares to be traded in Hong Kong,
where they account for about 10 per cent of market turnover, while
transferring regulation of the company to London.
The proposal is being studied by the Securities and Futures Commission who
will release a public consultation paper on the subject in June or July. One
problem is that London's takeover code does not extend to foreign
incorporated companies.
Jardine's proposal has been criticised by Legislative Councillors who
accused the company of seeking special privileges and trying to avoid
takeover rules in London and Hong Kong.
No one knows how many companies could follow Jardine and switch their
primary listing overseas. But the proposal is important. If Jardine was
granted exemptions from some Hong Kong regulations, for example the takeover
code, smaller companies would press for similar exemptions and this could
undermine Hong Kong's reputation.
Other companies have sought overseas listings to raise capital and attract
new shareholders. A stronger Hong Kong's stock market this year allowed five
companies to launch rights issues in the first quarter, compared to two in
the same period last year and 10 in the first quarter of 1989.
Nevertheless, Hong Kong's volatility and low overall ratings are pressuring
some companies to go overseas - 'the likelihood of Hong Kong being an
international financial centre after 1997 is remote and that affects its
stock market,' says Stephen Clark, director of Anglo Chinese Corporate
Finance.
Gold Peak Industries, an electronics manufacturer, last year listed its
battery division on the Singapore stock market. The Singapore company is now
trading on a price earnings multiple of 18 times, compared to the holding
company's 8.3 times in Hong Kong.
Video Technology, which claims more than 50 per cent of the US market for
electronic learning aids, last year delisted from Hong Kong and is now
planning a listing in London, New York or Singapore - 'the delisting was a
purely a money decision. The price quoted in Hong Kong was undervalued,'
according to Mr William Ho, managing director.
These companies have been able to go overseas because they have foreign
markets and their own brand names. But most Hong Kong manufacturers make
products under contract for foreign companies. They would gain little from a
foreign listing because their shares would still likely be rated on a Hong
Kong multiple.
Other companies with most of their assets in Hong Kong, such as local banks,
utilities and property companies, would still be treated as Hong Kong
companies if they listed overseas. Bankers agree the majority of Hong Kong
companies therefore have to stay in the colony.
Although public listed companies will stay in Hong Kong, private money is
flowing overseas. Hong Kong Chinese have traditionally diversified their
wealth outside Hong Kong. The process has been accelerated by the brain
drain. According to some estimates, based on information from destination
countries, more than HKDollars 50bn is being invested overseas each year by
emigrants.
The corporate exodus has co-incided with natural expansion overseas by Hong
Kong companies. Companies like retail group Dairy Farm has made overseas
acquisitions because prospects for further growth in Hong Kong were limited.
Dairy Farm, an associate of Jardine Matheson, has made acquisitions in the
UK Australia and Spain. But it is one of the few examples of successful
overseas moves by Hong Kong companies.
Groups such as New World Development and Sir Yue Kong Pao's World
International have bought overseas hotel chains - Ramada and Omni,
respectively - while Mr Li Ka-shing bought Canadian oil and gas company
Husky Oil.
But, so far, none of these moves have proved successful. Some analysts argue
Hong Kong companies, designed to react quickly to business opportunities in
fast growing economies, do poorly in mature economies where management needs
to be well structured.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (4): Government feels strain - The
build-up to legislative council elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S stretched government machine, which is already having trouble
coping with the complexities of the run-up to 1997, will come under
considerably increased strains this autumn when the first-ever
directly-elected candidates take their seats in the Legislative Council.
Party politics are emerging for the first time, polarised around attitudes
to China, in readiness for the elections which take place in September. In
addition, the 18 people who are to be directly elected to the 60-person
council will constantly be performing for their constituences, electorates
and pressure groups.
These developments will break down some of the consensus traditions on which
the authority of Hong Kong's non-democratic colonial administration has been
based, and will lead to more confrontations in the council.
'It will become more difficult and time-consuming to get decisions through
Legco - and we must discover how to make that work,' says Mr Hamish MacLeod
who takes over as Financial Secretary in August. 'For me, there will be
pressures about what budgets are attainable and how to cope with possibly
unpopular issues, for example like a sales tax, which may be sensible long
term but difficult to sell in the short term'.
The September elections follow recent district board and regional council
elections, during which party politics have started to emerge.
Liberal-leaning groups that favour a faster development of democracy and are
prepared to confront Peking did better on the district boards than business
groupings and pro-Peking trade unions which want closer relations with
China. But a rough 50-50 split is expected in the legislative council
elections.
The process of democratisation was agreed last year during the final
drafting in Peking of the Basic Law that will govern the territory after
1997. China's views predominated and the council's 18 directly seats will go
up to only 20 in 1995, 24 in 1999 and 30 (50 per cent) in 2003.
The 18 this September will be elected from nine constituencies on a
first-past-the-post basis.
The rest of the 60 seats will be filled by: an appointed vice president, who
will deputise for the governor as council chairman; the government's top
three officials (the chief secretary, financial secretary and attorney
general); 17 lay government appointees; and 21 indirectly elected people
(more than half of whom are expected to be pro-government) from functional
constituencies based on business areas and occupations such as financial
services, construction and lawyers.
The proceedings will therefore still be government-dominated, despite the
expected breakdown of a governing consensus.
A currently close and almost clubbish relationship between senior
departmental secretaries and council members will be reduced because seven
secretaries will lose their existing seats and will only be present when
summoned to present policies or to account for themselves.
No governing party is envisaged in the democratisation plans because no
single party can achieve an overall majority of the seats. This is in line
with the wishes of China which dislikes the emergence of pro-democracy
parties and wants Legco merely to be an adjucnt to a powerful executive
machine which will be headed by a Peking-approved chief executive from 1997.
'We aim to exert public moral pressure so that we can stop the government
winning arguments simply by stating that it is right,' says Mr Martin Lee,
Hong Kong's most prominent politician and leader of the main pro-democracy
party.
'But the government will probably be terrified of being seen to be making
concession to us over the heads of the indirectly elected members - so there
is likely to be more confrontation when there could be consensus'.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Lively Liberal campaign - Angus
Foster highlights the two main political groupings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Democrats of Hong Kong, led by Mr Martin Lee, an outspoken
lawyer, is the colony's best-known political party.
It was formed last year from a collection of liberal pressuregroups united
by their opposition to China's Tiananmen Square crackdown. As well as
prominent leaders such as Mr Lee, university lecturer Mr Yeung Sum and
teacher Mr Szeto Wah, the party has strong grass roots support among Hong
Kong's middle class and younger voters.
In the March district board election, the party won 56 of 80 seats it
contested, leading to its claim to be Hong Kong's largest political party.
In the September elections, the United Democrats will field 14 candidates on
a populist platform calling for full democracy for Hong Kong. It will also
push for stricter environmental protection. In a bid to attract working
class voters, the party will campaign for higher public spending and oppose
the importation of foreign labour.
But the party will be attacked for being idealist, for its confrontational
stance towards China and its links with groups branded as 'counter
revolutionary' by Peking. Mr Lee and Mr Szeto were both expelled from the
Peking-appointed Basic Law Drafting Committee after their criticism of China
in 1989.
Business and conservative groups will also claim the United Democrats'
public spending policies will raise taxes. Because many of the party's
leaders are professionals, its opponents will claim they are more interested
in emigrating.
Other liberal groups contesting the elections include the Hong Kong
Democratic Foundation, Meeting Point and the Association for Democracy and
People's Livelihood. Successful candidates from these parties will probably
link up with the United Democrats to form a liberal platform in the
Legislative Council. The Democratic Foundation was founded by two prominent
legislative councillors, Dr Leong Che-hung and Mr Jimmy McGregor, a former
government official and one of the few British expatriates involved in
politics. The grouping has 360 members and will field between one and four
candidates. But Mr McGregor has decided not to recontest his seat after
falling out with his constituents.
The Foundation will push for a faster pace of democratic reform although it
sees its role as moderating between the mainstream liberals and
conservatives. But outside middle class constituencies, the Foundation will
have little support.

highlights the two main political groupings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GROUPS united by their conservatism, broad pro-China views and determination
to undermine the liberals may form an informal alliance to contest the
September elections.
The alliance includes the pro-business Liberal Democratic Federation, the
leftist Federation of Trade Unions and traditional rural interests
represented by the Heung Yee Kuk.
The grouping has the blessing of China and will claim it can influence
China's policies towards Hong Kong. The grouping is committed to maintaining
Hong Kong's stability, a by-word for conservative economic management and
minimal democratisation.
But underlying differences, for example on labour policy, prevent the groups
co-operating too closely. In some constituencies they could work well
together, for example in the working class areas of Kowloon. But in others
they will compete and, in others still, their combined influence is weak.
The Liberal Democratic Federation grew from the conservative 'Group of 89'
business lobby, formed to protect business interests when Hong Kong's Basic
Law was being drafted.
The Liberal Democrats now have over 200 members, are well-funded and are
have the backing of top business tycoons including, it is believed, Mr Li
Ka-shing. The party will field candidates for between five and eight seats.
It has the support of several Hong Kong political heavyweights, including
legislative councillor Maria Tam, a vice chairman and possible election
candidate, and prominent businessman Vincent Lo. However, other leading
businessmen who were expected to join such as Stephen Cheong and Allen Lee,
both senior legislative councillors, have so far preferred to retain their
independence rather than be linked to a party.
Despite the advantages of funding and well known leaders, the Liberal
Democrats are poorly organised. They are more used to the politics of
patronage and privilege, they enjoy scarce media access and command little
grass roots support or experience.
The pro-Peking Federation of Trades Unions (FTU) is well organised and
claims a membership of 170,000 people. But membership is split across
constituencies. Outside urban areas like Kowloon the FTU will have to seek
other supporters, according to Mr Tam Yiu-chung, FTU member and legislative
councillor.
The FTU will field two or three candidates, one of which is likely to be
prominent unionist Mr Cheng Kai-nam. In what will be one of the most high
profile races, he intends to stand against Mr Martin Lee in Island East.
The Heung Yee Kuk, representing rural interests from Hong Kong's New
Territories, could also play an important role in the elections. The Kuk has
traditionally shunned politics. But, fearing its influence is waning, it has
helped set up the 120-strong Federation for the Stability of Hong Kong.
Lau Wong-fat, chairman of the Kuk, says the new organisation could evolve
into a political party 'at some stage.'
The Kuk claims to represent 500,000 people who look to it for guidance. But
as more people have moved into the New Territories from the urban areas, it
is not known how much support the Kuk can still mobilise.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (3): Airport plan is China gateway -
Peking has forced delay on  HKDollars 100bn project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ISOLATED island of a few houses, a school, and acres of banana
plantations has become the focus of a major diplomatic confrontation with
China. Called Chek Lap Kok, it lies off Hong Kong's large hilly island of
Lantau and is the proposed site for the colony's new HKDollars 100bn (1990
prices) airport.
But it all began quite differently, and with little controversy. The basic
aim of the airport plan was - and is - economic: to enable Hong Kong to
continue to act as the main entrepot, trading and transport centre for a
large area of China by replacing the existing congested Kai Tak airport.
'The Hong Kong hinterland is roughly the same as Rotterdam's and involves
serving about 200m people,' says Dr Ted Pryor, senior planner on the
government's Port and Airport Development Strategy. This stretches far
beyond Hong Kong's immediate Pearl River Delta area, with a population of
25m and the adjacent province of Guangdong, which has 65m people.
In 1974, a HKDollars 5bn plan was drawn up by consultants to build at an
airport at Chek Lap Kok, but it was shelved after years of procrastination
in 1983 as too expensive. In 1986 Mr Gordon Wu, the extrovert and determined
head of Hopewell Holdings, a Hong Kong-based construction and development
company, sparked the government into fresh activity by putting forward a
private sector-based scheme.
Mr Wu had support from China and was backed by various large local companies
including the Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Group controlled by Mr Li
Ka-shing.
But his plan was turned down by the government which launched its own
HKDollars 127bn (at 1988 prices) PADS scheme in 1989, including a new
airport at Chek Lap Kok to be opened in 1997, plus container port facilties
to be built later.
The need for a new airport is generally recognised and is accepted by China.
Kai Tak is the sixth busiest airport in the world in terms of international
passengers - 18.7m last year - and fourth in terms of freight, handling over
800,000 tonnes last year which was 9 per cent up on 1989. Its maximum annual
capacity, with a current midnight to 6.30am curfew, is 24m passengers and
1.4m tonnes of cargo, and saturation point could be reached by the
mid-1990s.
Chek Lap Kok is designed to start with 28.6m passengers, using one runway,
and grow to a maximum of 80m passengers and 4m tonnes of cargo using two
runways round-the-clock. By 2011, planners estimate that Hong Kong will have
50m passengers and 2.6m tonnes of cargo. Consultants put the economic
disbenefits of not building the new airport, through factors such as lost
tourist traffic and business opportunities, at HKDollars 100bn by 2010.
But the estimates do not take account of the impact of two other new
airports nearby. Nor do they allow for a substantial reduction in the 5m
Taiwanese a year who currently have to fly to China via Hong Kong because
they are not allowed by their government to fly direct. There is immense
pressure in Taiwan for this ban to be lifted.
China is building a Yuan940m domestic airport at Huangtian in the special
economic zone of Shenzhen - miles by sea from central Hong Kong. Chinese
officials say it will open by the end of this year (with equipment to
operate as an international airport) and that the first of its planned two
runways will build up to 8m - 10m passengers and 185,000 tonnes of cargo a
year.
Hong Kong officials treat these claims with scepticism and put the passenger
total nearer 3m. They say that even if China switched all its Hong
Kong-China airline flights, Huangtian would only relieve Kai Tak of up to 10
per cent of its passengers and 16 per cent of its aircraft movements,
delaying Kai Tak's saturation point for 12 - 18 months to mid-1995.
On the western side of the Pearl Estuary (Hong Kong and Shenzhen are on the
east), the Portugese enclave of Macao is building a HKDollars 3.5 - 4bn
international single-runway airport which will also provide direct access to
China's adjacent special economic zone of Zhuhai.
It was scheduled to open in 1993 and originally was backed by China, but has
run into trouble with Chinese officialdom. Macao's government says it is
expected to handle 3m passengers within a couple of years of opening, but
Hong Kong officials say they do not expect it to take any of Kai Tak's major
airlines.
The full potential of these two airports to ease Kai Tak's congestion has
however never been assessed because Hong Kong has seen no reason to consult
its neighbours, let alone make them partners.
Its basic aim is to continue to dominate the region's airport business and
provide a basis for the operations of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways. It
therefore does not want to dilute its international air traffic rights,
which China has agreed should continue for 50 years after 1997.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): Peking seeks more power - A
showdown in relations with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE always had to be a bust-up. When Britain signed away its rights to
Hong Kong in December 1984 and agreed that China would resume sovereignty 13
years later in 1997, it was inevitable that a struggle for power would one
day disrupt Sinologist diplomats' dreams of a cosy handover and cast doubt
over the colony's autonomy.
It was generally assumed that the crisis would break in the early 1990s when
the proximity of the handover, perhaps combined with some upsurge in China,
would lead Peking to try progressively to supplant British rule ahead of
time.
What no-one could have guessed was that the showdown would come over
something so basically harmless - and so economically important - as an
airport. Nor could one have guessed how quickly Peking would win and that at
the same time it would attempt to encroach on the most sensitive of all
areas - the independence of the judiciary.
Yet that is that has happened in the past 18 months. Peking has forced Sir
David Wilson, the colony's governor, and Sir David Ford, the chief
secretary, to delay plans for a HKDollars 100bn international airport until
they win its agreement.
It is worried about the airport draining fiscal reserves, but it basic
demand - which Hong Kong has been opposing - is for extensive scrutiny and
consultations leading to consensus on decisions such as financial borrowings
and contracts. Hong Kong says that this would amount to control and would
cause long delays in decision-making on the airport.
It would also set a precedent for China to gain control far ahead of 1997
over economic and fiscal policy and other issues ranging from education
policy to choice of top government officials.
China has also demanded extensive rights over the choice of judges on a
planned Court of Final Appeal before and after 1997, encroaching on the
autonomy of the colony's judicial system. This is one of several items
caught up in a Sino-British Joint Liaison Group which has made little
progress with its basic work of making detailed preparations for 1997.
These moves have been made so blatantly and effectively by China that they
have confounded British sinologists, whose personal and professional creed
rests on a belief that one can do business with Peking and that deals, once
done, are honoured.
The deal in this case is the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the 1997
handover which under-pins British rule, albeit with increased consultation
as the handover approaches.
It pledges that the new post-1997 Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong
will have a 'high degree of autonomy' for the next 50 years in everything
but defence and foreign affairs, and that it will be 'vested with executive,
legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final
adjudication'.
No-where in the joint declaration, according to British experts, is there
any justification for the sort of control that China is seeking so long
before 1997 over airport decisions, nor for the influence it is demanding on
the choice of final appeal judges.
Behind China's move, it is assumed, is deep distrust of Britain as a
colonial power, plus perhaps a wish to settle 150-year-old scores for
China's perceived humiliation when Hong Kong was colonised. There is
believed to be a fear that the British, behaving like other departing
colonial powers elsewhere, will cream off the riches, leaving behind a
run-down fragile economy.
In this context, UK companies would win airport construction contracts and
so drain Hong Kong's HKDollars 72bn accumulated fiscal reserves.
Peking's 1989 Tiananmen Square crisis heightened the distrust and concern,
firstly because of the way that hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people
massed on the streets in support of China's pro-democracy students, and
secondly because the UK and Hong Kong governments then stepped in with a
morale-boosting package. That package included plans for the airport, as
well as a Bill of Rights and British passports for Hong Kong people, which
sharpened China's anger.
Peking officials then realised that the airport was the one issue they could
directly affect because franchise periods and debt repayments would not
start till 1997 or later: international investment would therefore not be
forthcoming unless China gave its backing.
China probably always intended to interfere and keep Britain in check by
demanding a measure of control in the second half of the 1984-97 transition
period, which has just begun. The airport has enabled it to do this earlier
than might otherwise have been the case.
The intention to interfere has been evident in the detailed work of the
Joint Liaison Group which has made scarcely any progress since June 1989.
Its most well-known points of deadlock concern the appointment of judges to
a new Court of Final Appeal (which is needed to replace London's Privy
Council), and Hong Kong's right to re-develop defence establishment land
before 1997.
But there has also been extremely slow progress on more mundane but
important issues such as the negotiation of new air service agreements to
replace UK-based arrangements. Only about six have been completed out of 30
that will be needed. China has also blocked progress on other issues such as
investment protection agreements, re-arrangement of hundreds of
international treaties on detailed issues.
Such stone-walling by Peking has made Hong Kong realise - not for the first
time - that it is weak when it faces a determined Chinese government.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (1): Vital factors for the future - Hong
Kong thrives when business confidence is strong, but this resilience has
been shaken recently by Peking's hardliners who are seeking more power, both
before and after the UK hands over sovereignty of the colonial territory to
China in 1997
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of Hong Kong as one of the world's great economic growth stories
depends on three primary factors: a deep-water harbour which is its only
natural resource, a population of approaching 6m largely made up of Chinese
refugees who are desperate to capitalise on their money-making skills, and a
tolerant Chinese communist government to the north which allows this
rampantly free-market British colony to do its own thing.
Together, these three factors are needed to generate the confidence for
expansion which produces the high annual rates of economic growth of 12-14
per cent achieved in the late 1980s. The result is an annual income per
capita this year of about USDollars 13,400, second only to Japan among
Asia's industrialised economies and roughly the same as Singapore.
But remove any one of the factors and confidence crumbles. The domestic will
to invest wanes, international companies look elsewhere to places like
Singapore, and speculation begins about how long it will take for Hong Kong
to decay from being the world's eleventh largest trading economy into a
glitzy multi-storey version of Shanghai.
That is what has been happening since June 1989 when China's tolerance was
dramatically altered by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people marching
in support of the student demonstrations in Peking's Tiananmen Square. Hong
Kong consequently appeared to China to be more of a subversive political
threat than an economic asset and, as a spin-off, Peking's distrust of
Britain increased.
Peking's hardliners therefore decided to step up their control of the colony
before and after the UK hands over sovereignty in 1997. This has humiliated
the government which has been forced, step by step, to accept that Peking
has a major say over a HKDollars 100bn international airport project.
Before 1989, the government saw no need to provide more than the most
cursory information on the airport to Peking. Now it has had to admit that
it can neither sustain domestic support for the project, nor raise essential
international finance, unless China gives its blessing.
That has been a hard pill for a tightly-controlled colonial regime to
swallow. Even harder is China's parallel demand for virtual agreement in
advance on all major decisions - especially all debts and obligations that
straddle the 1997 handover. Subjects such as large capital projects,
education and housing policy, and appointments of judges and top civil
servants are expected to be included.
A long-running row over these issues has delayed the airport and undermined
the authority of the government. On a broader perspective, it has also
demonstrated that China will always interfere in the territory's affairs,
and that it will do so more aggressively when Peking feels politically
threatened (as with the Tiananmen Square crisis) or when it feels that its
1997 legacy is in some way at stake.
Some Sinologists in the British foreign service cling to a dream that China
will only demand control till the British leave in 1997 and that it will
then allow the 'high degree of autonomy' it has pledged. This seems
unrealistically optimistic. There is little support in Hong Kong for a
series of confrontations - such as the airport row - during the next six
years, because China cannot lose. The UK government is also assumed to want
to avoid being constantly involved in tortuous battles with Peking.
This leads to the conclusion that it is better to tackle the problem now by
trying to allay China's fears and gain its trust by recognising its
legitimate post-1997 concerns and by involving it in decisions. Hong Kong
is, in any case, inextricably linked economically with China. This is best
illustrated by concern over the future of China's 'most favoured nation'
trading status with the US. Cancellation would hurt the colony far more than
China and would, it is estimated, wipe up to 2 per cent off annual economic
growth which is forecast to reach only 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year.
China and Hong Kong are each other's largest trading partners and China
accounts for more than 80 per cent of the colony's entrepot re-export trade.
At least 2m employees in the southern province of Guangdong carry out Hong
Kong-related work, and estimates suggest that as many as 50,000 Hong Kong
technical and managerial staff work regularly in China.
But economic links develop more easily than political and administrative
co-operation. There is a deep-seated resistance at the top of the colony's
civil service against China being allowed a say in the local affairs - and
this would have to be changed before any real co-operation could take place.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British Foreign Secretary, signalled such a a change when
he said recently that it was 'light-headed nonsense' to believe, as some
people did in Britain and Hong Kong, that Peking should be kept 'as distant
as possible'.
Involving Peking will, however, need to be done in such as way that
minimises the risk of China's bureaucratic approach slowing down economic
developments. The creation of precedents for China to interfere widely after
1997 would also need to be kept to a minimum. Such involvement seems however
to be the only solution for the future.
Hong Kong thrives when confidence is strong. As a highly flexible trading
city, it is adept at overcoming challenges and setbacks, but the confidence
will not survive a series of airport-style confrontations running up to
1997.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (6): Eastern markets expand -
Opportunity knocks for machinery makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's food equipment manufacturers can look forward to some
mouth-watering prospects in the 1990s, even if the start of the decade has
shown that - contrary to the belief of some in the industry - they are not
recession-proof.
In spite of a series of takeovers in the 1980s by the two biggest players,
APV of the UK and Sweden's Alfa-Laval, the industry remains fragmented by
different worldwide fashions in food. APV, the world leader, had sales of
Pounds 928m last year, almost all of which was in the food business, which
compares with its own estimate of Pounds 11.5bn for the world market.
But the more ambitious companies have realised for some time that the
juiciest prizes in the next few years - in eastern Europe and the Far East -
will go to those with the financial staying power and geographical spread to
match the increasingly international outlook of the big food processors.
'As the market place changes, and some of the medium-sized customers
disappear, suppliers will have to come into line,' says Mr Bo Wirsen,
president of Alfa-Laval's food business.
Until very recently, the gradual process of concentration in the industry
was characterised by horizontal integration. APV's transformation since the
mid-1980s is the clearest example: through the takeovers of Baker Perkins,
the UK bakery and confectionery equipment producer, Pasilac, a big Danish
dairy equipment maker, and Rosista, the German producer of carbonated drink
equipment, APV has doubled in size and gained the broadest product range in
the industry.
At the same time APV has made a number of smaller acquisitions, with the
principal aim, says Mr Neil French, finance director, of filling a specific
gap in the product range. These deals reflect the continuing attraction of
small companies with a strong position in a market niche.
APV nearly bit off more than it could chew, however, and Sir Peter Cazalet,
chairman, says that, with eight takeovers in 1989, it had to spend
considerable management time on handling the new arrivals. The City was
relieved to see APV make just one small acquisition in 1990, the NZDollars
8.4m (Pounds 2.88m) purchase of Moffat Appliances, a New Zealand catering
equipment producer.
Alfa-Laval has also been on the takeover trail, making six acquisitions in
its food business over the last four years, but it was its own takeover,
agreed in January, which created an important precedent for the food
equipment industry. In the industry's first significant attempt at vertical
integration Tetra Pak, the Swedish-owned milk and juice packaging group, is
paying SKr 16.25bn (Pounds 1.53bn) for Alfa-Laval, of which food equipment
is only the second biggest sector after industrial equipment.
Mr Wirsen says the deal is 'a rather logical type of integration,' but in
March the European Commission said it had 'serious doubts' about the merger
on competition grounds and announced a full inquiry.
The Commission said the combination of the two companies' products could
create or strengthen a dominant position in the EC food processing machine
sector or the packaging sector. 'Its competitors are able to provide either
food processing or packaging machines, but not both,' it said. That,
however, is debatable.
Mr Wirsen stresses that Alfa-Laval will be keen to ensure it continues to do
business with competitors of Tetra Pak and, in the short-term, co-operation
between the two companies will be limited to possible co-ordination of
marketing and servicing at the request of customers.
In the longer term, though, Mr Wirsen hopes the link-up will aid the search
for new and improved technical solutions in liquid engineering, especially
in situations where it would require the two viewpoints to spot an
opportunity.
The Alfa-Laval takeover creates two very different companies at the top of
the industry, and the split is emphasised by recent disposals at APV which
focus it even more on the core business of food processing equipment.
The medium-sized equipment suppliers running behind APV and Alfa-Laval might
be tempted to try vertical integration of their own, attracted by the
prospect of offering 'one-stop shopping' for customers.
Failing that, the traditional type of horizontal merger will still hold
sway. An example was a deal in March between two Lancashire companies which
saw Petrie and McNaught buying from Greenbank Engineering the rights to two
new processes which combine hot air and radio frequency energy to bake
foods.
It is in small, entrepreneurial companies such as these that some of the
industry's brightest ideas start, although generally the equipment producers
see themselves as a service industry responding to food manufacturers' needs
rather than shaping them. 'We don't try to second-guess our customers,' says
Sir Peter.
But rising development costs, and the need to respond more quickly and
substantially to customers' expansion plans, suggest that in the 1990s the
smaller players will increasingly be selling their ideas rather than
developing them in-house.
APV, for example, has acquired the technology to produce so-called
'Sintermatic sausages,' skinless sausages which are kept from falling apart
by coagulation of protein around the edge of the product. APV is spending
about Pounds 500,000 developing the machinery to produce these sausages,
which will save processors from buying sausage skins and even offer the
intriguing prospect of new shapes for sausages.
Small companies will also find it difficult to offer their clients
facilities that might help the larger groups win big contracts. APV's Pounds
30m-plus factory being built at Peterborough will have a research laboratory
next door with rooms where customers can use APV equipment to develop their
products.
This investment should help APV benefit from any upturn in markets currently
suffering from difficult trading conditions, such as the UK and US. The
company has undoubtedly been much harder hit by recession than its Swedish
rival: while Alfa-Laval's food business lifted profits by 50 per cent last
year to SKr357m, APV suffered a 34 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 40.2m.
The discrepancy partly reflects the fact that Alfa-Laval has concentrated on
fewer customer segments and made more progress than its UK rival in
assimilating its acquisitions and introducing operating efficiencies.
But APV is catching up, and Sir Peter is encouraged by prospects in the UK,
which suggest that the current reluctance by customers to commit to orders
is due to short-term economic factors.
In the long-term, two key factors justify the industry's optimism. In
western markets, the maturity of the food industry will encourage a
never-ending search for new ideas, and that will normally produce orders for
new equipment.
According to a report in February by Frost &amp; Sullivan, greater demand for
snack and thermoformed pack foods is likely to boost European sales of form,
fill and seal machines from Dollars 720.5m in 1989 to Dollars 1.18bn by
1995.
The largely untapped markets of the Third World and eastern Europe provide
the second big opportunity for the western equipment manufacturers. In the
Third World, Mr French hopes that the next decade will see countries
achieving the level of GNP where processed food takes over from more basic
fare.
Eastern Europe has already produced a few significant orders, notably APV's
Pounds 50m contract in 1989 for ten breakfast cereal lines in the Soviet
Union and a similarly-sized deal won by Alfa-Laval to provide ten margarine
plants. However, although democratisation in eastern Europe has brought more
inquiries, it has yet to be matched by much business, says Mr Wirsen.
The problem, of course, is money. In eastern Germany, however, German
financing is available and APV hopes to take advantage of this by selling
equipment made by western German subsidiaries.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (7): When waste is the issue -
Surplus packaging becomes a liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this year, a group of activists from the Women's Environmental
Network went into the Islington branch of J Sainsbury, ripped off the
'excess' packaging on several items and dumped it at the supermarket's
check-outs.
Whether retailers and food manufacturers like it or not, packaging has
become a hot environmental concern because of its high visibility and
seeming wastefulness.
Supermarket chains have been quick to pick up on the mood and have launched
a variety of projects to seize the initiative. The Institute of Grocery
Distribution, a trade association for food manufacturers and retailers, has
set up an Industry Policy Issues Council, one of whose functions is to
examine what its members can jointly do to tackle environmental concerns.
Individual supermarket chains have also started schemes to encourage better
use of packaging materials and recycling. One of the most interesting of
these has been a pledge by Gateway that within five years it would cut by
half the energy consumption of the packaging passing through its 725 stores.
Mr Iain Wolsey, Gateway's marketing director, says this will involve
'painful changes' in the way that the company conducts its business. But he
adds: 'We have to solve this problem otherwise someone else will solve it
for us.'
Last year, Gateway asked the Landbank Consultancy, an environmental advisory
group led by Mr Bryn Jones, a former chairman of Greenpeace, to study ways
in which the company could improve its activities with regard to the
environment.
The consultancy drew up a report on the relative harmfulness of various
packaging materials which will now form the basis of Gateway's action
programme.
Mr Jones says the report would prove controversial but that he wishes to
stimulate a debate about the use of packaging materials.
'We want to talk to all the industries involved to see if we made any
mistakes. There are substantial environmental benefits to be gained from
discussing these issues together,' Mr Jones says.
The report studied various packaging materials and ranked them according to
environmental performance. It attached penalty points to different materials
depending on the degree of harmfulness to the environment.
The report listed the packaging materials which were least harmful to the
environment in the following order: re-usable glass, paper, laminates,
non-returnable glass, tinplate, aluminium and plastics.
The most important factor in determining environmental harmfulness was the
amount of energy a packaging material consumed throughout its entire life
cycle, from production to disposal.
On this scale, non-returnable glass and aluminium were considered highly
undesirable materials while paper and laminates scored well.
However, the bleach used in paper manufacturing, which is damaging to the
environment, and the difficulty of recycling laminates counted heavily
against these materials in other categories.
Other factors taken into consideration were the environmental costs of
extracting raw materials, the pollution caused in manufacturing the
products, and the ease with which they could be recycled.
The report went on to identify several ways in which Gateway could achieve
this reduction in energy use and proposed a 10 point programme that it
should follow.
It suggested that Gateway could encourage packaging companies to reduce the
volume of material by designing new forms of packaging or using different
materials. It could also encourage new delivery and collection systems for
its products, promote recycling and waste management schemes and use
re-usable or returnable containers more widely.
The Landbank consultancy urged Gateway to initiate a widespread debate on
environmental issues, both within its own company and within the retailing
and packaging companies generally.
Ms Penny Walker, a recycling campaigner for Friends of the Earth, says the
report makes an interesting contribution to the debate on packaging issues
and she highlights two particular aspects which have not generally been
considered in the debate.
First, she says the report placed considerable emphasis on the effects of
material extraction on habitats and species. 'What it attempts to do is to
look at the direct impact on sensitive habitats like rain forests.'
So, for example, aluminium scored badly because of the environmental damage
that its extraction causes.
The second area was the report's emphasis on the re-usability of packaging.
'The retailers' biggest problem is going to be to make the necessary leap of
the imagination to use refillable containers.'
Such containers could be used for drinks or for cosmetics, such as those
used at Body Shop, which are packaged in refillable plastic bottles.
Mr Tony Baldry, a junior environment minister who was present at the launch
of the Gateway initiative, welcomed the move saying it would provide a
'useful lead in the direction we all want to go'.
And he warned that unless other companies demonstrated their willingness to
act on environmental issues then the Government would consider further
action to compel them along the route.
The food industry will also face increasing pressure from Europe to set high
environmental standards as the Commission is currently drawing up a
packaging directive, due to be published in the autumn, which looks as
though it will set stiff recycling requirements.
The Germans have already taken a decisive lead in this area and its
parliament recently passed a tough law on waste management which requires
industry to take back and re-use 80 per cent of packaging materials by 1995.
The environmental trend is clear. Food manufacturers and retailers ignore it
at their peril.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (4): Carnivores lose ground -
Vegetarianism loses its 'cranky' image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VEGETARIAN food is losing its 'cranky' image in the UK, up to a point. As
more Britons eat less meat, food manufacturers and supermarkets are
expanding their vegetarian ranges.
But their marketing strategy demonstrates conclusively that the target
audience is not so much professed vegetarians, although their numbers
continue to grow, as the much larger number of omnivores seeking a
healthier, more varied diet.
In most cases, manufacturers whisper rather than shout the vegetarian nature
of their food. Vegetarians, after all, are accustomed to checking labels
carefully, while the biggest potential for growth is among consumers whose
eating habits may have evolved more quickly than their self-image.
Marketing Strategies for Industry estimates that 5.6m Britons, or 10 per
cent of the population, now at least have eliminated red meat from their
diets. Of these, 2.2m are believed to be lacto-ovo-vegetarians (eating dairy
products and eggs) or vegans (eating no animal products). According to Mr
Nigel Phillips, marketing director of Haldane Food Group, one of the largest
independent vegetarian food manufacturers with annual sales of Pounds 25m,
9m Britons eat vegetarian meals three or more times a week. It is no
surprise that the restaurant menu without specified vegetarian options is
now the exception.
In 1990, MSI says, UK sales of specialist vegetarian foods, conservatively
defined to include vegetarian grills, ready meals, quiches and flans and
cheddar cheese, soya and tofu products, vegetable stock and free-range eggs,
reached Pounds 335m.
Broader definitions, including vegetarian staples such as vegetables,
pulses, nuts, pasta and rice, would take the total to well over Pounds 1bn,
but would distort the figures, says MSI.
However, the most important pointer to the future is the fact that more
children than adults are vegetarian.
The slow extinction of the 'family meal' because of changing lifestyles and
the microwave revolution means that children now often have more freedom to
choose their food from an early age.
'The growth market by far is the younger generation,' says Mr Phillips.
'Virtually every family will have a vegetarian in it. Generally it's a
teenager and it's a girl.'
But young vegetarians often share tastes with meat-eating peers, and they do
not necessarily want 'adult' food.
This factor was central to the development of one of Haldane's newer
products, the 'No Bull Burger', which looks and tastes like meat, according
to Mr Phillips. It was launched, by coincidence, at the height of public
concern about bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 'mad cow disease.'
Haldane had planned a meat-less burger because burgers remained a growth
market, and teenagers, the single largest vegetarian group, ate 80 per cent
of burgers in Britain.
The company also knew it had to appeal to eyes as well as appetites, so it
consulted 35 discussion groups combining meat-eating and vegetarian
teenagers about not only the product but also about the packaging.
The appeal to teenagers is evidence of a perceived division between two
categories of vegetarian consumers. 'Hardened' vegetarians, Mr Phillips
says, do not want anything which looks or tastes of meat, but the growth
market is in meat analogues, despite the memory of early 'cardboard-tasting'
versions of textured vegetable protein (TVP).
The highest profile meat subsitute is Quorn, a mycoprotein - distantly
related to the mushroom - made by continuous fermentation and marketed by
Marlow Foods, an Imperial Chemical Industries-Ranks Hovis McDougall joint
venture. It is sold both in ready meals and, more recently, on its own.
Mr Ralph Pickles, Marlow's managing director, argues that early TVP flopped
because it was marketed, cheaply, as a meat extender, and failed to deliver
its promise on taste. 'People don't want cheap food, they want good quality
food at a sensible price. Repeat purchases depend on taste.' Two thirds of
people who tried Quorn were buying it again.
Quorn's packaging says 'suitable for vegetarians' only in small letters.
'Our market research tells us that if we make that too prominent', Mr
Pickles explains, 'it labels it as a vegetarian product which for a large
part of the population, marks it out as unsuitable', largely on taste
expectations.
Other manufacturers share this ambivalence, as illustrated by their lukewarm
approach to the Vegetarian Society's green V seal of approval. To earn it, a
product must meet various criteria and the maker pays a negotiated annual
licence fee.
Among the brands which carry the seal on some products are Heinz, Baxters,
Marmite and Golden Wonder. However, other manufacturers, including
vegetarian specialists, find it unnecessary or even counter-productive. Mr
Phillips of Haldane, for example, says: 'It is very expensive to put a V
symbol on everything.' The length of time required for approval also
inhibits manufacturers who are trying to bring out new products in
competitive markets. He believes Haldane's reputation is well enough
established to obviate the need for the symbol. It may be more important for
manufacturers associated with meat products to pay for the symbol to
guarantee that a specific product is vegetarian.
But Dalepak Foods, which made its name in formed-meat grillsteaks but
diversified into chopped-vegetable-and-rice grills a few years ago, has not
felt the need to emphasise the vegetarian nature of the latter.
Marlow's Quorn would not qualify for the V symbol in any case, since it is
not made with free-range eggs, although Mr Pickles says: 'We would be very
happy to use free-range eggs in our product if they were available.'
It appears certain that meat will play a decreasing role in the British diet
 -at least as a routine fuel, it may still be associated with special
occasions for many people.
But the commitment required to become a vegetarian rather than just eating
vegetarian much of the time means it will probably continue to be a quiet
revolution.
This explains why Mr Phillips and his counterparts pay so much attention to
the younger generation. 'If you become vegetarian, 90 per cent of the time
you remain vegetarian.'

Safety Standards

WHAT is the air temperature inside your domestic refrigerator? How long is
it safe to use cooked meats after the 'use by' date? And how should you cook
frozen food in your microwave oven?
Such are the questions the food manufacturers and retailers throw back at
consumers accused of being responsible for outbreaks of salmonella and
listeria. But although many believe that food scares are frequently the
result of consumer misuse, it is the food industry that is being forced to
clean up its act.
Strict new regulations introduced this year put the onus on food producers
to ensure that when the consumer takes the goods off the supermarket shelf,
or orders them in a restaurant, they are wholesome.
Following the introduction Britain in January, food companies - from the
largest biscuit -maker or supermarket chain to the humblest take-away cafe -
now have to demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable precautions and
shown 'due diligence' in manufacture, transportation, storage and
preparation of foodstuffs. And last month () strict regulations governing
the temperature at which foods such as cheeses and cooked meats can be
stored also came into effect.
In spite of the new regulations, many question whether the consumer will be
better off. The regulations will only be effective if they can be adequately
policed - the job of local health officials.
For the environmental health inspectors there are two problems to overcome,
says Steve Bassam, leader of Brighton council and an assistant secretary for
food and environmental health at the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities. To begin with, he says, there is not enough money allocated to
the appropriate departments of local authorities to police the system
thoroughly.
Although the government allocated Pounds 30m from central coffers to smooth
the introduction of the new legislation, those responsible for implementing
the regulations believe Pounds 40m-45m would have been more appropriate.
Secondly, there are too few qualified environmental health officers and
technical assistants to do the job - a shortfall of 1,000 to 1,500 - and
local councils are having problems in recruiting the appropriate staff.
Despite the increase in regulations, many detractors argue the government
has given the food industry a loophole through which it can avoid
prosecution. Previously, if a fly was found in a can of baked beans then the
company was at fault: now, showing they have taken precautions to prevent
such an eventuality - shown 'due diligence' - could mean they are let off
the hook.
The manufacturers, however, take a very different view, says David Edwards,
operations director of the food Hygiene Bureau, a commercial test house and
training organisation. 'They see the new law as an extra commitment, not an
extra defence,' he says.
One difficulty is that what due diligence means has still to be determined
in court, making it difficult for manufacturers and retailers to gauge what
precautions are necessary.
Previously, for example, a large supermarket chain which sold branded
biscuits relied on a guarantee from the biscuit-makers that their products
were wholesome.
If a problem arose the consumer was referred back to the manufacturer. Now,
supermarkets cannot rely on this guarantee, but need to check suppliers'
working practices themselves. Just how far back into the manufacturing chain
they will have to check is unclear. As David Thurston, senior legal officer
with the Sainsbury's chain, puts it, 'Nobody knows if we have to vet Kellogs
before we can sell their cornflakes.'
For the smaller retailer, or the smaller restaurant, such a task would be
economically impossible.
To ensure protection under the law many large manufacturers are putting
quality control procedures into place. Many are turning to the British
Standards Institution's BS 5750 certification, which has been adapted for
food processing companies to enable the monitoring of processes, machinery
and training. So far, however, fewer than 100 companies out of the thousands
of UK food producers have been certified under the scheme.
Smaller companies are investigating more specific testing procedures such as
HACCP - hazard analysis and critical control point tests.
These focus on the most critical element of a food process and ensure that
it is carried out correctly. In a canning process, for example, heating the
produce to the right temperature might by the critical element of the
process.
Technology is also playing its part with a variety of tests and procedures
under development or available to help demonstrate due diligence, both in
processing and temperature control. These include:
Tagging systems designed to reassure the consumer that the food has been
stored at the right temperature, such as the Fresh-Check indicators already
widely-used in the US. The indicator is a circle in the centre of which is a
polymer dot, which darkens when exposed to heat. If the central dot is
lighter than the outer circle the contents are fresh: if darker then the
packet has been 'thermally abused'.
Many supermarket chains are investigating this sort of labelling system for
use in distribution. If one label was put on the top of a dispatch of cooked
ham, for example, it could indicate if the whole consignment had been stored
at the correct temperature.
Edible inks which could be used to print the 'use by' dates, on to the food
itself, rather than on the wrapper. This would prevent unscrupulous food
retailers from unwrapping products that had passed their 'use by' date -
pork pies, for example - and selling them on the delicatessen counter.
Rapid biological tests, to determine whether bacteria are present in the
food manufacturing chain. Today, most tests involve sending away samples or
growing them in a laboratory, which can take days. By the time a problem is
discovered the food could be on the consumers' plate. Within three years
tests could be available to spot bacterial problems before the food leaves
the factory.
Computer systems to help maintain appropriate records. Pace, of Moira,
Northern Ireland, for example, has developed a software package which
handles product specification, auditing of suppliers, calibration of
machinery and training.
All should help manufacturers and retailers ensure their products are
wholesome. It is then the consumer's job to ensure they are properly cooked.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (3): Mitsubishi's exotic palate
 -A takeover with a difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCES, based in Liverpool for more than a century, is as British as fish
paste and tinned salmon.
After two years under Japanese ownership, none of that has changed, although
Princes is now also as Italian as conchiglie pasta and as Danish as
marinated herring.
What Princes does not betray, so far at least, is any trace of a Japanese
accent either in its management style or its product range. Perhaps more
interestingly, Mitsubishi Corporation's acquisition of Princes in January
1989 was not the bellwether for a flock of similar Japanese purchases.
When Nestle sold Princes to Mitsubishi in January 1989, the transaction was
widely hailed as one of the first Japanese acquisitions in the European food
industry. What is remarkable more than two years later is that it has
remained a singular event; there has been no comparable deal since then.
The reasons remain hard to fathom, although all takeover activity has waned
in the European food market since then.
Mr Jim Grover of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, London-based food and drink
specialists, suggests Japanese buyers are very brand-conscious but have been
inhibited by high asking prices.
Mitsubishi was Princes' third owner in less than a year. Buitoni, the
Italian pasta manufacturer, had bought Princes from J Bibby &amp; Sons, the
industrial and agricultural group, in the 1970s, to marry authentic foreign
food in a fast-growing sector with traditional, but mature, British
products.
But the Buitoni family sold out to Mr Carlo De Benedetti in 1984. When he
could not generate enough growth out of the business, he sold it to Nestle
of Switzerland in 1988.
When Nestle unpacked its shopping basket after the deal, it decided that
Princes' collection of tinned products, even though it carried one of the
largest grocery brands in Britain, really was not worth shelf space in its
pantry.
The emergence of Mitsubishi as the ultimate buyer raised belief in itself at
Princes, according to Mr Stephen Clegg, marketing director. 'Mitsubishi
bought Princes not because it was part of a package but because they really
wanted it.'
Princes already did business with Mitsubishi in a small way; the Japanese
company's tuna-canning plant in Mauritius was one of its suppliers. A
coincidence, Mr Clegg said.
Two years on, Princes retains considerable operating autonomy within the
group. There is little hands-on involvement from the parent company.
Princes' board has only one Japanese member, Mr Tak Akiyoshi, co-ordinating
director, who handles communications between Liverpool and Tokyo.
Princes, which has only one employee based outside the UK, does tap into
Mitsubishi's global network for weather forecasts, help on commodity trading
and information on product sourcing. However, it retains full responsibility
for all decisions, including quality control, says Mr Clegg.
Quality control and security of supply are central to the success of
Princes, whose modus operandi would be recognisable to its founders, a Mr
Simpson and a Mr Roberts, who began to import tinned salmon and lobster from
Canada in 1880.
With expected turnover of more than Pounds 200m this year, Princes is still
overwhelmingly an importer of canned goods. Its only UK-manufactured
products are meat and fish spreads and pasta sauces, made in Southport.
Together they account for only 4 per cent of turnover by volume and 6 per
cent by value.
'Our strength is our sourcing,' says Mr Clegg. 'Unless you're able to source
from a wide variety of locations, you can be caught out.' It now buys
products from 40 countries and works closely with suppliers to improve their
standards.
Crab meat, for example, used to be imported from North America. But costs
rose so much that Princes had to shift to Thailand, where it persuaded
suppliers to wrap the crab meat in parchment within the tins to prevent
discoloration.
Similarly, as South African fruit became less politically acceptable,
Princes turned to Greece for its tinned peaches. It found, however, that
quality often failed to come up to scratch, so it worked with five canners
to improve the selection of fruit and the printing and affixing of labels.
The need to ensure that its tuna is caught in a 'dolphin-friendly' manner,
without the use of high seas drift nets, made Princes impose tough standards
on all canneries it uses around the world. None can handle drift-netted tuna
at any time if it wants to keep Princes' business.
Some of Princes' leading suppliers do not need any external pressure to
reach or maintain standards. The Dutch company Van der Laan makes its canned
meats, a market in which Princes is the UK brand leader even though it
entered it only in 1982, and Saeby Fiske in Denmark supplies mackerel and
herring.
New products are critical for growth because so many of Princes' old
favourites are in mature or declining sectors. UK demand for fish and meat
pastes, for example, has halved in the past 10 years, and neither Princes
nor its rivals is committing much effort to reversing the trend or fighting
for market share. 'One of the characteristics of this market is inertia,'
comments Mr Clegg. 'I hesitate to call it loyalty.'
Princes is focusing on creating new segments and niches in growth markets.
Tiny pots of fishpaste may be out of favour, but Princes has launched
chilled spreads and slicing sausages.
It is becoming difficult, moreover, to find Princes herring or mackerel that
has not been adorned with an 'added value' sauce. The old-established Trex
brand of vegetable shortening has been opened as an umbrella over a new
International Collection* of exotic oils like pistachio and toasted sesame.
The latter, again by coincidence, is supplied by Mitsubishi.
The exit from Buitoni left Princes with a gap in its portfolio because
retailers had come to identify it with a range of authentic Italian food. It
now imports pasta made by Federici, a century-old family-owned company in
Umbria, and makes sauces under the Federici name in Southport.
It might seem that another entrant is the last thing needed in a pasta
sauces market fiercely contested by industry giants such as Unilever (Ragu),
Mars (Dolmio) and Nestle (Buitoni) and private label producers. But Mr Clegg
sees a role for Federici's pasta-and-sauces package among more timid
shoppers: 'Less assured consumers have a desire for authenticity.'
There is no doubt, in any case, that Mitsubishi got the real thing, in terms
of a solid and growing UK grocery brand, when it acquired Princes. And it
made clear from the beginning that it would back the right European deals
with deep pockets.
Mr Clegg is unperturbed by the lack of action since then, knowing his
Japanese parent is playing a patient hand but will not hesitate when the
time comes. Mitsubishi has a saying: 'If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
today.' The European food industry should keep its eyes peeled for that
signal.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (2): Border raiders in action -
Europe remains ripe for mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
TRANQUILITY, it would appear, has returned to the mergers and acquisitions
scene in the European food industry. Gone are the mega-deals that peaked
with the Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out of Nabisco in late 1988. The
fantastic prices companies paid as the Nabisco businesses were auctioned
off, and others deals that followed, are also only fond memories for the M&amp;A
specialists.
But the lack of headline-grabbing deals, with the notable exception of
Philip Morris's purchase of Jacobs Suchard last June, is misleading. While
many of the largest and most obvious targets for acquisitive food
manufacturers have now been bought or are not for sale, there continue to be
numerous middle sized deals reflecting multi-national and smaller company
enthusiasm for Europe.
Not all the excitement is to do with the arrival of a single market in 1992.
Unilever, United Biscuits and Kellogg are among companies which had
recognised how ripe continental Europe was for concentration even before the
promise of greater cross-border trade.
Compared with the huge but maturing US market, where competitive stalemate
is looming, some product areas retain significant growth potential.
In the Pounds 3bn snack market, for instance, less than half the market is
controlled by the four major players. And Europeans are consuming sometimes
as little as half as many biscuits, snacks and soft drinks as Americans.
Forecasters such as Mark Lynch, of Warburg Securities suggest this market
will grow 27 per cent in volume over the next five years and probably more
in value terms.
These groups' new emphasis on Europe is already showing on the bottom line.
In 1990, sales at CPC, the US food group, for example, grew 12 per cent
worldwide but by 41 per cent in Europe partly as a result of its acquisition
from SmithKline Beecham of the Marmite, Bovril and Ambrosia businesses.
'The single Europe act is a real opportunity and a chance to restructure
especially in the area of sourcing,' says Morris Tabaksblat, the main board
director who chairs Unilever's food executive.
Last year, Unilever provided Pounds 305m before tax to streamline businesses
in Europe where it has 60 per cent of its food sales. The opportunity to
supply regional markets from large manufacturing centres instead of
artificial national markets from within their own borders will lead to
economies of scale on production and distribution, Tabaksblat says.
United Biscuits has similar plans to Unilever's and hopes to double Europe's
share of its trading profit to 12 per cent by 1995. Its failure to beat BSN
of France to Nabisco's biscuit and snacks business was a setback but the
Pounds 168m it spent buying businesses in Europe last year nevertheless
helped make it the continent's second largest biscuit maker.
In a less dramatic way these investments should lead to margin improvement
through the elimination of independent distributors and more efficient
manufacturing.
Cadbury Schweppes' recent Pounds 122m purchase of Oasis and Gini bottling in
Belgium from Perrier Sources, and its distribution agreement with
Apollinaris Brunnen, Germany's largest mineral water company, shows a
similar desire for critical volume in the drinks market.
The bout of investment by US and European groups is likely to lead in
two-three years to another wave of unbundling, similar to the sale of
Nabisco's biscuit and snacks business to BSN and Pepsico's purchase shortly
afterwards of Nabisco's UK snacks business.
'After a period of indigestion the companies will want to get back to real
areas of strength,' says Jim Grover, a director of OC&amp;C Strategy
Consultants. 'It is going to be increasingly difficult to be a follower
without strong brands.'
Hand in hand with the lower-key merger and acquisition activity has been an
increased focus on joint ventures and distribution arrangements. Some of
these are more permanent than others.
Cereal Partners, the 1989 link between General Mills of the US and Nestle of
Switzerland, was seen as so strong that Ranks Hovis McDougall, previously
second only to Kellogg in the UK, sold out in June last year to the
newcomer.
Others partnerships, such as Borden of Germany's link with the Hungarian
state-owned bakery, Favarosi Sutoipari Vallalat, arise from the
peculiarities of operating in emerging eastern European economies.
Yet others deals, in particular joint distribution agreements, are more
likely to conceal a Trojan horse. They are useful while the partners gain
experience of each others' markets but require a kind of discipline that
rarely lasts.
Differences of approach frequently lead to one partner taking out the other,
as when Unilever in March bought the remaining 50 per cent of
Margarinefabrikken Alfa Solo, a Danish producer of margarine, that it did
not own already.
These deals appear to be a kind of half-way house in the slack phase of the
acquisition cycle. But they may become less noticeable once acquisitions
resume. And resume they will. 'The next 10 years will bring big M&amp;A activity
in Europe like in the US in the last 10 years,' says Tabaksblat.
So what of the European market potential for smaller companies? 'It will be
OK for the own label manufacturers as suppliers to the retail trade,' says
Mr David Lang who heads Henderson Crosthwaite SP food team. 'It is the
in-between company brand manufacturer that is threatened.'
Those without strong market positions in a country or who are small in the
European context and are unable to tap economies of scale might consider
divesting weaker brands unless they can dramatically and rapidly increase
their size, agrees Grover.
Own label producers, who are enjoying growth in the UK away from the brand
battles, will have to wait longer in Europe, says Mr Christopher Haskins,
the chairman of Northern Foods.
Even more sophisticated European retailers such as France's Carrefour remain
far behind the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury in the UK in terms of central
ordering or stock control.
'While we cannot find retailers like Marks and Spencer and Safeway the
opportunities for fresh food are limited,' he says. With the opening of the
Channel tunnel, delivery of fresh food overnight from Rotherham to
Dusseldorf would be feasible as long as German retailers agreed to encourage
the new market.
So what of the direct effect of 1992 on product harmonisation and changes in
taste? Most analysts believe the next wave of acquisitions will have little
immediate impact on harmonising consumer taste.
Weaning the French from their local patisserie or the Belgians off their
Godiva chocolates is considered by food experts to be a long term project.
Some branded goods will travel the continent but in terms of the
Euro-sausage or the standardised Euro-Bagette, 1992 is still a long way off.

FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (1): An appetite for growth -
Europe's makers and distributors of food, with sales of Dollars 600bn a
year, are licking their lips at the prospect of a single market. But the
continent's gastronomic diversity should ensure that the day of the
homogenous 'Eurosausage' will never dawn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER the acquisition binge in the late 1980s, the European food industry
was bound to pause for digestion.
Recession and fewer obvious large takeover targets meant the chances of
another NJR Nabisco buyout and break-up last year were remote. But the large
players such as Nestle, Unilever, Philip Morris and BSN which fought over
morsels during the Dollars 25bn Nabisco feast are far from replete.
True to the best gastronomic traditions, they are merely enjoying un trou
normand - a breather to cleanse their palates before they tuck into another
course of takeovers and unbundlings.
While the size of European takeovers may never be the same again, numerous
smaller deals in the past year suggest the Dollars 600bn European food
market is nevertheless changing at a rapid pace. New names are emerging:
Cereal Partners in breakfast cereals; old names are popping up in new
sectors - BSN in biscuits in the UK and Mars in ice cream; and old players
are bowing out in the face of competition - Ranks Hovis McDougall in
cereals.
The most obvious change in the last year is the recession that has struck
most markets to a varying degrees. After a decade in which food
manufacturers enjoyed both strong margin and profit growth, their 'recession
proof' tags are now being severely tested.
By and large they appear to be living up to their reputation, says David
Lang, who heads Henderson Crosthwaite's food team. 'The recession looks bad
but feels OK,' he says.
Not only does the industry appear to be holding its own, but the sharp fall
in consumer spending has brought surprisingly few signs even of trading
down, according to Christopher Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, one
of the largest suppliers of fresh food to Marks and Spencer. 'The high
street has been hit but fresh food sales are holding up partly because the
restaurant trade is suffering and people are eating more at home,' says
Haskins.
A similar picture emerges from continental Europe, where recession has
bitten less deeply but food again appears among the last items cut from
shopping lists.
Looking beyond recession, the industry's biggest challenge remains the
single market in 1992. Manufacturers have tempered early optimism, which at
its most unrealistic envisaged a homogenous market of 320m people emerging
almost overnight. They are now most excited by the chance to shake up the
way they source and distribute products.
For the first time, says Morris Tabaksblat, the chairman of Unilever's food
executive, large markets will be supplied from fewer plants that are no
longer constrained within national borders. There should be no reason why
Nestle, for example, should not ship Findus fish fingers from Grimsby on
Humberside as far afield as Sicily (Sicilian tastes permitting).
But these opportunities may only be enjoyed by the likes of Nestle, BSN of
France, Unilever and Philip Morris, some analysts say.
What does an 'enlarged' Europe hold for smaller and medium sized companies
which do not have sector-leading brands and lack the muscle of their bigger
competitors?
'Most category followers are too broadly based,' says Jim Grover, a director
of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants. 'The number one in a brand can spend huge
amounts on advertising support and the retailers are increasingly
discriminating against weaker brands in terms of pricing and listing. For
sector followers, life is tough.'
Just how tough it can be for 'followers' - and why companies are likely to
continue paying fancy prices for strong brands - is demonstrated in the
recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into Nestle's dominant
position in soluble coffee.
The report absolved Nestle of any wrong doing but nevertheless showed its
return on capital for coffee was 114 per cent. Its nearest rival, General
Foods, earned 29 per cent and the third player, Lyons Tetley, a mainly own
label supplier, earned only 10 per cent, the report showed.
Smaller companies with weaker brands in the enlarged European market as well
as in domestic markets may have to shrink and play to their strengths in
order to survive, says Grover.
An example of a group concentrating on its strongest suit is the recent sale
by Bahlsen, the German biscuits group, of its Gubor subsidiary to Hershey
Foods, the largest US chocolate confectioner.
Even mighty Unilever appears to have recognised its relative weakness in the
manufacture of meat pies when it sold a Mattessons Wall's factory to
Northern Foods earlier this year.
While unbundlings, such as these, may be limited in scope and number at the
moment, a new wave of European food industry demergers is on its way. More
businesses will be put up for sale and each market sector will see fewer and
fewer players, says Henderson Crosthwaite's Lang.
More immediately, food manufacturers may already be stumbling on to a
rockier path after the smooth ascent of profits and margins in the late
1980s. Some analysts see recent results from Dalgety and United Biscuits as
the first signs of the harder times.
First of all, many markets and product categories are mature in northern
Europe. Secondly, the easiest cost savings have already been made. And,
perhaps most significantly, manufacturers are facing an increasingly
sophisticated and powerful retail trade.
Here again size talks; the Nestle coffee salesman is unlikely to have to
fight the retailer for shelf space or margin. But retailers are beginning to
limit the number of suppliers they deal with and are increasingly trying to
claw back margin from weaker brands, says Grover.
Sophisticated store checkout systems and central distribution networks are
also helping reduce the stock levels retailers hold - effectively forcing
the food manufacturers to hold stock for them. Tesco, for example, has
halved the amount of stock it carries over the past five years.
In continental Europe, no such sophistication exists even in the large
retailers such as France's Carrefour, where local ordering and distribution
remains the norm.
One obvious way the industry will overcome these constraints on growth is to
continue to innovate. Ten years ago, who would have given fresh pre-prepared
meals much of a chance? But this market was made by technological advances
that led to shorter production runs, rapid information transfer from store
to factory and advances in bug detection.
Mars's formidably successful transfer of its Mars bar brand to ice cream
suggests the industry has plenty of resourcefulness up its sleeve.
The industry will also capitalise on changes in habits and taste. 'In
Northern Europe, quality improvements and a drive towards convenience foods
will keep the momentum of growth going,' says Unilever's Tabaksblat.
As tastes change it is not always clear whether the consumer is leading the
manufacturer or vice versa. Consumers by and large remain conservative but
there is a role for manufacturers to lead with new products, as Mars ice
cream experience shows.
In general, though, manufacturers will be following or leading a trend
towards value and safety combined with convenience and variety, according to
the Leatherhead Food Research Association.
Food will increasingly be bought and marketed for its perceived health
benefits, although manufacturers believe that the pure 'green' market will
remain a small part of the total market.
There will be a continuing decline in the use of preservatives, emulsifiers
and stabilisers while tins will give way to frozen and fresh food.
And following the Food Safety Act's implementation in January, manufacturers
will be increasingly anxious to raise safety standards. This is already
creating a whole new market for suppliers of food monitoring equipment that
can be installed on high speed production lines.
As if all this was not already enough for Europe's food industry, they are
also aware of the increasing interest shown by US giants anxious to spread
beyond their mature markets. Looking at the already crowded dinner table,
they must be counting their blessings that the Japanese have yet to develop
a real appetite for Europe.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Indian parties fear prospect of hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN politicians increasingly accept that the formation of a new
government after the election could be a difficult and protracted affair.
India needs to get a new government into place as rapidly as possible after
polling, which takes place from May 20-26, to prepare a new budget and
negotiate an estimated Dollars 5bn loan from the International Monetary
Fund.
The postponement of the budget in February resulted in a sharp drop in
India's creditworthiness abroad and the risk of a default on its debt.
However, all political parties now accept that the election is likely to
result in a hung parliament with no party obtaining an absolute majority.
The two significant trends to have emerged so far in the campaign are that
the Hindu radical BJP party is gaining ground in the north while the
Congress party is slipping.
The Janata Dal party of the former prime minister, Mr V P Singh, has dropped
badly behind - though the regional partners in his National Front coalition
and the Marxist parties with which he is allied are helping to bolster his
strength.
A further trend that has emerged is the widespread disenchantment with
political parties.
More than 30 per cent of a recent sample survey in the north said they did
not know how they would vote or that they would abstain.
According to unofficial forecasts here, Mr Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party
could obtain about 220 seats of the 520 contested. This is more than the 197
seats Congress won in the present parliament, but below the 270 many in the
party hoped for at the beginning of the campaign.
If present trends continue the Congress score could fall lower.
With 220 seats, Congress would need to join forces with the Marxists or
factions within the National Front in a coalition whose main area of
agreement would be to deny power to the Hindu nationalists.
The Marxists, led by Mr Jyoti Basu, the chief minister of West Bengal, have
said that they could not accept the conditions that would accompany a
substantial IMF borrowing. All other parties accept the principle that India
has no alternative but to borrow.
If the Congress score fell below 200 then Mr Gandhi's own future would be in
doubt. Mr Chandra Shekhar, the prime minister, and a former leader of both
the Congress and the Janata Dal, clearly hopes that in such a situation he
would be able to achieve a political realignment and his own reappointment.
Much hinges on the performance in the final stages of the campaign of the
BJP. The party reckons it can win about 140 seats.
However, its standing in the opinion polls could frighten floating Moslem
voters into the arms of the Congress.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN economies which were depressed in 1990 are unlikely to fare any
better this year, according to the Caribbean Development Bank's review of
the region, which has just been published.
The bank said the prospects of the region were not encouraged by
expectations of continued weak performance in the economies of the
Caribbean's major trading partners.
The CDB, which is based in Barbados, said the economies of its borrowing
members last year 'continued to slow down  .. affected primarily by the
deepening world recession.'
It said that of its 17 borrowing members, only Anguilla, Belize, Dominica,
Montserrat and Trinidad and Tobago recorded economic growth.
The bank, which has total resources of Dollars 712m - contributed mainly by
the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany and Italy - provides programme loans
to its members.
Resort countries in the region suffered last year from a downturn in
international tourism, caused by recession in the major markets and the Gulf
crisis.
The CDB said the region's tourism was also affected last year by increasing
competition from other resorts.
Tightened liquidity caused a contraction in the construction sector as
commercial bank lending declined. This coincided with an end to
reconstruction activity following damage caused by a hurricane in the
eastern Caribbean 20 months ago.
The CDB reported better news for the Caribbean's banana industry, with
exports increasing by 13 per cent last year. There were increases in
production in Dominica, Jamaica, St Vincent and St Lucia, while exports fell
in Belize and Grenada.

FT  09 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise active on oil deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEAL conjured up by Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil to acquire the
North Sea assets of Occidental Petroleum for Dollars 1.35bn triggered a
wholesale shake-up of the oil sector.
The market's initial reaction was to mark Enterprise shares sharply higher,
along with others in the sub-sector, on the view that the deal removed an
overhang of Enterprise shares and revalued North Sea assets generally.
There was a rethink later, with Enterprise retreating from an initial 570p
to 548p before closing a net 6 off at 551p. Market analysts said the big
institutions were attracted by the 8.75 per cent yield offered by the newly
issued convertible bonds involved in the deal, and were switching out of
Enterprise ordinary shares and into the bonds. Turnover in the ordinary
reached 13m shares.
The deal involves Elf and Enterprise setting up a joint venture - Elf
Enterprise Petroleum, in which Elf will have two-thirds and Enterprise the
rest - to acquire the Occidental assets. The bonds involved are convertible
into Enterprise shares at 640p a share.
Tate pleases
Tate &amp; Lyle rose 9 to 374p following strong interim results and as the
company reaffirmed that it would not be raising its ADollars 325m (Pounds
150m) bid for Bundaberg Sugar, of Australia.
Food specialists noted that with the world sugar price close to a 3 1/2
 year low, Tate was under little pressure to increase its offer. However, a
note of caution was struck after it indicated that US regulatory approval
for sucralose, the artificial sweetener, may not be imminent.
Tate's half-year profits increased by Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 94.7m from the
same period last year, which was at the upper end of brokers' forecasts.
Analysts raised their full year estimates by Pounds 10m to between Pounds
233m to Pounds 236m. Next year Pounds 260m to Pounds 280m is anticipated.
High yielder
Longer term investors showed approval of Trafalgar House after the
construction and property to shipping group maintained its interim dividend
in spite of sharply lower first-half profits. The decision confirmed
Trafalgar's status as one of the two highest yielding stocks in the Footsie
list.
The chairman anticipated no immediate recovery in Trafalgar's fortunes but
remained optimistic for 1992 and beyond. Analysts concurred with the view,
and also spoke of the unexpectedly good half-year performance by the
construction/engineering division. On a two-year perspective they thought
Tralagar shares had considerable upside potential. The stock closed 6 up at
268p on volume of 5.2m shares.
SmithKline reacts
SmithKline Beecham ran into profit-taking after publishing first-quarter
figures largely in line with market expectations. The shares have been among
the strongest in the Footsie in recent months and yesterday's results found
traders flush with stock.
Analysts made minor adjustments to their full year forecasts. They noted
higher than expected currency losses but sales revenues were better than
expected. BZW, for example, trimmed its full year prediction by Pounds 5.6m
to Pounds 994.4m.
SmithKline had been strong in early trading after company chairman Mr Henry
Wendt said his long-term financial objective was for annual earnings to grow
at a rate of at least 15 per cent.
The shares were 13 ahead at mid-session before sliding to close at 809p for
a net decline of 22. Turnover was a solid 2.7m shares.
There was evidence that big funds had been switching from the oil majors
into the Elf Enterprise Petroleum bonds to take advantage of the generous
yield.
BP, releasing first-quarter figures today, dropped 11 to 343p on good
turnover of 7.2m shares, while Shell, reporting next week, fell a similar
amount to 521p with some 5.5m changing hands.
A number of analysts are cautious on BP. Mr Fergus MacLeod at County NatWest
advocated taking profits in the stock, which he said had recorded 9 per cent
outperformance since early April. 'The yield relative is back below 130 and
speculation over the future of the Kuwait Investment Office's 9.9 per cent
stake and the UK government's 2 per cent is bound to resurface,' said Mr
MacLeod.
County expects BP to report a first-quarter deficit of Pounds 25m after
stock losses, against a profit of Pounds 344m during the same period in
1990. On a replacement cost basis, which excludes stock gains and losses,
County is going for net income of Pounds 410m, compared with Pounds 361m.
The Enterprise deal affected the rest of the exploration and production
sector, where Lasmo raced up to 373p before sliding back to close only 2
firmer at 357p on 3m shares traded.
British Gas came back into favour, helped by Smith New Court turning
positive on the stock after its recent bout of underperformance. At the
close Gas were 2 up at 239p, having touched 241p, with turnover reaching
7.7m.
The two power generators came in for sustained support and outperformed the
electricity issues, boosted by the forthcoming flotation of the Scottish
generators. PowerGen, where turnover leapt to 10m, moved up 3 1/2 to 141p
while National Power held at 133 1/2 p on 7.7m.
Water shares were given a strong push by County NatWest, whose water sector
analyst, Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, shifted his stance on the sector from
hold to buy. Mr Miller-Bakewell said he expected further unbundling of the
Water Package and said he favoured the 'more-focused risk-averse management
strategies' of North West and Anglian. The latter performed well, adding 5
at 300p.
Speculation about a convertible bond issue depressed Cadbury Schweppes,
although in the event it was Enterprise Oil which tapped the market. Cadbury
did not recover and closed 7 lower at 373p as talk of a convertible issue to
fund a bid for Dr Pepper/7-Up, of the US, refused to go away.
Unilever fell 10 to 733p after a cautious annual meeting statement. There
was also apprehension ahead of the first-quarter results due on May 17.
Analysts expect a small decline from the same period last year to between
Pounds 345m to Pounds 350m.
United Biscuits slipped 6 to 375p on talk that a brokerage house had lowered
its estimate for the current year by Pounds 5m to Pounds 209m, making it one
of the lowest forecasts so far.
J. Sainsbury gained 3 to 387p and Tesco declined 5 to 288p as funds switched
between the two stocks. Kingfisher put on 3 to 494p as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
one of the more bearish houses, raised its current year estimate by Pounds
10m to Pounds 235m.
Several big leisure stocks had a good day, against the trend of the wider
market, as Smith New Court released its regular review of the sector. Smith,
taking a more positive view than previously, said: 'You may be a little
early buying the leisure sector, but the downside is limited. Present
trading conditions are fully discounted.'
It identified Ladbroke, up 5 at 289p, and Queen's Moat Houses, unchanged at
95p, as good value. Trusthouse Forte, a penny firmer at 275p, was on a more
demanding rating, said Smith.
Reuters climbed 13 in early trading in the wake of a presentation by the
company to the Society of Investment Analysts. There was some talk that SG
Warburg had upgraded the stock, but the broker denied this.
There were downgradings in evidence elsewhere, however. James Capel, for
example, cut its full year forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 340m, saying
there was continuing concern over revenues from the company's real-time
information products. Reuters dropped to 774p at worst before ending at 782p
for a decline of 3 on the day.
Rolls-Royce met fresh selling after announcing further job losses. The
latest cuts involve 3,000 jobs and will reduce the workforce to 28,000 at
the end of 1991 from 34,000 at the beginning of the year.
The chief executive said yesterday: 'The immediate situation is difficult
and we have to reduce capacity and costs over the next two years.'
Rolls-Royce has also declared a pay freeze for all employees for six months.
The shares, downgraded by Goldman Sachs in New York on Tuesday, eased
further to 163p.
Another broking house downgrade aroused more uncertainty about dividend
prospects for British Steel. Mr David Morgan of Lehman Brothers cut
estimates for both this year and next, saying since the yield is the main
prop to the share price he expects a further period of underperformance. The
shares lost 1 1/2 to 130p.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Treasury auction success
gives Dow modest boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES posted moderate gains yesterday afternoon on news of a
successful Treasury auction of 10-year notes, writes Karen Zagor in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved 13.41 to 2,930.90 amid light New
York SE volume of 157.2m shares. On the big board, advances outscored
declines by 860 to 664. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 1.19 to 378.51.
On Tuesday the Dow fell 24 points in the aftermath of disappointing demand
at the three-year note sale which triggered a bond market retreat and a late
afternoon sell-off in stocks. Concern about yesterday's afternoon auction
resulted in exceptionally quiet trading in the bond and stock markets during
the morning.
Technology issues recovered after Tuesday's weakness. IBM, which plans to
cut its computer workstation prices by as much as 60 per cent, gained
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 103 3/4 . Digital Equipment put on Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 65 1/4 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 .
Upjohn, which told investors that it is committed to remaining independent
although a number of its patents on important drugs will expire in the
mid-1990s, declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43 1/2 in heavy trading.
Eljer Industries leapt Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 21 7/8 on news that a unit
of the UK's Hanson had bid Dollars 20 a share in cash for the heating,
ventilation and plumbing products concern. The Eljer share price had traded
as low as Dollars 5 1/2 in mid-October.
Occidental Petroleum, which has agreed to sell its North Sea oil interests
for Dollars 1.35bn in cash to a joint venture led by France's Elf Aquitaine,
added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 20 1/4 .
Disappointing first-quarter sales at Toys R Us pushed the shares down
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 7/8 .
Fears that a takeover bid valued at more than Dollars 1bn including debt for
Vista Chemical from RWE, the giant German utility, had run into trouble
prompted heavy trading in Vista's shares, which dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 49 1/2 .
Du Pont advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 3/4 after Smith Barney increased
its rating on the stock to buy from hold, although it also reduced its 1991
earnings estimate to Dollars 3.25 a share from Dollars 3.35. Dow Chemical,
another big chemical company, improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 .
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite rose 1.00 to 492.51, but
Apple Computer receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 3/4 .
Microsoft moved ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 103 after announcing a
three-for-two stock split, effective on June 18.
Medimmune traded at Dollars 11 1/2 . An initial offering of 2.5m of its
common stock was priced at Dollars 9 1/4 late on Tuesday.
Mesa Airlines, which said its new fleet of larger aircraft would put
pressure on its short-term load factor, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 14 1/4
. It posted second-quarter net earnings of 31 cents a share compared with 29
cents a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed with a slightly firmer bias on thin trading, after
moving within a narrow range throughout the day. The composite index edged
up 3.2 to 3,482.0 and rises led falls by 296 to 235. Volume amounted to
19.2m shares.
Power Corp, which shed CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 16 3/8 , said its
first-quarter earnings fell to 23 cents a share from the 34 cents recorded a
year earlier.
Brunswick Mining &amp; Smelting, a 64 per cent owned subsidiary of Noranda, said
workers at its lead-zinc mine in New Brunswick have voted to end a
10-month-long strike. Brunswick firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 8 and
Noranda gained CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 18 1/2 .
Newbridge Networks led the list of most active industrial stocks for the
second day, closing up another CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 10 1/2 . The
company attributed the activity to a two-year general agreement announced on
Monday between Newbridge and two units of Nynex.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR ended firmer in London after quiet trading. There is no important
economic news due until tomorrow's US producer price index, and the dollar
rose nervously in a thin market on a report that Iraqi anti-aircraft fire
had been aimed at a US Navy jet on Tuesday.
There was also nervousness as traders waited to see the result of last
night's 10-year US Treasury note sale and today's 30-year bond auction.
Sentiment surrounding the US currency received a boost from comments by Mr
Robert Mcteer, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president. He told a US
congressional sub-committee that banks in his region are beginning to see
signs of recovery, and that 'the transition (of banks) to profitability is
encouraging' after the losses of the last four years.
Mr Mcteer's remarks were reinforced by his counterparts in Chicago and
Boston, who were optimistic on the subject of improving credit availability,
when addressing the sub-committee.
At the London close the dollar had climbed to DM1.7330 from DM1.7210; to
Y138.30 from Y137.95; to SFr1.4655 from SFr1.4580; and to FFr5.8650 from
FFr5.8275. Its index moved up to 66.2 from 66.0.
Instability in eastern Europe also lent support to the dollar at the expense
of the D-Mark. US President George Bush strongly defended Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, shortly before he met leaders from the Baltic Republics
in Washington. Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, president of Lithuania, speaking
before his meeting with Mr Bush, threatened to assist in the break-up of the
Soviet Union if there is not a swift move towards Baltic independence.
The D-Mark was among the weaker members of the European exchange rate
mechanism. It also gave ground to the Japanese yen, slipping to Y79.80 from
Y80.15 in London.
The yen was supported by fading expectations of a cut in the Japanese
discount rate. The Bank of Japan will wait to confirm an economic slowdown,
possibly for about a month, before deciding whether to change its tight
monetary policy, according to an official at the central bank.
Sterling lost ground to the dollar, but was steady in terms of the yen and
improved against most of its partners in the ERM. Reduced political risk
supported the pound, after last week's poor local election results for the
ruling UK Conservative party appeared to put back the likely date of a
general election.
The pound shed 30 points to Dollars 1.7180. It was unchanged at Y237.50 and
rose to DM2.9775 from DM2.9625; to FFr10.0750 from FFr10.0300; and to
SFr2.5175 from SFr2.5100. Its index climbed 0.3 to 91.8. In New York,
sterling improved 20 points to end at Dollars 1.7200.
Sterling was third strongest in the ERM, with the peseta steady at the top.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said in London that the peseta
is too high, endangering Spain's export position.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil set to import Dollars
1bn worth of grain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAOLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE drought in Brazil's south-central region will force the country to
import Dollars 1bn (Pounds 578.8m) worth of grains this year, according to
the Technical Trade Co-ordinator (CIC), which forms part of the the Ministry
of Economics.
Argentina is likely to provide about 80 per cent of imports, strengthening
the country's position as the world's biggest grain exporter.
This figure includes plans to import up to 120,000 tonnes of soyabeans -
traditionally one of Brazil's main export products. Heavy damage from the
drought has led analysts to predict a 22 per cent drop in the soyabean crop
this year, compared to 1990.
The agency has also received government authorisation to import 13,000
tonnes of soyabean oil, and expects total foreign purchases of the product
to reach 60,000 tonnes this year.
Brazil will import between 800,000 and 1m tonnes of rice, said a CIC
spokesman, including 350,000 tonnes from Argentina and Uruguay and the rest
from the US, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries.
The rice scheduled to come in from Argentina and Uruguay will bear no import
tariff, while imports from other sources will be taxed at 15 per cent.
Brazil will also take in about 1.5m tonnes of corn, and 3m tonnes of wheat
from abroad, according to the CIC. Again, Argentina will be supplying the
bulk of purchases.
'The prolonged drought in Brazil's key south-central growing area has been
devastating,' said a CIC spokesman. 'This, coupled with tight agricultural
credit, has led to severe shortages in all these products.'

FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shell puts Dollars 74m into
Chilean offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL, the petro-chemical group, has injected Dollars 74m
(Pounds 42.8m) of new capital into its subsidiary in Chile, where it is
investing in forestry and mining.
Chile is the focal point of Shell's relatively new forestry business. The
company owns 60 per cent of a Dollars 460m pulp mill at Nacimiento in the
Bio-Bio region, which has its formal opening next month, and an associated
Dollars 110m eucalyptus forest.
Partners in this project, which will produce 220,000 tonnes of pulp a year
for use in tissue paper, are two US groups, Scott Paper and Citicorp
Banking.
Shell has more than 60,000 hectares of plantations in Chile. Mr Robert
Turner, president of Shell Chile, says Chile has a natural advantage in
forestry - trees grow twice as fast as in the northern hemisphere.
But he says Shell Chile will now pause to consolidate its position in
forestry. 'Growth in Chile in the immediate future will come from mining.'
Billiton, Shell's mining and metals division, is spending Dollars 14.5m on
exploration this year, mainly on a huge copper deposit at Collahuasi in the
Tarapaca region.
Mr Rodney Lay, managing director of Billiton Chile, points out that the
world's three biggest copper mines are in the country and that Collahuasi
'appears to be a classic Chilean deposit. Everywhere they look they find
copper.'
Billiton's partners in the copper project are Falconbridge of Canada and
Chevron of the US.
If the go-ahead for a mine is given, Collahuasi would cost between Dollars
200m and Dollars 300m and produce 75,000 to 80,000 tonnes of copper in
concentrates a year to start with, but Mr Lay says a mine could not start up
until 1995.
Billiton's sole current operating mine in Chile is Choquelimpie, near Arica
in northern Chile, which is pioneering high-altitude, low-grade gold mining
and last year produced 100,300 troy ounces of gold and 64,000 ounces of
silver.
With its partners, Northgate of Canada (35 per cent) and Citibank (23 per
cent), Billiton is spending Dollars 3m this year exploring for more reserves
at Choquelimpie, which in theory runs out of ore in 1993.
Shell now has more than Dollars 600m invested in Chile, up from Dollars 70m
ten years ago, and the number of employees in Shell companies has grown from
300 to 3,000.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine investment may be diverted
from Australia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINING investment is likely to be diverted from Australia to other countries
if the government bans mining at the disputed Coronation Hill site in the
Northern Territory, the mining industry warned yesterday.
'International miners and Australian miners are saying we might as well go
to other places where the government is interested in further development,'
said Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, director of the Australian Mining Industry
Council.
His comments followed the release of a report into Coronation Hill by the
Resource Assessment Commission (RAC), a government advisory body set up to
investigate the competing claims of miners, aboriginal landowners and
environmental groups.
The government initially indicated that mining at Coronation Hill would be
allowed, but imposed a temporary ban in 1989 after environmental groups
claimed it would threaten the Kakadu national park, a wilderness area
adjacent to the site.
Significant gold reserves have been identified at the site by the Coronation
Hill Joint Venture, which comprises Newcrest Mining (formerly BHP Gold
Mines), Norgold, and Plutonic Resources (formerly Pioneer Minerals (Gold).
The RAC report says mining would have only minor environmental consequences,
but would infringe the religious beliefs of the Jaowyn tribe, the
traditional aboriginal owners of the land.
It also hints that a ban on mining would not have serious economic
consequences if the government explained carefully to mining companies that
the site was regarded as a special case.
The report makes no recommendations, but sets out a series of seven options
ranging from a ban on mining, through limited development in consultation
with the Jaowyn, to full development as proposed by the joint venture.
However, Mr McIntosh said Coronation Hill was seen as a 'litmus test' by the
mining industry, and warned that limits on mining would be regarded as
confirmation that the government was prepared to break its own rules.
'It has clearly become an emotional issue because of the way the government
has handled the whole crisis,' he said. 'The country is going broke, and it
would be disappointing to think that we cannot get to the stage where we can
have some more pragmatic decisions.'
Mr McIntosh said Australia would be regarded as 'elitist and preservationist
if we continue with this nonsense of saying every tiny area in the country
has some special significance to small groups of people.'
Mr Bob Hawke, the prime minister, said the RAC report presented the
government with a difficult decision, but refused to comment further. Mr
Hawke has previously argued that Coronation Hill is a special case
'involving a combination of complex and sensitive issues which would only
rarely occur.'
The federal cabinet is expected to discuss the report shortly, and a
decision is expected early next month.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: India reins back its sugar
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government has decided for the moment not to export the full
525,000 tonnes of sugar which it sanctioned last month. Even though there is
a huge surplus, the caretaker government headed by Mr Chandra Shekhar has
accepted the industry's suggestion to restrict the export to 225,000 tonnes
for the time being.
The decision to withhold export has been taken in view of the prevailing
depressed sugar price in the world market, according to Mr Om Dhanuka,
spokesman for the Indian Sugar Mills Association. The Indian Sugar and
General Industry Export Import Corporation, the trading arm of the industry,
is still looking for buyers for 50,000 unsold tonnes out of the 225,000
tonnes.
Whether India will finally export 525,000 tonnes will be decided by the new
government to be formed following the elections later this month.
The Indian sugar industry had produced 10.04m tonnes of sugar by mid-April,
compared with 9.12m tonnes in the corresponding period last season. Experts
believe total production in the current season, ending September, could be
12m tonnes, against actual production of 11m tonnes last year.
If production touches 12m tonnes, the total availability in the current
season will be 14.2m tonnes, when brought-forward stocks are included.
Domestic demand will at the most be 10.6m tonnes.
When the industry's stock was taken recently, it was found that 328 mills
were still engaged in cane crushing as on April 15 last, against 289 mills
on the corresponding day of the previous season.
Mr Dhanuka said: 'There is still plenty of cane in the field and a good
number of mills in north and west India will remain operational till June
when monsoon sets in full might.'
India's cane production in 1990-91 is estimated at 233.45m tonnes, compared
with 222.62m tonnes last year.

A NEW ZEALAND company has linked up with the Johor state government of
southern Malaysia to set up farms capable of carrying 9,000 deer.
Corporate Investments, a diversified company, will form a NZDollars 8m
(Pounds 2.7m) joint venture with the Johor state government economic
development corporation. CIS will hold a 25 per cent stake in the new
company and have a five-year management contract to supply fallow deer.
The first consignment from Auckland is expected to arrive soon. An export
slaughtering and processing plant will be set up later.
Mr Peter Masfen, executive chairman of CIS, said 200 hectares of land,
mostly jungle and coconut plantation, were being cleared and fenced for the
first farm and a further 200 hectares would be available for further
development.
CIS also has a joint venture deer farm in British Columbia and a joint
venture with Sumitomo Forestry Company of Japan to process timber.
Mr Masfen said the main objectives of the thrust in south-east Asia was to
link New Zealand expertise in farming, processing and marketing with the
abundance of land and labour in the region.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Italian banks close to Soviet
finance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN BANKS are close to finalising a large loan for the Soviet Union, the
first to be raised under an Italian government programme announ- ced last
year aimed at supporting the weak Soviet economy.
The funds are being raised under an Italian pledge to provide up to L2,200bn
(Dollars 1.7bn) in financial support to the Soviet Union.
The loan of Ecu427.9m (Dollars 509.2m), carrying the guarantee of the
Italian Treasury, will finance payments to Italian exporters for the supply
of goods to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has built up arrears on trade
debts with western exporters, amounting to an estimated Dollars 5bn.
Banca Commerciale Italiana is arranging the credit, which will be available
for a year. It will be repaid in four equal semi-annual instalments with a
final maturity at the end of 1995. BCI declined to disclose the interest
margin. The syndicate of 15 to 20 banks is expected to be entirely Italian.
The Soviet Union borrowed directly from banks until late 1989, but it would
now be impossible without guarantees from governments in the industrialised
countries.
According to a report from the Institute of International Finance, a
Washington-based research group financed by international banks, commercial
banks provided more than Dollars 8bn in new credit in 1989 but withdrew
about Dollars 12bn last year. This year it expects a further Dollars 7bn
will be withdrawn. Most of this swing was accounted for in short-term
lending, through a fall in the availability of trade credits and foreign

It calculated official disbursements of medium and long-term credits to the

Germany will provide Dollars 3bn, Korea almost Dollars 2bn and France, Italy
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the US at least Dollars 1bn each.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Bank cuts tap stock price to sell entire
Pounds 800m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bank of England cut the price for the Treasury 9 per cent stock due 2008
to sell the entire Pounds 800m tranche yesterday.
The tap stock has been overhanging the market for several weeks as
market-makers were reluctant to pay the minimum tender price of 94 1/4 when
the existing stock has been available in the market for up to 2 percentage
points less.
The Bank of England sold the stock at 92 1/8 (to yield 9.96 per cent)
yesterday to a small number of market-makers thought to include Barclays de
Zoete Wedd and SG Warburg. Some of the smaller market-makers expressed
dissatisfaction at the way the sale was handled. One pointed out that the
stock - which is part-paid - had traded down to the equivalent of 92 3/16 ,
and therefore questioned the Bank's decision to sell the entire tap at below
the market price to only a few market-makers.
The Bank said it took advantage of a bounce in the government bond market to
offload the stock. It is now expected to press ahead with a busy funding
schedule.
Overall, the short end of the gilts market edged up, while the longer
maturities fell during the day. The benchmark 11 3/4 gilt due 2003/07 opened
at 110 9/16 but fell to 110 5/16 by late afternoon.
US TREASURIES recovered their morning losses to trade modestly higher
yesterday afternoon following news of respectable demand at the Treasury's
10-year note auction.
Morning trading was depressed by residual worries about the Treasury's
quarterly refunding auctions following unexpectedly light demand at the
three-year note sale on Tuesday. But prices recovered on news that demand
had held up at the Dollars 11.75bn sale of 10-year notes, which had an
average yield of 8.07 per cent with no tail.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up  5/32 to
1/16 , yielding 8.22 per cent, after sliding  5/32 in morning trading.
Shorter-dated maturities were unchanged to  1/32 higher.
The Federal Reserve did not intervene in the open market for a second
consecutive day, and Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other,
changed hands at the 5 per cent level through most of the day.
The bond market continued to focus on new supply in the absence of any
economic news. Many analysts had expected Tuesday's sale of Dollars 13.5bn
in three-year notes to draw the strongest demand of the series of auctions
in the Treasury's Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding. Although the average
yield of 7.09 per cent was in line with expectations, the bid-to-cover ratio
of 2.5:1 suggested unexpectedly lacklustre demand and prompted fears about
the reception of yesterday's Dollars 11.75bn auction and of the Dollars
11.75bn of 30-year bonds to be sold today.
GERMAN government bond prices weakened yesterday as investors sold futures
contracts to buy the latest 10-year bund issue.
In the tender yesterday, the government sold DM4.39bn of the 8 3/8 per cent
10-year bund at an average price of 99.95, to yield 8.36 per cent. The
government had already sold DM3bn to the bank consortium on Tuesday and has
kept DM2.61bn to help with market regulation. Traders said that the new bund
was being used for arbitrage purposes as it was the cheapest bond
deliverable into the bund futures contract in London.
The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM22.1bn at this week's tender for 35-day
securities repurchases, allocating funds at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent.
This means that a net DM1.6bn is being drained from the market, which
traders said suggested no change in monetary policy.
The Bundesbank refused to comment on rumours that Mr Karl Otto Pohl,
Bundesbank president, would resign.
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped yesterday after the disappointing
performance of the US Treasury market on Tuesday. Hopes of a cut in the
official discount rate in Japan have faded, also contributing to weaker
prices.

INDICATIONS of further behind-the-scenes activity at Trans World Airlines,
the heavily indebted airline owned by Mr Carl Icahn, surfaced yesterday as a
group of unsecured bondholders formally appointed financial advisers to
represent their interests.
The formation of an 'unsecured bondholders committee', and the appointment
of advisers, follows recent talks between the international carrier and some
of its secured bondholders over debt restructuring plans. The US courts last
month confirmed the right of certain secured debtholders to repossess
aircraft and engines if a deal could not be struck.
TWA defaulted on a variety of payments due on its debt earlier this year.
The unsecured creditors' advisers said they had already approached TWA about
talks on the securities in default, but that no meeting had yet been set up.
Mr Seth Schofield is to succeed Mr Edward Colodny as chief executive of
USAir, one of the middle-ranking US carriers. Mr Colodny will be 65 in June,
the age when USAir officers usually retire, but will remain as chairman. Mr
Schofield is currently president and chief operating officer of the group.

<TEXT>
MR PAUL DESMARAIS, chairman of Power Corp of Canada, said he is ready to
deploy most of the USDollars 2bn in cash that his holding companies control
in both European and North American financial services and industrial growth
sectors.
Speaking after Power Corp's annual meeting, he said Pargesa Holding, which
he jointly controls with the Albert Frere group of Belgium, has well over
USDollars 1bn to invest in Europe.
Power Corp, through Parfinance, a Pargesa affiliate, has linked with two
French financial groups to pool voting interests and become the largest core
shareholder group in Compagnie Financiere de Paribas, the banking, financial
services and industrial holding company.
Mr Desmarais said the two Canadian holding companies he directly controls,
Power Corp and 70 per cent-owned Power Financial Corp, are now actively
negotiating potential deals in financial services and several industrial
sectors in North America.
'Capital is very scarce the world over and we are getting proposals from all
quarters, including Asia and the former east bloc,' said Mr Desmarais. 'We
time our moves carefully, but we would be ready to invest in forest
products, for instance, despite the industry's present problems.
'We do not rule out energy. Petrofina, which we control through Pargesa, is
returning to upstream oil and gas in Canada and will grow further in the US.
'We have been burned before in energy and we prefer someone with direct
experience to manage expansion in that field.'
In financial services the thrust of expansion, will be partly through
Great-West Lifeco, a full service life company with half its USDollars 20bn
assets in the US.
Mr Desmarais, 64, chief executive and architect of the Power Corp group for
24 years, said he will be easing his workload gradually.
He appointed his son Andre, 34, president and chief operating officer of
Power Corp.
His other son, Paul Jr, 36, already chairman of Power Financial Corp, the
financial services subsidiary which also holds 25 per cent of Pargesa,
becomes vice-chairman of Power Corp.

blocked
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed merger of two Californian electricity companies, which would
create the largest investor-owned power utility in the US, suffered a
potentially fatal setback yesterday when state regulators blocked the deal.
SCEcorp, the parent of Southern California Edison, which provides power in
the Los Angeles area, has been trying since 1988 to take over San Diego Gas
and Electric in a deal valued at more than Dollars 2.8bn. SCEcorp can appeal
against the regulators' veto, but it was unclear yesterday whether it would
do so.
The unanimous ruling by the California Public Utilities Commission follows
its consideration of a 1,300-page report, published last February, which
said the benefits of the merger would be outweighed by its negative impact
on competition.
The decision comes in the wake of several recent mergers in the widely
fragmented power generation sector. Analysts have suggested this could be
the start of a wave of takeover bids which would allow utilities to reap
economies through pooling.
The Californian PUC said it had ruled against the merger because the
utilities had not proven that the deal would provide long-term net benefits
for customers, and because it would have adverse effects on competition
among utilities which transmit power or which sell in the open market the
excess electricity they have generated.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SONY Software yesterday confirmed that the co-chairman of its Columbia
Pictures Entertainment division, Mr Jon Peters, will give up his title and
day-to-day management duties. This is the second shuffle of Hollywood
executives this month.
The move comes only 19 months after Sony paid a high premium to acquire
Guber-Peters Entertainment, Mr Peters' former production company.
It also comes only days after Paramount Communications appointed Mr Brandon
Tartikoff to head its Paramount Pictures unit.
Sony's regard for Mr Peters and Mr Peter Guber was reflected in the Dollars
200m, or Dollars 17 1/2 -a-share, it paid for Guber-Peters in 1989, at a
time when the stock was trading at Dollars 12 3/4 a share and in the costly
lawsuit it fought for Guber-Peters.
Sony said Mr Peters would establish a new entertainment company which would
be tied exclusively to Columbia. The new company would produce films, music
and television.
Mr Peters, a former hairdresser, is one of Hollywood's most colourful
characters. He formed a relationship with Barbra Streisand in the 1970s when
he was working as a hairdresser, and in 1976 helped produce Ms Streisand's
remake of A Star is Born.
Mr Peters joined forces with Mr Guber in 1980 and the pair produced such
film hits as Batman, Rain Man and The Colour Purple before joining Sony.
The duo have poured money into Columbia Pictures and its Tri-Sta Pictures
unit. They are expected to spend about Dollars 700m this year on films,
nearly twice as much as Paramount Pictures intends to spend.
At Columbia, Mr Guber, who trained as a lawyer and had some experience of
studio management, focused on corporate affairs while Mr Peters concentrated
on creative matters.
Rumours started in February that Peters, who had never worked inside a big
corporation, was planning to leave Columbia. Mr Guber, will remain as
Columbia's chief executive.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRASCAN, a kingpin of the industrial and financial services empire
controlled by Toronto's Bronfman brothers, is willing to put some peripheral
businesses up for sale as part of efforts to ease the strain on its
financial resources.
Mr Trevor Eyton, Brascan's chief executive, said yesterday that the company
had also asked its 41 per cent owned food and beverage unit, John Labatt, to
seek outside investors to help finance any acquisition costing more than
CDollars 1bn (USDollars 869.5m).
Brascan's earnings have been hit by the steep slide in Noranda's earnings,
its mining and forestry subsidiary, and by the lacklustre performance of its
financial services interests, which include Royal Trust, one of Canada's
leading trust companies.
Brascan yesterday reported first-quarter earnings of CDollars 11.6m, or 1
cent a share, down from CDollars 44.6m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Its
share of group revenues slipped to CDollars 2.4bn from CDollars 2.6bn.
The company said it did not expect a return to 'satisfactory' profitability
until 1992.
Mr Eyton said that, despite persistent rumours to the contrary, Brascan had
taken no steps to sell its stake in Labatt, although the company had been
approached by possible buyers since the rumours surfaced.
Referring to future asset sales, he cited Noranda's pending sale of its wire
and cable business to France's Alcatel Cable as an example of the type of
business that may be put on the block this year.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Soft drinks war takes on a hard
edge - Paul Abrahams on Coca-Cola's plan of attack on the market in the
Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW conflict is set to bubble over in the Middle East following the
decision this week by the Arab Boycott of Israel Office to lift a ban on
Coca-Cola. For the two titans of the carbonated beverage industry -
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo - are preparing for a long, drawn-out battle.
The prize for these prime propagators of US cultural imperialism is a
commanding position in a one of the world's fastest-growing markets.
Before the Gulf war, the combined effect of the climate, Islam's prohibition
on alcohol and a Middle East population explosion, was a 20 per cent growth
rate in carbonated drink sales. Although the Middle East represents only 8.5
per cent of the non-US market, it is worth about Dollars 4.25bn a year. This
is, after all, a Dollars 90bn industry.
The problem for Coca-Cola was that PepsiCo benefited from most of those
sales. 'The Middle East is the only major area where Pepsi has market
leadership,' admitted Mr Neville Isdell, president of Coca-Cola's division
that serves the Arab world.
'Our aim is to redress the balance to the natural order of things: in the
non-US market outside the Middle East, Coca-Cola out-scores Pepsi by a
factor of four to one.'
Optimism overflows at Coca-Cola's Atlanta headquarters. The company claims
to have been successful in the few Arab countries where Coke has been
available in spite of the ban. The Arab Boycott Office banned its products
after Coca-Cola franchised Israeli bottling plants during the 1960s.
Mr Isdell points out that Coca-Cola is now level with Pepsi in Egypt after
starting from zero in 1979. And after entering most Gulf states two years
ago, the group has about 18 per cent market share, according to Mr Isdell.
The end of the ban is more than welcome news for Coca-Cola, which was badly
bruised during the Gulf war. The Persian Gulf cola campaign witnessed a
victory almost as overwhelming as General Norman Schwarzkopf's.
While the world's television screens were dominated by images of US troops
carrying cans of Pepsi, sightings of Coca-Cola were rare.
Pepsi, which has five bottling plants in Saudi Arabia, claims to have sold
95 per cent of the 3m cases of carbonated soft drinks it estimates were
consumed by US the military in the Middle East since August. (Each case
contains 24 8oz cans.) Coca-Cola disputes Pepsi's estimates, reckoning Coke
captured about 30 per cent of the military market.
Whatever the true figure, Saudi Arabia was the worst of battle terrain for
Coca-Cola, admitted Mr Isdell. Coca-Cola only re-entered the Saudi market
two years ago and has no manufacturing facilities there because of a legal
dispute with its old Saudi bottler.
During the war, the company was forced to import from its plant at Al Ain,
far from the front on the Abu Dhabi border with Oman. Pepsi claims it
maintained its 87 per cent dominance of the Saudi civilian market during the
conflict.
To add insult to serious financial injury, Pepsi then scored one of the
biggest product placement triumphs in cola war history. When the Iraqis came
to sign the cease-fire, the only beverage on the negotiating table other
than water was Diet-Pepsi. The reason? General Schwarzkopf, mindful of his
waist, has a weakness for the bubbly black stuff.
Pepsi executives were jubilant when they saw the bottles, said Mr David
Jones, president of PepsiCo in the Middle East and Africa. But the company
decided not to exploit its publicity coup, he added.
'Doing a media blitz about our supplies to the US military would be a
double-edged sword,' he explained.
'While it might be appealing to our American customers, it might not be so
appealing to those in the Middle East whose sympathies during the conflict
were a little closer to Mr Saddam Hussein.'
Both companies are now preparing to invest in distribution infrastructure.
'We want to make sure a cold product is only an arm's reach from desire,'
said Mr Jones.
Meanwhile, the cola warriors are hoping for peace in the Middle East.
'To be honest, we prefer supplying locals than armies,' explains Mr Jones.
'It's better for business.'

bitter taste

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCA-COLA and PepsiCo are suddenly at each other's throats in Japan, lodging
competing claims with the Fair Trade Commission over a Pepsi commercial that
Coke wants canned.
Advertisements ridiculing a competitor are unusual in this
consensus-conscious country, but, for the past month, PepsiCo has served a
mildly amusing, gently mocking commercial to Japanese viewers.
The US-made commercial shows the high-octane rap singer M. C. Hammer having
his customary Pepsi switched for a Coke during a performance. He then breaks
into an off-key rendition of the ballad Feelings, which prompts an audience
member to offer him a Pepsi, inspiring a return to the rap beat.
PepsiCo Japan has filed a claim with the FTC alleging Coca-Cola (Japan) has
put unfair pressure on Japanese television stations not to broadcast the
commercial, which has disappeared from the television screen in recent days.
Meanwhile, Coca-Cola had lodged a complaint with the FTC against Pepsi,
alleging that, under the Japanese advertising code, the commercial unfairly
disparages Coke. Four years ago, the FTC ruled comparative commercials would
be allowed only if the method was impartial and the content verifiable.
A Coca-Cola official said unfair pressure had not been applied to Japanese
broadcasters, though 'we informed key television stations that we did not
authorise the use of our trademark and that the information implied was
untrue and therefore unsupportable and disparaging'.
Pepsi said yesterday the commercial was the first of its kind in Japan, and
a survey of young people showed it was the second most popular nationally
last month. The company said Pepsi sales for the month were up 50 per cent
from a year earlier, though Coke is still reckoned to have a 90 per cent
share of the cola market.
'We would like to continue airing this popular commercial. However, when we
placed orders for May television spots to five key stations, they all
replied that they cannot accept,' PepsiCo said.
The success of the commercial has surprised the Japanese advertising
industry, which will be tempted to indulge in the gentle art of the put-down
if the FTC rules in favour of Pepsi. Commission officials yesterday said
they could not comment on cases under review.
Coca-Cola said that the company had no objection to PepsiCo screening the
commercial in the US because the country was accustomed to comparative
advertising.
He said that Japan was 'a completely different situation' and that 'we have
always tried to respect Japanese customs in presenting our product'.

A row over the latest valuation of Southend Properties has been silenced
after Southend threatened to seek an injunction against Frogmore Estates,
the target of its Pounds 130m bid.
Frogmore was quoted in the press last week saying that sample valuations of
Southend's portfolio indicated a 30 per cent fall in value, compared with
the 8 per cent fall in value that Southend announced at the time of its bid.
This estimate was based on information sent to Frogmore by Southend before
the offer was announced.
After Southend threatened to seek an injunction, Frogmore made a temporary
undertaking not to make use of this information. As as result, it said it
could not confirm or deny its previous claim.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Hogg to cut involvement at Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR CHRISTOPHER Hogg, chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds, the
speciality materials manufacturer, will in August relinquish his position as
chief executive, clearing the way for Mr Sipko Huismans, the group's
managing director, to take over.
Yesterday's announcement of Sir Christopher's impending move to part-time
chairman, marks a further stage in the company's evolution during his 11 1/2
years as chairman and chief executive.
Mr Huismans' appointment is indicative of Courtaulds' internationalisation
in recent years: he will be the first non-Englishman to hold a position of
such seniority.
When Sir Christopher became chairman and chief executive at the start of
1980 Courtaulds was an ailing textiles and chemicals conglomerate. He has
overseen a transformation through rationalisation and internationalisation
which culminated in the demerger of Courtaulds Textiles and Courtaulds in
1990.
Mr Huismans said of Sir Christopher: 'He took a group which was an unwieldy
mess and turned it into two sensible, sizeable companies.'
Sir Christopher's move is bound to provoke speculation that he plans to move
to another senior job in industry. He will leave the chief executive post on
August 1, a day before his 55th birthday, still significantly younger than
many chairmen of comparable industrial groups.
However, he said he had no plans beyond fulfilling his duties as part time
chairman of Courtaulds, Courtaulds Textiles and Reuters, the financial
information group. Although Sir Christopher said there was 'non-hidden
agenda' in the move he did not rule out moving to another post in due
course.
Mr Huismans, who was born in the Netherlands, joined Courtaulds 30 years ago
as a chemist in Swaziland after an education in South Africa. He has been
managing director of Courtaulds for the last two years. His appointment,
with a main background in sales and marketing, will present a significant
change of style from the quietly spoken and intellectual Sir Christopher.
With the radical restructuring of the group largely completed Mr Huismans
said his main task would be to raise performance throughout the group to the
highest international standards.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Administrators urge Polly Peck creditors to
play waiting game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PATIENCE IS a virtue' sums up the message from Polly Peck International's
administrators to the group's many creditors in their report distributed
yesterday.
Rather than settle for the quantifiable, albeit meagre, returns that a
liquidation would yield, they urge that creditors should hold their fire in
the hope that money will start to flow back to the group from Turkey and
northern Cyprus at some indeterminate future date.
That would reverse what are said to have been 'very large sums' flowing in
the other direction, leading to debts of about Pounds 959m being owed to the
rest of the group by businesses in the area.
The administrators also say that they have been told that, between July and
October last year, as Polly Peck's financial crisis developed, Pounds 230m
was pumped into proposed leisure developments in northern Cyprus. They have
not been able to verify this, but say that 'substantial further investment'
would be needed to achieve any return.
Meanwhile, the core businesses would be primped up to enhance values with
the aid of strategic partners who would be brought on board. And
investigations into the possible enhancement of returns through legal claims
would continue.
If all went well, the implication is, creditors might eventually expect to
receive more than the 52p in the pound dividend implied by the directors'
estimate contained in the report, since this includes no estimated
realisable values for 'certain' northern Cypriot and Turkish subsidiaries.
The likely return from a liquidation would approximate to just 20p in the
pound, with some creditors, acting to improve their position at the expense
of others, receiving 30p. This implies a deficit of assets against
liabilities of more than Pounds 900m.
The report puts unsecured creditors at Pounds 1.15bn. 'The group was in a
more parlous state than we imagined,' said joint administrator Mr Richard
Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
Under the broad strategy for 1991 and 1992 outlined by the administrators
yesterday, approximately Pounds 500m of debt (equivalent to a range of
30p-60p in the pound) would be settled by way of repayment or refinancing.
The proportions of each would depend on the performance of the principal
underlying companies within the group.
'A substantial part' of the remaining debt would be converted into an
instrument giving rights to participate in returns from the food, packaging
and leisure businesses in northern Cyprus and Turkey. The rump of the
group's borrowings would be written off or converted into equity.
The current equity would be reduced to a nominal value, 'with a view to
launching a possible rights issue' to raise funds to support the on-going
businesses.
The operation in the most obvious need of support at present is Sansui, the
Tokyo-listed electronics group that Polly Peck bought control of last year.
The administrators said yesterday that the strategy of expanding Polly
Peck's Far Eastern electronics operations by utilising the Sansui brand name
on the output of Capetronic, another subsidiary, had not yet been
successfully implemented. As a result, Sansui incurred trading losses of
Pounds 30m in the nine months to December 31 1990.
The administrators said that they had been advised that there was 'little
prospect' of realising their investment in Sansui in the short term and that
restrictions existed on selling Polly's shares within two years of
acquisition. They are accordingly working urgently on the preparation of a
recovery plan, as well as seeking a partner to 'provide financial and
management resources and to assist in restoring the profitability of the
group'.
A partner is also being sought for Del Monte, the US fresh fruit arm, to
help the company to exploit the developing European market. Proposed
deregulation, coupled with the emerging situation in east Europe, is a
source of great potential, the administrators stated.
In the year to December 31 1990, Del Monte made pre-tax profits before
interest of Dollars 80m on turnover of Dollars 799m. The company is
structured 'so as to be financially independent' of the rest of the group,
the report confirmed.
On the food, packaging and leisure interests in Turkey and northern Cyprus
where the principal uncertainties lie, the administrators said that there
had been 'an encouraging improvement'.
An understanding has now been reached as to 'the method by which the
relevant businesses' could be reorganised, they said. One of a number of
'avenues' being considered is the possible flotation of the food and
packaging entities as one group and of the leisure interests as another.
Less encouragingly, they said that trading in the foreseeable future was
likely to be 'at a considerably lower level than previously reported'. This
was due to the impact of the Gulf war and the uncertainty caused by the
appointment of administrators. A number of valuable markets for Meyna, the
fresh foodstuffs producer, and Unipac, the carton box-maker, existed in
Iraq, Kuwait and other countries, they said.
Vestel, the Turkish consumer electronics company, made trading profits of
Pounds 52m on turnover of Pounds 270m in the year to December 31 1990. Since
last October, it has negotiated its own financing facilities with the
assistance of the administrators which are regarded as adequate to meet
on-going needs. The administrators believe that realisation of the assets,
whether by a sale or a share placing, would currently only be possible at 'a
significant discount to the current market capitalisation'.
In general, the administrators said that they had 'serious reservations' as
to the quality and fairness of Polly Peck's published results.
Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner of Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's auditor, said
yesterday: 'The administrators have had full access to our audit working
papers (those dealing with the group accounts) and no queries have been
raised with us.'

<TEXT>
NEWS that Jacuzzi, the whirlpool bathmaker owned by Britain's Hanson group,
might bid Dollars 20 a share for Eljer Industries sent the potential target
group's stock soaring by Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 21 7/8 yesterday.
An offer at this price would value the Texas-based manufacturer of plumbing,
heating, and ventilation products at about Dollars 145m (Pounds 86m).
Yesterday, Mr Roy Jacuzzi, president of the California-based company, said
that Eljer would form an 'ideal add-on' business for Jacuzzi. Eljer's
products include toilets, sinks, bathtubs and shower stalls sold under the
Glas Tec, Eljer, Aqualine, Valley and Cambrian brand names.
The initial response from Eljer to the Hanson subsidiary's proposal was less
than enthusiastic. Describing Jacuzzi's approach as 'unsolicited', it said
that the matter would be discussed at the next scheduled board meeting on
June 18.
Eljer's net profits fell from Dollars 7.27m to Dollars 2.48m in 1990. Sales
were Dollars 449.2m.
Hanson is thought to have a stake of less than 5 per cent.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Trafalgar interim falls to Pounds 51.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the construction, property, shipping and hotels
conglomerate, yesterday reported a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds
116.9m to Pounds 51.5m for the six months to March.
The fall would have been worse without a 40 per cent rise in construction
and engineering profits to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 27.4m) thanks to a strong
order book of Pounds 2.9bn.
Taxation rose from 27 per cent last year to 33 per cent because the group is
not making sufficient UK profits to offset against its advanced corporation
tax (ACT).
Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, said: 'We are very concerned with the
level of our tax. It is very difficult in a recession as tough as this to
retain UK profits. However, we are looking at ways of mitigating ACT.'
Sir Eric said the group was looking at three possible solutions: skipping
the dividend payment, issuing convertible loan stock or acquiring UK
businesses.
The convertible loan stock is understood to be the most desirable. Interest
paid on the stock would be tax deductible.
Shareholders would not want the group to pass the dividend, and any
acquisitions through an increase of debt could affect gearing, already at 54
per cent.
Borrowings for the end of March stood at Pounds 450m compared with Pounds
830m of shareholders' funds.
Turnover fell from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 1.6bn and earnings per share
before extraordinary items more than halved from 16.9p to 6.7p.
The interim dividend has been maintained at 8.8p.
The group has had to reduce costs and overheads which has led to the loss of
500 jobs from its 18,000-strong UK workforce and 250 out of the 10,000
employeed overseas.
Sir Eric said the second half would be tough. 'We need further cuts in
interest rates before things are going to get a lot better.'
The recession hit Trafalgar's property and investment division which
suffered a 55 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 127.4m (Pounds 224.6m).
The commercial and residential markets in the US remain slow, although Sir
Eric said there were some signs that the UK market was improving.
In a significant change of policy, certain development properties for sale,
worth around Pounds 200m, are to be reclassified as fixed assets which will
be revalued in September.
The shipping and hotels division was badly affected by the Gulf war.
Group hotels were only half full and profits fell from Pounds 337.6m to
Pounds 290.6m.
Business from the shipping sector, valued in sterling, will now be
calculated in dollars, allowing the group to increase its borrowings in the
US and reduce them in the UK.
The share price rose 6p to 268p.

FT  09 MAY 91 / B&amp;C court ruling may be worth 15p in Pounds to creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and Commonwealth yesterday won its marathon litigation against
Quadrex Holdings of the US and Samuel Montagu, the merchant banking arm of
Midland Bank, in a ruling that could be worth up to 15p in the pound to
creditors of the failed financial services group.
Administrators for B&amp;C argued that Quadrex's failure to complete an agreed
purchase of the moneybrokers division of Mercantile House, which B&amp;C took
over in 1987, had cost it Pounds 200m (Dollars 344m).
However, yesterday's High Court ruling from Mr Justice Gatehouse that B&amp;C
was entitled to damages is not the end of a legal battle which has become
one of the largest civil actions ever fought in the UK courts.
Hearings to assess the amount of damages will take place later this year and
might still have to await the outcome of an appeal should one be launched.
Mr Peter Phillips, a joint administrator of B&amp;C, called the outcome
'satisfactory' for creditors of the group that was once valued at Pounds
2.5bn but collapsed last year owing Pounds 1.2bn.
The creditors are unlikely to see any payments from the Pounds 415m so far
realised from asset sales before the end of 1991.
The ruling will also allow B&amp;C to claim against Samuel Montagu, which acted
as Quadrex's merchant banker during the negotiations between Mr Gary Klesch,
of Quadrex, and Mr John Gunn, the then B&amp;C chairman.
The judge described the frenzied atmosphere during the 1987 negotiations
when the City was in its heyday of takeover activity and undertakings were
made to clinch deals that could not be relied upon.
Mr Justice Gatehouse said Mr Ian McIntosh, the head of corporate finance,
twice told B&amp;C that funds were available to Quadrex for the Pounds 280m
agreed purchase of the wholesale broking division when, in fact, they were
not available.
The judge said he did not believe Mr Gunn and Mr Peter Goldie, the then
chief executive, had acted dishonestly in failing to correct statements made
in the negotiations to the effect that B&amp;C had not been provided by
Mercantile with any financial information about its subsidiaries that was
not then publicly available.
However, he did say that Quadrex was entitled to a reduction in the damages
due to B&amp;C because the two men had not corrected their original statements
when they became aware of further information later in the negotiations.
That reduction should amount to Pounds 20m, the judge said.
Neither B&amp;C nor Quadrex had full information on Mercantile's moneybroking
operations. Mr Gunn was in the process of taking over Mercantile when it was
negotiating with Mr Klesch.
Mr Phillips said the damages could be recovered against either Samuel
Montagu or Quadrex or both. However, once decided, they should be split
evenly between the two defeated parties in the case.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Elf and Enterprise in Dollars 1.35bn agreement: French group
moves to become leading player in North Sea oil production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Aquitaine, the French oil and chemicals group, confirmed yesterday that
it would form a joint venture with Enterprise Oil, the UK oil exploration
and production company, to buy Occidental Petroleum's North Sea assets for
Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 799m). Elf will hold two-thirds of the joint company,
Elf Enterprise Petroleum, and Enterprise a third.
The agreement involves the transfer of part of Enterprise's stake in the
large North Sea Nelson oilfield to the joint venture company. In return, Elf
will reduce its 25 per cent stake in Enterprise to 10 per cent.
The shares will be distributed via an issue of Pounds 438m of exchangeable
bonds to finance the acquisition. The bonds are issued by Elf but convert
into Enterprise shares.
Further financing of Pounds 347m for the asset purchase will initially be
provided by Elf. Enterprise will assume one-third of the burden when it
becomes a shareholder in the new company. The Occidental interests bought by
the new venture include 23.4 per cent of the Claymore field and 36.5 per
cent of the Scapa field. The deal also includes 36.5 per cent of the Flotta
oil pipeline and terminal in the Orkney Islands.
In addition, the sale involves a 36.5 per cent interest in the Piper B,
Saltire A and Chanter fields which are under development, as well as a wide
spread of exploration acreage.
The new venture will hold 19 per cent of the Nelson oilfield.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chief executive, said the company is gaining 'a
broader, more balanced portfolio of assets with earlier production'.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Hopes are high for a joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Enterprise Petroleum, the joint venture company set up to buy
Occidental's UK oil and gas assets, will be a leading player in the North
Sea. It will have estimated reserves of 300m barrels of oil and production
is expected to peak at 100,000 barrels a day (b/d) in 1995, writes Deborah
Hargreaves.
It is a smart, strategic step for Elf, which has been energetically pursued
by its chairman, Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent. The deal satisfies the company's
aim to become a leading operator in the UK. But Elf is paying a full price
for its North Sea ambitions.
The deal values Enterprise's Nelson interest at more than Pounds 600m as
part of an overall agreement which will pay Dollars 4.50 to Dollars 5 a
barrel for proven oil reserves. This values Occidental's assets higher than
most analysts had predicted: they had put the price at Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds
651m), Dollars 250m less than the joint venture is paying.
'This underpins the value of the industry sub-sector,' said Mr Fergus
McLeod, oil analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh.
The deal will boost Enterprise's production profile just when it begins to
sag in 1993 by adding an additional 25,000 b/d to output as some of
Occidental's assets come on stream.
It will also speed up cash flow to the company if the new venture makes a
profit in three years, as the companies expect.
The deal prompted the City to raise its earnings forecasts for Enterprise
next year by about 5 per cent to 42.5 pence a share. Initially, it also
reflected well on the share price which rose to 570p. However, shares
dropped back to close at 556p, slightly below Tuesday's level.
A big benefit for the UK independent oil group is that the deal removes a
potential predator. The presence of the Elf stake has cast a cloud over the
company's shares for months.
Elf has said it will retain its 10.1 per cent stake in Enterprise as an
investment, and the French company must consult its British partner if it
decides to sell.
But Enterprise also stressed yesterday that it had an escape clause allowing
it to leave the joint venture within 90 days at any time. The clause has
prompted some analysts to question how long the marriage of convenience may
last.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Labour clash with Tories on taxation: Kinnock speech
provokes fierce battle of claims and counter-claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIERCE political dispute over tax and spending policy gathered pace
yesterday as senior Tory ministers poured scorn on Mr Neil Kinnock's claim
that economic growth and a freeze on tax rates would generate Pounds 20bn in
revenue for better social services.
While Conservatives dismissed the Labour leader's projections of a 2 1/2 per
cent a year growth rate as unrealistically optimistic, he charged that a new
tax-cutting Tory government would be forced to axe spending on social
services.
Meanwhile, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, warned in a speech in
London to the Royal Institute of Public Administration that the Tory target
of cutting basic rate tax to 20p would mean Pounds 29bn in lost revenues
over a five-year parliament.
As the political temperature rose, speculation that a June election could
not yet be entirely ruled out re-emerged with the release of Tory figures
claiming its local election losses still indicated a narrow 20-seat majority
at a general election.
The prospect was dismissed by senior ministers, who said that, even with a
good result at next week's Monmouth by-election, the earliest date would be
in the autumn.
The tax-cuts-versus-services row began after Labour officials on Tuesday
released highlights of a keynote lecture on the party's social policies,
delivered by Mr Kinnock to a Community Care Journal annual conference in
London last night.
In the speech, the Labour leader attacked the Tories for reiterating their
promise to reduce tax. 'A government cannot raise standards of public
services which are currently underfunded and at the same time cut taxation,'
he said.
'And a government which pledges tax reductions must say just what essential
services are to be cut to pay for them.'
In their place he pledged that Labour would maintain the real value of tax
allowances and 'keeping tax rates where they are, an average growth rate in
the economy of 2.5 per cent will generate Pounds 20bn of revenue for the
Exchequer'.
This had already provoked a flurry of counter claims from the Tories, with
Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary, saying Labour governments were
incapable of producing such growth rates.
Speaking in Monmouth, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, cast doubt on
Labour's spending plans while indicating that the Conservatives did not
necessarily guarantee to cut tax to 20p in the course of a single
parliament.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Spain calls for solution on Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENT over Gibraltar was now the only important obstacle to better
relations between Britain and Spain, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime
minister, said in London yesterday. He said Madrid was waiting for London to
make a move to solve this 'historical anachronism'.
The Spanish leader stressed after talks on Tuesday with Mr John Major, the
prime minister, that London and Madrid were in broad agreement on the future
economic and monetary development of the European Community. Both
governments considered it would be a mistake to rush into full monetary
union before achieving greater convergence between the economies of members.
There were continuing differences over the organisation of European defence.
Although Spain agreed with Britain that Nato should not be undermined by any
new European defence arrangements, Mr Gonzalez said he could not imagine a
common European foreign policy that was not complemented by a common defence
policy.
Although Mr Gonzalez declined to give any details of his discussions with Mr
Major on Gibraltar, he made clear, both in an interview with the Financial
Times and at a press conference, that Spain was not prepared to wait
indefinitely for a solution to the problem. Spain has a long-standing demand
for sovereignty of the Rock. The Spanish prime minister indicated that he
was looking for step-by-step progress, starting with the joint use of
Gibraltar airport.
Mr Gonzalez issued a thinly-veiled warning that Spain might take retaliatory
measures if Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's prime minister, went ahead with
plans to establish a modern off-shore financial centre on the Rock and to
reclaim land on its east coast.
He hinted that Spain could neutralise the tax advantages Gibraltar offers on
investments in Spain channelled through the Rock.

FT  09 MAY 91 / US to renew campaign for lower world interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US intends to renew its campaign for a commitment by leading industrial
countries to a growth strategy involving lower world interest rates, in
spite of a bruising confrontation over the issue at the recent meeting of
Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers.
Germany, supported by Japan and Britain, rejected the call made by Mr
Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, for a shift in emphasis towards
tackling slower growth rather than inflation.
Senior US officials concede that they failed to persuade the other G7
members of their case in what non-US participants described as a tense and
difficult discussion. However, the US intends to revive the issue at the
summit of the heads of government of the G7 countries - the US, Japan,
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - in London in mid-July.
The US tactics are apparently not to take a high profile on the issue for
the time being, partly for fear of worsening divisions and in the hope of
winning people round in time. Instead it plans to pursue the matter behind
the scenes through the 'sherpas' or senior officials who prepare the summit
agenda.
The US case is that there is a serious shortage of investment capital. Much
less money is available from such traditional sources as the Arab oil
producing states, Japan and Germany, but that big demands exist in the
Middle East, eastern Europe and Latin America.
US officials stress current high real interest rates in Europe and note that
banks will not undertake sufficient cross-border lending.
The US argues that the current European, and especially German, strategy is
too heavily determined by the desire to fight inflation - which is already
low - and that it ignores the real difficulties.
The US urges industrial countries to shift to what it sees as a more
forward-looking strategy to solve the difficulties of growth in the 1990s.
US officials see such an approach as important also for sustaining economic
and political reform in eastern and central Europe. Such a dynamic approach,
officials believe, would at least provide hope for expansion rather than
what they see as an over-emphasis on inflation.
Some of these issues may be taken up in a speech which President George Bush
plans to deliver on Sunday on the economics of the new world order.
The administration has been talking about signs of recovery in the US
economy but is concerned that any improvement may be delayed and may not be
strong if the European and Japanese economies are weaker.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER seven coalmines are to close over the next year with the possible
loss of up to 6,000 jobs, British Coal disclosed yesterday.
Confirmation of the closures, already announced locally, came at a meeting
of the Commons energy select committee.
Mr Kenneth Moses, British Coal's company's technical director, told the
committee that seven pits around the country were scheduled for closure,
reducing the total number functioning to 62.
A British Coal official later said that the likely reasons for closure would
be the exhaustion of recoverable reserves. The closures had been negotiated
with unions locally, and there were no appeals.
Miners affected by the closures would be offered early retirement or
alternative work, and no compulsory redundancies were expected.
The pits scheduled for closure are in several regions, including the
north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and south Wales. They are Dawdon, Barnsley
Main, Denby Grange, Dinnington, Sutton Manor, Allerton Bywater, and
Penallta.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, was also questioned by the committee
on the likely shape of Britain's coalmining industry as negotiations get
under way with PowerGen and National Power on future coal demand.
Under questioning, Mr Clarke said it was impossible to predict the future
size of the industry prior to the outcome of talks with the generating
companies.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Yugoslav PM backs army role in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE, BRUSSELS,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YUGOSLAVIA'S army was last night given full backing by Mr Ante Markovic, the
prime minister, in an attempt to stop the spread of ethnic conflict which
has brought the country to the brink of civil war.
At the same time, he called for the disarming of all citizens following last
week's violent clashes between Serbs and Croats which left 18 dead.
His move came as Britain sought a European-wide initiative to resolve the
crisis. It has asked its European Community partners to consider a possible
mediating role for the 34-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe. All the EC countries are members of CSCE, which also includes the
Soviet Union, Canada and the US.
Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, appealed for an end to
violence as a means of solving the ethnic disputes, the worst since the
Second World War.
Mr Markovic, who presented his five-point plan to the federal government,
said: 'Conditions should be created for the Yugoslav People's Army to act
according to the constitution and the federal law to carry out its basic
functions - the defence of the borders, and in this situation, it is also to
stop inter-ethnic armed conflict.'
The army has wanted to impose a state of emergency. However, this requires
the consent of the collective presidency - consisting of representatives
from the six republics and two provinces - which so far has refused.
The deadlock has encouraged some army factions to consider imposing martial
law.
Admiral Stane Brovet, the deputy defence minister, warned parliament
yesterday that the army was losing patience.
Mr Markovic's statement is aimed at a compromise between the army and the
presidency. By spelling out the role of the army, he may hope to win
constitutional backing for the military to quash unrest, but not impose a
state of emergency.
He said that 'any attempts (by the republic or individuals) to change 'the
internal or external borders of the country' would not be tolerated.
The crisis has been sparked by sharp political differences between Croats
and Serbs, the country's two largest ethnic groups.
Britain's mediation attempt, to be put formally to the EC's foreign affairs
council in Brussels next Tuesday, will be the first concerted international
attempt to try to provide Yugoslavia with a forum to find way to resolve its
problems.
However, any efforts to convene a meeting of the CSCE countries will require
the consent of Yugoslavia.

FT  09 MAY 91 / A better balance of rich and poor: Felipe Gonzalez, the
Spanish prime minister, talks to FT writers about Spain's hopes for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FELIPE GONZALEZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's socialist prime minister for nearly nine years,
was on sparkling form when he came to breakfast with FT editors and writers
yesterday. In a forthright exchange, Mr Gonzalez took a colourful swipe at
Britain's inability to influence Gibraltar over the joint use of its airport
and remembered some useful advice Mrs Margaret Thatcher once gave him in the
basement of the British embassy in Moscow.
On the last day of his first official visit to Britain, Mr Gonzalez said it
was necessary that the two intergovernmental conferences planning the
economic and monetary and political union of the European Community, be
agreed at the same time, even though some EC members, including Britain, are
less than enthusiastic about some of the proposals for political union.
Spain would fight hard for the creation of a new tier of poorer EC members
entitled to a greater share of EC funds, suggesting that some richer
countries were extracting more from the EC coffers than they paid in.
Emerging eastern European democracies, he suggested, could not expect the
west to foot the bill for 40 years of communism. Following is part of the
discussion.
Q: What is your timetable for the intergovernmental conferences and what are
your priorities for them?
A: The calendar agreed requires us to finish work on the intergovernmental
conferences at the end of this year and, theoretically at least, these
should be ratified by national parliaments before the end of next year.
I think the conference on economic and monetary union, in spite of being
technically more complicated, could achieve results more easily than the one
on political union, but I don't think there is the slightest possibility
that they would approve one of the conferences and not the other. There
would be several countries that would be against it but this could lead to
the planned end to both conferences being prolonged a little.
Spain is committed to the concept of economic and monetary union but expects
or hopes for a significant increase in Community resources to be transferred
to the less wealthy members. How much of an increase?
We are not talking about the amount right now and it's difficult to
introduce a budget into a treaty. What we are talking about are some
criteria concerned with the construction of what we call European Union.
In Emu, we believe that, alongside economic convergence, there should be a
parallel effort towards cohesion between member states. At this point we
reach an imbalance in the allocations of different countries if you take
into account their relative wealth. We are allocating slightly more than we
get from the Community. We have just under 80 per cent of average EC per
capita income so it's obvious that someone is getting paid more than they
pay in although they have a higher per capita income than we do (mainly)
through restitutions from farm exports.
The Community budget is in crisis this year because of the failure to
control the Common Agricultural Policy. More money will go to the surplus
producers if something is not done to stop this, and Spain is not one of
them?
The situation is much better in relative terms to what we faced in 1987.
Frankly, we want a budget debate this year but it will not really happen
until the end of 1992.
I remember (Italian prime minister) Andreotti in a difficult meeting in
which we were deciding on a pluriannual budget and the Community's financial
imbalances turning to Jaques Delors, who was highly irritated that we had
not resolved the problem and said to him: 'Mr Delors, surely you don't want
us to pay for all our sins in one fell swoop?'
Do you believe the political union being discussed in the IGC should have
competence in defence or not?
This is inevitable. If you really want a common foreign policy it is
difficult to conceive that it would not be accompanied by security and
defence policies. The Community cannot limit its foreign policy to problems
of trade or finance with its trading partners.
The Gulf crisis was a graphic illustration of what could happen to a common
foreign policy without a common defence policy. When the peace was being
negotiated Europe did not exist. The US and the Soviet Union would be at the
table. But Israel and other countries in the region do 70 per cent of their
trade with the EC.
How do you see Nato being organised, being structured in the future?
I think it's best left alone for the time being. Obviously the relationship
between Nato and the Warsaw Pact cannot be maintained as it has in the past.
The thing is how to maintain Nato and create a common foreign and security
policy for the Community.
Douglas Hurd has made a proposal. He says let us concern ourselves with
conflicts out of (Nato) area as a trial. But it's difficult to say then
that, look, this is our common foreign and defence policy - to say that
operations within the zone have nothing to do with common policy.
Do you see the outcome of the IGCs as strengthening the Council of Ministers
vis-a-vis the Commission and the European parliament?
The problem of achieving balance between the institutions is the second
greatest problem facing the political IGC. The Community is being
constructed by virtue of intergovernmental decisions. So it is an expression
of intergovernmentality. I am talking about important decisions. On day to
day decisions you cannot compete with the Commission. The parliament has a
bad reputation with government. A decision was taken, badly timed perhaps,
to elect a body by universal suffrage and the parliament now wants the right
to control an executive. We have to give the parliament some content.
Commission appointments might be confirmed by the parliament. And it will
have powers of co-decision with the Council of Ministers.
If Spain has been helped by membership of the EC how could you deny
membership to countries in eastern Europe?
That's unfair. Spain went through a very deep economic crisis between 1975
and 1985. We got a great deal of moral support, but we never received a
single peseta in assistance.
We should not pull the wool over our own eyes. I don't think (Lech) Walesa
realises that western Europe is not going to foot the bill for 40 years of
communism. Just like it didn't pay for 40 years of Franquismo. No one feels
obliged to pay this bill. And I don't know of a single western European
public sector not in deficit, no matter how rich the country.
Therefore the funds will have to come from the private sector and the
private sector is not going to invest until they see things more clearly (in
eastern Europe).
At one of the funerals in Moscow I met Mrs Thatcher in the basement of the
British embassy. We had been talking for seven years about getting into the
EC. With little time for a detailed briefing, I reminded her of the story
about the crippled man in a wheelchair rolling himself on a pilgrimage. The
chair left the road and he hurt himself but prayed to the Virgin Fatima that
'please don't let anything worse happen to me. I want to be as I was before.
Don't make me lose my arms as well as my legs.'
Mrs Thatcher's reply was intelligent. Entry into the EC, she said, consisted
of two parts. One, agreeing to a whole lot of things to get in and then,
once in, trying to undo all the amazing things you agreed to do in the first
place.
You called upon Britain to show imagination in regard to Gibraltar. Could
you explain?
Without much effort of imagination we could begin joint use of the airport
at Gibraltar. I need an airport in the area. It seems to me to be absolutely
irrational that while we are building a Community I am obliged to build an
airport 20km away from one that already exists. I do not see any reason why
an agreement that has been signed between great Britain and Spain has not
been implemented. We don't need any imagination here, we just need a
decision.
If we look at how the winds of history are blowing it is clear that things
are going to change. Right now we are in a silly impasse. We can agree to
use Heathrow or Barajas jointly but not the airport at Gibraltar. For the
British, Gibraltar is a visit to the dentist once a year when we meet to
talk about it. For us, it is a stone in the shoe all day long.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Last days of the Raj
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the Raj in India is now at hand. That day did not come with
independence in 1947, which was more of a coup d'etat than a revolution. The
departure of the British simply allowed the new Indian elite to assume the
powers and perquisites of the empire. The Nehru dynasty ruled where once the
British viceroy held sway. But the empire is tottering. The principal
question in the forthcoming elections is not who will be in and who out
among the cast of politicians. It is rather whether the replacement for the
Raj is to be a decentralised and economically liberal India or a politically
fragmented and impoverished one.
The British bequeathed to their successors not merely the machinery of a
strong state - a professional army, an independent judiciary and an
uncorrupt bureaucracy - but a panoply of western ideas. The Congress party -
secular, socialist and democratic - seized upon the powers it inherited to
put its acquired ideas into practice.
The term elective dictatorship could never be more appropriately applied
than to Nehru's India. It was his intention to weld Soviet planning on to
the administrative fabric of the British Raj. Periodic plebiscites could not
remedy the evils of excessive centralisation of political, administrative
and economic power, however much they may have ameliorated its effects.
Economic centralisation choked India's economic development; all-Indian
nationalism suffocated the local nationalisms of a heterogeneous
sub-continent containing almost as many people as Sub-Saharan Africa and
Latin America combined; and the ambitions of her rulers, notably those of
Mrs Indira Gandhi, strangled the autonomy of India's inherited institutions.
Over-centralised state
An over-centralised secular state has now produced its antithesis: regional
separatism, Hindu revivalism, political fragmentation and economic disarray.
With its principal institutions - the bureaucracy and the judiciary -
demoralised and corrupted, its ingrained reflexes towards fiscal prudence
and monetary caution enfeebled and its legitimacy corroded, the Raj is now
nearing collapse.
Two of the principal protagonists in the election offer a part of the
solution: Mr Rajiv Gandhi, by his commitment to economic liberalisation, and
Mr Chandra Shekhar, by his commitment to political decentralisation.
Unfortunately, the former is too much the scion of Nehru's centralism and
the latter too much the heir of Nehru's socialism. Neither will provide all
of what is needed.
Job reservation
Meanwhile, Mr V P Singh's commitment to job reservation for the so-called
poor and backward castes, irrespective of individual merit, is a recipe for
administrative disorder and civil strife. Similarly, Hindu revivalism cannot
be the basis of a peaceful state that contains millions of non-Hindus. The
sterility of its politicians is India's tragedy. If they continue to view
politics as about little more than carving up the spoils, they may soon have
no spoils left to carve.
A foreign empire could be relatively centralised. To increase that
centralisation still further, as Mr Nehru then proceeded to do, was a grave
error. To remain democratic, a country as vast as India must become a loose
federation.
Economic liberalism is equally important. This is not merely because the
economy would then work better (though it would); nor because the incentive
to corrupt the bureaucracy would decline (though it would). Economic
liberalism is itself a form of decentralisation. But it is also one that
would allow the combination of economic integration with local political
autonomy.
The alternative to decentralisation and liberalisation will not be the
preservation of India as it is today. It is more likely to be India's
disintegration. That is precisely what is happening to the Soviet Union,
where - as in India - an inherited empire is falling apart. But as a
democracy, India has the institutional framework for peaceful change. The
challenge to India's politicians is to use that advantage before they lose
it.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Poland's struggle for stability: Martin Wolf discusses the
growing political pressures on a government wrestling with resistance to
radical economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'To think that two and two are four
And neither five nor three
The heart of man has long been sore
and long 'tis like to be.'
Poland's search for economic stability is reaching the decisive stage. Those
efforts have been made more difficult by external shocks. But they are
threatened quite as much by internal pressures.
The government is being called upon to pretend, principally for electoral
reasons, that two and two makes, if not the five of A E Housman's poem, at
least four and a half. Agreements were ratified last month on more than
Dollars 1.6bn in new borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and a
reduction of at least 50 per cent in Poland's official external debt. Both
were granted in homage to the zeal of Leszek Balcerowicz, minister of
finance and deputy prime minister in the two post-communist governments. But
some hope, and others fear, that the pilot is now to be tossed overboard and
the course subsequently changed.
A planned meeting of economists convened by the advisory council to
President Lech Walesa was widely expected to initiate that change. But this
meeting was postponed until May 17, following discussion between the
president and the prime minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. Both the idea of
that meeting and its postponement reflect the battle now taking place.
The collapse of Poland's communist regime in 1989 represented the downfall
of an economic system that turned two and two into three. In the last stages
of that collapse the government behaved as if they made five. Since Poland
had long since ceased to be internationally creditworthy, the laws of
economic arithmetic were imposed via accelerating inflation. The efforts of
the two post-communist Polish governments to stabilise the economy involve
the reimposition of the laws of arithmetic overtly, where inflation had
imposed them covertly.
Two and two must make four not only at the level of the economy as a whole,
but also at that of individual enterprises. Under the planned economy the
central authority was supposed to impose discipline upon enterprises. As
authority collapsed, so did the discipline. Structural reform is designed to
substitute the market's invisible hand for the planner's iron fist.
Enterprises will not only be forced to balance their books, but at prices
that reflect economic scarcities.
It has become conventional wisdom that the movement to democracy is a
necessary complement to such radical reforms. One would like to believe
this. But it is probably untrue.
The reforms are imposing upheavals that many find arbitrary. A revolution
supported by the proletariat must reduce the relative position of that class
in favour of a middle and upper-middle class that either does not exist or,
to the extent that it does, consists largely of the communist nomenklatura.
The democratic process allows full expression of the fears of those who can
see what they will lose in the near term; it can barely represent those
whose future gains are obscure or altogether invisible.
It is unlikely to be an accident that many successful stabilisations cum
market-oriented reforms have taken place under authoritarian or
semi-authoritarian regimes (as in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Chile or
Mexico), or under foreign occupation (as in post-war Germany and Japan). It
is similarly no accident that the east Asian record of market-oriented
interventionism, proposed as a model for eastern Europe by Stanley Katz (FT
24 April 1991), is also a record of political authoritarianism.
These were what Deepak Lal of University College London has called
'autonomous' as opposed to 'factional' states.(1) The autonomous state can
serve its own ends, not those of constituents. When an autonomous state is
both benevolent and intelligent (a decidedly rare event, rashly presumed by
most welfare economics to be the norm), it can impose sensible reforms where
a factional state must seek consent.
The experience of Argentina and Brazil, both of which moved from
authoritarianism towards democracy in the 1980s, reveals the dangers.
Half-hearted efforts at stabilisation have brought both states short-term
success, followed by overwhelming political resistance and then reversal.
Each failure reduces the credibility of the next attempt, the ultimate
consequence being not merely economic disarray, but an almost total loss of
faith in democratic political institutions.
The economic disarray is itself important. Along with the cycle of inflation
followed by disinflation go unstable real and nominal interest rates and
wildly varying rates of economic growth. In the presence of such
instabilities long-term investment becomes virtually impossible.
Such a relapse must be the greatest single threat to successful economic
reform in Poland. Unfortunately, the danger is far from remote, for four
reasons:
the delay in completing the stabilisation is eroding both consent and
credibility;
external circumstances have proved highly unfavourable;
there was already a modest relapse in the second half of 1990; and
political pressure for relaxation of the squeeze is building up.
The Polish 'shock' has often been criticised for being too swift. So far as
economic stabilisation and changes in relative prices are concerned, the
opposite is more likely to be true. A population which had gained a
long-sought change in political and economic regime may tolerate a short
shock, even if it is severe, followed by improvement, even if it is limited,
more readily than years of deterioration.
Furthermore, the rapid move to a decentralised economy, now under way, could
not be safely conducted if the relative prices on the basis of which
decisions were to be made were highly distorted, as is noted by Paul Hare
and Gorden Hughes in a paper for the Centre for Economic Policy Research.(2)
What may be justified, instead, are temporary fiscal transfers, aimed at
ensuring that enterprises which are economically valuable in the short term
are not closed down prematurely, this being a recommendation made last year
by John Flemming, now at the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.(3)
The speed with which prices are liberalised is as important for
stabilisation as it is for economic efficiency. In Poland's case the bulk of
the adjustment took place in January 1990 when consumer prices rose 79.6 per
cent, but there have been a number of subsequent adjustments, notably in
January 1991, when they rose by 12.7 per cent.
Mr Balcerowicz refers to such increases as 'not a resurgence of inflation,
but as a 'correction'. He is right. But it is unlikely that the Polish
people will understand the difference. Even now, adjustments that were
partially postponed from earlier in the year need to be made to the domestic
prices of natural gas and electricity.
It is partly because of such shocks that the government is expecting 55 per
cent inflation this year, as against its earlier forecast of 36 per cent.
Even the forecast by the central planning office, under Mr Jerzy Eysmont,
that inflation would exceed 80 per cent is not out of the question.
An important reason for these successive shocks has been the move to dollar
and world prices of imports of Soviet oil. No less important to the Polish
economy has been the associated collapse in exports to the Soviet Union and
the post-communist countries of eastern and central Europe. These external
shocks are a part of the reason why the 12 per cent decline in real Gross
Domestic Product of last year is expected to be followed by, at best, no
growth this year and, at worst, by a further decline of 5 per cent.
External events are not the only reason for continued inflation and economic
decline. In the first half of last year the Polish government over-achieved
on all its stabilisation targets, imposing a far deeper reduction in real
wages and output than it had expected. This was partly because it failed to
foresee the consequences for aggregate supply of the huge changes in
relative prices, as discussed by S Gomulka of the London School of Economics
(4), and partly because of the way state enterprises responded to the
reduction in demand, a point explored by Mark Shaffer, also at the LSE (5).
Meanwhile, inflation fell, more slowly than had been hoped, to a trough of
1.8 per cent in August.
With a presidential election as well, it is little wonder that the
government relaxed fiscal and monetary policy somewhat in the second half of
1990. However understandable, this relaxation proved premature. It had a
noticeable - though modest - effect on output, but a more noticeable one on
inflation, which jumped to about 5 per cent a month.
As a consequence of that relaxation, combined with the external shock,
Poland will be struggling to control high levels of inflation throughout
1991 and probably 1992 as well. In particular, wages in state enterprise are
now under the effective ceiling of a penal tax on increases larger than 60
per cent of the rise in consumer prices. Pressure is now building up against
this deeply unpopular policy.
Pressure is also building up on the exchange rate, which has remained
constant at 9,500 zloties to the dollar since January 1990, even though
nominal wages have increased by more than 150 per cent. If inflation
proceeds as is now expected, a devaluation - and so yet another shock to
inflationary expectations - would seem difficult to avoid, notwithstanding
the denials of the National Bank of Poland.
As if all that were not enough, a parliamentary election is to be fought in
the autumn, with many in the government fearful of the support shown in the
presidential election for Mr Stan Tyminski. People like Mr Eysmont, who is
also a member of the Centre Alliance, an emerging Christian democratic
grouping, argue that Poland needs economic expansion. He regards inflation
as high as 100 per cent this year and 50 per cent next year as acceptable.
Mr Eysmont argues that 'risks must be taken' because 'the greatest danger is
stagflation'. But abandonment of a partially successful stabilisation is
almost certain to bring soaring inflation back once more, as the flight from
the zloty recommences.
The choice that Poland faces is between an unavoidably painful attempt to
eliminate inflation now and a renewed and almost certainly still more
painful (because less credible) attempt to eliminate it next year. The
lesson is not that gradual stabilisation pays, but that it does not. The
question not merely for Poland, but for many other countries too, is whether
fledgling democracies are able to act upon that lesson before they are
forced to learn it.

Michael Heseltine's decision to sit on his hands over the local authority
swaps affair is yet another disaster for the UK banking lobby. The trade
groups representing UK banking interests already had an impressive record of
failure in their Whitehall battles.
The latest setback - which will cost the banks Pounds 550m - came despite
two official visits to the Treasury by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of the
British Bankers Association, and a lobbying campaign by Sir Martin Jacomb,
chairman of the British Merchant Bank and Securities Houses Association.
Even Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, weighed in. All
argued that the affair was harming the City and needed to be righted by
retrospective legislation. But to no avail.
It puts a heavy onus on Sir Nicholas Goodison, the new BBA chairman, to
strengthen the bank lobby's firepower. Early signs suggest he's wasting no
time in rallying his forces and will play a more up-front role.
The Bank of England also might come to regret the way its ineffectiveness in
the affair has damaged its image among its flock, particularly the foreign
bankers who turned to it for help. As one said: 'The BBA described this as
regrettable. Personally, I'd have used the word disgusting.'

Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, occupies a red-hot seat. His
task of pushing through a plan to end the Soviet crisis will test the
thickness of his skin and unflappability of his demeanour, besides the depth
of his sardonic wit.
He confesses no great desire to stay in the post, restrained from
resignation only by reluctance to waste precious time which, he says, is of
the essence in saving the economy.
As finance minister, Pavlov was frustrated by the procrastinations of the
previous government under Nikolai Ryzhkov, which 'wasted six months in
discussions'. He should be used to it. In various top posts over the last
decade, he saw price reform regularly promoted to the top of the political
agenda, only to be relegated again.
The first reform package was prepared in the last years of Leonid Brezhnev.
Price lists were printed, but the plan died along with Brezhnev because the
Politburo thought successor Yuri Andropov would be blamed for it.
Resurrected under Konstantin Chernenko, reform again fell prey to mortality.
Exhumed under Gorbachev, new price lists also reached the printer but were
pulped after a central committee thumbs-down in 1988.
Last month, under Pavlov, reform was finally pushed through. It has made him
as popular as a mosquito on a summer evening but at least he made it while
Gorbachev was in good health.

Aptly named Larry Speakes, who put his own words into Ronald Reagan's mouth
while serving as the US president's chief spokesman, has found a new job
that will carry his voice to British ears. He is to be communications
vice-president of Canadian telephone-equipment group Northern Telecom, which
lately bought control of STC.
Little has been heard of him in the three years since he quit as public
relations chief at Merrill Lynch amid a fuss over his book, Speaking Out, in
which he admitted occasionally inventing Reaganisms.
One came in 1985 when, feeling the president was being upstaged by Mikhail
Gorbachev in their summit meeting, Speakes spread the myth that Reagan had
told the Soviet leader: 'There is much that divides us, but I believe the
world breathes easier because we are talking here together.' Speakes later
acknowledged he was wrong 'to take such liberties'.
Northern Telecom, for one, has clearly forgiven him. Its chairman, Paul
Stern, says his new mouthpiece is an experienced professional who will be 'a
real asset'.

At 80, Lord Kearton may have long ceased treating Courtaulds as his personal
domain. But the appointment of Sipko Huismans as its chief executive shows
he still has influence over its fate.
It was Kearton, a colossus of post-war industrial Britain, who first spotted
Dutch-born Huismans in 1961. At the time, he was 21 and a 'very bad chemist'
with a Courtaulds offshoot in Swaziland. But Kearton saw a latent sales and
marketing man hiding inside and brought him to England.
What caught Kearton's eye? Dynamism, he recalls, ability and an
irrepressibly adventurous approach. All of which paints Huismans very
differently from the cerebral, precise and very English Sir Christopher
Hogg, another Kearton recruit who has been chairman and chief executive for
nearly 12 years.
Hogg, 54, says it is time to give someone else a go. He will remain chairman
of Courtaulds and of Courtaulds Textiles, which was successfully hived off
last year. With the chairmanship of Reuters also in his quiver, he claims he
has no immediate ambition elsewhere.
He describes his successor as 'a bloody good decision-maker with great
judgment'.
The new chief executive, for his part, remembers travelling in the lift with
Kearton, dreaming of the job which will be his from August. 'I have wanted
to be here for 30 years. We will see how things go but seven or eight years
in the seat may be enough.'
He has been on the board since 1984 and managing director of the speciality
materials business since last year's de-merger. And while he does not
envisage any shake-up in strategy or personnel, his appointment as the first
non-Brit to the top job in Hanover Square seems appropriate.
'When Chris arrived,' he says, 'Courtaulds was a UK business with overseas
offshoots. I take over when two-thirds of sales and more than half the
workforce are outside the UK.'
His five languages should come in handy.

The pairing of double bass virtuoso Dave Holland and the edgy New York
altoist Steve Coleman is an unlikely success given their disparate
backgrounds. Holland is older, English and records for ECM, the sometimes
ascetic German label. Coleman is a young black American at the hub of the
burgeoning New York jazz movement, the so-called M-Base collective. But,
coloured by the electric guitar and drums of Kevin Eubanks and Marvin
'Smitty' Smith, their music meshes.
The quartet's wonderful ECM album of last year, 'Extensions', has already
showed that Holland is barely a leader here - all four musicians contributed
to the writing - and that the quartet is definitely not a vehicle for the
Englishman. Monday's performance, the start of a two-week residency at
Ronnie's, demonstrated just how dynamic a leaderless quartet of diverse
talent can sound live.
Holland, now resident in the US, plays pungent lines which are rich in
melody and tone. By contrast, Coleman's phrasing is angular and cagey.
Eubanks, standing, carves out heavy, rocky electric guitar breaks and, when
sitting, uses his many pedals to add colour and scenery to Holland and,
particularly, Coleman, during their solos.
Smith, barely visible behind a towering kit, directs the rhythm with an
urgency more in keeping with fellow M-Baser Coleman's playing than
Holland's.
Holland plays a great deal and his parts are long and strong. But because
the personnel apparently enjoy each other's material and tough playing so,
the music is more densely layered than a quartet usually produces.
No individual works up a real lather but then you wouldn't expect that from
the combined but barely controlled cool of ECM and the Macro-Basic Array of
Structured Extemporisation.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Accountancy Column: Close relationships produce successful
audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON APRIL 25 this column carried a series of proposals for change in the
auditing regime suggested by Mr James Leek of Caparo Industries. Similar
proposals have in recent months been put forward with renewed enthusiasm by
various individuals, including Mr Austin Mitchell, the indefatigable Labour
MP for Great Grimsby. If we are to improve auditing rather than run the risk
of destroying much that is good, we must identify the real problems, their
causes and the actions needed to address them.
There are three real issues.
Companies occasionally fail soon after the publication of accounts that give
no warning of impending disaster.
Estimates and values reported in accounts are on occasion found to be badly
wrong.
Those suffering loss are sometimes frustrated by their inability to gain
restitution.
The third complaint is different in nature from the other two; any
allocation of loss is properly a matter for resolution by the courts.
We firmly believe that auditor independence, or rather a supposed lack of
it, does not lie at the root of these ills. We are not aware of any cases in
which the auditor of a public company has been found not to be acting
independently of management. The strength of the UK accounting profession,
its very high ethical standards, the independence and scepticism inculcated
through the auditor's training - and awareness of the public need - ensure
that concerns over independence are of no practical significance except in
the rarest of cases.
We are not alone in that view. Successive commissions and congressional
hearings in the US have considered and rejected precisely those proposals
for change in the audit regime which are re-emerging from some quarters.
We must work together, however, to deal with the real troubles, which we
identify as follows. First, and of most significance, there are difficulties
in reflecting the realities of modern, complex and rapidly changing
businesses in the snapshot provided by the annual report. Uncertainties over
the ultimate outcome of unfinished business are often at the root of those
handicaps.
Some of the obstacles stem from limitations in the accounting process. The
Accounting Standards Board is pursuing improvement vigorously. In
particular, it is placing greater emphasis on the value of accounts for
forward-looking decision makers.
Management and auditors need to work together in determining how best to
portray the realities of complex businesses in the annual report. The
auditor faces a challenge of needing to get a close knowledge of the
business and the confidence of its senior management, while retaining
independence of viewpoint. Distancing the auditors from the business and
replacing them regularly would only increase the likelihood that they would
fail to understand and spot any shortcomings.
There is a second, and far less common, problem: deliberate
misrepresentation on the part of management. We cannot build an audit regime
around the assumption that all management is crooked just to try to catch
the tiny minority that is.
In the nature of management fraud, there is rarely much to be gained by
discovering it after the event. The loss will have already been incurred.
What is required is to work with the corporate sector in developing a
control environment that minimises the opportunities for fraud. Getting
close to, but not cosy with, the company is the answer because the last
thing the fraudster wants is someone of integrity getting close to his or
her operations. Companies with a weak control environment are exposed to
undue risk and the shareholders should be told.
So much for the general nature of the issues. What specific actions can be
taken to respond? Two constructive proposals were made in the Dell report
sponsored by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte in 1987, entitled The Audit Judgment
and its Communication.
First, in response to the need to give as much warning as possible of
impending trouble, we recommended that the directors' report should contain
a formal statement that the directors have reviewed properly prepared
internal budgets and other relevant information, and are reasonably
satisfied that the company will be able to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future. The auditors should be required to review that statement
and to report if they believe it to be unjustified.
Second, in order to ensure a control environment that minimises the risk of
fraud, the directors and auditors could report on the adequacy of all the
company's key financial information systems used in planning and managing
the business. Care would be needed to establish a practical yet worthwhile
regime. Developments on those lines are being pursued in the US.
That leaves the third difficulty of those people who have suffered a loss
and are seeking restitution. That is a different case because there is an
important distinction between the confidence to rely on a good audit having
been done and the ability to sue in the rare event that it has not. Auditors
will continue to pursue the highest standards both because of the damage to
their reputation if they do not and because it is open to the company to sue
them for any negligence.
The question of who else may be able to sue auditors if they have also
suffered loss should be considered and decided in the light of developments
generally in civil law. It has long been established that it would be
unreasonable to expose providers of services to negligence claims from
anyone and everyone who may be able to argue that a loss could in part be
traced back to faulty provision of that service. There must be boundaries,
and those may change with time and circumstance, but the value of the audit
is in no way dependent on who can sue to recover loss in the rare event of
shortcomings in the provisions of that service.
I conclude that in facing up to the questions of inadequate accounts, far
from distancing auditors from the company, we need a close working
relationship between auditors and senior management.
In the vast majority of cases, both are seeking to improve reporting, and
the accounts will be better for working together. In those few where
management misrepresent, the auditors will discover that more easily the
closer they are to the company's affairs. Professional auditors are
specifically trained to handle such relationships properly and positively -
the evidence shows that, overwhelmingly, they succeed.
Brian Jenkins is head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the chartered
accountants and management consultants.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plan to introduce
ministerial policy teams - Civil Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will raise the public esteem of civil servants, review but not revoke
the move to administrative agencies and broaden the political input to
decision-making through ministerial policy teams, Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, said yesterday.
The proposals came in what was Labour's first important statement on
government administration, delivered in a keynote speech last night to the
Royal Institute of Public Administration.
In a clear effort to differentiate Labour's approach from that of the
Tories, Mr Smith argued that the 1980s had seen a fashion for disparaging
the work of the public sector. 'The case for efficient, adequately resourced
and highly motivated public services is neither hard to explain nor
difficult to justify,' he argued.
Yet in recent speeches, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr John Major,
the prime minister, had continued to stress that the government was still
committed to reduce the size of the administration.
'It is certain that significant cutbacks will be necessary if the
Conservatives are to achieve their goal of a basic tax rate of 20 pence,' Mr
Smith warned.
Putting the case for devoting the 'growth dividend' to investment and
improvement in public services, he said that Tory efforts to achieve private
affluence 'ignore the risks of public squalor.'
Labour would attempt to keep pay 'broadly comparable with equivalent
movements elsewhere.' Acknowledging that there remained scope for improved
efficiency, he endorsed a recent speech by Lord Armstrong, the previous head
of the civil service, for more training.
Tackling the issue of political input to policy making, Mr Smith backed the
Treasury select committee's recommendation of Ministerial Policy Units
comprising both political appointees and career civil servants.
On new administrative agencies, he hinted that Labour would not scrap the
system, though their role would be reviewed. What was vital was that
agencies were not a first step to privatisation.
In his concluding remarks, Mr Smith emphasised that at least some of the
problem of accountability would be resolved by a new Freedom of Information
Act, to be introduced by Labour in the first session of a new parliament.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lang seeks to head off dispute over
devolution - Scottish Conservatives' Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday sought to quash speculation
that the party leadership in Scotland was softening its opposition to
devolution.
In a speech to the party's annual conference in Perth, however, he
concentrated his fire on the assembly with tax-raising powers proposed by
the other Scottish parties in the Constitutional Convention.
He acknowledged that the government would listen, if sceptically, to
suggestions for a deliberative assembly as part of its plans to restructure
local government in Scotland.
Mr Lang's speech, marking the start of the three-day conference, was
designed to head off a damaging row in the party over devolution in the run
up to the general election.
Recent comments by party officials suggesting a more responsive approach to
the issue have provoked a fierce response from the Thatcherite wing of the
party.
In yesterday's conference debate, a number of speakers suggested that the
planned move to single-tier local authorities in Scotland would leave a gap
that could be filled by some form of national representation in Edinburgh.
Mr Michael Hirst, the president of the Scottish associations, made a coded
appeal for a wider debate by opening the conference with the comment that:
'It is through examining, debating and justifying our policy positions that
we can be sure that our policies are right for Scotland.'
Mr Lang, however, insisted that the review of local government structure
would not become 'the Trojan horse of a tax-raising Scottish assembly'.
Devolved powers for Scotland, he added, could only be accepted in the
context of a similar trend across the whole of the UK.
The divisive potential of the issue was underlined by repeated statements by
Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, denying recent press
speculation that he is in favour of a move towards Scottish devolution.
Mr Patten denied that he had even 'thought, let alone said anything', on the
subject.
The conference opened with the latest opinion polls showing the
Conservatives holding some 24 per cent of the vote. That remains well above
the level last year when Mrs Margaret Thatcher's unpopularity pushed it down
to about 17 per cent, but it has dropped back from the 26 per cent the
Tories achieved in the wake of Mr John Major's succession to Downing Street.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fumbling for the keys to
long-locked doors - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mrs Margaret Thatcher travelled north to the Scottish Conservative
party's conference in Perth four years ago it was to launch her triumphant
campaign for the 1987 general election.
Triumphant, that is, in England. Four weeks later her party secured a
majority of 100 at Westminster. Its representation in Scotland was halved to
just 10 of the 72 seats.
Tomorrow, Mr John Major will follow not so much in as around her footsteps.
He will pledge to preserve her legacy while defending his decision to sink
the poll tax flagship she launched on the Clyde.
He will be as staunch as his predecessor in his defence of the Union, but
will signal that he intends, unlike her, to be a prime minister who can
safely walk the streets of Scotland.
After last week's local election results in England and Wales, he cannot
promise a general election majority of one hundred seats.
But his hope is that a different brand of Conservatism will prevent the
party's extinction north of the border. There is talk that, for the first
time since 1979, the Tories might, just might, actually win a few more seats
in Scotland.
There are risks as well as opportunities for Mr Major. Just as Mrs
Thatcher's departure has allowed English cabinet ministers to peer into
previously darkened corridors, so too some in the Scottish party are
fumbling for the keys of long-locked doors.
The most important, and most firmly bolted, is marked Devolution. It is a
word that Mr Major's predecessor ordered struck from the party's political
vocabularly, but one that remains on the lips of 80 per cent of Scottish
voters.
The mere mention of an Edinburgh assembly by some party officials - notably
Michael Hirst, president of the Scottish association - provoked a storm from
the loyalist right.
The Young Conservatives, who seem to believe that the party has failed in
Scotland only because it has not been sufficiently Thatcherite, has launched
a pre-emptive 'Scotland is British' campaign. In typically eloquent
language, it says that the Scottish Constitutional Convention - which the
Tories have boycotted - is seeking to turn the country into a 'mini-Albania
where socialism reigns supreme'.
Mr Chris Patten has found himself charged by Scottish members of the No
Turning Back Group (leading supporter Scottish Office Minister Mr Michael
Forsyth) as the architect of a plot to persuade Mr Major to ditch the Union.
Judging by the mood of some of the right-wing activists at yesterday's
proceedings, that charge will be laid against anyone who admits to even
thinking about the subject.
But in a party which has seen its base shrink dramatically since 1979, the
activists and the diehards have become almost synonymous.
Evidence from the opinion polls is that Tory voters - and many more have
been prepared to admit their allegiances since Mr Major entered Downing
Street - believe that now the key has been turned in the lock, the door
cannot simply be slammed shut again.
They find it strange that in Scotland, the Conservatives are forced to
suppress the sense of national identity that sustains the party south of the
border. Their understanding of history is more acute than that of their more
outspoken activists - the 1707 Act of Union that is supposedly so sacrosanct
to the Young Conservatives provided for substantial self-government.
A prime minister who has promised not to lecture but to listen to the voters
will find it hard to ignore the views of the four-fifths of the Scottish
population who want stronger representation in Edinburgh. Nor does Mr Major
share the centralist instincts that forced Conservatism and devolution into
conflict during the 1980s.
Mr Ian Lang - and Mr Patten - ruled out again the assembly with tax-raising
powers sought by the opposition parties in the Convention. They were
careful, however, not to dismiss entirely the prospect that the
reorganisation of local government in Scotland into single-tier authorities
could leave a gap for some form of national representation in Edinburgh.
If Mr Major wants to win votes in Scotland he might be wise to do the same.
If he wished, the prime minister might even quote Mrs Thatcher: 'The
establishment of a Scottish assembly must be a top priority to ensure that
more decisions affecting Scotland are taken in Scotland by Scots.'
Her words, spoken in Edinburgh in 1975, were probably drafted by Mr Patten,
then a humble central office speechwriter.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories in 'band' criticism: Council
Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers joined with Labour MPs yesterday in criticising the narrow
base of the new council tax which the government is proposing to introduce
as a replacement for the poll tax.
Mr Steven Norris (C Epping Forest) called for the number of property
valuation bands to be increased from seven to nine, with Pounds 20,000
introduced as the new base, and Pounds 250,000 and over as the top range.
Changes were also advocated by Mr Roger Sims (C Chislehurst) who complained
that retention of the seven bands would result in people in his constituency
with modest properties being placed in the same category as those in
'millionaires row'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the government had looked
at 'various permutations' and had concluded that the seven-band arrangement
(with Pounds 160,000 at the top of the range) was the most appropriate.
He promised that if the consultation process being undertaken by the
government indicated that there were specific areas in which the capital
value process needed modification 'we will look at that'.
Mr Heseltine said as the tax was designed for local authorities to
administer and collect, it was appropriate for the government to proceed by
consultation and not imposition.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, argued that the seven-band
range reflected the government's determination to retain the poll tax
principle by ensuring that the rich be protected from paying their 'full
whack'.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, stressed that those in the
most expensive properties would pay 2 1/2 times as much as those in the
least expensive properties.
He said this was 'a very fair apportionment of the burden'.

FT  09 MAY 91 / BMA to demand suspension of NHS reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS' leaders will today ask Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary,
to suspend progress on the government's National Health Service reforms and
examine alternative ways of improving the service.
Representatives of the British Medical Association will meet Mr Waldegrave
in an atmosphere of political tension over the reforms, which took effect
only five weeks ago. Two of the new self-governing hospital trusts formed as
part of the changes have already announced up to 1,000 job losses, and the
Universities Funding Council has expressed concern that the reforms might
damage medical education.
The BMA, which lost all contact with the government during its campaign of
opposition to the health reforms, will offer to take part in joint talks
with the government to explore alternative ways of improving services to
patients.
In return, it wants Mr Waldegrave to 'urgently review the consequences of
the internal market concept' on which the reforms - which separate the
funding of health care from its supply - are based. It will also call on the
health secretary to stop preparing to introduce further self-governing trust
hospitals and GP fund holders next year.
Relations between the medical profession and government have improved since
Mr Waldegrave became health secretary. Although he has shown willingness to
examine the progress of the reforms with the BMA, he is unlikely to respond
favourably to demands to suspend their development.
Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the BMA council, said the 'current chaos'
in the NHS was a direct result of imposing an unworkable administrative
system on a service that was already facing financial crisis.
'The government has got it wrong because it did not listen,' he said.
North Western regional health authority has appointed British Airways to
advise on ways of improving services to patients.
The airline will adapt its customer services training courses to help
develop similar initiatives in the health sector.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Rolls-Royce feels the pinch of recession: Paul Betts looks
at the effects of the squeeze in aviation and defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the world airline and defence industries has hit
Rolls-Royce with a vengeance. For the first time since its bankruptcy 20
years ago, the company warned yesterday that it might be forced to make
compulsory redundancies to reduce its 34,000-strong workforce by 6,000
people in its aerospace division by the end of this year.
During the previous downturn in the commercial aerospace business in the
early 1980s, Rolls-Royce managed to reduce staff without resorting to
enforced redundancies. Sir Ralph Robins, the company's chief executive, said
yesterday he hoped the company would again be able to achieve the cuts by
voluntary means.
Yet it seems unlikely that Rolls-Royce will manage to cut its aerospace
workforce by 18 per cent by the end of this year without compulsory
redundancies. An early-retirement package and a short-service termination
scheme will both run out at the end of June. So far, only 1,400 out of the
6,000 employees have agreed to leave voluntarily.
Rolls-Royce also announced a freeze on pay for all employees for six months.
That will be followed by a bonus scheme related to the performance of the
business to be introduced next year, when Sir Ralph hopes to see the first
clear signs of recovery in the civil aviation market.
Rolls-Royce is in a far stronger financial position today than at the time
of its collapse in 1971. Although 24 per cent down from the previous year,
it still reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 176m on sales of Pounds 3.67bn
for 1990, including a Pounds 50m provision to cover restructuring costs. It
has developed a broad product range in its commercial engine business,
increased its market share and expanded into the power generating sector
with its acquisition of NEI Engineering. It has a Pounds 5.7bn order book
with firm orders for 826 civil engines and 170 military engines.
Even so, the company remains more vulnerable to a downturn than its two
larger US competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, in the
cut-throat aero-engine market. It is neither part of a larger diversified
group nor does it have the same broad customer base as its two bigger US
rivals.
Unlike the previous downturn in the industry, both the defence and the civil
sides of the business have declined simultaneously this time. 'In the early
1980s the civil business fell but the defence business remained strong,' Sir
Ralph said. 'Now both sides are down.'
Rolls-Royce started restructuring its Bristol-based military aircraft engine
business last summer when it announced plans to reduce the Bristol workforce
by about 850. Now it plans to reduce the workforce there by a further 1,200.
It also intends to rationalise its overall defence aerospace activities by
progressively running down its helicopter engine plant at Leavesden,
Hertfordshire, which employs 1,750 people, and transferring those operations
to Bristol.
The Gulf conflict has not changed the overall trend of falling military
expenditure by governments. 'We don't know what the bottom for the defence
business will be,' Sir Ralph said. 'We are waiting for the Ministry of
Defence to announce their future defence plans.' The government is expected
to clarify its plans in the next few months.
Although Rolls-Royce remains optimistic about long-term growth prospects for
the civil aircraft and engine markets, it was caught by surprise like the
rest of the industry by the depth of the present airline decline - the worst
since the Second World War. There are still only tentative signs of recovery
in the aviation industry after the collapse in air travel provoked by the
Gulf war, which was compounded by the economic recession in western markets.
Rolls-Royce hopes to see the market pick up again later this year or, more
probably, next year. Meanwhile, it has faced deferments of some engine
orders for Boeing 747 and 757 aircraft as well as Fokker 100 and Boeing 767
jets. Orders for new aircraft and engines are scarce at present. Aircraft
have been grounded because of the financial collapse of some airlines,
including Air Europe and Eastern, both Rolls-Royce engine customers.
'Flying is down by an average of 10 per cent around the world. This has led
to a 15 to 18 per cent reduction in our spares business,' Sir Ralph said.
Rolls-Royce has also had to continue spending heavily on the development of
its new heavy-thrust Trent engine programme - the most powerful variant of
the company's RB211 range - to equip the new generation of large wide-bodied
jets planned by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and the European Airbus
consortium. Rolls-Royce R&amp;D spending totalled Pounds 237m last year compared
with Pounds 161m in 1989.
The wide-bodied aircraft market probably holds the biggest promise of growth
for Rolls-Royce and the other aero-engine makers. The market is estimated to
be worth about Dollars 50bn (Pounds 29bn) between now and the end of the
century.
Sir Ralph believed that Rolls-Royce had a good chance of winning a big slice
of that new market.
'We have now got a wide range of exciting products, a better share of the
market, a strong balance sheet,' he said. He conceded that the company did
not know where the military business was going and was still uncertain about
the timing and strength of the airline recovery. As a result, the company
could not rule out a further round of job cuts next year.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Foreign banks attack inaction on council swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN BANKS operating in the UK yesterday launched a strong attack on the
government for its decision not to act over the local-authority swaps
affair.
In a sharply worded statement, the Foreign Banks and Securities Houses
Association said the decision was 'appalling and represents the worst
possible outcome for the UK and the international banking community'.
It went on to question whether the City of London remained 'a fit and proper
market place for international financial activities'.
The association represents 175 mainly European banks, and some of its
members are among the 80 banks that stand to lose up to Pounds 550m from the
decision.
The statement said the local-authority swaps market had been operating for
more than eight years before the authorities questioned it. The foreign
banks said: 'In our opinion the authorities should not have allowed such a
substantial market to have become established and then turn round and
'erase' it as if it never existed.'
The banks said that the decision meant there was now political risk in
dealing with UK bodies. The affair was causing 'immense concern' to foreign
regulators, and would benefit only financial centres that competed with
London.
On Tuesday, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, decided not to seek
retroactive legislation to validate swaps by local authorities that the Law
Lords ruled were illegal.
Mr Ben Brittain, chairman of the FBSHA, said: 'I would hesitate to say that
my members have been deeply scarred financially by this, but we are deeply
concerned about the principle.'
The British Bankers Association is expected to make a statement today
denying allegations by the government that banks were lax in checking out
the legal status of local-authority swaps.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Trafalgar House urges road financing policy change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, which is bidding to build Britain's first toll motorway,
yesterday called for a radical change of government policy on privately
financed roads.
Sir Eric Parker, the Trafalgar House chief executive, who has been a staunch
supporter of plans to raise private money to build roads, said delays in
getting projects approved by government were undermining investment plans.
He said: 'Ministers need to have a good look at the system. It was easier to
build private roads in the 80s when the economy was better. But the downturn
has made it very difficult for companies to build private roads.'
Sir Eric said bankers' fees had more than doubled during the past two years,
increasing the cost of financing schemes.
He recently met Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, to urge
streamlined government procedures.
The construction, property, shipping and hotels group is a member of one of
three consortia bidding to build a 30-mile toll motorway north of
Birmingham.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Brooke hopeful in spite of Ireland talks stalemate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared confident last
night about the prospects for 'round table' talks between the province's
main political parties.
'We're getting somewhere,' he said as he left the Stormont parliament
building. However, morale about Northern Ireland's political future was low
as stalemate continued over a logistical detail that has delayed the talks.
After a further 6 1/2 hours of bilateral meetings with Mr Brooke, leaders of
the main nationalist and unionist parties failed to agree on the venue for
the Irish government's entry into the talks process.
The dispute underlines the mistrust between the two communities in the
province. Neither wants to be seen as giving way first. Discussions are
still at the 'talks about talks' stage.
Only nine weeks remain before the deadline for the completion of talks, with
discussions on the complex subjects of devolution in the province and a new
Anglo-Irish Agreement still to start.
Ministers believe no side will want the talks to collapse on what seems a
trivial issue.

FT  09 MAY 91 / CBI opposes stricter EC merger rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry made a plea yesterday for little or no
change to the UK's approach to regulating takeovers and mergers.
In its written evidence to the Commons trade and industry committee inquiry
on takeovers and mergers, the CBI said self-regulation was preferred to the
statutory control proposed by the draft European takeover directive.
Any attempts to make the system more rigid so as to make takeovers more
difficult would be strongly opposed by UK business, it said.
Statutory regulation of takeovers would inevitably lead to delay, expense
and increasing resort to litigation during takeovers, as had become the
practice in the US. The Takeover Panel was part of the City's system of
self-regulation and had the advantage of flexibility, allowing a quick
response to changes in the commercial environment.
The CBI said it had 'serious problems' with the draft directive on the
ground that the whole basis of the UK's efficient and flexible approach to
the takeover process and mergers might be at stake under the EC proposals.
The MPs heard an opposing view from BAT Industries, which said the Takeover
Panel was unaccountable and had unfair procedures, and that there was
secrecy and lack of certainty about the way it operated.
The draft takeover directive would cure those defects and present an
opportunity to enhance the quality of the regulation of takeovers in the UK,
it said.
A new body properly constituted and properly accountable to parliament
should be set up to be the UK supervisory body under the European proposals,
it added.

FT  09 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: No attempt to deceive parent bank,
jury told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NATWEST, the merchant banking subsidiary of NatWest Bank, made no
attempt to deceive its parent bank over the handling of the Blue Arrow
rights issue, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday.
NatWest management had access to information about the matter from various
sources and Mr Terence Green, the former NWB deputy chief executive, helped
to redraft a County position paper from which any reference to a guarantee
covering the holding taken in Blue Arrow by County NatWest Securities was
dropped, the jury were told.
Mr Leslie Collett, the former secretary to the County chairman's committee,
agreed with Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director, that
nothing said at any meeting he had attended concerning Blue Arrow led him to
believe NWB was misled.
'I do not believe there was any intention to mislead,' he told the court.
When Mr Jones suggested it was 'transparently obvious' that the parent bank
was fully informed of the situation, Mr Collett replied: 'It is clear they
had information from various sources, yes.'
Mr Collett agreed that at the end of November 1987 he met Mr Green to
redraft the paper on the holdings the County group had taken in Blue Arrow.
The paper was signed by Mr Charles Villiers, the former County chairman, and
was to be submitted to the NWB chairman's committee.
'Mr Green read the paper and made one or two amendments before I took it
back to County to have it retyped,' he said.
Mr Jones asked whether it was Mr Green who had altered the letter to remove
the reference to the indemnity given by County's corporate advisory division
to CNWS.
Mr Collett replied that he could not remember specific amendments, but it
was 'quite possible' that was one of the changes made. He agreed with Mr
Jones that Mr Green was 'very keen to get the paper right for his own
board'.
Mr Collett also agreed with Mr Jones that an argument had arisen within NWB
over what should be told to its UK business committee, which included
non-executive directors among its members.
He agreed that, in conversation with Mr John Minto, personal assistant to Mr
Thomas Frost, NWB chief executive, Mr Minto had discussed removing details
of the original NWB loan to County to underwrite the rights issue from a
report to the business committee.
Mr Collett said Mr Minto supported a confidential approach and that that was
opposed by NWB's domestic banking division, which preferred being open to
the committee.
He denied that it was obvious Mr Minto had been speaking on behalf of Mr
Frost. Mr Minto could have been speaking for Mr Frost, Mr Green or Mr
Charles Green, another NWB deputy chief executive, he said.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities
deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the September
1987 issue.
The trial continues today.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Governor warns of inflation 'false dawn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday warned
against premature optimism about next week's expected sharp fall in
inflation.
'There are inevitably false dawns in the battle against inflation,' Mr
Leigh-Pemberton said at the University of Exeter.
The headline rate, as measured by the retail prices index, is expected to
fall next Friday to around 6.2 per cent in April from 8.2 per cent. The
financial markets have already begun to anticipate that its publication will
serve as a trigger for the Bank to cut the bank base rate below 12 per cent.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said underlying inflationary pressures remained stubborn
in spite of the predicted RPI fall, which he said would reveal 'no more'
than the effect of last year's imposition of the community charge dropping
out of the 12-month figures, aided by recent interest-rate reductions.
In addition, difficulties in measuring inflation accurately provided
policymakers with an incentive to be cautious about easing monetary policy
on the basis of the RPI alone.
The RPI had failed to reflect the sharp rise in house prices in late 1988
and early 1989, then had failed to come down as prices responded to the
tightening of monetary policy.
The governor urged policymakers to look at a broad range of official
indicators.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Shrian Oskar, a businessman, was sentenced to three years' jail at the
Old Bailey yesterday after a jury found him guilty of forgery and on two
counts of perverting the course of justice.
The court had been told that, using a forged affidavit, he had hoped to
overturn a two-year sentence imposed in 1985 for dishonesty and to fight
extradition proceedings launched by the Australian government.
Dr Oskar is already serving six years after being convicted last autumn of a
Pounds 400,000 fraud on Midland Bank.
After that trial, the home secretary issued a deportation order against him.
Judge Lawrence Verney, the Recorder of London, said yesterday the three-year
term should be concurrent with Dr Oskar's existing sentence so that the
deportation order was carried out at the earliest opportunity.

Half of the association's members report that business is still down in all
sectors, particularly vehicles. But they expect an upturn in the next
quarter.
Mr Brian Hassell, association chairman, said the recent fall in interest
rates was encouraging because it eased the financial burden on highly geared

THE GOVERNMENT yester-day ordered a review of the schools inspectorate which

Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said the review would cover 'all
possible options for an inspectorate capable of delivering an effective
system of quality control'.
Mr Eric Bolton, head of the inspectorate, will retire in August, and one of
his deputies will be appointed temporary head until the review is finished.
The inspectorate has often criticised the state of schools, and Mr Clarke
was immediately attacked by the National Union of Teachers for 'punishing'
the inspectorate for being 'too honest, too often'.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Brown envelopes seal future of commercial TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BROWN envelopes that will determine the fate of the UK's 16 commercial
television companies will be opened next Thursday.
The envelopes will contain bids that might commit applicants to paying the
government a total of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn for a 10-year commercial
broadcasting licence from the beginning of 1993. There are expected to be 35
to 40.
The ceremonial opening of the bids by the Independent Television
Commission's chairman, deputy chairman, chief executive and secretary is
part of the process of validating information submitted by applicants. Bids
will be checked, then locked in a safe.
So far, the gaze of the television industry has fixed on one date and time -
noon on Wednesday, May 15, the deadline for bids. Less attention has been
given to what happens next, how the commission will handle the mountain of
paperwork that will be delivered on Wednesday morning and how the commission
will make decisions.
A careful procedure will tend to place a greater emphasis on highest bids
than has been widely realised before.
Some ministers have backtracked in private on the wisdom of the Broadcasting
Act's provision that each licence will go to the highest bidder that reaches
a quality threshold, unless there are exceptional circumstances such as an
underbidder offering exceptionally high programme quality.
The commission is clear on the issue. Whatever ministers say, it has to
implement the law to the letter if it is to avoid having its decisions
challenged in the High Court. Until recently there was a feeling in the
independent television industry that somehow deals could be done to prevent
too many ITV companies losing their franchises.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, appeared to encourage that
view when he was broadcasting minister by suggesting that continuity of the
network might be a reason for setting aside a highest bid under the
exceptional-circumstances clause. The commission believes 'continuity'
cannot be legally defined. It will decide, franchise area by franchise area,
without considering what effect those decisions are having on the overall
shape of the ITV network.
Mr David Glencross, the ITC's chief executive, said: 'What we are really
saying is that the quality threshold is similar to what has already been
achieved and that those who get over it will be able to provide a service at
least as good as people get now.'
The commission believes that the demands on applicants and the costs
involved in mounting a bid for a large region - up to Pounds 2m - have
effectively weeded out frivolous bids.
Next Thursday, a licence working group under the chairmanship of Mr Michael
Redley, the commission's official in charge of licensing, will begin work on
the applications to draw up a list of bidders that pass the quality
threshold. The working group will draw on the financial, regional and
programming expertise of the commission's officials. Each of the eight
members of the commission - excluding the chairman and deputy chairman -
will oversee two of the 16 contests.
The officials will submit recommendations and briefing papers to the
commission, which has 10 members, within two or three months for the final
decision on which applicants will make it to the last bidding round. Only
then will the cash bids be brought out of the safe.
When a winner is established in each area, commission members will consider
whether there are exceptional circumstances that would overturn the verdict
of the brown envelopes. If exceptional circumstances are being considered,
all the companies involved will be invited to the commission for a private
hearing.
The final stage before the winners are announced, probably by the end of
October, will be to look at the priorities of the applicants.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Morris appeal on inter-union disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Morris, deputy general secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, yesterday called for changes in the TUC's Bridlington rules
governing inter-union disputes as union leaders met to discuss the future of
the TUC.
Mr Morris said events in the past few years had shown that the Bridlington
rules were 'ripe for review'. He said they should be examined independently
by an impartial expert who could suggest changes to bring them up to date.
The call indicates growing pressure on the Bridlington rules, which have
been at the centre of controversy in a number of disputes involving the
TGWU. They include the dispute over Ford's proposed components plant at
Dundee.
Mr Morris made his remarks in London at a conference called to discuss how
the TUC should operate. Changes in the way it and its member unions operate
will be considered at the Trades Union Congress in Glasgow in September.
The rules, which set out how unions may compete for membership within
companies, have been criticised by a number of rightwing unions and led to
the expulsion from the TUC of the EETPU electricians' union in 1988.
Mr Morris's call indicates that there is now some leftwing disquiet about
the rules, which have also been criticised by Mr George Wright, the other
main contender to become the next general secretary of the TGWU.
The rules were defended by Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT
transport union. Mr Knapp said there had to be a 'discipline of approach'
and the TUC should 'not be in the business of free market unionism'.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said unions had achieved a lot, but
the pressures from competition and from some employers 'increasingly put
individuals in exposed position, and we find it difficult to protect them'.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Revised pay offer averts strike at The
Guardian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE over a proposed pay freeze at The Guardian newspaper ended
yesterday. Journalists voted to accept a revised offer of a flat-rate Pounds
500 increase rather than starting a strike in a week, writes John Gapper.
Leaders of the National Union of Journalists chapel (office branch)
recommended that the 250 journalists accept the offer, under which they will
receive a Pounds 500 advance on a scheme linking pay to advertising revenue
in the next year.
Mr Seumas Milne, father of the chapel (chairman of the office branch), said
the decision was 'not a victory, but a draw'. He said the journalists had
managed to break the pay freeze, although the offer was inadequate.
Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, said the deal was an attempt to
adjust to a difficult financial climate by offering more pay if revenue
improved.
Under the offer, journalists will receive an extra Pounds 310 for each
Pounds 800,000 which the newspaper gains in advertising revenue during
1991-92 above its budgeted advertising level.
The Guardian has also guaranteed a minimum pay rise of 5 per cent in the
next annual settlement due next January. It had been attempting to impose a
pay freeze on all employees because of the sharp downturn in advertising
revenue.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Poaching seen as big obstacle to
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) should promote practical measures to
tackle skills shortages, according to a report by the Business Strategies
research group, published yesterday.
Reviewing the role of Tecs, the group says the threat of poaching is the
most serious obstacle to skill training. As training levies are 'unlikely to
be implemented in the near future', Tecs should concentrate on removing
other barriers that contribute to skill shortages.
Those include practical child-care issues, which preclude women from
working, and lack of information for companies about local skills training
and the mobility of labour.
'Most of these functions are performed already by specialist companies or
individuals, but not comprehensively and certainly not in an integrated
fashion,' the report says.
Mr Richard Holt, senior economist at Business Strategies, said: 'This is not
just a problem for Tecs to deal with, it is also up to major employers to
help improve labour supply mismatches. There is a major business opportunity
for the Employment Service companies to provide a far more integrated
recruitment, relocation and retraining service.'
Figures published by the Department of Employment yesterday show that more
than half of all unemployed people of working age - 57 per cent last year -
have some academic qualifications. That is a slight increase on 1989, when
55 per cent of unemployed people had qualifications, the 1990 labour force
survey says.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Civil Service job-loss rules to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is planning to end restrictions on how ministries choose
civil servants for enforced redundancies. The initiative will further
challenge the perception that a Civil Service job is a job for life.
The Treasury will abandon advice to government departments that they adopt a
'last in, first out' principle when choosing candidates for redundancy. It
is also withdrawing an 'order of discharge' list which lays down the types
of employees who should be the first enforced redundancies.
Until now, certain groups of civil servants, including those over 65 and
those on temporary appointments, were first.
The Treasury wants to give departments more freedom to choose, increasing
the likelihood that less talented civil servants will be selected first.
Civil Service unions are angry about the initiative. They believe the jobs
for life image is already outdated after job losses in the past decade.
The IPMS specialists' union said the government's latest move would enable
departments to tackle redundancies in a more brutal manner than before.
It and other unions are braced for enforced redundancies over the next few
years in several departments, including the Ministry of Defence and the
Property Services Agency.
The abandonment of the 'last in, first out' and other selection principles
is part of a trend in Britain. In the recession, more companies have been
adopting policies enabling them to make the least valuable workers redundant
first.
The Treasury has told unions that the former criteria on redundancies placed
'undue restrictions' on departments that are reducing workforces but need to
maintain 'viable operations'.
The initiative fits with the government's belief that departmental and
agency managers should have more freedom to run their operations.
Previously, guidance on redundancy procedure has been enshrined in a model
agreement, drawn up in 1975 by the Treasury in consultation with the unions.
That will be replaced with a code of practice that will advise departments
on statutory legal requirements.
The code will also abandon the model agreement's strictures on procedures to
be adopted before redundancies are announced.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Abolish A-levels, says Royal Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL reforms to post-16 education and training are proposed in a report
by the Royal Society published today.
Professor Brian Follett, the society's vice-president, warns: 'The
scientific and technological needs of the UK will not be met unless there is
radical revision.'
The proposals fly in the face of government policy, which is committed to
retaining A-levels and resists broadening the traditional two or
three-subject course of study for A-level students.
The Royal Society, which consists of leading scientists and engineers, is
particularly critical of early specialisation, which it says restricts
career choice and 'compares unfavourably with the education systems of our
European trading partners'.
Its report condemns both the low stay-on rate among 16-year-olds and the
'confused and confusing' system for those who do stay on.
It cites recent figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which show that only 35 per cent of 17-year-olds in the
UK are in full-time education and training, compared with 80 per cent in
Germany and 89 per cent in the US.
Scotland's staying-on rate is notably higher than England's, and its less
specialised and more skills-oriented system is praised by the Society.
In its report, the Society proposes a modular two-year 'advanced diploma' to
replace A-levels and the wide range of vocational qualifications at present
on offer to post-16 students. The Society also proposes a new advanced
certificate which would be awarded to those who stay on for only one year
after the age of 16.
Both the Royal Society's proposed courses would require students to study
subjects from three 'domains': the first spanning maths, science and
technology; the second economics, industry and society; and the third
languages and aesthetics.
Maths and science tests for 14-year-olds were postponed yesterday by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, education secretary.
He said the tests, due to start next summer, were being delayed for a year
while the new national curriculum was streamlined.
He also wants the number of attainment targets for science and maths to be
reduced. Children would be required to master and then be tested on just
five targets in each subject - reduced from 14 in maths and 17 in science.

THE EUROPEAN Community is due on Monday to impose definitive anti-dumping
duties on Japanese audio cassettes in a controversial move.
The cassette dispute has already provoked a threat from Tokyo to cease
investing in the EC. The case still excites concern in a minority of EC
member states and is bound to lead to renewed scrutiny of the EC's
anti-dumping arsenal.
The EC Commission has secured a qualified majority of the 12 member states
to impose the levy, Brussels officials say. To do so, it has dropped a more
contentious case against imported tape used by Japanese companies to
assemble cassettes in the EC.
The tape case is incendiary because the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade last year outlawed the EC's so-called 'screwdriver' rules against
products assembled in the EC using imported parts. Critics saw the tape
action as an EC attempt to reintroduce the anti-circumvention provisions
banned by Gatt.
Brussels has agreed to drop the tape inquiry, but lawyers acting for
Japanese companies say it has not altered the figures used to calculate
injury to EC producers.
These, they claim, are related to a percentage of market share which could
only have been reached by including output of Japanese affiliates producing
inside Europe.
The Commission denies this. The measure is designed and drafted to specify
that this output is not included in the injury, an official insisted.
The definitive duties are likely to be lower than expected - an average of
about 17 per cent.
This compares with provisional duties ranging from 14.7 to 22.3 per cent
imposed last November and a 22-24 per cent band suggested by the Commission
last month. Commission investigators originally calculated there was a
dumping margin of 60 per cent.
The case has been bitterly fought. On April 30, Tokyo told Gatt's
anti-dumping committee that if the EC went ahead with definitive levies on
cassettes, Japanese companies would review plans to invest in Europe.
According to one EC diplomat, Japanese companies have made veiled promises
of investment in member states voting against the measure. But lawyers
acting for Japanese companies in the row insist their clients have merely
stressed that the EC's methodology amounts 'objectively to an attack on
inward investment'.
The row over methods centres on the reference period, fixed unusually far
back in 1985-88. Injury has been related to EC cassette producers' market
share in 1985 and the prices they would have needed to get a 12 per cent
profit then. The Commission admits that during the reference period, market
share of imports from Japan fell from 42 to 35 per cent. Hence the parallel
investigation into audio tape. If cassettes produced inside the EC using
imported tape are taken into account, Japan's share rose significantly.
The Commission says the flaw in this argument is that 'it assumes that the
remaining 35 per cent (market share) was not injurious, and was not unfairly
gained'.
EC diplomats say Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium, among the
original dissenters from Brussels' view, now accept the cassettes case has
been definitively cleansed of 'screwdriver' taint.
Those member states almost certain to vote against the levies - the UK,
Luxembourg and Denmark - also appear to accept that EC output by Japanese
companies is not considered by the regulation. But the UK, for one, while
not objecting to the dumping finding, is still unhappy with the methodology
and the resulting figures.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Sales south of the border seen to be basis for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELLING more electricity, particularly south of the Scottish border, will be
the key to profit growth for ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the
two electricity companies announced in their pathfinder flotation
prospectus, published yesterday.
Pool - or spot market - prices in England and Wales would also be critical
in determining the future profitability of the two companies, the prospectus
said.
Hydro-Electric, the smaller of the two companies, was more forceful than
ScottishPower about exporting electricity. Mr Roger Young, chief executive,
told a London press conference yesterday: 'Virtually all our profit growth
will come from generation and supply.'
Since the industry was restructured last March, both companies' electricity
sales have increased significantly, the prospectus shows.
Hydro-Electric's sales have grown from 7.4m megawatt-hours in the year
ending March 1990, to 10.1m MW-hours this financial year. ScottishPower's
sales have increased from 19.8m to 21.9m over the same period. In both cases
the increase stemmed largely from increased sales outside the companies'
area.
Hydro-Electric was also more assertive about competing in the electricity
market, selling directly to large industrial customers in England and Wales.
It has won 11 contracts to supply 39 customers outside its region.
ScottishPower, which has been less openly aggressive, won contracts to
supply 10 customers outside its area, and has since lost two. It will
consider alternatives to direct sales, in particular selling to the pool in
England and Wales, the company said.
ScottishPower was cautious about the future of prices to large customers,
which it believed might fall significantly. If that happened, the company
said, it may become uneconomic to supply those customers.
Both companies said they expected to make considerable cost savings in the
generation business, particularly because they will have lower cost
gas-fired generation from mid 1992, when gas from the North Sea Miller field
will be available to supply the power station at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire,
whose output they share.
Mr Young gave a warning that the quantity of Miller gas that would be
delivered was one of a number of uncertainties faced by Hydro-Electric.
Another risk was the plan by both companies to upgrade the interconnector,
which connects the Scottish grid to the National Grid in England and Wales.
ScottishPower said it expected demand for electricity to bring some natural
growth to its other main business, the transmission and distribution of
electricity to end customers.
This 'wires' business, which is generally regarded as stable and
predictable, represents 70 per cent of ScottishPower's operating profit, but
only 45 per cent of Hydro-Electric's, the prospectus disclosed.
Hydro-Electric said its distribution business should continue to make a
substantial contribution to profits, but it was vulnerable to growing
competition from gas. About 52 per cent of end users in the company's area
were served by a natural gas network compared with 84 per cent in the UK
overall, the company said.
Unlike the 12 electricity companies of England and Wales, the distribution
businesses of the Scottish companies will not be able automatically to
increase revenues by raising prices. The 'x factors' that regulate how much
they can increase prices on top of inflation every year are much lower - at
0.2 for each company - than their southern rivals.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Watchdog seeks to stop rivers running dry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIORITY programme to save some of England's most attractive rivers from
drying up was launched yesterday by the National Rivers Authority, the water
industry's environmental regulator, writes Richard Evans.
Over-exploitation by industry, landowners and water companies, together with
a succession of dry winters and hot summers, has led to unacceptably low
flow levels in some of the country's best fishing rivers.
The NRA warned yesterday that there were no 'quick fix' solutions, and that
the cost of reversing the decline might be as high as Pounds 20m.
Among options being considered are revoking or varying existing licences,
building new river channels to feed drying rivers and lining river beds.
Among the 20 targeted rivers are the Darent, Pang, Wey and Ver in the Thames
region; the upper Waveney, the Hiz and Slea in East Anglia; the Wharfe in
Yorkshire; and the Piddle in the west country. Mr Jerry Sherriff, NRA head
of water resources, said: 'It is not acceptable for rivers that once enjoyed
healthy flows all year round to become, in some cases, no more than dry
gullies in the summer months.'
Money for the work will have to come initially from the fees levied by the
NRA for extraction licences.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Government to sell 100% of Scottish electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to sell 100 per cent of the two Scottish electricity
companies, ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric, it announced at the launch of
the pathfinder prospectus for the flotation in Edinburgh and London
yesterday.
ScottishPower, the larger of the two companies, expects to show an operating
profit of Pounds 261m for the year to March 1991 while Hydro-Electric
forecasts an operating profit of Pounds 121m.
Pro-forma pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items are forecast at Pounds
225.7m for ScottishPower, and Pounds 97.7m for Hydro-Electric. Post-tax
profits are put at Pounds 153.6m for ScottishPower and at Pounds 72m for
Hydro-Electric.
Both companies said they would follow a progressive policy on dividends and
expect to increase them in real terms. On a pro-forma basis, ScottishPower's
total dividend pay out for the year ending March 1991 would have been Pounds
75m, the company said. The equivalent Hydro-Electric dividend is calculated
at Pounds 35m.
The two expect a lower tax charge in future than the one assumed for the
calculation.
Debt levels for the two companies at March 31 were also revealed.
ScottishPower starts life in the private sector with debt-to-equity ratio of
51.4 per cent, based on liabilities of Pounds 284m at March 31, 1991. With
Pounds 228.2m of indebtedness, Hydro-Electric had a gearing of 43 per cent.
The price of the shares will be announced on May 30, and all share
applications must be in by June 12.
The flotation of the two companies will complete the privatisation of the
electricity industry in Great Britain. Ulster's power industry is to be sold
next year.
For months, the biggest doubt about the flotation concerned the possibility
that the government might call a general election before it could be
completed in mid June. But political setbacks for the Conservatives over the
past few weeks have virtually eliminated that risk.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, expressed the hope that there would be
'no impediment to a successful sale'.
The flotation will also bring to the Stock Exchange two electricity
companies that, unlike the generators and regional electricity companies in
England, have the appeal of being vertically integrated. They generate,
transmit and distribute electricity.
Privatisation of the companies is part of the government's policy of
increasing share ownership in Scotland, where it has hitherto been
relatively low. The incentives for individual investors to apply for shares
are biased towards customers of the two companies who need only make a first
instalment payment of Pounds 100 and may apply for their own company's
shares only.
Other individual investors must buy a package of the two companies' shares,
likely to be in a ratio of 2 1/2 ScottishPower shares to one share in
Hydro-Electric, and make a down payment of Pounds 300. The exact proportions
will be fixed when the companies go on sale on May 30.
The offer is not being underwritten. Instead, the government is following
the successful practice applied in February with the English generators and
carrying out a book-building exercise among institutions to assess demand at
varying prices.
It will also market the shares to institutions in Japan, the US, Canada and
continental Europe.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush, in an important revision of US policy, yesterday threw open
all US ports to former Soviet satellite nations and declared his intention
'to stimulate commercial trade between the US and the region'.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said the decision was another
step towards ending Cold War restrictions and welcoming eastern Europe into
'the international community of democratic nations'.
The action had been taken, after an intensive inter-agency review, 'in
recognition of the progress these countries have made toward democracy. The
new port policy follows other recent moves to expand US trade with eastern
Europe. Last month duty-free trade benefits were extended to Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
The new port policy maintains the same delineation between the Soviet Union
and the eastern Europeans that the Bush administration has retained on other
trade matters. Export controls, for example, have been liberalised towards
the eastern bloc more than for the Soviet Union.
The new port policy opens all US ports for commercial, cargo, passenger and
fishing vessels from eastern European nations. In the past, access for ships
from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania was severely
limited. They could not enter 12 'high security' ports at all and they were
required to give two weeks' notice for other ports.
Now the six will be required to give only 24 hours' notice for any ports.
Soviet ships must give two days' notice at 49 ports and two weeks' notice at
others. Access to 12 high security ports is still denied to Soviet ships.

<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION of a 7.7km rail tunnel under the Great Belt, the main waterway
into the Baltic Sea, has become a nightmare for MT Group, the international
consortium constructing the tunnel.
The tunnel is now 13 months behind schedule, all work is at a standstill,
and the state-owned company which has commissioned the tunnel has issued
barely concealed warnings that changes will be made in the consortium if
work does not progress more smoothly.
James Howden, the Glasgow group which delivered the four tunnel-boring
machines, also built the machines which have nearly completed the work of
boring the Channel Tunnel.
The rail tunnel under the eastern half of the Great Belt is one part of a
three-part DKr19bn (Pounds 1.68bn) project to build a rail and road link
across the 14km belt to link Sjaelland, the large island on which Copenhagen
is sited, with the Jutland peninsula.
A road and rail bridge across the western half of the belt to the tiny
island of Sprogo in mid-belt will link up with the rail tunnel and a
motorway bridge across the eastern half. MT Group is led by Monberg and
Thorsen, a Danish company, and includes Campenon Bernard, France, Dyckerhoff
and Widmann of Germany, Kiewit Construction of the US, and Sogea of France.
A six-month delay in the delivery of the machines was the first setback for
MT Group. Since the first machine was started up last August, there have
been endless problems getting them to work properly.
On Tuesday this week, all four machines were halted for repair work and the
personnel working on the tunnel have been laid off. So far, the machines
have tunnelled 840 metres. According to the schedule, they should have
tunnelled 2,400 metres by now. MT Group has until May 17 to say when
tunnelling can restart and when the tunnel will be completed.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Impressionist art spring sale disappoints: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S leading spring sale of Impressionist and Modern art in New York on
Tuesday evening was a big disappointment, totalling Dollars 18.24m (Pounds
10.6m), with 20 of the 48 lots failing to find buyers.
A year ago the comparable auction at Sotheby's totalled Dollars 286.2m, with
Renoir's painting Au Moulin de la Galette selling for Dollars 78.1m. The
difference measures the collapse of the market for Impressionist art.
By being selective in the works it accepted for sale and by insisting on
modest reserve prices, Sotheby's hoped the auction would restore confidence
to this important sector of its business. In the event, absence of bids from
the Japanese and from overstocked dealers led to thin demand.
The only bright point was its success in selling seven paintings from the
collection of the Hollywood doyenne, the late Irene Mayer Selznick, for
Dollars 7.7m.
The highest price was the Dollars 4.51m (Pounds 2.6m) paid by a private
European collector for a late Matisse of 1940, La Robe Persane, from the
Selznick collection. The estimate had been Dollars 5m-Dollars 7m.
A tiny oil by Seurat, a study for his magnum opus Sunday Afternoon on the
Island of the Grande Jatte, also beat its estimate at Dollars 1.375m.
Buste d'Homme, a late Picasso of 1969, went for the same price, well below
its forecast, and a European dealer paid Dollars 1.045m, for Le Bain, a
pastel by Degas.
Mr David Nash, head of the Impressionist department, said he was
disappointed at the results of the auction. Attention now switches to London
for a similar Sotheby's auction on June 25 when, for the first time for
years, the quality of the works on offer is higher than in New York.

<TEXT>
MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy
president of the African National Congress (ANC), met for five hours
yesterday in a final attempt to avert the threatened breakdown of talks on a
post-apartheid constitution.
Later Mr de Klerk said: 'We have reached the stage where we are close to
solving the outstanding problems, which would result in real negotiations
beginning.' Discussions would continue today, he added.
The ANC has said it will suspend talks from today unless the government
meets its demands on ending the township violence which has left more than
1,500 people dead in the Johannesburg area since last August.
Neither side released details of the talks, which took place in Pretoria.
Both made important concessions in the days leading up to today's deadline;
but the issue of violence, which has severely damaged the ANC's support in
black communities, is an emotive one and neither side will be keen to appear
to back down.
The gap between the two sides on the issue of violence has narrowed
considerably since the ANC issued an ultimatum last month, calling for a ban
on carrying weapons in public, disbanding counter-insurgency units,
abolition of hostels, disciplining of policemen involved in killings, curbs
on police crowd control methods, setting up a public inquiry into violence
and the sacking of the ministers of defence and law and order.
On Tuesday Mr de Klerk appeared to gain concessions from Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Party, on the issue after summoning
him to Cape Town.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein of Iraq yesterday met Mr Masoud Barzani, leader of
the Kurdish Democratic Party and a longstanding enemy, as negotiations
continued over nationwide political reforms and autonomy for Iraqi
Kurdistan.
Mr Saddam had talks two weeks ago with Mr Jalal Talabani, who heads the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the other main guerrilla group in the Iraqi
Kurdistan Front.
Mr Talabani spoke then of an agreement in principle on Kurdish autonomy, but
many Kurds doubt that the Iraqi government will meet their demands for
international guarantees to uphold an accord. Nor has Iraq expressed a
willingness to allow the oil town of Kirkuk to be included in the Kurdish
region.
The official Iraqi news agency said only of yesterday's meeting that Mr
Barzani had led a four-man delegation of Kurds.
Kurdish leaders are anxious to reverse the exodus of Kurds from northern
Iraq which followed a failed uprising in March, while Mr Saddam apparently
wants to bring peace to the north so that he can tighten his grip on Iraq as
a whole.
The allied forces - whose victory over Iraq in the Gulf war prompted the
Iraqi uprisings - have set up 'safe havens' for the Kurds in northern Iraq.
Yesterday an allied military spokesman said Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners
fired twice at US navy aircraft scouting the area on Tuesday, without
hitting the target. Baghdad denied its gunners had opened fire.
Meanwhile, the last US troops pulled out of southern Iraq. Units of the 3rd
Armoured Division rumbled across the desert and into Kuwait, while UN
peacekeeping forces in white four-wheel-drive vehicles patrolled the Iraqi
border town of Safwan and the surrounding area.

RELIEF efforts for the millions of people affected by last week's cyclone in
Bangladesh have been hampered by a lack of co-ordination between the
civilian government and senior army officials organising the operation.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's new prime minister, who has been in office for
less than two months, yesterday cancelled a visit to Saudi Arabia because
she wants to head the relief effort and avert possible friction with the
military .
Officials admitted in Dhaka that millions of survivors of the cyclone in the
coastal areas are still not getting food, drinking water and medical
supplies. It could be several days before the relief operations become fully
effective, they said. Small non-governmental organisations whose
representatives have reached the affected areas have proved to be more
effective than the official machinery.
International aid pledges now total about Dollars 400m, but disbursement has
not yet started.
Some ships carrying food have are standing off Chittagong port, which is
only partly operational, and unloading is proving to be a problem.
The authorities are considering diverting the ships to another port.

SOUTH KOREA has frozen bank credit to 14 companies from eight of the
country's largest business groups for failing to obey a government order to
sell surplus land by Tuesday.
The measure is the strongest yet taken by the government in its attempts to
curb real estate speculation which has driven up land prices and diverted
funds from productive investment.
Last year, the government announced that companies must dispose of a total
of 57.44m pyong (149.55m square metres) of land which was not being directly
used for their business operations. At the beginning of this week, the
deadline for the disposal, only 63 per cent of this land had been sold.
The 14 companies - which belong to the Lotte Group, the Hanjin Group and six
other conglomerates - are expected to suffer financial difficulties as a
result of the credit freeze. They will face further penalties if they fail
to dispose of their non-business land by the end of the month. In
particular, they will be restricted to selecting just one company to be
freed from existing credit constraints under a new government policy.

FT  09 MAY 91 / No chemical weapons at front, says UK general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MYSTERY surrounding Iraq's tactics in the war over Kuwait deepened
yesterday when General Sir Peter de la Billiere, who commanded British
forces, said Baghdad had apparently not sent chemical weapons for use
against the US-led coalition.
Shortly before the allies launched their offensive in February, UK officials
said there was evidence that Iraq had moved chemical shells and rockets to
frontline units.
But Sir Peter told the House of Commons defence committee yesterday that to
his knowledge no chemical weapons had subsequently been recovered.
'I believe the reason for this is that they weren't deployed,' he said. It
had previously been assumed that Iraqi forces did not resort to chemical
weapons either because they had no opportunity to employ them effectively
against the rapid allied advance, or because of allied threats of
retaliation.
Sir Peter promised 'full disclosure' of the results of an investigation into
the deaths of nine British soldiers whose armoured vehicles were attacked by
a US A-10 aircraft.
His comment followed a reported statement by Lt-Gen Charles Horner, the US
Air Force commander in the war, that a British air controller had indicated
there were no allied forces in the area.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Hawke uses his iron fist on the waterfront: Australia's
docks will no longer be a graveyard of good intentions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK nearly 19 hours of non-stop talking, and a whole packet of cigars,
but Mr Bob Hawke, Australia's Labor prime minister, appears to have pulled
off a deal which will clear the way for reform of the country's inefficient
docks.
The outcome was a much-needed political victory for the prime minister, who
ran the risk of losing his reputation as a master of consensus. If the deal
holds, he will gain a prize which has eluded governments for decades.
The Australian waterfront is a graveyard of good intentions. At least 11
official inquiries have recommended reform since the Second World War,
warning that high costs and bizarre labour practices were hampering trade.
All have sunk without trace in the face of lukewarm support from employers,
and implacable opposition from the Waterside Workers' Federation (WWF), the
monopoly supplier of labour.
In the union's eyes, every attempt at reform threatened a return to the
pre-war system of casual labour, when foremen would throw each day's work
tickets in the air for the strongest and quickest to catch, leaving the slow
and the unlucky without work.
To the employers, protected by limited competition and pooled labour costs,
any attempt to rock the boat raised the spectre of a prolonged dispute with
a union which could bring the wharves to a halt.
The result is that Australia has some of the world's most inefficient ports,
manned by some of the country's highest paid and most cosseted workers.
Among other benefits, dockers are guaranteed a job for life, paid for
travelling to work, and sometimes paid for not working. The dockers of
Thevenard, South Australia, were paid ADollars 370 (Pounds 169) a week last
year for an average of six hours' work.
The economic costs are high. The Inter-State Commission (ISC), a government
advisory body, estimated that Australian cranes move an average of 13.34
standard 20ft containers per hour, compared to an average of 24.72 at
overseas ports with which Australia trades.
The ISC put the cost of unnecessary labour and delays to shipping and cargo
at ADollars 620m a year, but exporters' organisations say the cost is closer
to ADollars 850m if lost business is included.
The Hawke government set out last year to reduce these costs through a
ADollars 290m restructuring scheme, to be funded jointly over three years by
the taxpayer and the employers, through a levy on cargoes. The scheme was
intended to reduce the workforce from 6,500 to 4,500 by financing redundancy
payments averaging just under ADollars 100,000 each for 3,000 older workers,
and training 1,000 younger recruits.
The ISC calculated the scheme would increase productivity by an average of
35 per cent. But only one company, National Australian Terminals, has so far
implemented an agreement, while others say negotiations with the union have
been unproductive.
It was against this background that negotiations on reform came to a halt
when the Industrial Relations Commission, the statutory authority which
oversees Australia's centralised wage-fixing system, put a national limit of
2.5 per cent on pay rises.
The decision meant that productivity-linked pay rises could not be paid to
waterfront workers without a special hearing before the Commission, which
both sides ruled out.
Mr Hawke stepped in because the deadlock threatened to undermine the
credibility of the government's wider programme of structural reform, which
is intended to increase Australia's international competitiveness.
The deal reached under his auspices will deliver a flat pay rise of ADollars
12 a week to dockers, plus 6 per cent over the next two years, but only
after reform agreements have been implemented, effectively locking the union
into the process.
The Commission will be asked to approve the deal to keep it within existing
industrial relations law, which also regulates arbitration and the conduct
of disputes. But Senator Bob Collins, the shipping minister, says the
government is determined to make the deal stick, even if it has to legislate
to create an 'alternative mechanism'. The immediate impact will be to force
the union to implement an outline reform agreement relating to the Sydney
container terminal run by Conaust, a P&amp;O subsidiary which handles about 50
per cent of container trade.
The Conaust agreement is significantly tougher than the earlier agreement
with National Terminals, and is likely to provide a blueprint for reform in
other ports.
However, the reform could yet be threatened by the refusal of employers to
recruit the 1,000 young workers specified by the government. Mr Richard
Setchell, Conaust managing director, says recruitment would be 'madness' in
the face of a severe decline in trade caused by Australia's stagnant
economy.
'We are not interested in hiring more people. Why would we overman the
industry again?' he says. 'What the unions are saying is a nonsense. We will
get rid of the people that we don't want; we are not going to go out and
hire them again.'

FT  09 MAY 91 / Egypt's Gulf troop pull-out seen as snub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN A surprise snub to Arab allies in the Gulf, Egypt said yesterday that it
would pull its troops out of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 38,000-strong
Egyptian force, together with a smaller Syrian contingent which also joined
the anti-Iraq coalition, had been seen as the nucleus of a future regional
Arab defence force.
The policy reversal, announced by President Hosni Mubarak, reflected growing
Egyptian disaffection with its wealthy allies since the signing on March 6
of a security agreement between Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states. The
vaguely worded defence pact had suggested the continued stationing of Syrian
and Egyptian troops in exchange for Gulf money.
Egyptian officials then appeared frustrated by the lack of progress in
ironing out details. Obstacles included Iran's anger at being kept out,
Kuwait's preference for western troop support and differences over the
nature of the aid. Gulf countries offered to create a Dollars 10bn aid fund,
but then suggested it only offer finance to private business.
Gulf leaders recently indicated that they favour a larger Iranian role in
security. Having succeeded Iraq as the strongest Arab state, Egypt opposes
the participation of non-Arab regional powers such as Iran and Turkey.
Mr Mubarak played down inter-Arab differences, however, insisting that the
pull-out decision was taken a month ago when it was felt the troops had
completed their mission. He said the full withdrawal could take up to three
months.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Paraguay finds old habits die hard: Breaking with the past
is not always easy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE knows where they have gone but somewhere in this land-locked South
American backwater must lie the many Alfredo Stroessner statues, nameplates
and slogans that once graced every Paraguay street corner and prominent
building.
Little more than two years after the western hemisphere's longest-serving
dictator was deposed, the country has been stripped of all physical traces
of his rule.
But some things have not changed. In the main street of the otherwise sleepy
capital of Asuncion, Stroessner's legacy lives on in the form of hundreds of
hawkers crying: 'Eh senorita, wanna buy Rolex?'
Roadside tables piled high with fake watches, smuggled French perfumes and
Japanese electronics are evidence that the contraband culture which
Stroessner encouraged is alive and kicking.
The new government of General Andres Rodriguez is publicly committed to
stamping out the business, which nets more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m) a
year. It began promisingly in February 1989 by introducing a unified
floating exchange rate which substantially increased official exports that
year.
But official exports have again dropped back and critics claim that, like
his predecessor, Gen Rodriguez is not only turning a blind eye to contraband
but is using it to lubricate his political machine. One official said the
government feared the social consequences of ending contraband; a recent
study found that banning cigarette smuggling would deprive 20,000 people of
a source of income.
The commerce minister insists on describing as 'regional trade' the
ill-gotten gains which fuel the capital's neon-lit casinos and explain the
Mercedes in its streets and elaborate mansions on its outskirts. 'We're like
a little Hong Kong' says Mr Antonio Zuccolillo as he explains that
Paraguay's 'under the table trade' with its biggest trading partner, Brazil,
is double that conducted above board.
No one expected that 35 years of dictatorship could be erased overnight. But
some complain that only the names have changed and that the system
continues.
However, the human rights situation has improved immeasurably and ABC Color,
the country's most popular and outspoken newspaper, is currently publishing
a series of articles denouncing corruption in the present government with no
fear of being closed down, as it was in 1984 until Stroessner's fall.
In fact political change has come more quickly than expected, given that
Paraguay had no popular revolution but a military coup and that Gen
Rodriguez is an old friend and relation - by marriage - of Stroessner, who
now lives in exile in Brazil.
Although Gen Rodriguez simply took over Stroessner's Colorado party and
sanctified his position by an election marred by allegations of fraud, he
seems determined to uphold his promise of a transition to democracy by 1993.
May will see Paraguay's first free municipal elections, to be followed by
national elections in two years.
On the economic side, the guarani continues as one of Latin America's
strongest currencies and the economy has not collapsed as predicted after
funds dried up from the massive Itaipu hydro-electric project. The scheme,
financed principally by Brazil, meant annual growth rates of 10 per cent in
the early 1980s.
Although last year Paraguay had zero growth - partly because of Brazil's
failure to pay bills for imported electricity - and 45 per cent inflation,
its highest ever, its problems pale in comparison to those of its two giant
neighbours, Argentina and Brazil.
However, the government has shied away from its promised privatisation
programme and much-needed land reform.
According to Mr Tomas Palau, a social scientist, only 5 per cent of the land
is cultivated and most of Paraguay's rural population are landless squatters
who survive by subsistence farming.
'Contraband has destroyed our rural economy', says Mr Palau, pointing out
that the shops are filled with Brazilian produce and that Paraguay imports
60 per cent of its basic food.
This is not through a shortage of fertile land. Paraguay has 400,000 sq km
for its population of 4m and has often been described as an agricultural
arcadia. In fact the east has been taken over by an estimated 200,000
Brazilians who find the land across the border more attractive.
But contraband has meant little revenue reaching the Treasury for
agricultural development. What may force this to change is the recent
creation of a common market with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.
This is intended to end all tariffs between the countries by 1995. It would
also set up common external tariffs, which would end Paraguay's function as
a duty free store, forcing it to find an alternative source of income.
Joining that market is part of Paraguay's process of cleaning up its image.
New incentives have attracted Dollars 400m in foreign investment over the
last 18 months, and last October it signed a letter of intent with the IMF
for an 18-month standby facility - its first programme with the fund for
more than 30 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM Webster, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, announced
his retirement yesterday, leaving President George Bush with a tricky
decision on a successor.
Mr Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a CIA veteran, is
viewed as a front-runner. But a Gates nomination would be a gamble; he has
already tried and failed to win the top job.
In 1987 President Ronald Reagan nominated Mr Gates as CIA director to
replace Mr William Casey, who many believe masterminded the Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostages affair. Mr Gates, whose role in the affair remains murky,
was forced to withdraw in the face of Senate opposition.
Mr Webster, 67, a former FBI director, took Mr Gates' place and set about
repairing some of the damage caused by the scandal. The president said
yesterday he had brought 'an integrity, an effectiveness and an insight' to
the job. However, Mr Webster was never a member of Mr Bush's inner circle.
Moreover, the CIA under him has faced criticism for poor work ahead of the
1989 Panama invasion and for indifferent assessments of Soviet economic
strength.
The selection of a successor faces renewed controversy, thanks to recent
reports that the Reagan campaign, working with CIA renegades, struck a deal
with Iran to delay the release of US hostages until after the 1980
presidential election.
Reports have also suggested that Mr Bush, who was Mr Reagan's running-mate
in 1980, took part in a meeting with Iranian representatives in Paris to
conclude the deal. Mr Bush yesterday repeated last week's rejection that he
was involved - without specifically denying that a deal may have been
struck. 'I can only say categorically that the allegations about me are
grossly untrue, factually incorrect, bald-faced lies,' he said.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Politicians ride nationalist tiger in Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, came to London earlier this
week he had few kind words to say about the Serbs. They belonged to 'a
different civilisation,' he said. Their Orthodox faith and centuries of
Ottoman domination set them far apart from the Catholic Croats, who had been
part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
His disparaging comments about the Serbs and other ethnic groups in
Yugoslavia will serve only to strengthen the already deep sense of suspicion
between the country's two largest peoples.
Some 600,000 Serbs live in Croatia - 11 per cent of the republic's
population. They settled there following waves of migrations from the south
which started in 1690 when Serbs fled from Turkish domination. In Croatia,
they played a key role in protecting the frontiers from the Turks, a point
omitted from Mr Tudjman's London lecture.
The Serb minority assimilated, as much as was possible given their different
cultural traditions. The Serb script is Cyrillic, their religion Orthodox;
the Croats' script and religion are Latin and Catholic. The two ethnic
groups have retained their dialects of the Serbo-Croatian language, which
Croats today are accentuating to emphasise their distinctive cultural
identity.
But it was the events of the Second World War which poisoned relations
between the two groups. After tens of thousands of Serbs were killed by the
Nazi-backed Croatian Ustasha movement, and others sought refuge in the
Partisan movement, Tito gave the Serbs a much greater political prominence
in Croatia.
Proportionally, Serb influence in the Communist party, the security forces,
and the Croatian administration was excessive. Tito often used the Serbs as
a kind of watchdog over the Croats, particularly after 1971, following his
brutal suppression of the Croatian nationalist movement which wanted greater
autonomy.
For these reasons many Croats are seeking revenge for past injustices -
perceived to be perpetrated by Serbs - through the creation of an
independent Croatia, or a Yugoslavia which is not dominated by Serbia. A
section of the Serb minority in Croatia is determined to resist this.
Led by Mr Milan Babic, a staunch nationalist and proponent of a 'Greater
Serbia,' militant and largely peasant Serbs from around Knin have declared
Serb-inhabited regions autonomous from Croatia, and aspire to union with
Serbia. They constitute a very small percentage of the Serb minority. But
their militancy has incensed the republic's government, and has tapped
latent Croatian nationalism, centred in the Dalmatian port of Split.
Non-militant Serbs in Croatia, who have held talks with the republic's
government, fear becoming the target of Croatian nationalists. If Croatia
becomes independent, they feel they will become underdogs.
The Croatian government could allay their fears by starting negotiations
with the militants. But this appears extremely difficult since Croats
believe Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Communist/nationalist president of
Serbia, has supported the militants in Croatia in order to quash the
republic's plans for independence.
The danger now facing both republics is that nationalism has assumed its own
momentum; it is out of the hands of the politicians.

DOMINATING the thoughts of Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, is
the most obvious manifestation of the Soviet economic crisis: the wave of
strikes by miners and other workers, especially in steel mills and
engineering plants.
In an interview yesterday, he stressed that part of his anti-crisis
programme seeks to put an end to strikes in the vital sectors of the Soviet
economy.
The prime minister said that President Mikhail Gorbachev had before him a
decree for his signature which would be published next week, after the
Victory Day holidays starting today. That decree, he said, would install a
'special regime' in key sectors - including coal and metallurgy - under
which workers who went on strike, and those who incited them to strike,
would be liable to prosecution. He dismissed suggestions that troops would
be used either to force workers to work or to stand in for them, saying that
the normal forces of law and order would suffice.
He appears to be thinking of an 'anti-strike' agreement for workers defined
as essential. They would receive compensation for losing the right to
strike.
The prime minister believes he is within sight of getting all 15 Soviet
republics to sign the anti-crisis plan, to which he has the agreement of the
Supreme Soviet and the backing of the president and the ruling Communist
party. He said representatives of all republics have been taking part in the
plan's formation - in Lithuania's case, with observer status - andthis
Sunday they are expected to come back to talks with Moscow, with the full
authorisation of their own governments, on what they wish to see in the
final version of the programme. Next Wednesday, the cabinet of ministers
will meet under the chairmanship of Mr Gorbachev to try to finalise a draft.
The prime minister appeared to put on one side the question of the
predominantly political Union treaty, which Mr Gorbachev has stressed must
soon be signed. Instead, he gave priority to economic agreements under the
anti-crisis programme, under which the Soviet and republican governments
would agree which 'questions should be settled through presidential decrees
and which should be tackled through the republics.'
Here, as elsewhere, Mr Pavlov indicated that it was not important which
level of government controlled which part of the economy. The essence was:
could it be done competently? He claimed to be confident that all republics
would, sooner or later, recognise economic logic and sign up to it. 'What
can Georgia (a so far recalcitrant republic) do outside the Soviet market?'
he asked.
On the other hand, he appeared to recognise the right of those republics
which wished not to sign up to be granted full independent status. 'From the
point of view of the economy, we do not differentiate between Lithuania and
Czechoslovakia, if it (the former) has not entered the economic union,' he
said. 'Why would we sell a tonne of oil to Lithuania and receive a tonne of
pork in return, when we could receive two tonnes on the market?'
His optimism may be well-founded: an official at the Moscow mission for
Armenia - one of the rebel republics - said yesterday the republic intended
to sign economic agreements with the centre, adding: 'We are still in the
Soviet Union, and we have no intention of disrupting economic links with it.
We are striving for political independence, but economic independence will
take several years.'
It is this line which Mr Pavlov sees prevailing. Next week, in his view, the
republics will be forced to choose between full economic independence and
Soviet reality.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Major 'wins backing' to slow pace of Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR believes he has won support from several other European
Community members for moderating the pace of economic and monetary union.
After lengthy talks with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, in
London on Tuesday, Mr Major telephoned Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday and
then had a working lunch with Mr Michel Rocard, the visiting French premier.
Though France is as keen as ever to press ahead, not only with Emu, but with
political union, British officials consider that both the German and Spanish
governments are now anxious not to rush towards a monetary union before
there is greater convergence of EC economies.
The views of Germany and Spain are very similar to those of Britain, the
officials maintain. The Dutch and Irish are also said to be more or less on
the same wavelength as the British. It would therefore be a mistake to
expect big developments at the EC summit in Luxembourg next month, they say.
Mr Gonzalez said after his talks with Mr Major that 'it would probably be a
mistake to come to conclusions too quickly. One would have to wait until
December. There are many political reasons for waiting in order to achieve
reasonable results from both intergovernmental conferences (on Emu and
political union).'
Mr Major and Mr Rocard also discussed the prospects for a common European
foreign and security policy. According to officials they agreed on the
general principle that Europe should play a greater role in defence policy,
but that this should not undermine Nato.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday praised his Soviet counterpart for his
'enormous accomplishments' and said he did not want a breach in the
US-Soviet relationship.
Speaking amid speculation in Washington about a summit with Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev in July, Mr Bush for the first time hinted at a sympathetic
attitude to the Soviet request for an extension of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
887m) in US export credits, mainly to buy farm products.
He said that, while the Agriculture Department had to make representations,
he had always felt 'when people are hungry, or in need of support, as it
relates to food and nourishment, that we ought to try to help.'
Mr Bush stressed his 'strong and good' relationship with Mr Gorbachev. 'The
Soviet Union is fighting difficult economic times but I am not about to
forget history and what he did in terms of eastern Europe; what he's done in
terms of perestroika and glasnost has my respect. I don't want to see a
breach in a relationship that is very strong, that has served us
extraordinarily well in recent times.'
He was speaking before meeting leaders of the three Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. While stressing that the US had never
recognised their incorporation into the Soviet Union, he argued that 'fair
and constructive negotiations' were the only way to resolve their problems
with Moscow, urging that all parties should be 'flexible and pragmatic'.
The US is keen to avoid high visibility protests, and Mr Ivars Godmanis,
Latvia's premier, said later that Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state,
had urged them to 'find some mechanism for independence which would save
face for the Soviet Union.'
No date has been set for the Bush-Gorbachev summit, but there is speculation
that it could take place just before the annual meeting of the Group of
Seven in London in July.
A stumbling block is the dispute over the interpretation of the treaty to
reduce conventional arms in Europe, which was signed last November. Marshal
Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of staff of the armed forces, will visit Washington
next week to try to resolve the remaining problems.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Rolls-Royce doubles job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine group, yesterday doubled the number of jobs it
wants to cut from its aerospace division this year to 6,000.
It warned that this could involve the first compulsory redundancies at the
company since its bankruptcy 20 years ago.
The group also announced the progressive closure of its helicopter engine
factory at Leavesden, Hertfordshire, which employs 1,750 people, and a
freeze on pay for all employees in the aerospace division for six months.
The large-scale cuts reflect the deep decline in the defence and commercial
aerospace industries as well as recession in the UK manufacturing sector in
general.
The Labour party said 15,000 jobs in industry and services had been lost in
the past 10 days, undermining any hopes the economy was showing signs of
recovery.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, described the
Rolls-Royce announcement as 'grim news which will have a devastating impact
on many communities up and down the country'.
The latest Rolls-Royce job losses come on the heels of widespread cuts at
other British aerospace and defence companies. The defence sector alone has
shed about 25,000 jobs in the past six months.
A Labour party survey showed that more than 200,000 jobs were lost in the UK
in the first three months of this year at an average of 16,000 a week.
Another large rise in unemployment is expected when official figures for
April are announced next week.
Rolls-Royce said it wanted to reduce its aerospace workforce by 18 per cent
by the end of this year by cutting 6,000 out of the division's 34,000 jobs.
The company had already announced 3,000 job cuts in its defence and
commercial aero-engine operations this year and yesterday said it would cut
a further 3,000.
These would include 1,800 jobs at the company's commercial engine business
based in Derby and 1,200 in the military engine operations at Bristol. Sir
Ralph Robins, chief executive, warned there could be further cuts next year.
He said: 'Like all aerospace companies worldwide, we are suffering from the
effects of recession, which were worsened by the Gulf war, and by cuts in
defence expenditure.'
Although the company had a strong order book and balance sheet, he said the
immediate situation was 'difficult and we have to reduce capacity and costs
over the next two years'.
With the slowdown in air travel and airlines' financial difficulties, the
company has experienced a sharp fall in income from its engine spare parts
business. Airlines have also deferred engine orders.
Rolls-Royce said it hoped to achieve as many cuts as possible voluntarily.
So far only 1,400 employees had agreed to leave and the company warned it
would have to make enforced cuts unless the number rose in the next two
months.
The continuing decline in helicopter business had made the Leavesden factory
unviable, the company said. It planned to vacate the plant by the end of
next year, transferring the helicopter business to Bristol and other plants.
The pay freeze in the aerospace division will come into effect at the end of
the current pay agreement. It will be followed by a bonus scheme related to
the performance of the business. This bonus scheme will be introduced in
January, when the company is hoping to see a recovery in the commercial
airline market.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Polly Peck may never repay Pounds 650m warn administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME Pounds 650m of the Pounds 1.15bn debts of Polly Peck International may
never be repaid, administrators of the group warned yesterday in their first
formal report on the group's finances.
The three court-appointed administrators also reported serious misgivings
that the group did not hold legal title to assets bought with its money and
said accounting deficiencies had thrown up 'serious reservations as to the
reliability and fairness of the published results'.
News of Polly Peck's financial situation, which was worse than had been
generally expected, came in a report to creditors from the three - Mr
Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and Mr
Christopher Morris of Touche Ross.
If the proposals outlined yesterday are approved by creditors at a meeting
on May 24, Mr Asil Nadir will be replaced as chairman and chief executive.
The bulk of the group's operations would be continued, rather than sold off.
Only about Pounds 500m of Polly Peck's debts are likely to be refinanced or
repaid, according to the report. This would amount to an average of 44p for
every Pounds 1 owed, compared with only 20p in the event of an immediate
liquidation.
Most of the rest of the debt would be converted into an instrument which
would pay a return based on the future performance of the group's food,
packaging and leisure businesses in northern Cyprus and Turkey.
The administrators offered little hope of this instrument paying a
substantial return. They said they had gained virtually no access to the
businesses in the Near East, and had 'serious reservations' about claims in
Polly Peck's reports that these businesses had generated two thirds of group
profits last year. To ensure the maximum possible return to creditors, Mr
Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot, may be given a role in the Near East.
'It is too early to decide what his role might be; he has influence that can
be of benefit to the creditors,' said Mr Stone. Mr Nadir has been charged
with 18 counts of theft and false accounting involving sums exceeding Pounds
20m.
In their report, the administrators warn that the Pounds 1.16bn value put in
the group's accounts on its net assets in the Near East 'cannot now be
relied on upon'.
'These do not appear to have been fully under the control of the main board
of PPI,' they said, adding: 'The administrators understand that certain
assets are not held in the name of Group companies.'
Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner of Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's auditor, said:
'The administrators have had full access to our audit working papers (those
dealing with the group accounts) and no queries have been raised with us.'

FT  09 MAY 91 / Nationwide Anglia cuts mortgage rate by 0.7 points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE Anglia, Britain's second largest building society, surprised the
mortgage market yesterday by announcing it will cut its lending rates by 0.7
percentage points.
For larger loans, Nationwide's rates will be up to 0.75 points lower than
the current bank base rate of 12 per cent.
Nationwide's move coincided with a veiled warning against early cuts in
interest rates from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of
England.
Many of Nationwide's rival lenders said this was a reasonable view. None of
them followed suit with lower rates.
Nationwide and most other UK mortgage lenders last announced reductions in
their rates after the most recent half-point cut in base rates, less than a
month ago.
However, Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's retail operations director, said
the cuts announced yesterday were not related to the society's view on base
rates.
He said it was only a 'convention' to wait for base rate cuts before
reducing mortgage rates. Nationwide was moving now because political
uncertainty had been reduced and the exchange rate appeared to be stable, he
added.
The cut applies to all mortgages and takes effect on May 11 for new
borrowers and on July 1 for existing borrowers.
Nationwide did not specify by how much it planned to reduce rates for
savers. Mr Hutchinson said: 'Savers' rates will not have a cut until around
the time when we change the rates for existing borrowers. We have some
flexibility because we are wholly funded by retail savers.'
Nationwide's competitors drew attention to the two months existing borrowers
will have to wait for a reduction, and the likely cuts in rates for savers.
Others suggested that Nationwide was seeking to increase its market share.
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said it would
'remain competitive' but was not planning an immediate decision.
Woolwich, the third biggest building society, said it would not reduce its
mortgage rate until base rates fell again. It described Nationwide's move as
a 'marketing ploy'.
Abbey National said it had 'no intention' of following Nationwide. It said:
'We think they are gambling on a further Bank of England base rate cut.
There's absolutely no indication at the moment that this is likely to
happen.'
Mr Leigh-Pemberton appeared to support this view. In a speech at the
University of Exeter strongly attacking inflation he suggested that next
week's fall in the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index to about
6.2 per cent would not be enough to justify a fifth cut in interest rates
since mid-February.
Nationwide's new rates will be 12.25 per cent for mortgages up to Pounds
60,000, 11.75 per cent up to Pounds 120,000 and 11.25 per cent for larger
loans.
By comparison, Abbey National charges 12.85 per cent for loans under Pounds
60,000, 12.15 per cent for loans up to Pounds 100,000, and 11.95 per cent
for larger loans. Woolwich offers 12.15 per cent (12.9 per cent for loans
under Pounds 60,000), with an offer of 11.65 per cent for first-time buyers.
Citibank offers 11.45 per cent for all loans from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds
150,000, and thus undercuts Nationwide for smaller mortgages.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Gorbachev decree puts strikers at risk of jail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRIKERS IN essential industries in the Soviet Union face the prospect of
fines and possible imprisonment under the terms of a decree to be issued
next week by President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The annnouncement came as the last big group of striking coal miners - in
the Kuzbas area of Siberia - agreed to return to work tomorrow, though they
reserved the right to resume protests in two months if their demands for
better pay were not met.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, concerned to stifle any new
wave of strikes in essential sectors such as those which have plagued the
coalfields for the past two months, said yesterday that the decree would
give the authorities the right to prosecute strikers and those who incite
industrial action.
The decree, part of the government's anti-crisis programme, was agreed with
the leaders of nine republics in their landmark joint statement last month.
Mr Pavlov also urged the west to abandon its 'wait and see' approach to
events in the Soviet Union and provide substantial economic aid to ensure
the success of market reforms.
He said the country above all needed western assistance for making the
rouble convertible, a move which he described as 'the second stage' of
economic reform. 'If you want to intervene, you should do so resolutely in
order to obtain concrete results instead of giving advice from the side,' he
said.
Having already introduced price reform, the country would need substantial
imports to flood the market with goods, together with stand-by credits to
support the rouble once convertibility was introduced. Mr Pavlov did not say
when he wanted to switch to a convertible currency.
But he suggested that if invited, President Gorbachev would present these
requests for assistance to the Group of Seven leading industrialised
countries at their London summit in July.
He was confident that all 15 Soviet republics, including those which want
independence, would soon subscribe to a common economic reform programme.
Representatives of all the republics were expected to to complete final work
on the anti-crisis programme on Sunday. This would be followed next
Wednesday by a meeting, to be chaired by Mr Gorbachev, of the Soviet cabinet
and republican envoys.
Soviet and western critics of the Pavlov plan, which combines institutional
reforms with anti-crisis measures, have said it is unlikely either to
achieve financial stabilisation or to break the state's stranglehold over
industry. G7 countries have so far been cool about unleashing aid.

FT  09 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures drifted lower yesterday as the market continued to lack
a strong sense of direction and turnover remained depressed.
The June FT-SE 100 index contract initially commanded a strong lead over the
stock market of around 30 Footsie points. However, with no real basis of
support the futures market's premium was quickly frittered away, and by the
time Wall Street opened, the June contract was back to its 15-point fair
value premium.
Institutional investors made an appearance in the market, returning to take
profits. One broker said the selling confirmed that 'the institutions were
back in force', with many taking the view that the market had little
immediate upside potential. But selling had not been aggressive.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,540, down 26 points, while its premium to the
spot index finished at 16 compared with 29 at the previous close.
Turnover on the traded options market remained low. Allied-Lyons was the
busiest stock option as a mixture of speculative July 600 call buying and
two-way dealing in July 550 puts lifted turnover. A total of 1,522 contracts
changed hands.
British Telecom had 1,392 lots traded, with switching out of May 330 calls
into August 360 calls and puts boosting dealing.

FT  09 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equities drift lower in poor volume
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER unimpressive trad-ing session in London saw equities give back the
gains of the previous day, discouraged by corporate developments and the
less certain trend on Wall Street.
Interest rate optimism found fresh support from sterling's continued
firmness, as well as from a cut in mortgage rates by Nationwide Anglia,
second largest of the UK building societies; but over-enthusiasm was checked
by a warning from the Governor of the Bank of England against reading too
much into the recent drop in the headline inflation rate in the UK.
Once again, the chief feature was the low level of business in the equity
market. Not since the middle of last month has daily retail volume in
equities reached the Pounds 1bn mark regarded as the minimum for a healthy,
and profitable, trading session in the London market. Seaq-recorded volume,
which takes in both retail and intra market business and is therefore a
somewhat unreliable guide to the level of genuine investment business,
reached only 387.9m shares yesterday, compared with 431.2m on Tuesday, when
turnover was swollen by the large placing of shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
The return to low trading volumes since the end of March has been
discomforting for London-based securities houses, and has been reflected
this week in further cutbacks in staff at City firms. The first quarter of
the year, when the London equity market showed one of the highest levels of
total return for the past decade, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd, had
also been accompanied by a substantial improvement in volumes.
However, there were indications yesterday that the institutions still have
heavy cash balances ready to commit when suitable situations offer
themselves. In addition to their ready response to the Dollars 1.35bn
purchase of the North Sea assets of Occidental Petroleum by Enterprise Oil
and Elf Aquitaine, the big players took up the outstanding tap stock issue
in the gilt-edged market. It was also disclosed that 89 per cent of the
Pounds 96m recent rights issue from Morgan Crucible had been taken up, and
the rump of 4.7m shares placed in the market; this was considered a highly
satisfactory outcome.
The market was on the downside throughout yesterday's trading session, with
attempts to rally repeatedly unsuccessful. A final downturn was featured by
weakness in the international oil shares as the sector backed away ahead of
today's trading statement from British Petroleum. Also unhelpful was Wall
Street's weak start to its new trading session following reports that
President Bush had suffered a further health problem.
The final reading left the FT-SE Index at 2,523.4, the fall on the day of
17.1 virtually cancelling the advance of the previous session. Market
strategists have read little into either day's market trend. Attention
remained focused on the prospects for another half- point cut in UK base
rates at the end of next week, when the April retail price index will
provide the latest evidence on UK inflation levels.
Once again, investors played closer attention to individual company
statements than to the overall trend of the market. A maintained interim
dividend from Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping
group, removed one market uncertainty.
However, SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, closed lower after
erratic price movement in spite of interim results much in line with
expectations.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Second-liners feature as
first section weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS turned to second-liners yesterday as share prices on the big board
were weakened by the fall on Wall Street and the lower yen, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 32.35 at 26,309.79. The index touched a day's low of
26,178.22 in the afternoon, but arbitrage buying brought a partial recovery
and the index later reached the day's high of 26,367.99.
Overall activity remained lacklustre as volume rose slightly to 270m shares
from 220m shares. Declines outnumbered gains by 669 to 275, with 170 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 9.67 to
1,987.04, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.69 to 1,499.08.
Traders said investors, who had expected a cut in the discount rate after
the Golden Week holidays, were disappointed by the stable monetary policy.
Concern over high arbitrage positions also depressed sentiment.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that if market conditions failed
to recover, heavy selling by investment trusts could push the Nikkei below
the important 26,000 level.
Small and medium-capital stocks with brisk earning outlooks were sought by
investors. The second section rose 8.79 to 3,397.83, while the
over-the-counter index finished 17.52 ahead at 3,286.64.
The big four Japanese brokerages promoted issues related to Japan Railway's
capital investment. Nippon Signal, a railway operation equipment maker,
closed Y50 up at Y1,620 after making a record high of Y1,670. Totetsu Kogyo,
a track maker, put on Y50 to Y1,260.
Companies which announced cuts in the minimum trading units for their shares
mostly gained ground. Tachikawa, a curtain and blind manufacturer listed on
the second section, finished a net Y120 stronger at Y4,150 after climbing to
an all-time high of Y4,320. The company announced that it would reduce the
minimum trading unit from 1,000 to 100 shares.
Nippon Television Network moved ahead Y400 to Y26,900 on declaring that it
would reduce its unit from 100 to 10 shares. On the other hand, Asatsu, the
advertising agency which was popular recently for the same reason, retreated
Y160 to Y7,830 on profit-taking.
Nihon Nohyaku, the day's most active stock, rose Y80 to Y2,540 on
speculative buying. The issue has climbed from Y750 since February 1, and
some traders are concerned about its high margin level.
Liquid crystal display makers were sought on hopes of strong sales, but fell
on late profit-taking. Sharp, which has a dominant market position, slipped
Y30 to Y1,590, while Casio Computer lost Y10 on balance at Y1,300 after
touching a year's high of Y1,340.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 175.39 to 29,185.32 on volume of 21.1m
shares. Shima Seiki attracted small-lot buying on stating that it would
reduce its trading unit to 100 from 1,000 shares. Profit-taking later pushed
the issue down to Y15,200 for a net fall of Y100.
Roundup
FINE TUNING seemed to be taking over from foreign buying yesterday, although
the latter continued to lift shares in Australia, where the Hong Kong
Chinese are said to be active, and is expected to return to New Zealand
where US activity was perceived.
NEW ZEALAND saw profit-taking after a five-day rally, the Barclays index
surrendering 23.14 or 1.5 per cent to 1,556.61 following a 7.6 per cent gain
in the previous five trading days. Turnover eased from NZDollars 21.4m to
NZDollars 20.4m. Brokers said sentiment remained generally bullish.
Brierley Investments slipped 3 cents to NZDollars 1.24 on 2.6m share volume,
after a rise of 17 cents in the previous two sessions on news that the
Singapore government is paying NZDollars 126m for a 4.7 per cent stake in
the company, and a further NZDollars 660m for a 30 per cent shareholding in
its UK hotels unit.
AUSTRALIA attracted more overseas buying as the All Ordinaries index added
7.9 at 1,545.7. Turnover expanded from ADollars 180m to ADollars 294m.
Trading volume was boosted by the sale of 25.9m shares in TNT, the transport
group, for around ADollars 34.5m by the shipping and coal concern McIlwraith
McEacharn. TNT firmed 4 cents to ADollars 1.43 after short sellers had to
buy back the stock at a higher price.
MANILA's initial gains were shaved by profit-taking, leaving the composite
index 12.54 up on the day at 1,113.43. BANGKOK's SET index ended 8.61 better
at 848.67, recovering less than a third of Tuesday's 27.94 or 3.2 per cent
drop on political worries.
HONG KONG, where the vice-chairman of the stock exchange resigned yesterday
after advocating preferential treatment for council members in new share
issues, closed modestly higher. The Hang Seng index improved 6.29 to
3,747.80; turnover was little changed at HKDollars 1.12bn.
SEOUL's increasing concern over political uncertainties left the composite
index down 4.05 at 631.12, its fifth fall in a row.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: European papermakers anticipate
recovery - They have attracted investors hunting for cheap, cyclical stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL AROUND the world, pulp and paper companies have been reporting
disastrous results. In the US, almost all the big paper companies have
announced sharp profit falls for the first quarter of 1991 and, if anything,
the situation is even worse north of the border in Canada.
The big Nordic companies have also been struggling with depressed pulp
prices, high costs and severe over-capacity in many sectors of the market.
Sweden's pulp and paper companies saw their pre-tax profits fall on average
by 35 per cent last year, and many in the industry are expecting worse to
follow in 1991.
Even the largely self-sufficient Japanese companies, which are normally a
law unto themselves, have been feeling the squeeze because of over-capacity
in the industry. The downswing in the pulp and paper cycle has struck with a
vengeance.
Yet set against this dismal industrial background, many of the big paper
companies' share prices in most of these markets have climbed sharply since
the beginning of the year.
For example, a composite index of several Nordic paper companies, including
Stora and SCA of Sweden, Metsa-Serla, Kymmene, UPM and Enso-Gutzeit of
Finland, and Norske Skog of Norway, shows a 28 per cent improvement since
the start of 1991. This compares with an 18 per cent rise for Nordic shares
in general, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
Is this simply another curious case of stock market perversity, or is there
a rationale for this remarkably buoyant performance?
The justification that analysts advance for the strength of equity prices in
this sector is that, since the beginning of the year, institutional
investors have been on the prowl for relatively cheap stocks in
traditionally cyclical industries, and have focused on paper and packaging
shares as representative of these investment criteria.
Thus the stock market is performing its classical function of anticipating
future economic and industrial developments.
However, Mr Peter Bradshaw, an analyst who follows the Nordic paper
companies for Swiss Bank Corporation, believes the surge is premature and is
anticipating a recovery that will not happen for some months to come.
He adds: 'What we have seen is a huge run-up in a lot of the shares since
the Gulf war ended and we are now at a critical point. My own view is that
the share prices have run ahead of the fundamentals.'
A consensus appears to have emerged that the bottom of the pulp and paper
cycle has now been reached and that the upswing is now in sight. But Mr
Bradshaw has his doubts.
'As far as any upturn is concerned, there is still no sign on the horizon.
All of the (paper) markets, with the exception of Germany, remain weak,' he
says.
Germany is still benefiting from what one analyst describes as the 'feel
good' sentiment of unification, and demand for paper and board products has
generally remained strong.
PWA, Germany's largest producer of paper and board and the eighth biggest
European group, has seen its shares surge 24.3 per cent since the start of
1991, compared with 15.2 per cent for the German market as measured by the
FAZ index.
Unlike many other paper companies, PWA is still undervalued, according to
some analysts. The company has good defensive strengths and does not suffer
from the same cost pressures as its Swedish and Finnish rivals; yesterday it
maintained its dividend and reminded investors that its group net profits
actually rose by 10 per cent in 1990.
Although shares in the Nordic paper sector may now pause for breath, they
should move ahead again strongly when firmer evidence emerges that the
industry is on the upward path.
They may be lifted by takeover speculation as much as by the prospects for a
swift rebuilding of profits, as the industry continues its voracious
consolidation.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Norway hits 1991 high on quiet
Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIA apart, volume was thin in most continental bourses yesterday, as
traders and investors looked forward to today's Ascension Day holiday. Paris
was closed, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT did its best to avoid commitment, and turnover on German stock
exchanges stayed low at DM4.4bn, against DM4.2bn on Tuesday. However, prices
moved down, some of them considerably.
After an 8.87 drop to 681.21 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed
20.18, or 1.2 per cent lower at 1,607.28. There was particular weakness in
chemicals and mechanical engineering, and relative strength in energy stocks
like RWE, only DM2 lower at DM401.50, and Veba, down DM1.10 to DM348.90.
The engineering losses were apparently indiscriminate. Lower profits from
Metallgesellschaft followed two days of strength on a DM1bn project to clean
up pollution in East Germany, and coincided with a report from Barclays de
Zoete Wedd which said that Germany's mechanical engineering industry is on
its way into recession. The shares fell DM7.50 to DM546, but there was more
severe weakness in Linde and MAN - down DM16 to DM798, and DM9.50 to DM379
respectively - for which BZW saw above-average prospects
SEL, the telecom company 86 per cent owned by the French Alcatel group,
dropped another DM22 to DM328 for a two-day loss of DM51. On Tuesday it
reported that net profits had almost disappeared in 1990, and passed the
dividend; but Ms Heidemarie Hoppner of B Metzler in Frankfurt observed that
the company had revealed to analysts that it still had DVFA earnings of DM15
a share for last year.
Another big faller was Continental, the tyre manufacturer, down DM6.70 to
DM197 as it called an extraordinary supervisory board meeting for today.
Last week the company halved its 1990 dividend.
OSLO hit a year's high in active trading as foreign investors showed renewed
interest. The all-share index, which gained 2.5 per cent on Tuesday, rose
4.90 to 506.17, passing the previous 1991 high set in early March. Turnover
grew to NKr588m from NKr517m.
Kvaerner rose NKr4.5 to NKr202 after the engineering company revised upwards
its 1991 profits forecast. The board also won approval for plans to merge
with Kvaerner Shipping, and for an issue of 3.5m new shares. Saga, which
announced first-quarter profits after the market closed, added NKr2.5 to
NKr115.
MILAN continued to fall in thin trading on increased worries that Italy's
50th postwar government could collapse over disagreement on the current
budget discussions. The Comit index fell 6.81 or 1.2 per cent to 574.88 in
volume estimated at slightly above Tuesday's low L106bn.
Fiat ordinary shares dropped L132 to L5,267, following Tuesday's news that
its new car deliveries had fallen 15.5 per cent in April, and continued to
slide in after-hours trading to L5,250.
Olivetti fell L82 to L3,648 on a newspaper report that Volkswagen of Germany
might sell its 5 per cent stake in the computer company. One analyst said he
would not be surprised if the car company sold its holding, as it was not
integral to its core business. Furthermore, Olivetti's current difficulties
made an early recovery in the share price unlikely. After the market closed,
Volkswagen issued a denial.
AMSTERDAM was mostly easier with the exception of Internatio-Muller which
jumped 7.8 per cent on speculative buying. The CBS tendency index fell 0.4
to 94.2 in quiet trading.
Internatio gained Fl 6 to Fl 83 following Tuesday's news of a takeover offer
from Hong Kong's First Pacific. But Hagemeyer, 60 per cent owned by First
Pacific, fell Fl 2.80 to Fl 119.50. Both shares were suspended on Tuesday.
Buhrmann-Tetterode, ex dividend of Fl 2.80, was hurt by its recent profit
warning. It closed down Fl 4.10 at Fl 52.60.
STOCKHOLM fell in a busy half-day session. The Affarsvarlden general index
lost 5.9 to 1,036.0 in turnover up from SKr343m to SKr380m. Ericsson B
shares dropped SKr8 or 4.2 per cent to SKr181 in turnover of SKr56m, after
Tuesday's late announcement of a 14 per cent fall in first-quarter profits.
MADRID was little changed. The general index eased 0.49 to 279.55, while
turnover picked up to about Pta11bn from Pta9.4bn.
Focsa was requoted, rising to Pta14,960 before falling back to close Pta200
lower at Pta14,500. It was suspended from trading on Tuesday for the
announcement that it is to be merged with another construction company owned
by the same family interests.
VIENNA fell 1.7 per cent to its worst level since the end of March,
following losses in Frankfurt and overnight on Wall Street. The bourse index
shed 9.88 to 565.77 in active trade.
ZURICH went with the tide, dropping Nestle registered by SFr130 to SFr8,360
although the food group said yesterday that sales were rising and that 1991
profits, with a proviso on exchange rates, should be better this year. The
Credit Suisse index fell 3.4 to 542.4.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Rates stay soft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE-MONTH sterling interbank, the most important guide to base interest
rate levels on the London money market, straddled the 11 1/2 per cent level
yesterday.
This points to a cut of  1/2 point in bank base rates, with the market
regarding Friday May 17 as a possible date, after publication of the April
UK retail price index.
The Bank of England has discouraged such speculation however. It kept the
short end of the market tight yesterday by not supplying enough help to take
out the full underlying shortage. The central bank has also lent funds at 12
per cent on the last four Fridays. Three-month interbank was quoted at 11
9/16 -11 7/16 per cent compared with 11 9/16 -11 1/2 on Tuesday, while
12-month money fell to 11 3/16 -11 1/16 from 11 1/4 -11 1/8 per cent.
Short sterling prices maintained a firm tone on Liffe. June delivery opened
at 88.87 and held in a narrow range before finishing at 88.88, against 88.85
previously.
Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,150m, but revised this to
Pounds 1,250m at noon and to Pounds 1,300m in the afternoon. Total
assistance of Pounds 1,018m was provided.
In early operations the authorities bought Pounds 255m bank bills outright
in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 421m bills were
purchased, by way of Pounds 138m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent;
Pounds 64m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 219m
bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon Pounds 222m bank bills were bought in band 1 at 11 7/8 per
cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 120m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,064m, with bank balances below target
absorbing Pounds 325m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds
225m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 15m.
In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.80 from 8.85 per cent despite a net drain
of DM1.6bn from the banking system at this week's securities repurchase
agreement tender.
The Bundesbank allocated DM22.1bn for 35 days at a fixed 8.60 per cent, to
replace an expiring facility of DM23.7bn.
Trading conditions were comfortable however, with banks reserve holdings
averaging a high DM77.2bn for the first six days of the month.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices continue to forge ahead from day to day. There is a
long way to go before the old floor price basis of 700 cents is scaled
again, but progress made has been far greater than anyone forecast, and
confidence breeds further buying. The outlook into next season, from July
onwards, is more clouded. Supply still seems quite likely to exceed demand,
and as the pipeline is refilled demand itself could slow down. There are
improvements in UK activity and business, but emergence from the recession
is very far from full yet.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chevron pours oil on troubled
waters - As the Angolan ceasefire approaches, Julian Ozanne looks at the oil
sector's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOW-LEGGED Americans in jeans, cowboy boots, and shiny rodeo belt buckles
stand around the air-conditioned pool hall in Chevron's Malongo camp,
sipping Budweiser, Miller Lite and US-imported Coke Classic.
Outside in the steamy equatorial heat, helicopters flown by Vietnam veterans
ferry oilmen between the offshore rigs and platforms to the camp, passing
over a well-watered nine-hole golf course, astro-turf greens, tennis courts
and the steady flow of Ford and Chevrolet pick-ups along a network of
immaculate tarmac roads.
Malongo camp, on the sweltering central African coast, is the base of
operations for the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (Cabgoc), a successful and
productive joint venture oil company in which the Angolan state oil company,
Sonangol, has a majority 51 per cent shareholding.
Operated by Chevron, the largest private shareholder, the camp is more like
Texas than Angola. It is one of the reasons why the war-torn and
economically crippled country has become one of the fastest-growing oil
producers in Africa and the second largest after Nigeria.
A huge influx of foreign investment and expertise in the early 1980s has
laid the basis for a doubling of Angola's production in the last six years
from 232,000 barrels per day in 1985 to 476,000 bpd last year. Cabgoc's
Cabinda offshore concession contributed about 45-50 per cent of national
production in 1990. Proven reserves last year stood at 2.34bn barrels, the
equivalent of nearly 14 years of production at current levels.
The oil industry has played a vital role in the Angolan economy, plagued by
16 years of destructive civil war and inefficient socialist central
planning.
The sector earned Angola Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.56bn) in 1989, accounting
for about 91 per cent of export earnings, 57 per cent of real GDP and 62 per
cent of fiscal revenues.
Investment in exploration and development in the Angolan oil industry in the
last three years is estimated at about Dollars 2-2.5bn, largely due to big
discoveries and development in Block 3, a production-sharing agreement
operated by Elf Aquitaine - Angola's second largest producer  - and
continued development in the Cabinda offshore concession, including the
recent construction of two new production platforms and a water injection
platform.
According to Mr Joao Lourenco Landoite, Angola's petroleum minister, the
pace of investment and development will pick up dramatically over the next
five years.
Bidding is due to open for five of 16 new deep water concessions ranging
from 500-2000 feet. A model contract has already been drawn up setting out
the number of wells to be drilled, the minimum expenditure and the signature
bonus.
Preliminary talks have already been held with several interested oil
companies, including British Petroleum and Shell, which are not currently
operating in Angola.
'We want to get more foreign companies coming into Angola for oil
exploration, and if they are British companies they are welcome,' said Mr
Landoite, who visited London in March. 'We need new experience, new money
and we want to better understand the international oil industry.'
In addition to the new deeper water blocks, significant investment is
expected in exploration activity in several new areas recently awarded or
under negotiation, including an onshore concession at Cabinda with BP and
other shallow water offshore concessions with Unocal, Conoco, Elf, Total and
Texaco.
Mr Landoite is also currently tying up a Dollars 120m financing package to
allow Sonangol to act as operator for the first time with technical
assistance from Range Oil in Block 4.
Further exploration, development and recovery in the Cabinda offshore
fields, where four rigs are currently active, is expected to boost Cabgoc's
production to 325,000-350,000 b/d in 1994. The Ministry of Petroleum
projects total national production in 1994 from existing producing
concessions at 611,000 b/d.
With a ceasefire in the 16-year civil war now agreed for May 15, Mr Landoite
is also optimistic about the development of other onshore concessions and
the five southernmost shallow water offshore concessions - blocks 9-13 -
whose prospects have been hindered because of insecurity and the threat of
rebel attack. Peace will also dramatically reduce the huge foreign exchange
costs of transport, insurance and importing all goods, even basic foodstuffs
and beverages.
While the enclave offshore oil sector has been largely insulated from the
civil war, isolated attacks did create problems. In February, 120 foreigners
working for Conoco had to be evacuated from Ambriz after rebels besieged the
town.
Foreign companies have found the investment climate favourable in Angola.
The oil industry operates outside of the administrative and foreign exchange
controls imposed on the rest of the economy. Profitability has been high as
a result of low costs of production, the high exploration success rate and
the government's flexible policy on fiscal matters.
Foreign investors have also been attracted to Angola because crude
production is not limited by quotas imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
Domestic distribution of petroleum products is currently carried out
exclusively by Sonangol, but Mr Landoite says the government will privatise
distribution this year.
'It has been a mistake. We must open the market to privately owned local and
foreign companies. There is no way of going on as we are now,' he said.
While most industry analysts foresee a healthy and exciting future ahead for
the Angolan oil sector, some doubts remain over the operations of Sonangol,
allegations of high-level government corruption and the real net inflow into
the country of oil earnings.
In an otherwise candid interview, Mr Landoite excused himself from
addressing the question of the net inflow of earnings, confirming suspicions
that a controversy is raging in government about the huge outflows from the
oil sector in expatriate salaries, dividends, transport, insurance and
oil-industry imports.
Maximising the benefits of the oil sector for the domestic Angolan economy
will be a pressing task as the oil industry continues to expand rapidly in
the coming years.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin prices forecast to rise
strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN PRICES will rally to Dollars 6,500 a tonne in the next six months,
correct and gradually rise to Dollars 7,500 a tonne 'within the next 12
months,' according to a special report from Rudolf Wolff, the London trader,
writes David Blackwell.
Yesterday cash tin on the London Metal Exchange closed at Dollars 5,770 a
tonne, a rise of Dollars 15 on the day.
In the short term, says Wolff, any significant rally is likely to be met by
a knee-jerk reaction from lower cost producers. But trade buyers willing to
take a longer view will in the end force the consumer's hand, provoking
forward buying.
'This will provide the market with a solid floor until confidence is
restored and producers find an application for strategic hedging, which has
been unnecessary for so long in the tin market.'
On the supply side, Wolff expects the market imbalance to be redressed quite
quickly. At present price levels Wolff estimates about 60 per cent of
production is uneconomical.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Elf Enterprise Petroleum in innovative
finance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Enterprise Petroleum, the new joint company formed by Elf Aquitaine and
Enterprise Oil, secured economically attractive financing yesterday by
making innovative use of an equity-linked structure.
Elf Enterprise Finance issued Pounds 438m of bonds exchangeable into Elf
Enterprise Petroleum ordinary shares, the second largest offering in the
sterling convertible market after Hanson's Pounds 500m issue last month.
Previously, the exchangeable structure has been used by companies to trade
out of hostile stakes in target companies, for example, General Cinema
issued bonds exchangeable into Cadbury-Schweppes shares, News Corporation
into Pearson and Bond Corporation into Allied-Lyons.
But in this instance, Elf Aquitaine's 25 per cent holding of Enterprise Oil
shares is to provide funds for a joint venture between the two companies,
while at the same time closing out the overhang of Enterprise oil equity,
which had put some pressure on its share price.
'(The exchangeable bond structure) balanced marketing requirements with the
need to deploy shares into mutually-owned assets, to maximise proceeds from
the exchangeable bonds without putting undue pressure on our ordinary
shares', said Mr John Walmsley, financial director of Enterprise Oil.
An equity placing would have raised less than the convertible, as the shares
would have had to be priced at a discount to the current market price. The
exchange price for the bonds is 640p, 15 per cent above Tuesday's closing
level.
The deal was primarily aimed at UK investors, but was also broadly
distributed in Europe. Dealers said the issue met strong demand from both
equity investors - the bonds yield about 5 per cent more than the underlying
shares, with the exchange price set at a reasonably premium - and bond
investors.
Lead manager SG Warburg, joint lead Goldman Sachs and co-lead Cazenove split
an 'exempt list' of more than 100 big institutional accounts, mainly UK,
between them, which other underwriters banned from calling. Although this
practice, sometimes seen in the domestic market, helped facilitate orderly
distribution of the deal, the size of the list was felt to be excessive.
The deal performed strongly to close at 100 1/4 bid, above its par issue
price.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Singapore may face shortage
of staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE'S financial sector looks set to remain a strong part of the
buoyant south-east Asian economy, according to a survey by the Singapore
Institute of Banking and Finance.
However, bankers fear growth could bring staff shortages, writes Christine
Moir.
The sector has grown at an average of 20 per cent a year for the last five
years, twice the rate for the economy as a whole. Last year, its growth was
22 per cent compared with an average for the country of 8.3 per cent, and it
employs 4.2 per cent of the labour force.
According to a survey of 292 financial institutions by the IBF last autumn,
employment in foreign exchange and treasury functions, and investment
management (the sectors with the strongest economic growth) is likely to
increase by 6.6 per cent a year over the next three years. Demand in futures
and options trading, retail banking and computer services will be similar.
Top salary scales have reached international levels; the IBF survey assumes
average top executive salaries equivalent to USDollars 950,000. Mean
salaries for the sector are about USDollars 24,000, nearly three times the
average wage in Singapore.
At the other end of the scale, basic clerical staff receive about USDollars
8,000. This is insufficient to attract immigrants from other Asian centres
such as Hong Kong, let alone international financial markets.
Most senior financial sector executives expect business to remain robust,
possibly outstripping the IBF forecast of staffing growth of 5.9 per cent,
3.2 and 3 per cent during each of the next three years.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Blazing a trail in southern
Italy - Haig Simonian explains the change of status for Banco di Napoli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO di Napoli, the large public-sector Italian bank, is called many names,
but 'trail-blazer' is not one of them.
However, the Naples-based bank, which is the biggest financial institution
in southern Italy and the fifth largest nationally, is the first big bank to
decide to use new laws letting it list up to 49 per cent of its shares on
the stock exchange.
Precisely when the bank goes ahead will depend on market conditions, says Mr
Antonio Sussi, its deputy director-general, who is also responsible for its
international activities. However, he adds, 'we expect to issue within the
year'.
Although some large public-sector banks, such as Banca Commerciale Italiana
(BCI) and Credito Italiano, are quoted, most are not.
Neither municipally-owned savings banks, such as Milan's Cariplo, are
listed, nor the handful of large banks which, like Banco di Napoli, are
owned by charitable foundations.
The closest private investors can get to such institutions is to buy special
categories of shares such as the non-voting savings stock which some have
listed, or the ordinary shares of quoted subsidiaries, such as Monte dei
Paschi di Siena's Banca Toscana operation.
Last year, legislation allowed such big banks to change their legal status
to joint stock companies, and thus move towards floating up to 49 per cent
of their ordinary shares. The decision at Banco di Napoli's annual meeting
on April 29 to change its status means it should be the first to go ahead.
How much the move will raise remains unclear. However, Mr Sussi stresses the
bank has put its long-standing problem of shortage of capital behind it.
The change to joint stock status will be accompanied by a revaluation of
assets which is set to more than double the bank's net worth from L1,742bn
at end-1990 to L3,620bn.
'At this point, we become a much bigger bank,' says Mr Sussi.
The figure will reach more than L5,000bn if subordinated loans and other
factors, such as the first L140bn tranche of a four-tranche L850bn cash
injection from the Italian Treasury, are included.
The changes will leave the previously under-capitalised bank much better
placed. At the end of last year, it had reached the Bank of Italy's current
capital standards.
The recapitalisation will also put it above the 1993 norms from the Bank for
International Settlements, Mr Sussi says. 'We will have a lot of room to
grow.'
Shareholders in the 'new' joint stock Banco di Napoli, which will be
formally launched on July 1, will be the foundation - which currently owns
all the bank - and the Italian Treasury. Following the translation of last
year's injection of Treasury funds into new shares in the bank, they will
have stakes of about 93 per cent and 6.5 per cent stake each.
Mr Sussi cannot say whether the bank will float 49 per cent of its stock on
the bourse in one go or will opt for smaller tranches. 'We really haven't
thought about that yet. It will depend on the market.'
Discussion of possible foreign tranches and potential lead managers for the
offering is also premature. 'We have to be sure the shares get placed with
investors who won't immediately sell them back in Italy,' notes Mr Sussi.
Although the bulk of the issue will be sold domestically, 'we could also
sell some shares abroad if we get the feeling that there are long-term
investors", says Mr Sussi. As matters stand, the bank reckons that more than
10 per cent of its savings shares are held outside Italy.
Banco di Napoli has grown in attractiveness as an investment since the early
1980s, when it barely made money. Even if profits remain relatively low, net
earnings jumped by 40.5 per cent to L104bn in 1989 and leapt a further 52.4
per cent to L159bn last year.
That came despite a contraction in total assets to L82,870bn from L85,128bn
in 1989, reflecting the bank's tougher policy on lending. According to
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its loan loss provisions are now in line with
industry averages.
Shareholders have already had some reward, with the dividend on savings
shares being raised last year to L1,600 a share from L1,400.
Analysts say there is further profit potential in the bank's pension scheme.
The current, fully-funded in-house scheme is believed to be over-provided,
allowing scope for considerable savings in future. No allocation was made to
the fund last year.
The bank, which now has 617 branches, has been expanding its domestic
coverage, notably in the south. 'The south of Italy is still underbanked,'
says Mr Sussi. The bank plans to open almost 140 new branches this year,
most of them small units.
Further internationalisation is also in the pipeline, although Mr Sussi
rejects rumours that the bank is on the brink of a cross-equity deal with a
foreign counterpart.
'We have an operating agreement with Banco Exterior of Spain, but there is
nothing else planned,' he says. 'Our position is first to change the bank's
status; that will show our full strength. Then we can talk with others.'
With its new capital, is there not the risk of suddenly throwing caution to
the winds and spending wildly on acquisitions? 'It won't happen to us. We've
spent too many years living within very tight capital bounds,' says Mr
Sussi.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: HK issue will mature under
Chinese rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG Kong's heavily indebted, state-owned Mass Transit Railway yesterday
announced the issue of the first international bond from the colony with a
maturity stretching beyond 1997 - when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty, writes Our Financial Staff.
International bankers' confidence in Hong Kong has been shaken by Peking
refusing to back a HKDollars 100bn international airport project.
The MTR has built a reputation among international financial institutions as
a reliable borrower. It said its HKDollars 280m private placement bond,
maturing in 1998, was the first on the international market by a Hong Kong
issuer with a post-1997 maturity.
Mr Roger Moss, MTR finance director said the issue should not be seen as a
measure of confidence in the colony. 'We haven't suggested this deal signals
confidence in Hong Kong beyond 1997. There are bigger (political) issues to
look at if you want to discuss confidence in Hong Kong.
'This is a signal that a well-known borrower can complete a deal that goes
beyond 1997. We've always said that when the time is right, we would go for
a deal beyond 1997.' The issue, to be signed in Tokyo on May 22 but already
completed with lenders, is arranged by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
and co-arranged by a syndicate of six Japanese banks.
'I'm quite sure this issue will be a success given the quality of the MTR
and their relationship with the international market,' a source at a
European bank said.
However, a source at a Japanese bank which took part in the latest deal
said: 'It's interesting, but it's too small to be significant. It's
basically a private, targeted deal'.
Mr Moss is credited with steering the railway company down an innovative
borrowing path through instruments such as Eurocommercial paper with Euroyen
options, Canadian dollar Eurobonds and Hong Kong dollar/US dollar dual
currency medium-term notes.
In 1989, a Euromoney survey published three months after the Tiananmen
square massacre, showed that the MTR was considered the world's third most
professional borrower after the World Bank and Sweden. At the end of 1990,
MTR's total outstanding debt stood at HKDollars 18.49bn against HKDollars
17.39bn in 1989.

THE Adelaide Steamship group, formerly run by Mr John Spalvins, will receive
ADollars 411m (USDollars 321m) from the flotation of National Foods, a new
company formed to acquire the food business of Industrial Equity.
The prospectus for the flotation, filed with the Australian Securities
Commission, shows that National Foods will raise ADollars 235m through a
share issue, and fund the rest through debt.
The funds will be distributed by Industrial Equity to its joint owners,
Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth, all part of the loose-knit
Adsteam group.
The return to Adsteam is around the level indicated by the group as part of
a proposed restructuring focused on its David Jones and Woolworths retailing
arms.
The restructuring was abandoned last week after the failure of the group's
main companies to achieve agreement with their banks to reschedule more than
ADollars 6bn in debt.
The companies are now seeking individual agreements which are expected to
lead to a series of flotations, led by David Jones, an up-market chain
store, and Woolworths, a successful supermarket chain owned by Industrial
Equity.
National Foods will be one of Australia's largest dairy marketing companies.
with a portfolio of well-known brand names.
Mr Spalvins, who transformed Adsteam from a small shipping company into one
of Australia's largest corporations, was fired as chief executive in March
after the group reported a consolidated net loss of ADollars 1.2bn for the
six months to December.

PAN AM, the financially pressed US airline which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, said it would resume transatlantic
services to London later this month, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Its announcement comes as profitability in the US industry recovers from the
shock of the Gulf war.
Pan Am sold its routes into London's Heathrow airport to United Airlines in
April, after its cash needs had become acute. Its jets will now fly into
Gatwick airport only.
Pan Am said its daily non-stop Miami-London service would start on May 18,
using Boeing 747 equipment. Although this authority has been operated by
United recently, Pan Am said it would honour all reservations issued by the
larger carrier for flights after May 17.
On May 23, it will resume services on the Detroit-London route with three
weekly flights. This will be stepped up to five flights a week on June 15,
with the flight being extended to Cleveland.

THE FATE of FNN, the business news media group put up for sale in November
and entered into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year, hangs in the
balance after a bidding war erupted between the two groups vying for it,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
A joint venture between Dow Jones and Westinghouse Broadcasting increased
its bid from an all-cash offer of Dollars 115m to Dollars 167.1m, made up of
Dollars 125m in cash, Dollars 32.8m in future revenues and Dollars 9.3m of
assumed liabilities.
CNBC, a cable television subsidiary of General Electric, has also submitted
a revised bid, of Dollars 146.1m, including Dollars 140m in cash and Dollars
6.1m in assumed liabilities.
Dow Jones/Westinghouse has filed an anti-trust suit in an attempt to prevent
an acquisition by CNBC, which operates the main competitor to FNN's business
channel. The Federal Trade Commission has already said it would not block a
CNBC acquisition on anti-trust grounds.

MAGNUM of New Zealand is paying NZDollars 48.8m (USDollars 28.8m) to gain a
controlling shareholding in Wilson Neill, the diversified group.
Magnum, the Auckland-based liquor and grocery group, is to buy 61m shares
from Mr Colin Herbert, Wilson Neill managing director, which will increase
its holding to 49.4 per cent from 31.4 per cent.
Mr Herbert has also signed a put option to sell Magnum a further 14m shares
in July, which will increase Magnum's stake to 53.5 per cent.
All the shares are being sold at 65 cents, compared with yesterday's market
price of 58 cents.
A former publican, Mr Herbert has taken Wilson Neill from a small,
diversified company, which he gained control of in 1984, to 15th in size on
the New Zealand stock market.
Wilson Neill has recently disposed of most of its fishing interests, taken
control of Tasmania's Cascade Brewery, and acquired a 50 per cent stake in
Australian Pubco, a joint venture with Carlton United Breweries of
Australia.
Magnum has recently bought interests in another chain of 70 hotels in an
Australian tourist hotel group and other wine and spirit interests in
Australia.
Magnum is 54.4 per cent owned by a joint venture between Asia Pacific
Breweries of Singapore, which is a joint venture with Heineken, and Magnum's
former majority owner, Brierley Investments.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: ITT chief forecasts strong rise
in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAND ARASKOG, whose compensation as chairman of ITT has been sharply
criticised because of the group's flat earnings, forecast the company would
have stronger operating profits this year.
Mr Araskog, speaking in Leominster, Massachusetts, where the
hotels-to-insurance conglomerate held its annual meeting, did not elaborate.
In 1990, the group had operating profits of Dollars 1.11bn, excluding its
investment in the telecommunications equipment company Alcatel.
The largest public pension fund in the US, the California Public Employees
Retirement System, voted against re-election of the company's directors at
the meeting in protest against Mr Araskog's 1990 compensation. However, the
directors were overwhelmingly re-elected.
In a year when ITT's earnings rose 3.9 per cent, to Dollars 958m, and its
share price sank 18 per cent, Mr Araskog's cash compensation rose by about
50 per cent to Dollars 5.5m.
His compensation has become a lightning rod for mounting US shareholder
concern over apparent disparities between generous executive pay and poor
corporate performance.
According to a recent survey by Business Week magazine, the average chief
executive's salary and bonus rose by 3.5 per cent last year to Dollars 1.21m
despite a 7 per cent drop in profits.
The Californian pension fund, which is taking a lead among institutional
investors on pay issues, said Mr Araskog did not deserve his pay rise
because the company's performance had been 'mediocre'.
It calculated that his pay over the past four years had been more than
double the going rate for chief executives of companies of a comparable size
and performance.
But ITT replied that the board's compensation committee, which used outside
compensation consultants, felt the chairman's pay was entirely appropriate
in the light of his performance and accomplishments. Mr Araskog said the sum
fairly reflected long-term performance.

rail link
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CANADA and Canadian Pacific are studying how they could both benefit
from a proposed USDollars 6bn high-speed rail system between Quebec City and
Montreal and Toronto-Windsor.
They are jointly exploring business and leisure travel patterns that would
emerge in the so-called Quebec City-Windsor corridor, where nearly half of
Canada's 26m population lives.
The Montreal-Toronto air route is the only profitable domestic run in
current conditions, and Air Canada has more than half the traffic.
Canadian Pacific, through its CP Rail freight subsidiary, owns one of the
two rights-of-way in the corridor. Some of its track might be used for the
high-speed system, and although it has long moved out of long-distance
passenger services, it manages commuter rail systems in Toronto and
Montreal.
The CDollars 500,000 study is aimed at identifying business opportunities
for both companies if and when the high-speed link is built.
'We specialise in high-speed transportation,' said Mr Claude Taylor, Air
Canada chairman. 'We have a sophisticated computerised reservations system
and well-developed routes and connections. Our frequent flier programme is a
strong marketing tool.'
Air Canada believes connector services for the high-speed rail system could
be provided jointly with CP, using Toronto and Montreal, the country's two
largest cities, as hubs.
Bombardier and GEC-Alsthom are proposing to use an adapted French high speed
train for the corridor and Asea Brown Boveri wants to use Swedish or German
equipment. However, opponents argue that population density in the corridor
is still insufficient to make a high-speed rail link economic.

<TEXT>
COAL and Allied Industries (CAIL), the Australian group which is the target
of a ADollars 437m hostile bid by CRA, is worth at least ADollars 595m
(USDollars 464m), according to a report released yesterday.
The report, by Grant Samuel and Associates, says CAIL shares are worth
between ADollars 10.70 and ADollars 11.20, valuing the company at between
ADollars 595m and ADollars 623m. CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of
the UK, has refused to increase its offer of ADollars 7.85 per share.
Grant Samuel's report, commissioned by CAIL, says the CRA offer does not
reflect the strategic value of acquiring the low cost mines operated by
CAIL, which is Australia's second largest coal producer.
The report says CAIL's significant coal reserves 'could support incremental
expansion of production (by CRA) at a much lower capital cost than would be
required by new projects'.
The acquisition of CAIL would also increase CRA's ability to influence the
market and reduce competition between Australian exporters, it says.
Mr Neil Currie, CAIL chairman, told shareholders that the board continued to
regard CRA's offer as 'inadequate and unacceptable'.
CAIL shares closed 12 cents lower on the Australian Stock Exchange
yesterday, at ADollars 8.44.

SEARS, Roebuck, the troubled US retailing conglomerate, said yesterday that

District Judge Ronald Buckwalter denied a motion by the stockholders, who

that Sears failed to disclose, in proxy materials for the meeting, the
existence of a 1988 shareholder suit in Chicago against the company.
The Chicago case, revealed last weekend in a newspaper article, alleges that
a restructuring of Sears in 1988 was meant to entrench management against a

<TEXT>
MANNESMANN and Metallgesellschaft, two leading German diversified
engineering and metals groups, yesterday reported a fall in earnings
reflecting a slowdown in world economic growth and weakness in some key
markets.
Both companies, among the most acquisitive on the German business scene
during the last few years, have been preparing shareholders for a downturn
in profits as a result of worsening trading conditions in recent months.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive at Metallgesellschaft, which has
activities in metals, engineering and chemicals, told shareholders at the
annual meeting that group pre-tax earnings fell 28 per cent in the first
half of the year ending September 30.
He said the company did not expect 'to meet its profit targets fully'.
Mr Schimmelbusch, who has pioneered a move by Metallgesellschaft into the
environmental technology field, told the meeting that the international
growth slowdown, lower raw material prices, and the fall in the dollar were
all factors behind the profits fall.
Mannesmann, which has a stake in Britain's TI group, reported 1990 group net
profits of DM464m (Dollars 269.7), down from DM505m in 1989. This
represented a lower figure than indicated in February, when the company
expected to match 1989 results.
Mannesmann said it was proposing a DM9 dividend for 1990, unchanged from the
1989 payout made up of a DM8 dividend with a DM1 bonus.
Operating profits last year fell slightly to DM1bn from DM1.05bn in 1989.
Mannesmann parent company net profits rose to DM355m from DM287m.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyremaker, is to hold a hurriedly-called meeting of
its supervisory board today to discuss a renewed request from Pirelli of
Italy for further talks after the rejection of its initial merger proposal.
Normally, the supervisory board, headed by Mr Ulrich Weiss, an executive
director of Deutsche Bank, meets only a few times a year.
The fact that today is a public holiday in Germany adds a note of urgency.
Neither company would make any official comment on the meeting.
Pirelli has made clear it remains keen on an amalgamation and wants further
discussions. Continental has said it is only interested in talks about
co-operation and not about merging, or at least not on Pirelli's terms,
which would have left the Italian company in control.
It was unclear yesterday whether the non-executive supervisory board would
itself back a revised approach by Pirelli. Mr Weiss has previously supported
the idea of discussions in principle, but has backed Continental's chief
executive, Mr Horst Urban, in its outright opposition to Pirelli's original
proposal.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Nestle confident despite sales
drop

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss group and the world's biggest foods company, yesterday
disclosed a 1.8 per cent decline to SFr11.1bn (Dollars 7.6bn) in
first-quarter turnover. However, it said full-year 1991 sales and earnings
were expected to show an improvement.
Exchange rates had moved more favourably during April, and sales and
earnings should improve over the next eight months, said Mr Helmut Maucher,
managing director. The goal was 4 per cent growth by volume in 1991, he
said.
Nestle's sales for the quarter, in Swiss franc terms, had lost 8 per cent
through negative currency and price factors, said Mr Reto Domeniconi,
general manager in charge of finance. Internal growth had been an
'excellent' 5 per cent, with a further 1 per cent coming from new
acquisitions.
Currency fluctuations, principally the depreciation of the dollar, were the
main factors behind the decline in Nestle's sales and profits last year.
Sales shrank by 3.5 per cent to SFr46.37bn, and cash-flow dropped 3 per cent
to SFr3.88bn. Net consolidated earnings, at SFr2.27bn, were down by 5.8 per
cent. Nestle had said earlier the figures hid a 3.5 per cent increase in
sales volume.
According to the annual report released yesterday, net profit per share in
1990 was SFr617 against SFr656 in 1989. The board plans to pay an unchanged
dividend of SFr200 per share, raising its often-criticised payout ratio to
32.4 per cent from 30.5 per cent in 1989.
Had Nestle reported in dollars, like its US competitors, group sales would
have shown a 19.3 per cent increase to Dollars 36.5bn in 1990, Mr Domeniconi
said. Net earnings at Dollars 1.79bn would have been 16.5 per cent higher
than in 1989, while the net profit per share would have grown 16.3 per cent
to Dollars 486.
Exchange rates had a favourable effect on Nestle's financial position last
year. The fall in the Swiss franc value of its borrowings in foreign
currencies helped to produce a reduction of SFr1.2bn to SFr4bn in net debt.
Shareholders' funds amounted to SFr13.4bn at the end of 1990. Liquid assets
totalled SFr5.5bn, up by SFr1.3bn over the year.
Mr Maucher said that although Nestle planned no big acquisitions in the near
future, he would not exclude one should an opportunity arise.
Referring to the legal block on a capital increase imposed by a small group
of shareholders, Mr Maucher said the Federal Tribunal was due to give its
ruling on June 25.
He said Nestle had no urgent need of capital and saw no point at this stage
in diluting shareholders' holdings with a new issue.
In a drive for greater efficiency, McKinsey, the US business consultants,
are advising on streamlining Nestle's head office in Vevey.
Re-organisation is affecting the US and UK businesses in particular.
Carnation, the big US milk foods company bought in 1985, is being merged
with Nestle's other operations into one unit, Nestle USA, with a Dollars 7bn
annual turnover, under a new chief executive, Mr Tim Crull.
Mr Peter Blackburn, former managing director of Rowntree, acquired in 1988,
is returning to the UK after two years in Vevey, where he headed Nestle's
chocolate business. He will head the single organisation, with a Pounds
1.4bn (Dollars 2.4bn) turnover, into which Nestle is merging Rowntree and
its other UK businesses.

FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Harcourt moves deeper into the

<TEXT>
DEBT-laden Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the US publisher and insurer which saw
a Dollars 1.4bn bid for the group falter last month, reported an increase in
its first-quarter net loss, from Dollars 72m last year to Dollars 78.7m.
The company said the figures were due primarily to higher interest expense
and to lower publishing operating income, including the one-time costs of
consolidating Harcourt's college publishing operations.
General Cinema last month abandoned a Dollars 1.1bn tender offer for
Harcourt's publicly-held debt - part of a Dollars 1.4bn offer for the entire
group - after failing to agree terms with the bondholders. It is unclear
whether the bid can be revived.
Harcourt, which said at the time that it would have to consider 'all
available alternatives', declined to comment on the bid yesterday, but said
it would give further information in a filing next week with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
Harcourt said yesterday's results, which were struck on revenues of Dollars
280m, against Dollars 276.9m, and worked through at a loss of Dollars 1.13 a
share (Dollars 1.07 loss) were not indicative of the year, which was highly
seasonal, with most educational sales in the June to September period.
Reader's Digest, publishers of one of the world's best-read magazines,
yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in third-quarter net income, from
Dollars 63.9m, or 54 cents a share, to Dollars 81.2m, or 68 cents. Revenues
were ahead by 15.8 per cent to Dollars 640.6m.
US revenues rose 5.8 per cent, while international revenues advanced by 24.9
per cent, or 18 per cent when exchange rate movements were stripped out.

WOOLWORTH, the large US retailing group whose interests range from Woolco
department stores to Susie's fashion shops and various shoe chains,
yesterday reported a slump in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 13m after
tax.
This compares with Dollars 38m in the same period a year earlier.
Helped by favourable exchange rate comparisons, sales advanced very modestly
to Dollars 2.13bn, against Dollars 2.06bn. Within this overall figure,
speciality stores saw a 6.3 per cent sales improvement, but general
merchandise remained unchanged.
Had 1991 revenues been translated at 1990 foreign exchange rates, the
overall increase would have been reduced to less than 1 per cent.
On the stock market, which was prepared for drab first-half performance in
1991, the shares eased by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 30 1/8 yesterday.
Woolworth attributed the profits fall to recessionary conditions in North
America and to the goods and service tax which took effect in Canada on
January 1.
It said that its Canadian operations had also been hit by the recent court
ruling insisting on Sunday closing in Ontario, home of about 40 per cent of
Woolworth's Canadian stores.
Neither was the company optimistic about an early improvement in the trading
environment: 'Adverse economic conditions continue to negatively impact
consumer spending in the US, Canada and Australia and the consensus view is
that economic recovery will not commence until the latter part of 1991',
said Mr Harold Sells, chairman.
Total operating profits in the first quarter, ahead of corporate expenses,
almost halved from Dollars 91m to Dollars 49m.
Domestic operations saw their contribution slip from Dollars 73m to Dollars
53m, while foreign operations plunged from an Dollars 18m profit to a
Dollars 4m loss.
Woolworth said the 'strong operating profit gains' of its German subsidiary
were offset by the poor performance of the Canadian business.

<TEXT>
VASP, the Brazilian airline, has announced plans to invest Dollars 1.5bn in
expanding its international and domestic routes over the next two years,
despite a deep recession in the sector which has led many of the group's
competitors to slash costs.
The group said it would aim to raise Dollars 1bn from international banks
and Dollars 500m from domestic creditors. The group would not reveal which
banks it was talking to, but according to VASP's spokesman, Mr Wagner de
Goes, several had expressed interest.
VASP hopes to obtain much of the money through aircraft leasing deals. The
investment plan will include the purchase of nine MD11s. Boeing 747s are
also on the shopping list, but Mr de Goes said no firm deal had yet been
made.
VASP is holding talks with Embraer, Brazil's state-owned aircraft
manufacturer, to buy 50 Brasilias. The airline considers the cost of the
Embraer model, at Dollars 7.5m, too high and is hoping to strike a deal.
The new aircraft will be used to service routes the airline plans to open
between Sao Paulo, Miami and New York, and Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Los
Angeles and San Francisco. The group is also planning to expand its domestic
routes in the Amazon, north-east and central regions.
'A significant investment in international routes will increase our hard
currency income,' said Mr de Goes. 'And we need hard currency to finance our
airplane purchases.'

<TEXT>
ITALY'S INSTITUTO Bancario San Paolo Di Torino is due to sign a letter of
intent today with Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) to acquire the Spanish
bank's Barcelona-based subsidiary Banc Catala de Credit, which has 106
branches in north-east Spain.
The acquisition follows the purchase by Credit Lyonnais of Banco Jover, a
subsidiary of Spain's Banco de Santander, also based in Barcelona. The deal
underlines growing foreign interest in the prosperous Catalonia region.
Banc Catala, with assets of Pta152bn (Dollars 1.4bn), is the result of a
merger, organised by Banesto, of two small lossmaking local banks. Nursed
back to financial health two years ago, it increased net profits by 97 per
cent last year, to just over Pta1bn.
The decision to sell Banc Catala confirms a shift of opinion by Banesto's
chairman, Mr Mario Conde, once a staunch opponent of foreign acquisitions of
domestic bank networks.
San Paolo's move into Spain follows last year's purchase of a 35 per cent
stake in the small Banca Abel Matutes family bank in the Balearic Islands.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REBIRTH in the US enabled United Uniform Services to report taxable profits
of Pounds 2.66m for the 12 months to December 31. Sales amounted to Pounds
29.85m.
In its former existence the company was Amercoeur, whose activities mining
anthracite in Wales produced losses of Pounds 269,000 in 1989 on sales of
Pounds 182,000.
It evolved into its new form via the acquisition of Horace Small, one of the
largest suppliers of non-military uniforms in the US. A seven-month
contribution from this subsidiary took profits on from the Pounds 421,000
achieved at the interim stage.
In October, United consolidated its new direction with the Dollars 9.7m
purchase of Hub-Stinette, a privately-owned distributor of uniforms and
career wear.
Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, chairman, said United was confident of substantial
rises in sales and profits this year.
A final dividend of 1.5p is recommended on earnings of 12.9p (37.1p
deficit).
The shares yesterday added 17p to 105p.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bibby seeks Pounds 14.6m via cash call -
Barlow Rand holding will be reduced from 86.4% to 79%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY and Sons, the industrial and agricultural group, yesterday launched
a 1-for-10 rights issue to raise Pounds 14.6m to reduce borrowings and widen
its share base.
The issue of 11.32m new ordinary shares at 132p each will reduce the stake
of Barlow Rand of South Africa, its controlling shareholder, from 86.4 to 79
per cent. Cazenove will place most of Barlow Rand's entitlement of 9.79m
shares with investors. The shares closed down 3p at 160p yesterday.
The group said there was an understanding with the Stock Exchange that
Barlow Rand would reduce its holding.
It was also announced that pre-tax profits for the six months to March 30
were virtually static at Pounds 16.97m (Pounds 16.76m) on reduced turnover
of Pounds 227.59m (Pounds 286.16m).
Borrowings rose from Pounds 32.5m in September to Pounds 62m for the end of
March, representing 43 per cent of shareholders' funds.
The group was forced by the Companies Act provision to bring its off-balance
sheet debt - Pounds 21m associated with its rental company  - back on to the
balance sheet.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said: 'We were unfairly caught by the
change in the law. However, although I am perfectly happy with 43 per cent
gearing, I plan to reduce it so we can take advantage of acquisition
opportunities.'
The group has spent Pounds 27m on acquisitions and Pounds 18m on capital
investment, particularly on agricultural plant and equipment, in the past
three years.
The relative strength of sterling hit the science division's profits, which
fell to Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 6.75m). The group is looking to expand its
science arm via acquisition, and is studying six companies with a view to
buying one of them.
Mr Mansell-Jones said he thought the recession had 'bottomed out' but that
it would not happen fast enough to affect results for the full year.
Operating profits increased in paper and converted products from Pounds
1.54m to Pounds 3.67m, and in materials handling from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds
6.94m.
Earnings rose to 9.82p (9.56p) and the interim dividend is increased to
2.85p (2.75p).

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant unveils Pounds 4.2m
rights issue to reduce debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES &amp; MARCHANT, the once-acquisitive marketing services group, yesterday
unveiled plans for a Pounds 4.2m rights issue aimed at reducing debt amassed
in its purchases.
The cash call, on a 1-for-3 basis at 75p per share, accompanied a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 1.7m in the six months to March
31.
The latest figure was struck after exceptional charges totalling Pounds
105,000 largely reflecting reorganisation costs offset partly by profits on
sale of investments.
For the past year Holmes has been affected by the impact of the recession on
its marketing services consultancies, notably its design and sales promotion
businesses.
Turnover fell to Pounds 25.16m (Pounds 30.7m) and earnings per share to 6.6p
(13.7p) but the interim dividend is held at 3.3p.
Mr Emyr Jones, finance director, said the group was still trading within its
banking facilities but was concerned that the interest bill was absorbing a
high proportion of operating profits.
'It would take us four or five years to trade our way out of this
situation,' he said. 'The easiest way of reducing our debt was by raising
money and the best way to do that was a rights issue.'
The issue is underwritten by Lazard Brothers with Cazenove acting as broker.
Holmes' shares slipped by 1p to 84p on the announcement yesterday.
Holmes has spent Pounds 13.7m on acquisitions in the past two and a half
years and has been left with net debt of Pounds 11.3m as a result. It paid
Pounds 839,000 (Pounds 554,000) in interest from operating profits of Pounds
2.65m (Pounds 4.2m) in the first half. The group also expects to have to pay
Pounds 2.8m in defered payments on acquisitions over the next two years.
Mr Jones said so far this year there had been no sign of any change in
trading conditions, although the market did seem to have stabilised. He said
Holmes did not anticipate any significant recovery until early next year.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Staging a staggered, unstaggable sale -
Roland Rudd reports on the government's plans for its BT offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering two separate offers for its BT shares in an
unprecedented departure from past privatisations.
Under proposals being discussed by ministers, a fixed allocation of BT
shares would be offered to the British public before they were offered to
institutions.
The new shares would be released in batches every 24 or 48 hours over an
extended period. Each batch would be offered to investors at a fixed
discount to the existing BT share price.
Although the discount would not change, the share price would be subject to
market fluctuation.
It is therefore possible that investors buying shares on a Tuesday could get
them at a cheaper price than those buying on a Thursday.
To prevent investors stagging the issue, by hopping in and out of the sale
to make a profit, new BT shareholders would not be able to trade their
shares until the end of the offer.
There would have to be a daily linkage between retail outlets, such as banks
and building societies, and a central computer to alert them as to when a
given batch of shares had been sold.
Taurus, the automated system which will handle the settlement of stock
market transactions, would have been ideal but is unlikely to be operating
by the end of the year.
However, ministers do not believe this is an intractable problem.
The institutions, UK and foreign, would then be offered shares in the
allocation for the 'rest of the world'.
Government advisers are determined to narrow the normal three-week gap
between pricing and trading for the sale to institutions. In theory, they
believe it could be as short as 24 hours.
The innovative proposals are designed to allow retail institutions to
process millions of individual applications.
In the event of the government selling all of its 48.6 per cent stake, worth
some Pounds 11bn, the banks believe there could be as many as 5m applicants.
If even half that number were persuaded to use banks to buy shares it would
cause chaos.
The extended retail sale, described by one banker as similar to a gilts tap
stock - when the government holds back stock to avoid flooding the market -
is being enthusiastically embraced by the banks.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of National Westminster Stockbrokers,
said: 'A rolling discount to enable batches of BT shares to dribble out over
an extended period would eliminate the massive problems faced by retail
institutions selling shares in a short space of time.'
The proposal to price the new BT shares at a discount to the existing price,
known as a 'formula priced approach', could overcome the problems associated
with the 1987 British Petroleum sale when the market crashed - wiping out
the discount offered to potential investors.
Opposition to the proposals centres on fears that two separate offers would
lose the pricing tension between the retail market and the institutions.
There are also fears that potential investors like certainty, and would
therefore prefer to know the exact price of the new shares before the
application date.
The Treasury will not decide the structure of the sale until its deadline
for submissions on how to sell shares to individual investors expires on May
15.
However, the fact that ministers are willing to discuss such radical
proposals for the sale indicates that it is likely to be very different from
past privatisations.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Trusthouse name to be shed in THF revamp -
Founder's son, Rocco Forte, denies that egotism lies behind return to family
name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROCCO Forte, chief executive of Trusthouse Forte, confirmed yesterday
that the company planned to drop the Trusthouse part of its name and - once
ratified by shareholders - would in future simply be known as Forte.
The move is part of a Pounds 15m revamp of THF's 343-strong UK and
continental Europe hotel chain aimed at creating several distinct brand
identities for its hotels, most of which will carry the Forte name as part
of their branding.
The decision to drop the Trusthouse part of the corporate name represents a
final victory for the Forte family after the acrimonious merger in June 1970
of Trust Houses, a chain of traditional inns, and the Forte hotel chain.
For several years after the merger the clash of cultures between the
established Trust House management - headed by Lord Crowther and Mr Michael
Pickard - and the aggressive style of Lord Forte created tension between the
two camps of what had initially been described as a 'friendly' merger.
Eventually Lord Forte was successful, ousting both Lord Crowther and Mr
Pickard and then building up Britain's biggest hotel chain over the next two
decades.
Lord Forte, in his autobiography, said of the boardroom battles: 'I do not
want to blame any one individual for wrecking what began so promisingly: the
truth is that there were deep differences of management philosophy and
style, exacerbated by incompatibilities of temperament.'
Yesterday Mr Rocco Forte, Lord Forte's son, insisted that the decision to
drop the Trusthouse part of the name was taken after considerable research
which showed that Forte had the widest marketing appeal both in the UK and
overseas.
He dismissed suggestions that it was egoistical of the company to carry the
Forte family name on all its hotels. 'It was a decision of the board and in
the company's best interests,' he maintained. 'In some ways I am sorry that
we are 'losing' it as a family, because now it will be the corporate
identity rather than a personal one.'
Mr Forte also denied that the name change contravened the agreement made
with Trust Houses at the time of the merger: this had recently been
suggested by Mr Pickard.
'I don't think Mr Pickard's views are valid nearly 20 years after he left
the company,' Mr Forte averred.
He said that the decision to re-brand the company had been planned for the
past two years. In spite of difficult trading conditions in the first few
months of 1991 - THF's pre-tax profits for the 12 months to January 31 fell
27 per cent to Pounds 190m - he believed it was the right time to press
ahead with the changes.
The Pounds 15m cost of the revamp would be spread over two years, he added.
The fee for Wolff Olins, the design company involved, was put at less than
Pounds 1m of the total cost.
Under the re-branding, THF's hotels would be divided into several
categories. These covered: Forte Travelodges, a roadside budget chain; Forte
Posthouses, bringing together three-star properties, some of which presently
trade under the Post House and Crest names; Forte Crest, a four-star
business hotel operation; Forte Heritage, which includes traditional country
house hotels; and Forte Grand, the five-star international hotels such as
the Waldorf in London.
THF's luxury hotels, such as the Hyde Park Hotel in London and the Georges V
in Paris, would still be known by their existing names and the Forte brand
would only be discreetly mentioned.
About 32 existing hotels which do not fit into these categories are to be
sold. THF hopes to raise Pounds 100m.
The City generally welcomed the changes yesterday and marked the shares 1p
higher at 275p.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle will not pay over ADollars 4.10
per share for Bundaberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TATE &amp; LYLE will not pay more than ADollars 4.10 per share for Bundaberg
Sugar, the Queensland sugar miller and refiner, Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of
the world's largest sweeteners group said yesterday.
The ADollars 321m (Pounds 146.18m) offer will be extended shortly to allow
the Australian Foreign Investment Board time to decide on whether to let the
deal proceed, Mr Shaw said.
Tate and Lyle needs 90 per cent of shareholder acceptance and is facing
stiff opposition from Bundaberg.
If the deal goes through it is likely to have a mildly dilutive effect on
Tate &amp; Lyle's earnings in 1992, given the low level of world sugar prices.
But after a six-month period in which Tate &amp; Lyle has shown its resilience
as others have felt the heat of recession, Bundaberg is one of the few areas
where the group appears vulnerable in the short term, notwithstanding its
longer term benefits.
Staley, the US cereals sweetener, mildly disappointed in the six months to
March 1991 with flat profits in dollar terms.
This softness could persist in the second half, primarily because drink
bottlers have reported a slow start and are likely to keep the price
pressure on sweetener suppliers.
Although Tate &amp; Lyle insists that room remains for profits growth from
further squeezing of costs, there are limits to the benefit this year.
Brokers therefore forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 230m for the full year,
which would give earnings of 33.2p and a prospective multiple of over 11.
Longer term, Tate &amp; Lyle can look forward to high margin profits on
Sucralose, its high-intensity sweetener which it hopes to begin selling in
Canada later this year.
In the US, Monsanto's Nutrasweet is almost certain to have to relinquish
some of its 95 per cent market share if and when the US Food and Drug
Administration approves Sucralose.
In 1992, Tate &amp; Lyle will also benefit substantially from a stronger dollar
and could enjoy pre-tax profits of Pounds 282m. This would give a
prospective multiple of a little over 9, which leaves scope for further
growth in the share price, even though it has risen Pounds 1 in the last
four months.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tepid response to ASB plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S top finance directors are lukewarm about the Accounting Standards
Board's proposals for a radical restructuring of company profit and loss
accounts.
Last month the ASB released draft guidelines which proposed that companies
should give a detailed breakdown of the sources of income and expenditure
and publish a prominent statement showing the movement of reserves.
The rules also envisage a tightening up of the distinction between
extraordinary and exceptional items and would require companies to publish
details of discretionary expenditure such as advertising.
The technical committee of the 100 Group of senior UK finance directors met
earlier this week to consider its response to the proposals and concluded
that the document had significant shortcomings.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, chairman of the committee and finance director of Reed
International, was yesterday at pains to say that finance directors were
broadly behind the ASB in its attempts to reform UK financial reporting.
However, he indicated that the committee was worried about the complexity of
the revised profit and loss account - it would have eight columns of figures
 -and had doubts about the principle of disclosing discretionary
expenditure.
Mr Stapleton said that the committee supported the principle of greater
disclosure which lay behind the proposals which would require companies to
show details of income and expenditure from continuing businesses, companies
acquired during the year and discontinued businesses.
But he hoped that the rules would eventually take account of 'materiality',
in other words the scale of the figures in relation to the size of the group
as a whole.
He said the committee was wholly behind the proposed requirement to publish
a prominent statement of movements on reserves. Moreover, it welcomed the
proposed tightening up of the rules on extraordinary and exceptional items.
The draft rules were issued for a brief consultation period which ended on
Tuesday. In due course the ASB will issue a formal Exposure Draft which will
ultimately become a formal Financial Reporting Standard.
Prof David Tweedie, ASB chairman, said earlier this week that so far the
response to the draft rules had been broadly favourable.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Blenheim shares add 18p after US stake
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Blenheim Group, rose by 18p to 828p yesterday after the
exhibitions and conference organiser and publisher announced that a 12.2 per
cent stake had been acquired for Pounds 28.3m by Ziff Communications, the
private US publisher.
Ziff bought its 3.38m shares at a premium price of 837 1/2 p each from Mr
Lawrie Lewis, deputy chairman and former chief executive of Blenheim. Mr
Lewis is expected to sever his connection with the company which he helped
to found as Blenheim Dresswear in 1979 and bring to the USM as Blenheim
Exhibitions in 1986.
The concern, which moved to the main market last year, has been renamed
Blenheim Group. It hopes the Ziff connection will help it to develop the
publishing business, which has grown from nothing to 9 per cent of turnover
in two years.
In the year to August 31, Blenheim made pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m on
turnover of Pounds 88.8m. At yesterday's closing price, it had a market
value of Pounds 207.7m.

stake
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USHER-WALKER, the printing inks and roller manufacturer, which saw its share
price surge 12 per cent last Friday, is in discussions which could lead to
the beneficial shareholder of a significant stake joining the company.
Mr David Williams, a former deputy chairman of Mosaic Investments, who
recently acquired a large holding through a discretionary trust, could join
the group as corporate development director.
Yesterday the shares closed up 7p at 290p, posting a 20 per cent rise since
the beginning of the week.
Mr Williams is a beneficiary of the trust which owns Ringwood Investments, a
Channel Islands company that acquired 10.19 per cent of Usher-Walker's
shares from Southern Newspapers, its largest shareholder.
The future registered holder of Ringwood's stake is SIL (Nominees).
Shares in Usher-Walker jumped to 241p on Friday, after an announcement that
a group of directors led by Mr Peter Walker, chairman and managing director,
had acquired 3.79 per cent of the capital.
The directors also acquired the shares from Southern Newspapers, which has
seen its stake reduced from 18.8 to 14.99 per cent as a result.
As demand for printing ink has slumped in the harsh advertising climate,
Usher-Walker reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 149,000 in the six
months to end June 1990, down from Pounds 808,000.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tace board prepares to fight as Norwich
Union steps up attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Tace, the embattled environmental control equipment group,
yesterday said it would fight Norwich Union's efforts to install a new board
after last week's institutional shareholder revolt.
Tace said the requisition for an extraordinary general meeting to decide on
Norwich Union's proposal to install Mr Michael Beckett as chairman at the
head of a new board was 'damaging and unjustified'.
It said Tace shareholders should continue to back the team led by chairman
Sir David Nicolson, who was installed against the wishes of the institutions
earlier this year.
In a sharp attack on interference from institutional shareholders, the board
said Norwich Union's pressure last year on the Tace board to find a buyer
for the company had cost the group Pounds 500,000. This referred to the fee
charged by Hambros for time spent seeking a buyer.
After no buyer emerged the institutions continued their pressure and forced
the resignation of Mr Jock Mackenzie, Tace's founder, who had let head
office costs run out of control.
Tace said Norwich Union's actions were unjustified because pre-tax profits
had risen by 24 per cent to end-September last year and because overheads
had already been cut by Pounds 750,000 per year.
Norwich Union rejected Tace's comments. Pre-tax profits were still lower
than 1987 levels, earnings per share had halved over the period and that
apart from the chairman, management was unchanged.
The insurance company also said that institutions had been calling for
overhead cost cuts for a year. The cuts had only been made because of Mr
Beckett's brief stint on the board before he resigned last month after
falling out with Sir David.
Norwich Union and Framlington together control 21 per cent of Tace but claim
to have institutional backing from shareholders controlling 40 per cent.
Tace said it has 'indications of support' from shareholders controlling 29
per cent of the equity but this does not include any major institutions.
The group did not say when it would hold the EGM. It is required to set a
date within 14 days of Norwich Union's requisition notice on May 3. The
meeting can be held up to four weeks after the date is set.

FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: S Africans considering all-out bid for Etam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEANA Investment Corporation, a vehicle for a South African retailing
concern, was yesterday considering whether to mount a bid for the whole of
Etam, the UK women's fashion chain, after its tender offer for 18.5 per cent
of the shares was oversubscribed.
Oceana, a holding company for the European interests of the Lewis family,
which runs the Foschini chain in South Africa, will pay Pounds 22.3m for
12.1m shares, taking its stake in Etam to 25.1 per cent.
The offer was about 11 per cent oversubscribed. Valid tenders were received
for 13.4m shares, 20.5 per cent of the equity.
The striking price was the maximum 185p, which values the group at Pounds
121m. Tender prices ranged from 169p to 185p and those at the top price will
be scaled back.
Oceana has stipulated that 185p is the maximum at which it would bid for the
whole group. Yesterday Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman of Oceana and Foschini,
and his son Michael were in South Africa for the annual meeting of their
700-store women's fashion group. It made pre-tax profits of R148.9m (Pounds
31.2m) on sales of R822m last year.
Mr Michael Lewis, a director, said last week that Oceana wanted to avoid a
hostile bid. It hoped to use the response to the tender offer to arrive at a
modus vivendi with the Etam management.
If it went ahead with a bid for the whole company, it would have to find
about Pounds 90m more. He said Foschini could fund the acquisition from its
own resources, although he did not rule out a call on British institutions.
Etam said the result of the offer represented a vote of confidence in the
board. It stuck by its view that 185p per share undervalued the company, and
it seemed unlikely to prove amenable to any of the suggestions that Oceana
might make following the return of the Lewises from South Africa at the end
of this week.
The shares closed up 1p at 176p.

253m

<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, increased pre-tax profit by
15.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, despite a weaker dollar.
The taxable figure rose from Pounds 219m to Pounds 253m. SmithKline said the
increase would have been 26 per cent at stable exchange rates.
It used Dollars 1.89 to the pound as an average for the first quarter of
this year, compared with Dollars 1.66 last time.
The performance was helped by a Pounds 40m reduction in interest costs to
Pounds 15m. Net debt on March 31 fell from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 712m,
which reflected the impact of the Pounds 4.7bn merger between SmithKline
Beckman and Beecham in mid-1989.
Disposals between the two quarters, including cosmetics and foods
subsidiaries, brought in just over Pounds 700m. Last time, operations since
discontinued accounted for Pounds 26m of trading profit and Pounds 143m
turnover.
The continuing businesses increased trading profit to Pounds 268m (Pounds
247m) on sales of Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 1.15bn). SmithKline said the growth
would have been 18 per cent and 5 per cent respectively at stable exchange
rates. Margins were helped by the merger, including slimming down the
worldwide head-count by 3,000.
In pharmaceuticals, trading profit rose 10 per cent to Pounds 199m (Pounds
181m) on sales that slipped to Pounds 615m (Pounds 643m). The group's
biggest product, the ulcer drug Tagamet, showed 8 per cent sales growth
despite competition in Japan. It is, however, expected to decline slowly,
having reached its zenith.
Sales of the antibiotics Augmentin and Timentin increased by 32 per cent and
14 per cent respectively, and a new anti-depressant, Seroxat, made a
promising start in the UK. Weaker geographic areas were the Gulf and Italy,
where rule changes caused disruption.
Trading profit from consumer brands inched ahead to Pounds 44m (Pounds 43m)
on sales which dipped to Pounds 306m (Pounds 312m). Both the UK and the US
were affected by recession, although Contac, the cold treatment, saw sales
growth of 31 per cent in the US.
Animal health made a profit of Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m) in spite of a 10 per
cent sales fall to Pounds 72m. This reflected the benefits of restructuring,
on the one hand, and the ill effects of competitive pressure in feline
vaccines and parasiticides on the other.
Margins also improved in the clinical laboratories, which increased profit
to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10m). One growth area was testing carried out for US
companies, which are increasingly monitoring employees for drug abuse.
Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 12.1p (10.8p). The first quarter
dividend is 3.75p (3.4p) per A ordinary share and 43.09 cents (37 cents) per
equity unit.
The A share price closed down 22p at 809p.

<TEXT>
LOGITEK, the computer services company yesterday announced that it had
entered into talks which may or may not lead to it recommending an offer
from Microvitec, the USM quoted maker of computer peripherals, which had
launched a hostile takeover bid.
The move comes just one day before the extended deadline for the offer
expires. Microvitec has acquired just over 21 per cent of Logitek's shares,
with the remainder concentrated in the hands of a few institutional
investors.
Logitek had rejected Microvitec's offer as 'misconceived' and claimed that
it 'seriously undervalues' the group.
Microvitec had trimmed its initial Pounds 5.9m 3-for-2 share offer to a
1-for-1 offer valuing the group at Pounds 3.3m, after Logitek shareholders
agreed in March to dispose of Azlan, its computer networking offshoot in an
attempt to reduce the high level of debt.
Logitek has not, however, made any profit forecast ahead of day 39, after
which companies subject to an offer can no longer release financial
information, including, in normal circumstances, trading results.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Aquitaine's acquisition of Occidental's North Sea assets neatly solves a
financial problem for the French state-controlled group.
Elf officials are delighted at being able to pay for part of the purchase
with some of the French company's 25 per cent shareholding in Enterprise
Oil, Britain's largest independent oil company.
This allows the French oil group to transform what had become a purely
financial investment into an asset of real industrial value, say Elf
officials.
The group denies that it was influenced by the UK government's hardened
stance against acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies. Last
July, Mr Peter Lilley, the UK Trade and Industry Secretary, announced that
he would scrutinise all such acquisitions - a policy designed to 'curb
nationalisations by the back door'.
Elf has always argued that its investment in Enterprise was purely financial
and that it had no desire to seize control.
Yet a more stringent UK mergers policy had clearly limited Elf's room for
manoeuvre. Only last week, Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission gave
Elf clearance to take over the UK refinery and petrol station business of
Amoco, the big US oil group.
It was the latest of four decisions which ran contrary to the UK
government's attempt to curb such takeovers and, as such, a setback for the
Department of Trade and Industry. Elf officials welcomed the victory, but
stressed that they were keen to avoid a repetition of the months they had to
spend on defending their case at the commission.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Tate &amp; Lyle rises 8% in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TATE &amp; LYLE, the world's largest sweeteners group, yesterday surprised the
market with an 8 per cent increase in profits in the six months to March,
demonstrating the resilience of food-related stocks in recessionary times.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 87.5m to Pounds 94.7m on turnover down by
Pounds 196m to Pounds 1.49bn. The decline in turnover was the result of
translating dollar earnings into sterling and of making some disposals last
April.
Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 13.1p and the board recommended a
12.1 per cent rise in the interim dividend to 3.7p.
The market seemed to agree with Mr Neil Shaw, the chairman, who said results
were satisfactory both in the US and Europe. Shares closed up 9p at 374p.
Mr Shaw also said Tate &amp; Lyle would extend its offer for Bundaberg Sugar,
the publicly-quoted Queensland sugar cane miller. But he said the latest
offer of ADollars 4.10 per share, valuing the group at ADollars 321m (Pounds
146.18m), would not be increased.
During the year, Tate &amp; Lyle reduced interest charges from Pounds 36m to
less than Pounds 20m due to disposals. At the half-way stage, gearing had
risen to 81 per cent from 69 per cent last September. However, this year's
interim figure was sharply down on the previous year when gearing was 107
per cent.
The group's operating profits fell from Pounds 120.4m to Pounds 112.8. But
before currency translations and the lost income from disposed businesses,
operating profits were slightly ahead.
North American sugar, UK and European sugar and European cereal sweeteners
and starch operating profits all increased by more than 20 per cent.
Profits from sugar trading fell due to the lack of activity.

FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Trusthouse Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beware all enterprises that require new clothes, wrote Thoreau. Mr Rocco
Forte is clearly not a fan of the Sage of Walden Pond; reclothing Trusthouse
Forte will cost Pounds 15m.
Still, the name change is the least important part of the operation. More
significant - and arguably overdue - is the tidying-up of the company's
hotels into neat segments, with disposal planned for those that do not fit.
The temptation in such an exercise is of matching your newly-defined market
segments to your existing products, rather than the other way around. One
would be more confident that Mr Forte had avoided that temptation if his new
brands were to be independently managed businesses, not just smart new
clothes for the same old hotels division.

FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest job cuts at Rolls-Royce come as little surprise after the Pounds
50m provided against last year's profits. The stated reasons for the
cutbacks, though, beg the question whether this sort of trimming should not
have been carried out before. The repercussions of the Gulf crisis, airline
finances and Defence Ministry cutbacks are all convenient enough
justifications. But the running down of the helicopter factory at Leavesden
is the sort of move British Aerospace might have made without waiting for
the political climate to be right. Rolls-Royce shares have recently been
stalled by the uncertainty over big orders for the Trent engine. New
evidence that the cost base is being tackled will reassure those convinced
of the stock's long-term attractions.

<TEXT>
Sir Nigel Broackes ought to be kicking himself for not cutting last year's
final dividend. His message is too upbeat to do it now, and the shares
obviously need the support of one of the highest yields in the Footsie (9.1
per cent). But the consequences of overpaying shareholders showed up clearly
in yesterday's interim statement in the form of a 33 per cent tax charge and
a large new slug of unrelieved ACT. It is small comfort that a couple of
years' UK losses would provide the necessary shelter to bring the charge
back to its accustomed level of 20-25 per cent.
At least the 56 per cent drop in half-year profits looks like being the low
point in the present cycle. But the question is just how fast the recovery
will be. The company, for example, will do well to maintain its construction
and engineering margins in the second half, though this side of the group
certainly proved its quality in the first.
The signs of revival detected in UK housing, moreover, are not necessarily
shared by others. The key will be almost certainly be commercial property -
a big earner in the past - where the decision to reclassify about Pounds
200m of investment properties as fixed assets can be read in two ways.
Either it genuinely reflects the view that yields are going to be stuck at
present levels for some time, or it is a neat device to avoid taking
September's inevitable write-down through the profit and loss account.

FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: UK profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the spring reporting season just starting, the market's fit of caution
is timely. Current theories about profit recovery now face their first test
 -not how strong the recovery will be, but how deep a hole it will be
filling.
The CBI profit expectations survey is routinely over-optimistic, but its
timing is pretty reliable, forecasting upturns about a year before the
event. The last CBI survey projected a decisive turning point, which can
therefore be expected in the first or second quarter of 1992. How big?
Goldman Sachs can hardly be called pessimistic - it looks for a 15-20 per
cent bounce back next year, with output up and employment down; but it
stresses that the coming quarter may be worse than expected, just as the
first quarter was.
The better the inflation news, the worse the message about margins. Treasury
officials, who designed current policy to squeeze inflation via margins,
think that any hope of profit recovery this year is moonshine, and even a
standstill stretching it. Since this would come after a 10 per cent drop in
1990, Goldman's three-year forecast for an average nominal rise of 3 per
cent real looks far from gloomy.
But at that, it would take a further strong recovery in 1993 to get real
profits back to their 1989 starting point. The market may find this prospect
a little unexciting, unless it is banking on dollar miracles.

FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: The song of the border reivers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,523.4 (-17.1)
The long-term investment case for Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power rests on
them being seen as border reivers, lurking in their northern fastnesses,
ready to invade the English electricity market and grab what they can.
Of the two, Hydro-Electric fits the tale more neatly. An aggressive new
management; a smaller business, tilted towards generation; little reliance
on the vulnerable industrial market; and two mooted power projects in
England - all this adds up to an appealing story.
Scottish Power, a likely Footsie stock, has been slower off the mark. But
both have an edge on their English rivals. As integrated utilities, they
have much more scope for shifting costs and profits around the company, to
keep them away from the regulators.
In yesterday's pathfinder prospectus, the government has given each a bit
more debt than expected. Dividend cover, at 2.1, seems a bit low compared
with the expected 2.5 or so, even if you allow for tax to drop back to more
normal levels.
If English raids help profits to grow, these are small drawbacks. To that
hope, two caveats. A bigger interconnection with the south, as planned, will
allow raids both ways - and the English generators get access to cheaper
coal two years ahead of the Scots. Meanwhile, rushing to build in England
may offset part of the Scots' attraction; the absence of a pressing need to
invest in new plant.
At the flotation, such calculations will mean little. Only one thing will
count: how much the need to keep Scotland's electricity Scottish prevents a
full allocation for overseas demand.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: Lloyd's establishment and 'the rest'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A DOLL-STEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The reference to the 'family of Lloyd's' by Mr Alan Lord, the Lloyd's
chief executive ('Lloyd's launches reforms in bid to reassure Names', May 3)
must have caused quite a few sardonic smiles. The trouble is that too few
members of Lloyd's are part of that family.
Some 10 years ago while I was acting as an arbitrator in a complaint by the
Committee of Lloyd's against an underwriter, someone in the position to know
made the remark that the attitude of the establishment of Lloyd's towards
the rest resembled that of the bullies in some old-fashioned public school
towards the juniors. Nothing that I have since observed causes me to think
this was too uncharitable a view.
It seems unlikely that the announced reforms, which would leave the review
of the 'commercial circumstances' of the worst losses to the governing body
of Lloyd's while doing nothing at all about investigating the slightly less
bad losses, will achieve Mr Lord's aim of persuading the Names to give up
the courts to pursue their complaints.

Sir, Most of us have seen able, experienced staff made redundant.
The individual suffers, and the business loses valuable skills which are
usually costly to replace when things get better.
Is not the inflexibility of payroll costs a main cause of this inefficiency?
I have taken a straw poll which suggests that many employees would exchange
flexibility in pay for greater job security.
My suggestion of 75 per cent of salary as a guaranteed minimum, with 100 per
cent paid in a normal year, and 125 per cent in a good year seemed to be an
acceptable range. Is now the time for employers to offer such contracts?

FT  09 MAY 91 / Book Review: Sleight of hand over scientific method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT
By OB Hardison Jr
Penguin, Pounds 9.99, 389 pages
Modern man's yearning to understand the significance of science is attested
by a pile of recent popular works, but even the best requires study. How
convenient if it could be done in a single big bang, unifying all
discoveries from chromosomes to cosmology into the framework of what the
average arts graduate learned at school.
Enter O B Hardison Jr, the Mephistopheles of the computer age. He reveals
Everything in 400 pages, then causes it to vanish, leaving hardly a trace
behind, except a pleasant feeling of superiority and some rave notices in
the US and last year's Los Angeles Times Book Prize.
Hardison, an expert on culture and a professor at Georgetown University,
Washington, until his death last summer, certainly offers the broad view and
a long bibliography. His thesis is that modern technology overwhelmed
traditional cultures in a kind of game of progressive abstraction that
caused them to 'disappear'. So each of his five sections is subtitled 'the
Disappearance of . . .Nature, History, Language, Art and Man', respectively.
This may be a complicated joke because the 'Man' section is about artificial
intelligence, for example. Some of it is nonsense, Yet even at his most
preposterous, Hardison sounds as if he might possibly be on to something.
Take, for example, the conclusion of his first section: 'If science is a
human creation, we have caught the mind in the very act of swallowing up the
world, which is another way of saying that we have witnessed nature in the
process of disappearing.' Is this profundity, semantic froth, or just a cry
of pain?
Hardison compares the beauty of Charles Darwin's prose in The Origin of the
Species with the mathematics which D'Arcy Thompson, the Cambridge zoologist,
used to describe the living world in 1917. Then he proceeds to the computer
mathematics of Benoit Mandelbrot, who used computers in the 1960s to develop
fractal geometry, a formalism for describing natural shapes such as
coastlines.
son thinks Darwin was imprisoned in the confusions of a 'mythic' view of
nature, to which he is said to have attributed 'human motives'; his ideas
were thus flawed by the 'logical nonsense' of his supposed belief that the
survival of the fittest was 'tragic' (because of the extinction of the
rest). Then came Thompson ('everything in biology that Darwin was not') and,
later, Mandelbrot, to liberate mankind into the world of numerical
abstraction.
The fact that Hardison misunderstood and misrepresented Darwin, that his
hero, D'Arcy Thompson, though respected by academics, no longer rates a
mention in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and that Mandelbrot knew possibly
even less biology than Hardison, need not detain us. A man who can say that
the Ford Fiesta car 'appears to have sunk without trace' demands indulgence.
Perhaps he read The Origin in a hurry.
It is harder to forgive him for speculating whether Johannes Kepler, the
16th-century astronomer, would have abandoned his preconceived theory of the
solar system if observations had conflicted with it. Kepler stands - with
Darwin - among the giants of the scientific tradition precisely because he
did abandon the theory which everyone then believed in. He discovered with
much intellectual pain and prodigious analysis of Tycho Brahe's stellar
observations that the planets do not move in ordered circles, inscribed on
geometrical solids, as the ancients believed. Kepler deduced that they trace
less godlike elliptical orbits, a fact which helped Isaac Newton to
formulate the laws of motion and gravity.
Yet Hardison is too intelligent to be hissed quite off the stage. The
advance of scientific rationalism has left perplexing furrows in
20th-century culture. As he says: 'To many people, the world of quarks and
black holes is an affront. Humanity seems to have leaked out of it.' He is
at his best describing this loss of vital fluid, for example in modern and
post-modern architecture. This section is full of fun and insights. So who
cares if it is sound? His celebration of the poetry of nonsense and the
reduction of language to incantation or pattern is also instructive -
provided one ignores the dismissal of Eliot, Pound and Yeats as 'modernist'
(ie: tied to the past).
Then his survey of computer brainpower is racy and comprehensive, even
though he sows confusion about Alan Turing's test for whether a machine is
truly 'intelligent'. He suggests wrongly that Joseph Weizenbaum's famous
psychoanalytic programme, ELIZA, passed this intelligence test 'for some
users' back in 1963. But, as Weizenbaum explained in his powerful book,
Computer Power and Human Reason, ELIZA was as much a fraud as Coppelia
Hardison means the programme sort of seemed a bit intelligent. But where
does that leave his apocalyptic vision of a world dominated by machines, in
which 'silicon life will be immortal . . .for silicon beings, 100,000 light
years will be as a day's journey . . '?
The danger of this readable and provocative book is that it will be taken as
a bona fide exposition of scientific thought, even as a bridge between the
two cultures. But although Hardison is awed by science, he shows little
understanding of its method, preferring metaphors, dextrous conceits and,
sometimes, innuendo or sleight of hand. So, he perversely analyses passages
from Darwin as if he were a flawed nature poet, rather than a theorist who
changed the history of ideas. He fails to see how theories which seemed at
first repugnant to common sense stripped away the illusions of mankind. Nor
does he understand the central source of science's power and authority:
successful prediction. Caveat Emptor]

FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: Plan to reverse industrial decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEN GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Government speculation on recovery from the present recession is moving
from the sublime to the ridiculous ('CBI cautious about timing of economic
recovery', May 1). Gypsy Rose Lee would have a better record.
Hundreds of our members in manufacturing and financial services are losing
their jobs every week. They know the recession is deepening.
But the chancellor is telling them that the economy has reached a 'turning
point'.
While there may or may not be a recovery next year, Britain's performance in
relation to its main competitors will have deteriorated because of the loss
of valuable skills.
The present recession is reducing productive capacity, just when the need
for a strong competitive industry is most vital. Britain will face the 1992
internal market having cut investment by 10 per cent in 1991.
Mr Peter Lilley, secretary for trade and industry, believes more foreign
investment is the solution. This is hardly the way for an independent
democracy to order its affairs. Or do the Tories prefer the British economy
to be run from Tokyo, Berlin and Detroit?
Millions of working people want and deserve a secure future. A plan for
industry, encouraging investment, training and product development is the
only way to reverse the decline.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: The problem of presentation that dogs the Tory party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH KERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent episode regarding cost savings at certain hospitals which
have opted to be independently managed, and specifically Guy's hospital, has
confirmed to me a long-held belief that the Tory party is incapable of
presenting itself in such a way that it wins hearts and minds and thereby
persuades the voters that it has the right policies.
It is not good enough to have the right policies; it is necessary that
voters' perception is that this is in fact the case. When the news of the
proposed cost savings at Guy's hospital broke, the government gave the
impression of being totally surprised that this had happened and did not
effectively put forward its position. Instead, in a rather weak way, Mr
William Waldegrave, secretary for health, indicated that he had no prior
knowledge and that really it was not any of his business to interfere.
While Mr Waldegrave's stated position may be totally accurate; it is however
totally inadequate. The Tory party must be ready for such events happening.
It must be prepared to state clearly why it considers its policies to be
correct and also why a superficial interpretation of events is not correct.
What has happened at Guy's could be justified on grounds of the efficient
use of resources. Clearly, it does not mean that fewer resources will be
applied to the National Health Service but that those resources which are
applied will be used more effectively, thereby improving patient care. The
basic change in management philosophy will inevitably cause changes and
upsets and the government must be prepared to ride these and other upsets by
forcibly putting forward the merits of its policies. Effective spokesmen
must get in front of the media and make themselves heard and their policies
understood.
The Labour party, having put forward the superficial interpretation of
events without being effectively countered, was able to make political
capital out of these events. As this occurred shortly before the local
government elections, the government's failings in being able to present the
merits of its policies in a timely and effective manner have no doubt cost
it dearly.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Labour takes the next step
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST night's speech by the shadow chancellor John Smith to the Royal
Institute of Public Administration marks the first formal endorsement of the
government's reforms of the Civil Service by a senior member of the shadow
cabinet. It thus offers assurance that the creation of agencies to deliver
government services will survive beyond a change of government, a welcome
measure of bipartisan support for reforms designed to increase the quality
of those services while strengthening financial and managerial controls.
In the adversarial atmosphere of British politics, such cross-party support
for institutional reform has become rare enough to merit comment in its own
right. It would be advantageous were similar consensus to be achieved in
other important spheres of public life, such as pensions, education and
health care (or, for that matter, local government finance). Without such
agreement, reforms must be implemented against the opposition of entrenched
interests which look to a change of government to reinstate the status quo.
All too often, whatever success is achieved will be unravelled in future
years.
For the Civil Service reforms, at any rate, the threat of such a reversal
may now be lifted. Mr Smith not only welcomed the reforms set out by Sir
Robin Ibbs in the Next Steps report of 1988; he positively endorsed their
aims as central to Labour's objectives for the public sector. Such
criticisms as he made were not of principles, but of implementation - for
example, the government's alleged failure to carry civil servants and their
unions with it.
Service delivery
The Next Steps report sought to separate the delivery of government services
from policy-making by creating separate agencies to provide specific
services. Agency managers focus on service delivery, whether it be the
testing of heavy goods vehicles, the provision of company information or the
payment of benefits. Service targets are set for a three-year period, agreed
between the agency and its sponsoring department in a framework document
which also specifies the powers devolved on questions such as personnel
management. Agency chief executives are accountable to their sponsoring
department and to parliament for operational matters, a process which seems
to have worked well so far.
Mission statements
The launch of the first agencies was buttressed by much private-sector
paraphernalia - corporate identities, glossy annual reports and impressive
mission statements. More substantially, almost all the first tranche of
agencies launched customer service surveys, leading to improved service
quality and new - usually profitable - services. These early initiatives
indicate that the Next Steps approach has reinvigorated managers and staff
and begun to create more responsive and consumer-friendly organisations.
Agency staff remain civil servants, covered by national pay agreements,
terms and conditions. There is some freedom to introduce employment changes
where these would be more suited to the nature of the work; only one agency
 -HMSO - has used this freedom to create its own pay structure, though
several have introduced staff bonus schemes to encourage greater efficiency.
As the first agencies renegotiate their framework documents this summer,
managers will seek and should be granted greater powers to manage, further
untying themselves from the dead hand of central control.
In short, some progress has been achieved in creating free-standing,
user-oriented organisations, but much of the potential is still to be
realised - which is why Mr Smith's endorsement of Next Steps is significant.
Managers implementing the agency programme can now adopt a longer-term
perspective, secure in the knowledge that it will not be blown off course by
a change of government. While there is much further to go in the evolution
of Next Steps, the principle that government services are best delivered by
dedicated agencies at arm's length from the policy-making process is here to
stay. Its recognition is long overdue.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: The Women of Troy - Belgrade Studio, Coventry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euripides' The Women of Troy was first acted in 415 BC, immediately after
the Greeks had sacked Melos, and while they prepared for the Sicilian
campaign. Its anti-war ethic bears the imprint of its origins; but it is as
relevant now as it was during the Peleponnesian War. For this is a play
about the aftermath of war: its survivors,
refugees, and criminals. The central debate of the play is simple: is it
better to
survive to face fresh horrors, or better to have died in the war?
The Greek levelling of Troy provides the background to the action which,
like the current scenes from Zakho or Amadiyah, is unbearable misery.
Aristotle believed
that tragedy was a work-out for the emotions, exercising the extremes we
would not normally find in ourselves; The Women of Troy certainly depends on
the pity of others' plight, and fear at their
grief.
The Greeks saw tragedies in groups of three, and appended a satyr-play to
lighten the proceedings. But here, the action is all the more concentrated
for being singular. The central figure is Hecuba, mother of Hector and wife
of Priam. She hears that her sons are dead; her daughter, Cassandra,
enslaved; her son's wife, Andromache, abducted; and her grandson, Astyanax,
thrown off the ramparts. She then has the chance to indict Helen, the cause
of all the suffering, while a
vacillating Menelaus (Helen's first husband) looks on. The play ends as Troy
burns and Hecubais taken off to Odysseus' ship.
Euripides adds his own sharp ironies: each crop of horrors is prefaced by a
sentiment of relative content: 'There is no agony we don't already feel, no
abyss of pain we can discover.' He charts the reaction of victims who have
to give more for less and less. When Edward Bond wrote his version, The
Woman (1978), he followed the Euripidean logic that each new loss should be
worse than the last. The Women of Troy pitches headlong into misery.
The physical brutalities happen off-stage, but are all meticulously
delivered by messengers and chorus. This keeps the mind full of horrors, and
lets the eye focus on the issues embodied in the actors on stage. Greek
tragedies have no knowledge of 20th-century psychology: here, characters
emerge from the plot.
A tendency to over-naturalism nags at an otherwise exemplary production at
the Belgrade Studio. The cast of six is uniformly excellent; Margaret
Robertson (Hecuba), Alison Skilbeck (Andromache) and David Hobbs (Poseidon,
Menelaus) in particular find extraordinary range and power. And if Richard
Osborne's direction is somewhat anxious, the
play's issues are never obscured.
But this is a fine account of the play which remains current. Hecuba asks
the question: 'How can I suffer this and learn to bear it?' in face of new
disasters she has not yet met. Meanwhile, on the Turkish border at Cukurca
just north of Amadiyah, the arriving Kurdish refugees  - survivors of cold
and hunger - face an outbreak of cholera.

With yet another initiative to solve the Irish Problem currently under way,
this revival of Sean O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars is a timely reminder
of how old and intractable the Troubles are. And how peripheral to the real
lives of the people.
This is no idealistic view of the 1916 Easter Rebellion. The heroes are not
the patriots of the Irish Citizen Army, urged by stirring nationalistic
rhetoric to 'Welcome war like the Angel of God', but the working class poor
of the Dublin tenement who use the mayhem to loot the shops, but who rally
automatically when the conflict enters their home.
O'Casey is magnificent at toying with the emotions of the audience. The
doomed sacrifice of Jack Clitheroe (Breffni McKenna), who puts loyalty to
the Cause before his young wife because he is 'afraid to be called afraid',
hardly touches us.
It is the Empire loving Bessie Burgess (Judi Dench), who intersperses
choruses of 'Rule Britannia' with abuse of the Fenians, who displays the
truer loyalty because her commitment to the tenement is unthinking and
spontaneous. The young communist Covey lives through slogans while the
drunken carpenter Fluther acts courageously without the burden of ideals.
What gives this good old fashioned four-act tragedy enduring life is
O'Casey's ability to throw in everything and lose little. This is how life
felt in Dublin during that fateful weekend. In Sam Mendes' production the
Rebellion is ominously close in the ratatat of machine guns and the boom of
cannons but it never replaces the petty bickerings of the tenants, the
marital strains, the endemic sickness, the mundane poverty of the Dubliners,
seeking small consolations in the liquor and the local tart.
In a wrenching moment Nora Clitheroe (Niamh Cusack) temporarily wins back
Jack's attention and seduces him into singing her a love song. And the
second act, when the gentle shadow boxing of the locals in the pub is
interrupted by the fiery speeches heard at the political rally outside,
beautifully puts people before patriotism.
Cramming a cast of 15 and four sets on to a tiny acting area creates
problems (and makes for some intriguingly public set changes), and the
strongly Irish cast is slow to warm to its task. But once the rhythm is
caught, discreetly orchestrated by Judi Dench as the provoking widow, and
John Rogan, all angles and itches as the nostalgic Fenian, the younger
actors warm to their work. Niamh Cusack seizes her big speech on cowardice
while the abashed men stand like sentries on the four corners of the stage
awaiting the arrival of the inevitable catafalque.
Life goes on, says O'Casey. Men while away the time playing cards alongside
the coffin of the young consumptive; the English squaddies drink up the hot
tea abandoned in the deserted flat. There is laughter here as well as
constant tragedy. Mendes' production remains too earth bound and tentative
to do full justice to the eternal truths but it is a brave stab at a great
play.

It looks like an excellent evening for going over your catalogue of modern
first editions (have you seen what they're offering for 'Lucky Jim' with a
dust cover?) or cleaning the tops of the architraves. While doing that you
could listen to Analysis on Radio 4 (8.00) which tonight tries to establish
whether the condition of the South American poor will improve now that the
continent begins to be more prosperous.
If you feel a compulsion to watch television there is Floyd On Oz (8.00
BBC2) in which the intrepid gastronaut takes a train to the Australian
interior and on the way feeds four fashion models, a young camel named
Camilla, and the train driver.
This Week (8.30 ITV) shows how arms manufacturers are endeavouring to cash
in on the 'smart' weapons which supposedly won the Gulf War. The programme
tells how the Patriot missile system failed to intercept the last Scud fired
in the war because one unit was undergoing maintenance and another failed to
register a threat, so that 28 Americans were killed.

Even in Salzburg the advance of period performance practice is proving
inexorable. It has been the custom in the city since the 1930s to give an
annual performance of Mozart's C Minor Mass in St Peter's and the local
press was apparently struck by the clarity and expressiveness that John
Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir brought to the same music in
comparison when they turned up with it earlier this year.
In London it is almost de rigeur to perform this work on period instruments
now. Gardiner himself gave a single performance of it at the start of the
year, prior to setting out for Salzburg, and he was followed on Tuesday by
Roy Goodman and the Hanover Band. It would be interesting to know what
Salzburg thinks of them, as their music-making has even less inclination to
make Mozart sound like he traditionally used to.
The awkwardnesses of using period instruments were easy to hear. Wind
intonation was often sour; the orchestral balance was as it comes. Goodman
does not often intervene to right inequalities or impose his own ideas. In
some ways a less obviously 'interpreted' approach to 18th-century music like
this is welcome; but when Gardiner conducted the Mass, it was clear that we
were in the presence of a blinding masterpiece, and here it was not.
The vocal parts, solo and choral, were very respectably taken. In the
'Domine Deus' there were two well-contrasted sopranos, Lynne Dawson shining
bright, Anne Dawson more mature and rounded of voice. The 'Et incarnatus',
taken by the former, went with no lingering or sentimentality (and no
trills). The Hanover Band Chorus showed itself no less to be a useful small
choir. But the performance was rarely moving in the way that Gardiner's had
been.
In the first half Goodman and the orchestra warmed up on Haydn's Symphony No
102, a taster of the complete cycle of Haydn symphonies that they are
recording for Hyperion. Again there were doubtful moments of balance, when
the strings were lost from view, but the performance had vitality and fun.
The minuet was taken at Czerny's recommended metronome marking, which shows
that Beethoven is not the only one to have handed down to us speeds long
deemed to be impossibly fast.

Birmingham Royal Ballet is making a return to its erstwhile nursery in
Rosebery Avenue for the next two weeks. We shall be seeing new works from
young choreographers - as we so happily have for the past 45 years with this
company - and Tuesday night's showing of Hobson's Choice reasserted yet
again the vital creative identity of the troupe. I am not a devotee of the
piece, finding its unrelenting joviality altogether too much, but it is a
product of the company's traditions, an undoubted success with the public,
and it is performed with quite exceptional spirit and finesse.
David Bintley's realisation of Harold Brighouse's play is affectionate,
rather sentimental, and serves as excuse for every sort of theatrical trick.
What sustains it in the theatre are the ebullient interpretations it has
inspired from its cast, and the dancers' vivid response to every opportunity
for fun. The humour is, shall we say, broad; it is the especial grace of the
Birmingham artists that they never over-step the mark between wit and
slapstick. Timing is impeccable, comedy has been brightly polished, so that
Stephen Wicks as a gormless suitor armed with flowers can extract every last
joke without coarseness, while the drunken Hobson's progress up a flight of
stairs (a series of rushes and teeterings that demand impeccable planning)
is done with blithe skill by Desmond Kelly.
Casting on Tuesday night was the original, with the central trio of Karen
Donovan as Maggie, Desmond Kelly as her father, Michael O'Hare as Will
Mossop. Their roles are plainly very real to them, as they splendidly are to
us, and - whatever reservations one may have about the piece - it is
heart-lifting to see an ensemble as secure in understanding, alert in
response, in communication of feeling and step. This is true of every member
of the cast; the company playing has a warmth and a generosity that have
been a characteristic of the troupe since it was a group of Miss de Valois'
new young dancers who trod this same stage in 1946.

MISERY (18) Odeon Leicester Sq
NIGHT SUN (12) Renoir and Chelsea
AY] CARMELA (12) Lumiere
ZANDALEE (18) Cannons West End
PERFECTLY NORMAL (PG) Prince Charles
Imagine that you have finished typing your latest novel. Your New York
publisher Lauren Bacall is dying to see it. You hop into your car to leave
your snow-swirled country hotel. But on an icy corner you skid off the road,
somersault down a mountain-slope and disappear from the world under six feet
of snow.
That is the good news. The bad news is that you are then rescued and cared
for by the maddest owner-occupier in the whole Midwest. As played in Misery
by Oscar-winning Kathy Bates, she resembles a giant tea-cosy who has escaped
from a mental asylum. While tucking you into bed and attaching a dripfeed,
she ringingly insists that she is your 'number one fan'. She loves your
romantic novels about the heroine Misery Chastain, and gee golly, Paul, is
this your latest book? Can she read it?
Can you stop her. I am afraid she is not going to like your new book, Paul.
And when she dislikes something she tends to reach for an object either
blunt or sharp. A sledgehammer, say, or a kitchen knife . . . Luckily, even
though Paul is broken-legged and cannot escape, he is played in this Stephen
King-based thriller by actor James Caan, tough even when terrified. And his
story is directed by Rob (When Harry Met Sally) Reiner with a wit and
malicious relish that makes his sufferings piquant to others if not to
himself.
I am dashed if I can remember a film virtually confined to one room that
gave its audience this kind of rollercoaster ride. Spryly scripted by
William (Magic) Goldman, Misery will have you digging your nails into your
well-upholstered neighbour under the delusion that she is your chair-arm. At
least, if you are lucky, she is not Miss Bates. This actress, though
unrelated to Norman, has the same blend of childlike charm and homicidal
passion. A roly-poly face slashed by a saucer grin surmounts a body like a
barrage balloon. She can coo, sigh, laugh, scold. She can also - ready with
those earplugs - scream with anger.
If Miss Bates is the hostess with the leastest, Mr Caan is the guest with
the dwindling choice of escape scenarios. He could crawl broken-legged to
the front door, but his bedroom door is locked. Or he could poison Miss B
with his hoarded tranquillisers, but she tends to spill her drinks. Never
mind. There is always Sheriff Roberts Farnsworth in the local town, though
he seems to be about 99 years old and may take a while to put two and two
together.
As with all great thrillers, Misery combines terror with a jet-black humour.
Some ancestral memory of Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust, where the
jungle-marooned madman Mr Todd held the hero prisoner with enforced Dickens
readings, may have inspired King's tale of literary detention. But Misery
adds a modern dimension: the sophisticated celebrity pinioned by his
schmaltz-reared fan. It is not just the kitchen knife but the kitsch that
hurts: the china animals and Liberace records. It is not just the murder
threats but the murderous gush. 'I'm your number one fan, Paul]' But as the
late Julius Caesar discovered, it is your friends who get you in the end.
Night Sun, by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, is a radiantly mysterious epic.
Based on Tolstoy's Father Sergei, it assembles a typical Italian movie cast
 -that is, scarcely anyone is Italian - in a story of sacred and profane
love. Setting: 18th century Italy, from the court of Naples to rural Sicily.
Stars: Julian Sands, Nastassja Kinski, Charlotte Gainsbourg. Sands, whose
flayed-borzoi features are the definition of asceticism, is the royal
aide-de-camp who spurns a career-advancing marriage to the King of Naples'
former mistress (Kinski). To a monastery he goes. And thence, seeking
further purity of self-denial, to a hermit's cottage in Sicily. 'I know why
he's doing it,' proclaims his mother; 'to rise above those who humiliated
him.'
Yes indeed. Also to find his own dark night of the soul in which to create a
sun of self-illumination. Alas, he has scarcely worked up his initial
miracle-working powers before earthly matters intrude. First, his retreat
threatens to turn into a tourist attraction for la tutta Sicilia. Secondly,
two successive female visitors (Patricia Millardet, Mlle Gainsbourg) play
siren to his aspiring saint.
But if Sands finds his miracle-working gift jeopardised, the Taviani
brothers do not. Though Night Sun comes in the second league of their work,
after Padre Padrone and with more compromised curios like Good Morning
Babylon, it proves they are among the few living film-makers whose images
can catch the breath. A tree spilling a white petal on a boy's hand; a
silver curtain of rain slicing across the night sky and into the earth like
a violent benediction. Night Sun is about the merciless beauty of divine
grace, and the difficulty of tending it even in the world's darkest corners.
The film has a surreal passion unique to the Tavianis and a poetic
seriousness undreamt in most parts of the movie globe today.
Carlos Saura's Ay] Carmela from Spain is a hackneyed old heart-clutcher
about the Human Spirit versus the Fascist Imperative. Captured by Franco's
army, what can song-and-dance veterans Paulino (Andres Pajares) and Carmela
(Carmen Maura) do to avoid betraying their Republican loyalties?They have
been asked to perform in front of the Generalissimo himself. But Carmela -
she is so excitable - might blow the number in which she is supposed to
insult the Republican flag by doing a semi-striptease in it.
The film plays like To Be Or Not To Be rugby-tackled by The Colditz Story.
Laden with Spanish 'Oscars', it is goodhearted, patriotic and creakingly
undistinguished. Why Britain needs to see it is a mystery, unless the
luscious Miss Maura (of Women On the Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown) is now
considered an offer no filmgoer can refuse, whatever film she appears in.
Finally, two for Curio Corner. Zandalee is a tale of naked passion in New
Orleans. Hurling off their clothes and West Coast accents, Nicolas Cage and
Judge Reinhold vie for the love of Mr Reinhold's nubile wife Erika Anderson.
She, the titular Zandalee, is torn between her novelist spouse, whose
writer's block appears to have spread to the rest of his body, and his
passionate painter friend, whose love-making noises would surely attract the
Bourbon Street branch of the Noise Abatement Society.
From bedroom to bayou we follow them, our minds boggling that this ill-kempt
farrago was directed by the talented New Zealander Sam Pillsburg (The
Scarecrow). The Press show audience was in uproarious mood, not least when
Mr Cage's artist, a specialist in nudes, expatiated on the problems of
sexual harassment at work. 'When that big red snatch is comin' at yer like a
freight train, it's pretty hard to paint, I'll tell yer]'
Yves Simoneau's Perfectly Normal from Canada is mad but manageable. Powered
by a svelte dream-logic, burly con-person Lonnie (Robbie Coltrane) and
pintsize brewery worker Renzo (Michael Riley) strike up one of those
friendships that only happen in films. Will the shy Renzo accede to the
shyster Lonnie's proposal to start a restaurant with an operatic motif? Will
they end up together in full drag singing the duet from Norma while the
first-night customers twirl their linguine?
Of course they will. But first the plot shoots off in a dozen directions,
from psychotic ice-hockey coaches to picnics in the snow. The dialogue is
sprightly, and visually Simoneau's bug-eyed wide-angle images suggest
Citizen Kane reprocessed for fairy-tale Canada.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Technology: The verdict on Alvey's worth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Pounds 350m Alvey research programme in information technology was
launched with strong support from the British government in 1983, it was
billed as the answer to the UK electronics industry's flagging international
competitiveness.
Yet four years after the programme ended, the UK electronics industry's
position is worse than ever. Its market share has declined further - even at
home - the national IT deficit has grown and British companies have
withdrawn from important technologies and product markets.
So was Alvey, which received Pounds 200m in government subsidies and
directly involved about 5,000 people, a waste of time and money? Or did the
programme yield some benefits which will prove their worth over the longer
term?
A detailed evaluation, commissioned by the government and conducted by the
universities of Sussex and Manchester*, concludes that, from a purely
technical standpoint, Alvey chose sensible targets and achieved most of
them.
Substantial progress was made in advancing the frontiers of important
computing technologies, including very large-scale integrated (VLSI)
circuits, software engineering and intelligent knowledge-based systems. The
study argues that the programme also expanded Britain's R&amp;D capacity and
gave a fillip to its research community. But it is more ambiguous about the
importance of collaboration as a stimulus to research.
Only 22 per cent of industrial research teams said they saw Alvey as a way
to form new links with competitors, though 71 per cent of those who did
planned to continue working with partners after the programme ended.
There is also more than a hint that government subsidies were an influential
factor for some industrial participants. The study finds that, left to
themselves, some companies would simply have axed research work in several
technologies which Alvey was intended to promote.
The study argues that it was probably unrealistic to expect a long-term
research programme to produce a decisive short-term improvement in industry
performance. It also says Alvey would have benefitted from the involvement
of IT users, which would have made it more market-oriented.
However, the authors criticise industry for not seizing commercial
opportunities more aggressively. They say that only 17 per cent of the
industry teams involved said the results were regularly used by their
companies to make marketable products - a proportion the study calls
'disappointing'.
A third of Alvey researchers said their employers showed little interest in
the programme. Many found it hard to get money from their companies to
exploit their research commercially, while the companies lacked the
production skills to apply it properly.
Though companies which kept R&amp;D separated from production achieved the best
technical results in Alvey, the research was exploited most effectively in
the market by those which integrated R&amp;D closely with senior management
functions.
Factors over which industry had little or no control were also to blame for
the poor take-up of Alvey technology - in particular a chronic shortage of
well-educated staff and a shortage of 'patient' capital to back long-term
investment.
The authors suggest that the takeover by the UK's General Electric Company
of the semiconductor interests of Plessey and Ferranti could provide a base
from which UK industry could use Alvey research to attack world markets.
However, the study argues that Japanese and US companies are far better
equipped to put collaborative research to profitable use. Alvey's most
enduring economic contribution, it concludes, may be to enhance the UK's
ability to attract direct investments by those companies.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Technology: Hard times to bear - In the third of a series on
innovation in the recession, Andrew Baxter describes how the UK machine
tools sector is coping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<TEXT>
Anthony Balding could hardly believe his eyes when he stopped by one stand
at a recent machine tool exhibition in Taiwan. 'I saw one local manufacturer
there which had launched nine machines in one hit. That's a rate which can't
be dreamed of in the UK.'
Especially, it appears, in a recession. The UK machine tool industry, says
Balding, managing director of Norfolk-based Beaver Engineering Group, is
probably in its worst position for sales and orders for 20 or 30 years. Some
manufacturers say domestic sales are down 40 per cent over the past year,
although few admit to suffering as badly as that.
Beaver has been as innovative as any in the UK industry over the past five
or six years, developing a niche market in machining centres - large
multi-purpose machine tools - and turning machines.
'In our industry you should be looking at a major new product, or a
substantial change to an existing product, every 18 months,' says Balding.
Last summer it shipped the first of a new machine that cost around Pounds
700,000 to develop, a big investment for a company with annual sales of
Pounds 11m-Pounds 12m.
Now, however, Beaver has cut back on new product development and, says
Balding, 'we are moving as slowly as we have done for 10 or 12 years. It
hurts me greatly because our competitors in Japan, Germany and Taiwan are
not slowing down. The recession is going to put us two years behind where we
would have been.'
Across the country at Leicester, Malcolm Taylor, managing director of
US-owned Bridgeport Machines, is taking a different tack. Bridgeport, which
claims to be the largest UK machine tool producer, has shed some 'bottom
end' research and development staff, and set up a multi-disciplined hit-team
from R&amp;D, production and quality.
The aim, says Taylor, is to quicken the pace of new product development. 'We
are trying to run at 100mph to introduce new products, freshen up a
depressed market and prepare for the upturn.' A new range of machines will
begin to come on the market next month offering innovation and more
specification for little difference in price.
Taylor is determined not to lose two years to his powerful German and
Japanese competitors. 'In this business, either you get on the roundabout
and make it go faster, or you get off,' he says.
These two strategies for getting through the recession may vary in emphasis,
and would probably differ from those at the other 120-odd machine tool
manufacturers in Britain's highly-fragmented machine tool sector - the
world's seventh biggest with estimated sales last year of Dollars 1.72bn.
But the encouraging link is the importance that companies attach to
innovation - new machines, new production techniques, new attitudes to
selling. That is not just because it is a time when machine tool makers'
thoughts turn to innovation, as the 9th EMO, the big biennial European
machine tool exhibition, opens next month in Paris.
More fundamentally, the commitment to innovation is based on the fear of
history repeating itself. The post-war British machine tool industry has
witnessed the demise of dozens of famous names - led by Alfred Herbert, once
the world's biggest producer - due in to a static product range and refusal
to modernise manufacturing techniques.
The key development in machine tools over the past 25 years has been the
introduction of numerically controlled, and later computer numerically
controlled (CNC) machines, which have transformed the accuracy and
flexibility of machine tools.
This trend was spearheaded by the Japanese producers, and led to the
introduction of machining centres which can hold 100 or more tools and
memorise a series of jobs on a variety of workpieces. That in turn led on to
flexible manufacturing systems, where a host computer controls a group of
interlinked machine tools and machining centres.
British manufacturers have struggled to cope with this of the industry.
Although the mechanical aspects of machine tools have developed to take
advantage of the greater precision offered by computers, the extent to which
a machine tool industry can offer CNC machines has become perhaps the most
important indicator of its technological state of health.
In the UK, the Machine Tool Technologies Association estimates that NC/CNC
machine tools have risen from about 11 per cent of British manufacturers'
sales in 1978 to 35 per cent in 1989. That is still a long way behind the
Japanese at more than 80 per cent, but compares quite well with 45 per cent
for the old West Germany.
The commitment to expand the application of CNC is continuing despite the
recession. As recently as the mid-1980s, most British manufacturers would
have relied almost totally on CNC unit suppliers such as Allen-Bradley of
the US. Now the bigger companies have their own in-house software
development teams who, according to one observer, 'are unlikely to be
sitting around doing nothing in a recession'.
The use of CNC varies considerably, and is not limited to the larger
producers. Privately-owned Pneuform Bending Machines, based in Aldershot,
derives 85 per cent of its turnover from CNC machines.
Pneuform has just 18 full-time employees and is cushioned from the recession
by exporting 75 per cent of its Pounds 1.3m annual sales. In Paris it is
unveiling what it claims is a wire bending machine with a patented technique
for forming wire components such as exhaust brackets and supermarket
trollies.
Sensibly, the survivors of the shakeout in the UK machine tool industry over
the past 20 years are concentrating on specialisation rather than taking on
the big-volume Japanese producers such as Okuma and Toyoda. This has led to
the fostering of a small-company, owner-manager philosophy, with many
producers focusing all their development, production and marketing skills on
one product area in an attempt to stay competitive.
That has its advantages and drawbacks. Innovative production techniques can
be brought in quickly and have a speedy effect. Len Weaver, chairman of
Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based grinding machine producer, recalls that
five years ago the company had a 'build programme' of its production run for
the next 12 months. Once written, it was cast in iron. Now it is produced
every eight weeks.
The introduction of computer-aided design can quickly boost the productivity
of a small team of draughtsmen, and significantly improve the flow of new
products. But a recession exposes the weaknesses of a fragmented industry
that is constantly seeking improvements to its products and methods.
At Beaver, Balding has just spent Pounds 4.5m on a new factory, but is now
putting off spending a further Pounds 100,000-Pounds 140,000 on a CNC turret
punch that would have automated a semi-manual section of production.
And small companies shouldering the entire burden of a new product programme
can find themselves going into loss, as happened at Beaver.
But Balding refuses to import technology via licence agreements. 'I believe
that if you buy in designs other than to let that design be a small part of
your total programme, it is the beginning of the end,' he told the recent
House of Lords inquiry into innovation in British industry.
He points out that the UK machine tool industry is now so small that
companies have to look inward for solutions, with the exception of areas
such as computer technology.
There is some justification for this fiercely-independent approach. The
industry will probably never see another sea-change like CNC, and for the
past decade has been concentrating on incremental product development.
Consequently R&amp;D in the UK is 'not much R and a lot of D,' according to one
manufacturer.
This is true even in the grinding sector, which for technical reasons has
lagged behind others in the application of CNC. With an abrasive grinding
wheel constantly changing its size and shape, CNC has been able to cope with
this complex set of variables only since the mid-1980s.
Although much smaller than it was 15 or 20 years ago, the UK industry has
maintained an expertise in grinding technology that remains on a par with
rivals worldwide. This was strengthened last month when J&amp;S agreed to
acquire rights to creep-feed technology (grinding slowly in a single, deep
cut) from Brown &amp; Sharpe of the US.
Tom Pearce, director of Bristol University's Institute of Grinding
Technology, says some manufacturers are wary about joining in collaborative
research programmes, for fear of giving away too much to competitors. Pearce
says the recession has forced a few companies to pull out of research
projects, but this year he has had more inquiries than ever before.
J&amp;S made a splash at the 7th EMO in 1987 with its Format 5 CNC surface
grinder, but is contenting itself this year with some more modest
refinements to its range.
Behind the scenes, it continues to innovate its production methods, such as
rationalising the major castings used in its surface grinders. 'That does
not stop because of a recession. It's important to keep those efforts
going,' says John Liverton, technical director.
Next week's article looks at the computer industry.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Business Law: Self-regulation under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY JOWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GREAT DEAL of concern is being expressed about the effects of the European
Commission's forthcoming company law directive on takeovers, foreshadowed in
its draft 13th directive.
The fear is that the directive will force the UK's own self-regulatory Panel
on Takeovers and Mergers to be formally established by statute, which would
in turn threaten the informality, flexibility and speed which are the
panel's hallmarks.
The panel's supporters have raised the spectre of a rigid statutory scheme
administered by non-expert bureaucrats causing a rash of tactical litigation
and a rush for judicial review - even during the course of a takeover bid.
A recent study by the David Hume Institute favours the present largely
unregulated activities of the panel and compares its actions to that of a
football referee, acting to control a 'fast-moving, frequently
unpredictable, competitive event', where an authoritative decision needs to
be made quickly, and without the impediment of formality and appeal to the
courts.
The panel needs to act swiftly, and in practice operates with commendable
efficiency. However, its decisions are much freer of constraint than those
of any footfall referee. It makes the laws it interprets, it waives its own
laws, and it operates virtually free of public scrutiny. By comparison, the
football referee is a model of procedural propriety.
The panel has already been the subject of judicial review, first in the 1987
Datafin case. Despite its lack of 'visible means of legal support', the
Master of the Rolls described the panel as possessing 'a giant's strength'
and considered it amenable to judicial review because it exercises 'immense
power' of a public nature.
However, it was not only the panel's strength and power that convinced the
Court of Appeal to subject it to judicial review. It was also the fact that
the panel violated accepted norms of separation of powers being, as
described in a later case, 'part legislator, part court of interpretation,
part consultant, part referee, part disciplinary body'.
Listening to the pleas of the panel's supporters for freedom from legal
control brings to mind the time when virtually all UK administrative
tribunals and inquiries evaded legality on the ground that their place was
in the realm of 'administration' rather than 'justice'.
The main fear of the panel's supporters is that the implementation of the
directive through statutory enactment will encourage legal challenge to the
panel's decisions during the course of takeover bids.
Legal intervention, however, is unlikely to become more frequent simply
because the panel has statutory status. As has been made clear in countless
cases, judicial review never permits the courts to interfere with the
'merits' of a case.
No court will lightly upset the panel's opinion that the parties have or
have not been acting 'in concert', or that a party has been taking action to
obstruct a bid in breach of the City code on takeovers and mergers. These
are essentially matters of 'fact and degree' for the panel.
The concern is that the panel will be subject to judicial review for not
following the letter of the directive. The panel and its supporters cherish
its privilege of eschewing the literal interpretation of its rules, and
giving precedence to its set of principles.
It is therefore free to waive a rule in favour of a principle, to interpret
a practice that is not covered by a rule in the light of a principle, and
speedily to enact new rules to cover new situations (such as management
buy-outs).
The panel's mix of rule and discretion displays a commendable flexibility
and a willingness to consider each case on its individual merit. But the
draft directive also establishes a combination of principles and rules, and
permits reasoned derogation from a number of its rules.
The UK statute could easily instruct the new principles to prevail over the
rules. In any event, judges in the UK are these days perfectly capable of
interpreting statutes 'purposively'. They have, in past cases, shown
themselves to be sufficiently aware of administrative realities to recognise
that laws may be enforced selectively, and that extra-statutory concessions
are a fact of regulatory life.
When the Court of Appeal held that the panel's decisions were subject to
judicial review, the Master of the Rolls had the American experience very
much in mind when he promised that the relationship between the panel and
the court should be 'historic rather than contemporaneous'.
Thus panel decisions, if held unlawful in the future, would not be quashed
but only admonished by way of a declaratory judgment with prospective effect
(although it was subsequently made clear that in the case of decisions
leading to disciplinary action the court would intervene to protect the
parties from the 'abuse of power').
With or without the directive, it is going to be hard for the courts to
continue defending a secure zone of immunity around the panel - an immunity
which could not be justified in the case of other bodies performing public
functions.
Normally in UK law a remedy should be provided where a right or breach of
duty has been found. A blanket immunity from remedy in practice removes any
incentive to litigation, thus making the opportunity of judicial review in
effect a dead letter.
Nevertheless, there is a key reason why the fear of 'American style'
obstructive litigation is unfounded: the UK procedure for judicial review
(the application for judicial review) has a built-in filtering system.
Unlike US procedure, and unlike private-law procedure in this country, the
application for judicial review is divided into two stages. At the first
stage the decision is taken to grant 'leave' to apply. This stage is
purpose-built to halt obstructive litigation in its tracks, and would mean
that few unmeritorious cases would easily reach the second stage of a full
hearing.
Even in the absence of enforced change from the directive, a procedural
audit of the Takeover Panel would find much wanting in comparison with other
bodies performing public functions.
Its required consultative procedures when rules are amended are minimal.
Its composition looks to an outsider excessively biased towards those with a
direct financial interest in creating more takeover activity. (No doubt the
panel and the executive are scrupulously fair in practice but, as it is
said, justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done.)
Inter partes hearings in a contested matter are very much the exception  -
even though these are often the best way of arriving at the truth.
Nor does the panel normally allow presentation of a case by a legal
advocate. The courts have blown hot and cold on whether procedural fairness
includes the right to a legal adviser before domestic tribunals, and before
disciplinary tribunals in institutions such as prisons.
Even in those situations, however, the view has now formed that legal
representation is a basic 'civil right' that should not be excluded in all
but the most exceptional situations.
If that is so, why should legal representation not be permitted as of right
before the panel. Or, to put it another way, by what right, and on what
principle, does the panel seek to protect a virtual monopoly of
representation by City financial advisers?
The proposed European directive is unlikely to change the relationship
between the panel and the courts. Yet there seems no reason why the panel
should be exempt from controls on its discretion which are routinely imposed
on other decision-making bodies with far less power.
Nor does there seem any good reason why a somewhat increased measure of
control of the panel's 'giant's strength' should impede the undoubted
efficiency and flexibility for which it is justly renowned.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Management: Tape v tape; Philips v Sony - Recorded music
technology / Michael Skapinker assesses the reception awaiting digital
compact cassettes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American teenagers spent more on trainers than on music last year. Some
might see this as a comment on the outrageous price of footwear. To Gerry
Wirtz, it is a warning that time is running out for the cassette tape.
Wirtz is a senior product manager at Philips, the Dutch electronics group
which invented the cassette. He says that the traditional audio tape is in
decline.
Some companies, headed by Sony of Japan, have come up with a new technology,
Digital Audio Tape (DAT). Philips has hit back with the Digital Compact
Cassette (DCC). Both offer sound quality as good as that of compact disc.
At first sight, the companies' concern appears unwarranted. The
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry reports that cassette
sales tripled during the 1980s, reaching 1.5bn units sold in 1989.
Wirtz says it is vital, however, to introduce a new recording technology
before the old one reaches its peak. Work on the compact disc began before
sales of vinyl records began their precipitous fall. The development of
digital tape is, if anything, a bit late, he says. There are signs that
sales of traditional cassettes have already begun to slip.
Market research reveals that consumers think of traditional audio cassettes
as being old-fashioned, unreliable and offering poor sound. US youngsters,
Wirtz contends, are as disillusioned with the cassettes as with the music on
them.
A popular digital format is necessary if the demise of the audio cassette is
not to drag the entire Dollars 22bn recording industry into decline.
The proponents of digital audio tape have moved faster than Philips. DAT
machines are already on the market, despite legal objections from the record
industry which feared that people would use them to make crystal clear
pirate tapes. DAT has not, however, made much impression. Philips says this
is not surprising; DAT machines play digital tapes only. Anyone owning one
would have to throw their traditional audio cassettes away.
Wirtz contends that the tape market has to be approached differently.
Cassettes still outsell other musical media by a long way. Despite their
decline, 'the music cassette will be with us beyond the year 2000,' he says.
The problem with the cassette is not that it will stop selling. It will
simply sell more slowly. The trick, Wirtz says, is to come up with a
technology which can attach itself to the cassette market while at the same
time boosting tape sales.
Philips believes the DCC machines will do just that. The main difference
between DCC and DAT players is that the new Philips machines will play both
old-fashioned and digital tapes. Both types of tape can be inserted into the
same slot. (The old style of tape player will not, however, play the new
digital cassettes.) As traditional cassette players wear out, Philips hopes
that new buyers will go for DCC, attracted by the idea that they do not have
to throw their old tapes away.
Philips' prototype of a DCC player will soon be available; it plans to
launch the machines and tapes in April 1992. It has already lined up an
impressive array of music companies to support its technology, including
EMI, Bertelsmann, and PolyGram, a Philips subsidiary. Tandy of the US is
also expected to make the players.
The most impressive backer, however, is Matsushita of Japan, the world's
largest consumer electronics company and Sony's traditional rival. Philips
will not confirm that Matsushita is lending its support, but it is believed
that the Japanese group will be a co-licensor of DCC. Philips and Matsushita
will together sell the right to manufacture DCC to other companies.
Wirtz admits that marketing DCC will be a difficult job. The compact disc,
the other digital recording format on the market, has grown rapidly from
almost nothing in 1983 to worldwide sales of 600m discs in 1989. The CD had
the advantage of offering a sound clearer than anything that music
enthusiasts had heard before. DCC, as a subsequent digital technology, will
not have the same novelty value.
Philips, which invented the CD as well as the audio tape, thought each new
purchaser of a compact disc player would buy eight recordings in the first
year of ownership. Instead, new buyers of CD players bought 16 discs in the
first year.
'We don't expect DCC to be the same as the CD,' Wirtz says. 'It's the second
digital child. With your first child you go nuts. With your second you have
a one-day party and then go back to work. We expect people to buy only three
tapes in the first year they own a DCC player. It will be a massive problem
to keep the cassette market going. To do so with digital cassette we've got
to grow like hell.'
Philips is expected to aim DCC at the portable music market, selling
personal digital stereos and car tape players. Alain Levy, PolyGram's chief
executive, says he would like to give DCC tapes a price mid-way between that
of traditional cassettes and compact discs.
Wirtz, however, says he expects sales of DCC tapes to begin at around the
same level as CDs. DCC players will be sold for between Pounds 300 and
Pounds 500 each.
He showed off the new tapes at a London hotel last month, along with a
provisional version of a DCC player. The sound is as good as that of a
compact disc. Wirtz demonstrated this by playing the same piece of music on
CD and DCC players simultaneously and switching between the two. He then
played a traditional audio cassette on the DCC player, producing a
noticeably fuzzier sound.
The DCC tape looks like a cross between an audio cassette and a floppy disc.
Wirtz claims, however, that it will be far more reliable and durable than an
audio cassette. Licencees will have to follow strict guidelines in the
manufacture of DCC tapes. They will, for example, have to use high quality
plastic which does not melt on the dashboard of a car left in the sun.
But DCC still uses tape, however. Although better protected than in a
traditional audio cassette, it still looks vulnerable to accident or wear
and tear. CDs appear more durable.
Apart from the ability to carry on playing old cassettes, it is difficult to
see what DCC offers that CD does not. Some in the industry say DCC will
benefit from being vibration-resistant and therefore more suitable for use
in cars and personal stereos than compact discs. But the CD has quickly
established itself as a popular device. If DCCs are no cheaper than CDs who
will buy them? The answer, one imagines, is people who want to record from
CDs on to blank DCC tapes - an activity the record industry has never liked.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Management: Pyrotechnics in French tobacco - William Dawkins
reports on Seita's struggle to cope with the contradictions in its
government's policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prize for the man with the least rewarding top management job in French
state-owned industry must go to Bertrand de Galle, chairman of Seita, the
beleaguered tobacco monopoly.
Not only does the producer of Gauloises and Gitanes have to live with his
state shareholder's recent conversion to the anti-smoking cause; de Galle
also has to cope with the state's increasing interference in his business, a
serious constraint since the French market accounted for more than 95 per
cent of Seita's FFr11bn annual turnover last year.
Proving the rule that nobody is more virtuous than a converted sinner, the
French government has switched from being one of Europe's weakest to one of
its toughest anti-smoking administrations.
At the end of last year, parliament agreed a law banning all publicity for
tobacco from January 1993, as well as restricting alcohol advertising to
adult newspapers and magazines and a few radio stations.
The government's temptation to curb Seita's freedoms climaxed last month
when the group was forced to withdraw its latest brand, Chevignon, after a
bitter political row.
In support of de Galle the budget ministry argued that the new brand would
not attract new smokers but it would help Seita in a laudable attempt to
increase market share against US competition. But the health ministry's wish
to curb smoking at all costs won the day, thanks to the decisive backing of
Michel Rocard, the Prime Minister.
The Chevignon brand was launched jointly with the designer of trendy
youngsters' wear based on US 1950s designs. It was officially scrapped on
the grounds that it contravened an infrequently observed 1976 law against
the use of tobacco brand names on other consumer products.
de Galle was understand- ably peeved, especially in view of the fact that
the state has taken no action against cigarette brands like Cartier, Yves
Saint Laurent, Battistani - named after an Italian fashion designer - and
Dunhill, which appear to fall into the same category as Chevignon. 'It is
difficult to make my staff understand why the state wants them to go on
making cigarettes and at the same time that the public should not smoke,' he
mourns.
Faced with this contradiction, many people might feel that de Galle's
position is untenable. Yet he explains: 'The problem is not that we have the
state as a shareholder. It is that we are a company essentially active in
one national market, and a national market where the constraints are very
strong.'
The group is not nearly big or profitable enough to afford the grand
diversification strategies that tobacco multinat-ionals have practised with
such mixed success. de Galle compares his company with the privately owned
German cigarette group, Reemstma, which continues profitably to exploit its
national market and has - wisely, he believes - made very limited
diversifications outside its main business.
But being fully owned by a government that is both short of money and
against smoking clearly restricts Seita's freedom to raise money on private
capital markets. Only in 1987 did it make its first profit in 11 years. With
net revenues of FFr420m on sales of FFr10.3bn in 1989, Seita's most recent
accounting year, it only just has enough spare cash to fund its own
investments.
Yet de Galle is convinced that Seita does have a future, albeit a modest
one. The government's recent decision to allow private companies to take
minority stakes in state-owned ones gives Seita a little more flexibility
should it need a private partner, though de Galle has no specific plans. So
how does he plan to get the group out of its present fix?
Despite the strength of the French state's recent conversion to the
anti-smoking cause, de Galle does not believe his market will collapse
overnight.
He is bargaining on a 15 per cent decline over the next decade in the 95bn
cigarettes smoked annually by the French. There is scope to add to Seita's
52 per cent share of the French market by continuing its shift away from
traditional dark tobacco, towards lower tar cigarettes, which now account
for nearly two thirds of French consumption.
Seita took its first step in that direction with the launch of the Gauloise
blonde in 1984. It was seen at the time as a controversial attempt to meddle
with a valuable brand image, but has helped to reverse Gauloises' decline
against Marlboro and Peter Stuyvesant. Following the withdrawal of
Chevignon, it has just launched a light version of Lucky Strike.
All this buys Seita time, reckons de Galle, to continue the modest
diversification he began when he moved from a senior Finance Ministry job to
his present post in 1988.
The point, he explains, is to make the best possible use of the distribution
network that links Seita with the 39,000 state-licensed tobacconists or
tabacs in cafes and newsagents across France - the biggest sales network in
the country.
This asset is a relic of the time Seita used to have a monopoly of French
cigarette distribution which was abandoned at the end of the 1970s, though
it keeps its monopoly on production. Even though foreign manufacturers are
allowed to export to France freely, there is in practice no way of getting
cigarettes to the all-important tabacs other than through Seita.
Accordingly, the state group handles 98 per cent of all cigarettes
distributed in France, a useful captive market which accounted for 61 per
cent of the group's turnover last year.
Clearly, the network could, at little extra cost, be used to distribute any
product suitable for sale in a tabac, though Seita's efforts in this
direction have so far been limited. It tried to buy the Belin biscuit
company from RJR Nabisco two years ago, but was outbid by the French food
giant, BSN.
It has had better success in taking on the sale of telephone cards over the
past two years; formerly the preserve of the post office, they have become
essential to every French citizen. Sales accounted for FFr1.2bn turnover
last year, just over 10 per cent of group total, a proportion Seita hopes to
increase by introducing other products to the network.
Seita also has small but profitable businesses selling computerised sales
and stock-keeping terminals to retailers and has just begun to explore the
idea of selling its distribution expertise abroad.
In the meantime, de Galle has his hands full steering Seita through the
curious contradictions of its national situation.

Monmouth
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roger Evans, the Tory candidate in the Monmouth by-election, yesterday
fuelled the continuing row over two local hospitals possibly opting out to
become self-governing trusts, when he compared not balloting patients about
whether hospitals should opt out with a shopkeeper not balloting his
customers to find out what they wanted to buy, Alison Smith writes.
Asked whether he was saying the NHS was like Tesco supermarkets, he said he
was simply suggesting that the organisation was used by a changing class of
person 'which are patients, in exactly the same way that Tesco has a
different group of people using it each day.'
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, representing Mr Huw
Edwards, the Labour candidate, at a candidates' meeting in Chepstow, said
government plans were turning the NHS into a 'health supermarket'.
But the other parties criticised Mr Edwards' failure to attend the meeting.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Manchester shopping development in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Manchester's plans to develop valuable land owned by
Manchester Ship Canal were yesterday thrown into confusion by the
government.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, stalled further on planning
permission for the 1m sq ft Trafford shopping and leisure centre at
Dumplington, Greater Manchester. The centre is planned for 300 acres of land
which was at the heart of the bitter takeover battle for Manchester Ship
Canal in 1985-87.
Dumplington is in one corner of the big cross formed where the M63 motorway
bridges the canal. However, the motorway's ability to cope with rising
traffic after 1996 has now been seriously questioned by the Department of
Transport. The DoT says its latest forecasts suggest that the northbound
carriageway of the M63 would have to be widened to four lanes over 1 1/4
miles of Barton Bridge - which carries the motorway over the canal - if
vehicles leaving the centre are to merge safely with traffic on the
motorway.
Mr Heseltine's officials said that was new evidence. Manchester Ship Canal
and rivals bidding to build the regional retail centre on a nearby site now
have 21 days to respond or to ask for a public inquiry to be reopened. The
inquiry sat for five months to February 1988 and recommended Dumplington,
which the government still says is the best site for the centre.
The government has just spent Pounds 24m on widening the bridge.

<TEXT>
GLOOM about Northern Ireland's political future reached another low
yesterday as stalemate continued over a logistical detail that has delayed
'round-table' talks between the province's main political parties.
After a further 6 1/2 hours of bilateral meetings with Mr Peter Brooke,
Northern Ireland secretary, leaders of the main nationalist and unionist
parties failed to reach agreement on the venue for the Irish government's
entry into the talks process.
The dispute underlines the deep-seated mistrust between the two communities
in the province, whereby neither can afford to be seen as giving way first.
Discussions, in effect, remain at the 'talks about talks' stage.
So far, there is no indication that Mr Brooke has attempted to force a
compromise on the participants - a location on the European mainland has
been suggested.
In spite of the secrecy surrounding the talks engineered by Mr Brooke,
frustration is evident. 'Round table' talks were supposed to have taken
place on Tuesday, raising questions about why the talks process was allowed
to start without agreement on the logistics.
Only nine weeks remain before the deadline for the completion of talks, with
discussions on the highly complex subjects of devolution in the province and
a new Anglo-Irish Agreement still to start. Much of the good will apparent
before talks started has evaporated.
Mr Brooke held two rounds of bilaterals yesterday with the four
constitutional parties involved. The nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party is believed to have seen him on both occasions as full
delegation. So too is the Alliance party, which draws support from both
communities.
Mr Brooke is thought to have seen the two unionist leaders - Mr James
Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley - on their own. Mr Paisley is understood
to be particularly anxious that the second strand of talks, involving the
Dublin government, should be held in London.
The Irish government wants the second phase of talks, which will discuss
relations between south and north Ireland, to be held somewhere in Ireland.
Any agreement on a venue struck with the constitutional parties in Belfast
would have to be cleared with the Irish government.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Plan to stop English rivers drying up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIORITY programme to save some of England's most attractive rivers from
drying up was launched yesterday by the National Rivers Authority, the water
industry's environmental regulator, Richard Evans writes.
Over-exploitation by industry, landowners and water companies, together with
a succession of dry winters and hot summers, has led to unacceptably low
flow levels in some of the country's best fishing rivers.
The NRA said yesterday there were no 'quick fix' solutions, and the cost of
reversing the decline might reach Pounds 20m. Among the 20 targeted rives
are the Darent, Pang, Wey and Ver in the Thames region; the upper Waveney,
the Hiz and Slea in East Anglia; the Wharfe in Yorkshire; and the Piddle in
Wessex.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush opens US ports to E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush, in a major revision of US policy, yesterday threw open all
US ports to former Soviet satellite nations and declared his intention 'to
stimulate commercial trade between the US and the region'.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said the decision was
another step to ending Cold War restrictions and welcoming eastern Europe
into 'the international community of democratic nations'.
The action had been taken, after an intensive inter-agency review, 'in
recognition of the progress these countries have made toward democracy and
the rule of law'.
The new port policy follows other recent moves to expand US trade with
eastern Europe. Last month, the Bush Administration extended duty-free trade
benefits to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia under the US
Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).
The GSP suspends tariffs for certain products as a means of helping
developing countries, and to promote free trade. This year's list gave
benefits covering Dollars 337m (Pounds 198m) in trade, more than half of
which went to east European countries.
The new port policy maintains the same delineation between the Soviet Union
and the eastern Europeans that the Bush Administration has retained on other
trade matters. Export controls, for example, have been liberalised towards
the eastern bloc more than for the Soviet Union, which is denied GSP
benefits.
The new port policy opens all US ports for commercial, cargo, passenger and
fishing vessels from eastern European nations. In the past, access for ships
from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania was severely
limited. They could not enter 12 'high security' ports at all and they were
required to give two weeks' notice before entering other ports. Albania was
denied entry to all US ports.
Now the six will be required to give only 24 hours' notice for any ports.
Soviet ships must give two day's notice at 49 US ports and two week's notice
at others. Access is totally denied at the 12 high security ports.
The 12 ports now open to the former satellite countries but still closed to
Soviet ships are: Charleston, South Carolina; Hampton Roads, Virginia;
Honolulu, Hawaii; Kings Bay, Georgia; New London, Connecticut; Panama City,

FT  09 MAY 91 / Scots power sale takes key step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the momentum of a prospectus as big asa telephone directory dropping,
the long-awaited privatisation of the two Scottish electricity companies
moved towards its crucial phase yesterday.
For months, the biggest doubt about the flotation concerned the possibility
that the government might call a general election before it could be
completed in mid June. Political setbacks for the Conservatives over the
past few weeks have virtually eliminated that risk.
Although Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, was careful yesterday not to
pre-empt the right of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to choose the
election date, he expressed the hope that there would be 'no impediment to a
successful sale'.
The flotation of ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric will complete the
privatisation of the electricity industry in Great Britain. Ulster's power
industry is to be sold next year.
It will also bring to the Stock Exchange two electricity companies that,
unlike the generators and regional electricity companies in England, have
the appeal of being vertically integrated. They generate, transmit and
distribute electricity.
Apart from being easier to understand, especially for foreign investors
accustomed to it, the vertically integrated structure of the electricity
utility makes for more balanced businesses than those of the English
companies. ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric can relate their
generation activities to established customer markets.
Although the two companies compete for large industrial customers with a
consumption over 1MW, they also share a balanced mix of generating plant,
thanks to pre-privatisation asset swaps and a network of generating
contracts between them, as well as supply arrangements with the state-owned
Scottish Nuclear.
Together they benefit from the substantial past over-investment in
generating plant in Scotland, which will make new spending on generating
plant unnecessary. As a result, the government is floating them with highly
geared debt-to-equity ratios of 51 per cent for Scottish Power and 43 per
cent for Scottish Hydro-Electric.
That gives them a big surplus of relatively inexpensive power for export to
England. to It will become even cheaper when gas from the Miller field in
the North Sea comes on stream for Hydro-Electric next year.
However the scope for exports is limited by the relatively small size of the
interconnector, the power transmission lines linking Scotland with England.
Plans to double its size will not come fully into effect until 1995.
The flotation is part of the government's policy of increasing share
ownership in Scotland, where it has hitherto been relatively low. The
incentives for individual investors to apply for shares are biased towards
customers of the two companies who need only make a first instalment payment
of Pounds 100 and may apply for their own company's shares only.
Other individual investors must buy a package of the two companies's shares,
likely to be in a ratio of 2 1/2 Scottish Power shares to one share in
Hydro-Electric, and make a down payment of Pounds 300. The exact proportions
of the package will be fixed when the offer price is decided and the
companies go on sales on May 30.
The offer is not being underwritten. Instead, the government is following
the successful practice applied in February with the English generators and
carrying out a book-building exercise among institutions to assess demand at
varying prices. It will also market the shares to institutions in Japan, the
US, Canada and continental Europe, who are expected to take not more than 15
to 20 per cent of the offer.

FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Austria fights Czechs' nuclear push -
Prague is determined to sell electricity to the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA, despite intense opposition to its nuclear power stations by
neighbouring Austria, aims to become an important supplier of
nuclear-generated electricity to the west.
Prague is determined to press on with an ambitious nuclear power programme
while plans to expand atomic energy are being scrapped throughout eastern
Europe.
In so doing, it is relying on the widespread acceptance of nuclear energy
among Czechoslovaks who face some of the worst air pollution in Europe.
Mr Jan Jicha, deputy economics minister for fuel and energy, was recently
put in charge of exporting electricity to the west.
He noted that an agreement to sell nuclear-generated power to a German
utility could serve as a model for the urgently needed modernisation of
Czechoslovakia's existing nuclear power stations.
A contract for the sale of 1,400MW of electricity from the Mochovce nuclear
station, being built in western Slovakia, was signed with Bayernwerk in
Munich. The electricity is to be delivered over four years, beginning in
1994.
The revenue earned by selling electricity from Mochovce will be used to
repay the costs of installing instrumentation and control systems supplied
by Siemens which will bring the station up to western safety standards.
This is a pattern to be repeated in the planned expansion of Czechoslovak
nuclear power.
But Austria is equally determined to see that Prague's nuclear energy plans
are scrapped. Anti-nuclear groups in Austria and Germany charge
Czechoslovakia with being the 'new utopia' of the German nuclear power lobby
and say it is on its way to becoming Eastern Europe's leading nuclear energy
producer.
In eastern Germany, two Soviet-designed nuclear stations have been shut
down, and resistance is strong to plans by German electricity companies to
build new nuclear stations in the region.
Austrian opposition to nuclear stations is so strong that Vienna offered
Czechoslovakia DM500m (Pounds 170m) in free electricity if it shut down the
two oldest and most troublesome Soviet-designed 440MW reactors at the
Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear station in Slovakia.
They are the same type of reactor as in east Germany's Greifswald atomic
power station which was closed down last year after public protests.
Austria would like to see two later-model reactors shut down as four
reactors at the Dukovany nuclear power station in Moravia.
But Mr Jicha said it was doubtful whether Austria could compensate for the
loss of the nuclear power which makes up 27 per cent of total electricity
generated in Czechoslovakia.
He wanted to see this boosted to 40 per cent which compared with Sweden (50
per cent), Germany (38 per cent) and France (75 per cent).
Ironically, the Czechoslovak government under Prime Minister Marian Calfa
was originally opposed to nuclear energy. But it quickly changed its mind
when the alternatives became clear. The northern Bohemia region of
Czechoslovakia suffers from some of the worst pollution in Europe, because
of its lignite-fuelled power stations.
The cost of installing modern anti-pollution equipment would be far greater
than phasing out the worst offenders and expanding nuclear power capacity,
the government argued.
The devastation wrought by the lignite-fired power stations in northern
Bohemia explains why most Czechoslovaks, even those with reservations about
nuclear energy, prefer it to generating electricity from soft coal.
The two reactors under construction at Temelin in southern Bohemia are also
to be brought up to international safety standards with the help of western
companies. In addition, two reactors are to be installed at Mochovce and two
1,000MW reactors built at Temelin or at a site in Slovakia.
Siemens or Westinghouse are expected to win the contracts, Czechoslovak
officials said, and would form a partnership with Skoda Plzen, the only
manufacturer outside the Soviet Union which produced reactors under a Soviet
licence.
Siemens is also negotiating with Skoda and the city of Plzen to build a
200MW high-temperature reactor for the supply of district heat to Plzen.
The sale of nuclear-generated electricity to western Europe is regarded by
Mr Jicha as indispensable if the nuclear programme is to be realised. In
addition to Bayernwerk, PreussenElektra in east Germany would be a likely
customer, as well as Italian and French utilities.
Electricite de France (EdF), itself a major exporter of nuclear-generated
power, had expressed interest in buying a stake in the Czechoslovak
electricity company, but Mr Jicha said he believed it would be more
advantageous for Prague to sell electricity on its own.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Fears of foreign competition in solar race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN may eventually earn more than Pounds 700m a year from the export of
an advanced form of solar power technology but is in danger of losing out to
foreign competitors, a report for the Department of Energy warns, John Hunt
writes.
Advances in photovoltaics - in which treated glass plates convert sunlight
directly into electricity - have led to the possibility of competitive
electricity generation using such materials in the cladding and roofing of
buildings.
Yesterday Mr Colin Moynihan, energy minister, announced that his department
was providing Pounds 250,000 for a two-year programme by the department's
Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU). It will assess the potential for
photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation in the UK.
Mr Michael Harper, Friends of the Earth's renewable energy campaigner,
described the sum as 'peanuts' compared with the amounts being spent on PV
in some other countries.
The report warns that technological advances in PV by foreign companies,
with the aid of government support, may make it increasingly difficult for
the UK PV companies to compete in international markets.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Vice-chairman of Hong Kong exchange quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Philip Wong, first vice-chairman of Hong Kong's stock exchange council,
last night resigned from the council following a confrontation with the
colony's government and the Securities and Futures Commission which could
have undermined the international reputation of the exchange.
The confrontation centred on a now abandoned practice, which until 1987 gave
preferential allocations of share issues to members of the exchange's
council. But behind this there has been a row over stock exchange reforms
between the authorities and local brokers led by Mr Wong, who was expected
to become chairman of the council in October.
Mr Ronald Li, chairman until the world markets crash in 1987, was given a
four-year jail sentence last October because he accepted preferential share
allocations, believing them to be a reward for approving share listings.
Along with six other senior officials and advisers, he faces a further trial
later this year.
Mr Wong was a member of Mr Li's council but was not on the listing
committee. He has admitted in a letter to the exchange that he took
preferential allocations which he says were 'universally known and
implicitly approved by the regulatory authorities'.
Last week he was thwarted in a bid to reintroduce the practice when the
council overturned a decision it had made in his favour a week earlier. He
is believed to have launched the bid, which was almost certainly doomed to
failure, in an attempt to exonerate himself for receiving the allocations.
His defeat gave the issue wide publicity and precipitated yesterday's
resignation which had been informally requested by the government.
The problem has arisen because Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against
Corruption granted Mr Wong immunity from prosecution for receiving the
preferential allocations. It has been suggested he was granted this immunity
because he handed the ICAC crucial information regarding Mr Li in 1987.
But Mr Wong has denied that he reported Mr Li to the ICAC and is believed to
argue that he received immunity because, along with eight others involved in
the old exchange council, he agreed to government requests that he should
not stand in the 1988 council elections. He was subsequently elected and
rapidly became a vice-chairman.
He alleges that, following newspaper reports about the immunity, the
government and SFC built up a case against him and pushed for his
resignation because he was leading local brokers' opposition to stock
exchange reforms. The newspaper reports did not directly name him, but
hinted at his identity and said the immunity had been granted because he had
handed over the information.

FT  09 MAY 91 / End of power struggle could be catalyst for reforms: Mr
Wong's departure could prove as significant for change as the 1987 crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESIGNATION of Mr Philip Wong marks the end of an era for the Hong Kong
stock market. It might prove to be as significant a catalyst as the 1987
world markets crash, which temporarily closed the exchange and was followed
by the resignation and subsequent jailing on corruption charges of Mr Ronald
Li, then the exchange's chairman.
The significance is that the departure of Mr Wong - who was expected to
become chairman in October - could ease the way for reforms of the
exchange's structure and council aimed at reducing the power of small local
brokers. These brokers have regained control since 1988 when structural
changes were introduced and, led by Mr Wong, have been blocking the further
reforms aimed at underpinning Hong Kong's image as an internationally
important financial centre.
But Mr Wong's resignation has a wider importance because he is believed to
have been using the stock exchange as a stepping stone to other influential
posts elsewhere. He has links with Peking and is widely thought to have
ambitions for high office after 1997.
He has been expected to be elected to the Legislative Council in September
as the nominee of the pro-Peking Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Some
colleagues believe his real target is to be the first post-1997 chief
executive of the new Hong Kong government. Others say that this is shooting
too high, and rate him as part of an inner cabinet. Either way, Mr Wong has
been playing for high stakes and seems to have felt the need to clear his
name for partaking as a member of the pre-crash stock exchange council, in
the council members' then practice of receiving preferential share
allocations.
His unsuccessful attempt in the past two weeks to legalise the practice
appears in this context to have been an attempt to wipe the record clean,
rather than a serious attempt to reintroduce the practice and line his and
other council members' pockets.
In the securities markets Mr Wong is regarded as being a staunch defender of
local brokers against expatriate influence. He has thus used the old guard
of the stock exchange as a political constituency, first for his ambitions
to become the exchange chairman, and then to develop influence elsewhere. In
the past six days he has thrown two large dinners for more than 150 brokers
a time in order to canvass support for his cause.
At the peak of his influence, Mr Wong is believed to have controlled 380 to
390 votes out of 700 involved in stock exchange council elections, many
through proxies. Large international (mostly expatriate) brokers have been
progressively replaced by small brokers (mostly ethnic Chinese locals) in
the elections so that, according to officials, the council's 21 members now
represent only 8 per cent of the exchange's turnover compared with 34 per
cent in 1988.
This has led to led to accusations from officials of the colony's
expatriate-dominated watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, that
the stock exchange sees itself as a trade association protecting its
members' rights, rather than the interests of investors and the market. In
effect this is a toned down version of a criticism made after the 1987 crash
by an official inquiry which said that the old stock exchange committee was
an 'inside group that treated the exchange as a private club'.
One of the reforms which have been blocked is to change the exchange's
articles and end its limited company status which carries a profit-making
role. At present its members have a right to a share in its accumulated
surpluses of more than HKDollars 226m (Pounds 17m), built up from seat
purchases and transaction levies. It would become a publicly incorporated
non-profit making body.
At the same time about 150 non-trading members - who are believed to form
part of Mr Wong's vote bank - would be ousted. This issue has been fought
through the courts.
But the primary aim is to reconstitute the council to include listed
companies and institutional investors as well as larger international
brokers. Voting in council elections might also be weighted to take account
of a broker's turnover.
The SFC has pushed these reforms and led the attack on the old-style brokers
at the same time as it has been waging a separate battle with the stock
exchange and the Jardine Matheson Group over allegations of over-regulation
in listing rules and the rights of Hong Kong companies domiciled and listed
overseas. Together with the government it now hopes that the crisis over Mr
Wong will act as a catalyst for a consensus on the reforms.
The question now is whether Mr Wong's resignation will hinder this political
career. The pro-China chamber will have to decide whether he should be its
Legislative Council candidate. That could well depend on whether Peking
decides to continue to back him. It may take a line often heard in the past
and decide that he deserves support as the latest of a series of victims
attacked by Britain in order to keep control in Hong Kong out of ethnic
Chinese hands.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Israeli PM departs from his dogma on settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A rare public admission that Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories are a central issue in Middle East peace efforts, Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, has said they would be a subject for
negotiation.
His informal remarks to reporters on Tuesday night were a departure from his
earlier public dismissals of US and other protests about the settlements,
which are undergoing significant expansion. Previously he had insisted the
settlements issue was not connected to the peace process.
The prime minister was speaking in English. In the past he has appeared to
strike a conciliatory stance for a foreign audience, only to retreat when
speaking to his supporters at home.
The settlements issue is likely to be a key topic when Mr Alexander
Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister, meets Mr Shamir in Jerusalem
tomorrow and when Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, returns for
further talks next week. Mr Bessmertnykh arrived in Damascus yesterday on
the first leg of his tour. He will meet Mr Baker in Cairo on Sunday.
Mr Yossi Achimeir, a senior aide to Mr Shamir, said yesterday the prime
minister had not altered his staunch commitment to settlements. Mr Shamir
called the settlements 'part of the essence of the conflict' that would be a
subject for negotiations. 'It is a question of territory - to whom this land
belongs - and this is the object of negotiations and we have to negotiate.'
Mr Achimeir said the remarks were consistent with Mr Shamir's long-held
position that all issues could be brought to the negotiating table at the
second stage of the two-step process Israel has proposed for the
territories. This envisages negotiations on a final settlement only after an
interim period of limited Palestinian autonomy.
Peter Riddell adds from Washington: President Bush said yesterday he was
'moderately optimistic' that Mr Baker would make progress on his fourth
peace mission to the region since the end of the Gulf war.

FT  09 MAY 91 / US banking legislation clears initial hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGISLATION to strengthen the US banking system cleared its first
congressional hurdle yesterday, although Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of
the Federal Reserve, warned that provisions to remove protection from all
depositors in large banks could trigger a crisis.
The financial institutions sub-committee of the House banking committee
approved a bill providing for the recapitalisation of the financially
strained bank insurance fund, by raising the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation's (FDIC) line of credit at the Treasury from the current Dollars
5bn to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.6bn).
The bill would bar the FDIC from protecting deposits above the insurance
guarantee limit of Dollars 100,000. In the past the corporation has
protected such uninsured depositors under the 'too big to fail' doctrine,
because of fears that losses to any depositors in failed large banks could
trigger a loss of confidence across the system.
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve favour retaining an element of
discretion under more restrictive conditions than now.
Yesterday Mr Volcker told the Senate banking committee that 'removal from
the FDIC of its ability to protect all depositors of large failed banks
could well trigger a crisis in the banking system of a magnitude entirely
capable of turning a serious recession into something much worse,
precipitating escalating losses and larger budget deficits through the
economy.'
He also warned that, 'unhappy as the situation may be, substantial public
funds will be required to bolster the resources available to the FDIC'.
Under the plan approved by the sub-committee, any additional FDIC borrowing
will be repaid by the banking industry itself through increased premiums
paid to the insurance fund.
The Treasury has welcomed the sub-committee's action to recapitalise the
bank insurance fund, although it will be seeking to amend the removal of the
'too big to fail' discretion.
The sub-committee will start considering next week the Bush administration's
broader plan to allow banks to operate national branch systems and to link
with securities and other financial service companies.
It is still unclear how many of these proposals will be approved and the
full House banking committee will decide at the end of June whether to go
ahead with comprehensive banking reform, as sought by President George Bush,
or just the version agreed this week.
The Federal Reserve secured two important victories in the sub-committee
version.
First, the administration had originally suggested the FDIC should borrow
from the Fed rather than the Treasury, and the Fed's objections were
reflected in the acceptance of Treasury borrowing. Second, the sub-committee
voted 22 to 13 to remove a provision that would have restricted the central
bank's ability to help poorly capitalised banks with loans through the
discount window to head off disruptions to banking and financial systems.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, has renewed pleas for the
public to support the latest anti-inflation policy.
In a national broadcast on Tuesday evening, the minister acknowledged that
the campaign was President Carlos Menem's fourth assault on inflation since
taking office in 1989.
'The results this time can, and must be, very different. We are convinced
that we can and must inaugurate not months, but decades of stability and
growth,' Mr Cavallo said
In April he introduced Argentina's most coherent and stringent attack on
inflation yet. The results so far have been impressive; inflation fell to
5.5 per cent in April from 11 per cent in March, interest rates have
plummeted to 1.5 per cent a month, industry is booming and officials expect
2 per cent growth this year.
However, Mr Cavallo said stability could only be achieved by stamping out
tax evasion and by eliminating the budget deficit. Although tax revenues
increased in April by a third to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.17bn) over March's
Dollars 1.5bn, the government remains Dollars 200m in deficit.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILY life, education and the environment are the most important items on
the agenda of international managers, according to a survey of 12,000 men
and women in 25 countries to be published by the Harvard Business Review,
writes Simon Holberton.
Far from being breast-beating free traders, managers show themselves to be
economic chauvinists despite working for multinational companies. Managers
in several countries say they favour legislation supporting local interests,
although those in Japan display a stronger endorsement of free trade than
most.
Ms Rosabeth Moss Kanter, editor of the HBR and author of an article
analysing the survey, says: 'The ideal of a global village where a common
culture of management unifies business practice is still more a dream than a
reality.'
The typical senior manager, a male, is in his early 40s, married and
bilingual. He is employed by an established but private-owned company
employing several thousand people at home and abroad.
He is more concerned about customer service, product quality, workforce
skills and technology than he is about macroeconomic and political issues.
He is sure that trade rules, government policies, currency risks and capital
availability are neither significant success factors for his business nor
significant worries.
He is strongly in favour of work-site child care and is concerned about the
quality of education. He believes that business has a significant role to
play in improving education.

FT  09 MAY 91 / CDU battler Volker Ruhe fights on many fronts: David Marsh
talks to the German party secretary who has his sights set on the Foreign
Ministry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING HIS frequent trips to east Germany, Mr Volker Ruhe, general secretary
of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is regularly
addressed as 'Herr Generalsekretar' by devoutly respectful east Germans.
This anecdote illustrates the excessive respect for authority of Germans
east of the Elbe - and their difficulties in facing up to post-unity
economic upheaval forcing them take the initiative themselves.
'I have to tell them I am not Erich Honecker,' says the 48-year-old Mr Ruhe,
recalling the former Communist party general secretary who led East Germany
for 18 years before he was deposed in October 1989. 'They think everything
has to be decided by people at the top, and not by levels further down.'
Cajoling people in the former Communist state to come to terms with market
forces is just one of the battles the pugilistic Mr Ruhe has on his hands.
He also faces the task of rallying the party after recent defeats in
regional polls in Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate, caused by disarray in the
Bonn coalition and the breaking of Mr Kohl's promise not to raise taxes to
pay for German unity.
Mr Ruhe has a front-line role in trying to soothe passions in the coalition,
where renewed squabbling has broken out with the CDU's Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the liberal Free Democrats
(FDP).
Finally, and most intriguingly, he has launched a campaign to raise the
CDU's profile in foreign affairs. Before he took over, in September 1989,
the Number 2 job in the CDU behind Mr Kohl, this was Mr Ruhe's main
specialty, built up during years on the international conference circuit.
In an interview on Tuesday, shortly before flying with Mr Kohl for a meeting
with CSU leaders in southern Germany to bury the hatchet after recent
recriminations, Mr Ruhe declared that he had no wish to engage in
'fratricide' with the Bavarians. But he highlighted the potential for strife
with the Free Democrats, who have held the Foreign Ministry portfolio for
22, and for three-quarters of this time in the hands of Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, foreign minister since 1974.
'We have to reconquer the field of foreign affairs,' Mr Ruhe said. The clear
implication is that, when Mr Genscher eventually bows out, the CDU wants to
move in - and that the main candidate for the job will be Mr Ruhe himself.
'The Foreign Ministry is tied to the person of Genscher - but not the FDP,'
said Mr Ruhe. He pours barely-concealed scorn on the idea that Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, the live-wire FDP Economics minister, would eventually succeed Mr
Genscher.
Mr Ruhe has never made any secret of his ambition to become foreign
minister. But he is also prepared to be patient, saying he did not think he
would move to the job directly, but by a 'circuitous route'. He appears
likely to be brought into the government in the expected autumn cabinet
reshuffle, promised by Mr Kohl to put new people into key positions.
He has been tipped several times in the past to take the Defence Ministry
job, at present held by Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg. He views such a prospect as
a highly thankless task, but one which could launch him into the job he
really wants.
Under questioning, Mr Ruhe can also be encouraged to vent some spleen over
his own party. The Christian Democrats, he said, made 'a big mistake' before
the December general election in ruling out tax increases to cope with
unification - a pledge reneged on spectacularly by Mr Kohl three months ago
with one of the largest tax raising packages in German history. Defiantly,
he added that the FDP should take share the blame for its 'destructive role'
last year in adamantly refusing any question of an increase in taxation.
Mr Ruhe also criticised the government's initial lack of response to the
Gulf war in mid-January. 'We were caught wrong-footed.' Mr Genscher, he
said, was so preoccupied with his lobbying for lower taxes in east Germany
that the impression gained hold 'that there was no government at all.'
Mr Ruhe supports proposals for the Bundeswehr to be deployed outside the
Nato area in 'intervention forces' which could be operated with Britain and
France under the auspices of the Western European Union. This would be in
line with Germany's new responsibilities as a sovereign country.
However, he is against a hasty parliamentary decision on whether to amend
the constitution accordingly. In view of strong antipathy in the opposition
Social Democrats towards a wider role for the Bundeswehr, as well as
misgivings among parts of the FDP (including Mr Genscher), Mr Ruhe said: 'It
would be better to make no decision than a wrong decision.'
The country's chief task, he believes, is 'bringing about the internal unity
of Germany'. The financial expense of east German restructuring, he said, as
well as the psychological challenges associated with it, had been increased
by the speed with which the process was taking place. 'We underestimated the
extent of the change. Previously, we thought that living standards between
east and west would be equalised within 6-8 years - now we are talking about
2-3 years.'
Mr Ruhe, born in Hamburg, and with a strong affinity to the depressed region
of the east German Baltic coast, ranks as a forceful advocate of welding the
two halves of the country together again. But he can scarcely claim
foreknowledge of the speed at which it was going to happen. In October 1989,
a month before the breaching of the Berlin Wall, he forecast, somewhat
daringly at the time, that reunification would take place 'within a
generation'.
Now, he says, economic recovery in east Germany will have ironed out the
main social differences between east and west by 1994. Naturally enough, he
believes this will also enable the CDU to win the next general election, due
in that year: 'By 1994, I am sure we will have made the decisive steps.'

Norway's prime minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, visited Brussels

After meeting Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, Mrs
Brundtland said an EEA treaty was still possible by the target deadline of
late June. She would not follow Austria and Sweden in applying for
membership, but would launch a debate in Norway on EC entry next year.
Whatever happened, Norway would seek close ties with the Western European

<TEXT>
Attempts to combat recession in Poland through easing monetary policies
would lead to a growth in inflation rather than production, Mr Richard Erb,
the International Monetary Fund's deputy director warned yesterday, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The government continues to come under pressure to ease monetary policies
and a meeting of economists to be held under the auspices of President Lech
Walesa's advisory council on May 17 is expected to give vent to mounting
public discontent.
Mr Erb was speaking after two days of meetings with Polish government
officials and political leaders. He said the talks had given him 'even more
confidence in the political will' to maintain the direction of the country's
economic reforms.
'I remain positive and optimistic Poland will achieve the targets it has set
itself,' he said, referring to a letter of intent recently accepted by the
IMF as the basis of a three-year programme of loans worth over Dollars
1.6bn.

evasion charges, reports David Marsh from Bonn.
Mr Kiep was found guilty in the Dusseldorf district court of depriving the
state of DM7.4m in tax revenues by operating a fraudulent money-gathering
scheme for channelling donations from big German companies.
The system, under which companies were able to transfer untaxed funds to the
CDU through a Cologne-based foundation, was in place between 1971 and 1981.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S politicians have passed a landmark law banning insider trading,
closing a loophole which has hindered the country's standing as a financial
centre, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The new law, which will take effect as soon as it is published in the
Official Gazette, has been under discussion for some years.
The new rules will be enforceable through a jail sentence of up to one year
and fines of up to L300m (Pounds 137,000). However, judges will have the
discretion to raise the financial penalty if necessary.
With the passage last December of landmark reforms for the stockbroking
system, the Italian authorities have now passed two of the three most
important pieces of outstanding financial market legislation. Discussion of
the third element - new rules governing takeover bids - continues in
parliament.
Italian bankers do not expect the new insider trading regime to have any
immediate effect on the Milan stock exchange. However, cynics have claimed
that it might severely impede a market which has a reputation for thriving
on rumour and privileged information.

FT  09 MAY 91 / Bonn threat to block Soviet housing finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BONN government yesterday threatened to block its financing of a housing
programme for returning Soviet troops after Moscow's decision to award the
first of the lucrative contracts to Turkish and Finnish companies.
Mr Klaus Beckmann, state secretary in the Economics Ministry, said Bonn
would withhold the earmarked funds unless Moscow agreed to review its
decision, announced on Tuesday.
The row over allocating some of the DM7.8bn (Pounds 2.6bn) Germany has
pledged for rehousing troops threatens to disrupt plans for the Soviet Union
to withdraw 350,000 soldiers from east Germany by the end of 1994.
The withdrawal plan, centre-piece of the accord under which Chancellor
Helmut Kohl won Moscow approval for German unity, is being financed through
DM12bn of Bonn government grants and a DM3bn interest-free loan.
Officials close to President Mikhail Gorbachev have hinted, in recent
contacts with politicians in Bonn, that the Soviet Union could be persuaded
to speed up the timetable by a year provided Germany agreed to put up more
than the DM12bn.
The DM7.8bn promised by the German government covers construction of 36,000
flats for soldiers returning from east Germany. Although tenders for the
projects were put for international bidding, the Bonn government expected
that German building concerns - including hard-pressed companies in east
Germany - would win the lion's share of the orders.
The first batch of contracts was to build 4,000 flats, including 3,000 this
year.
Soviet officials declined to name the companies that had won the orders,
saying the choice had not yet been cleared with Bonn. But they argued that
the Soviet Defence Ministry, which selected the companies after an
evaluation of the offers by German and Soviet consultants, was entitled to
the final say as the contracting party.
'If the German offers had been competitive economically, then there would
have been room for some favouritism,' said one official at
Soyuzvneshstroimport, the state organisation responsible for foreign
construction work. 'But the Turkish and Finnish firms know our market well
and they offered more favourable conditions.
'Since this is an international tender, we have to follow the rules of
international trade.'

<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-controlled bank, is on the brink of nearly
doubling its presence in Spain by taking control of Banco Jover, a unit of
Spain's Banco Santander.
The French bank has carried out an ambitious programme of acquisitions in
Europe, including the purchase less than a year ago of Banco Comercial
Espanol (BCE), which is another subsidiary of Santander.
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais's chairman, said that Banco Jover,
with 98 branches and 750 employees, would strengthen his group's presence in
Catalonia, especially.
Overall, it would now rank as the sixteenth largest bank in Spain with a
market share of 1.5 per cent.
Mr Haberer, who has set about acquiring significant all-round banking
operations in all significant European markets, said that Credit Lyonnais
had now reached an adequate size in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands
and Belgium.
In the UK, he said, it ranked as the largest continental European bank,
while its entry into Germany involves a long-discussed but much-delayed
share exchange with Commerzbank.
French bankers said, however, that Credit Lyonnais appeared to be looking
for further acquisitions in Italy, where it recently took the majority of
Credito Bergamasco.
No price was disclosed for the acquisition of Banco Jover, and estimates
have ranged as high as FFr3.3bn (Dollars 559.3m), this figure would
represent more than 13 times 1990 earnings.
Cariplo, the Italian banking group, had originally taken a stake in Banco
Jover, but decided that it was not worth spending the additional money
required to take control, even at a much lower price than the price that had
been paid by Credit Lyonnais.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, the German motor conglomerate, was yesterday given the green
light to build a DM300m vehicle test track across north German moorland, in
a decision likely to attract wrath from the country's active ecology lobby.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the northern state of Lower Saxony,
which is run by a Social Democrat-Green coalition, said his government's
decision in favour of the project was 'difficult but ecologically
justifiable'.
That was not the view of the country's leading ecological action group,
Bund, which immediately attacked the move as endangering the environment in
the rural region of Emsland near the north German coast.
Yesterday's decision by the Lower Saxony government envisages a 13km test
track for lorries and cars being built by 1996 near the town of Papenburg.
Both Green ministers in the Lower Saxony government approved the action,
although the Green faction in the Hanover state parliament voiced
considerable misgivings.
Mr Schroder, said the state government was spending 'not one D-Mark' on
subsidies for the project. Proceeds from sale of the land  - whose only
current industrial use is to provide peat for farms and gardens  - would be
put towards developing alternative public transport systems. Daimler Benz
earlier fought for a decade to build a test track at Boxberg in the
company's home state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the south of the country. But
Daimler-Benz was forced to retreat in 1987 when Supreme Court judges ruled
that the company could not go ahead with compulsory purchase of land for the
site from farmer who refused to sell up.
The Stuttgart-based giant has been considering building a test track in
Alsace in eastern France, but said yesterday that it would no longer pursue
these plans.

warrants will allow US investors to manage their European equity portfolios
more efficiently.
The FT-SE Eurotrack 100, launched in October 1990 and comprising leading
European stocks outside the UK, is calculated in D-Marks. The FT-SE 200,
introduced in February this year, adds the FT-SE 100 index of UK stocks to

FT  08 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Saatchi stake reduced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME IN Saatchi &amp; Saatchi expanded as funds controlled by Lord Jacob
Rothschild cut their holding in the company. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew placed most
of the 75m shares sold by Lord Rothschild and said institutions applied for
more shares than were available.
The Seaq ticker showed 75m shares changing hands at 19p and another 66m at
19 1/4 p. Traders suggested the difference went at least partly to cover a
short position at UBS. Final turnover was 144m and the price eased  1/2 to
19 3/4 p.
Lord Rothschild previously held 20 per cent of the Saatchi Euroconvertibles.
In the company's rights issue, he opted not to take up the rights after
conversion, but instead to underwrite part of the issue at the rights price
of 10p a share. After the restructuring of Saatchi, Lord Rothschild held
nearly 9 per cent of Saatchi. This stake has now been reduced to around 4
per cent.
Rolls-Royce falls
Adverse US analysis on Rolls-Royce moved the stock against the market trend
yesterday. It closed 3 1/2 down at 163 1/2 p after relatively light turnover
of 1.9m shares. In New York, Goldman Sachs analyst Ms Judith L. Comeau
lowered her current year profits forecast to Pounds 175m, from Pounds 214m,
because of higher research and development (R&amp;D) costs and the lack of
recovery in the market for spares.
Her views surprised UK analysts, many of whom are beginning to wax more
positively over Rolls-Royce. They believe the spares market is showing signs
of recovery and that the group's business can support the rise in R&amp;D costs
associated with the massive development of the Trent engine.
Glaxo recovers
Glaxo recovered some of the ground lost in recent days as Kleinwort Benson
reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock.
Mr Ian White at Kleinwort said the latest independent survey data of doctors
showed that the first few months of sales of Glaxo's new asthma drug,
Serevent, had broken sales records for a UK drug launch. He estimated annual
sales of the drug, currently only approved in the UK, to reach Pounds 300m
to Pounds 400m by 1995.
Glaxo climbed 15 to close at the day's high of 1114p on good volume of 1.5m.
Wellcome rises
Wellcome continued last week's strong rise by advancing 25 to 617p. Turnover
was high for the stock at 2m.
Analysts said there could be good news on the company's Aids treatment
Retrovir revealed at an Aids conference next month in Florence, Italy.
Trials in the US are indicating that the drug's long-term efficacy - which
has been called into question in recent months - is improved when it is
mixed with another drug, DDC, made by Swiss-based Roche Holding. Such
combination therapy has been pinpointed for some time by bulls of the stock
as a means by which the revenue generating life of Retrovir might be
extended.
Lloyds Abbey down
The UBS Phillips &amp; Drew insurance team cited a number of reasons for
downgrading its current year profits forecast for Lloyds Abbey Life. The
latter's shares came under sustained pressure after the UBS move, closing 7
cheaper at 404p on turnover of 1.3m.
Mr Youssef Ziai, life sector specialist at UBS, said he cut his profits
estimate by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 357m. He gave three main reasons for the
reduction. First, the group was suffering from the same high level of
defaults and bad debts at its Bowmaker finance subsidiary that the division
had encountered in the last quarter of 1990; and the level of new lending at
Bowmaker was down. Second, Abbey Life's new business figures for the current
year were running some 10 per cent below those of last year.
Third, Mr Ziai said, the recovery in the housing market will be pushed back
into 1992 by the rising level of unemployment throughout the UK, and this
would adversely effect the group estate agency business.
The oil sector was enlivened by suggestions that the long-awaited sale of
Elf's 25 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil was about to be undertaken as part
of a deal with the UK group involving a joint purchase of Occidental's North
Sea oil and gas interests.
One of a number of market hints was that Enterprise was about to launch a
hefty rights issue to purchase the Elf stake. This would be part of a much
bigger swap deal that could also involve Enterprise exchanging a portion of
its Nelson oil field for other assets in what is seen by specialists as a
tax-efficient move by Enterprise.
There was considerable speculation that the Enterprise shares would be
bought back at 450p a share, plus a tax credit to allow for advance
corporation tax, which would add up to a total price of 600p a share.
Analysts said such a deal would remove the overhang of Elf's stake but that
a rights issue would inevitably prove unpopular in the short term.
Enterprise shares receded 6 to 557p.
BP eased marginally to 354p, unmoved by the possibility that it might report
its first-ever quarterly deficit tomorrow. 'A first-quarter loss has been in
the market since February,' said one analyst. Shell climbed 6 to 532p as
First Boston, the US investment bank, upgraded the stock.
Allied-Lyons put in one of the better performances of the day among Footsie
stocks in response to the confirmation of top management changes. The shares
rose 18 to 570p.
Printing ink maker Usher Walker jumped 42 to 283p as Mr David Williams,
deputy chairman of acquisitive mini-conglomerate Mosaic until last month,
took a 10.19 per cent stake in the company.
Tate &amp; Lyle rose 6 to 365p as Hoare Govett raised its current year forecast
by Pounds 5m to Pounds 232m. With Tate making 60 per cent of its profits in
US dollars, the US currency's recent strength will translate into higher
sterling profits. Strong interim figures are likely to be reported today and
the market is anticipating even larger upgrades than Hoare's. Analysts
expect Tate to announce half-time profits of Pounds 92.5m.
Booker added 5 at 482p as Nomura issued a buy recommendation which focused
on the company's move into food distribution and away from agribusiness
since its acquisition of Fitch Lovell and Linfood. United Biscuits dipped 4
to 381p as a broker was reported to have lowered its current year forecast
by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 212m and next year's by Pounds 10.5m to Pounds
242m.
BAA put on 8 to 438p following reports it was planning to expand into the US
and also that it was attempting to bring Marks and Spencer into Heathrow
Airport. Analysts, however, said BAA's US involvement was likely to be
small, while it would be at least two years before Marks opened any stores
at Heathrow.
Brierley Investments advanced 7 to 44p on views that the company's financial
position had been secured. It has reduced debt by selling a 30 per cent
stake in Mount Charlotte Investments, the UK hotels group, to the Singapore
government.
Reports that the Office of Fair Trading had confirmed an investigation into
the affairs of Eurocopy, and that the company's consumer credit licence
could be threatened, lowered shares of the independent photocopier
distributor 8 to 88p.
A higher dividend distribution combined with a substantially increased net
asset valuation compensated for lower annual profits from Ropner. Both
classes of shares rose 5, the ordinary closing at 140p and the 'A' at 134p.
Smith &amp; Nephew improved 3 1/2 to 127p ahead of tomorrow's first-quarter
results. Profits are expected to be lower at around Pounds 27.5m, compared
with Pounds 30.7m, and analysts currently hold contrasting views on the
stock.
Aegis, Europe's biggest media buying group, climbed 20 to 213p after
announcing details of a refinancing package including a Pounds 30m placing,
at 260p a share, with a US investment house, and the Pounds 23.4m
acquisition of the remaining shares in TMD, a UK media buying business. TMD
jumped 93 to 340p.
The former also owed instalments of Aegis shares to the vendors of Carat, a
French media buying business bought last year. Two of these have been paid
off early, eliminating a perceived stock overhang. There is one instalment
left, due in December 1993 and which may be made in cash.

FT  08 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Base rate hopes feature in thin trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLOW of corporate devel-opments, together with revived optimism on the
interest rate front, pushed share prices ahead yesterday while doing nothing
to inspire investment activity. The FT-SE Index gained nearly 18 points but
trading volume, after excluding a handful of specific stocks, was among the
lowest daily totals for the year.
Lacking a definitive lead from either Tokyo or New York, the London equity
market returned in somewhat lethargic form from the extended holiday weekend
in the UK.
The domestic backcloth was uncertain, with a survey of UK construction
industry employers claiming that the industry downturn had deepened but a
report from the Institute of Directors indicating some revival in business
confidence. The latest Financial Times survey of economic forecasts
suggested that the progress of the economy may oblige Mr John Major's
government to postpone any UK general election until October.
Equities drew comfort from a firmer performance by sterling, which raised
hopes that the expected improvement in the UK inflation rate to be disclosed
next week may open the way for another half-point reduction in base rates.
The City of London, primed recently by the prime minister and the UK
Treasury, expects a sharp fall in the April retail price index (RPI), to be
announced on May 17, perhaps to around 6.3 per cent annually from 8.2 per
cent in March.
Shares opened lower but turned higher as interest rate optimism was
reflected in a firm opening in the Footsie futures contract. The brighter
mood was encouraged by the placing of a substantial holding of shares in
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, by the Rothschild interests, and
by activity among brewing and pharmaceutical issues.
Futures markets helped equities throughout the session, but it was soon
clear that trading volume remained limited to the special situation stocks.
Turnover of 144m shares in Saatchi, largely representing double counting of
the share placing by Rothschild interests, made up about one-third of the
day's total Seaq volume of 431.2m shares.
The London market took further encouragement when Wall Street opened the new
session steadily, calmed by President Bush's return to work.
At its final reading, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 17.8 points at
2,540.5. Equity strategists suggested that the stock market may now have
settled into a trading range with a ceiling, for the present, at around
FT-SE 2,550, and saw yesterday's performance as a sparsely traded rally.
The next two weeks will bring a heavy list of UK corporate news, headed
tomorrow by first-quarter results from British Petroleum, as well as a spate
of data on the UK economy. While the market was concentrating yesterday on
prospects for the April RPI figures, not all analysts accepted that these
may provide the trigger for cuts in base rates.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London investment bank, remains somewhat
cautious towards UK equities in the short term, commented BZW's Mr Richard
Kersley, although the firm expects falling inflation to provide the spur for
an advance later in the year.
For the present, he believes that further improvement in equities appears
likely to be 'stock specific', with the broad range of stocks finding it
difficult to make further progress after the spectacular advance achieved
over the first quarter of the year.

FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Weak treasury market causes
Dow to fall

Wall Street
US EQUITIES followed bonds lower yesterday afternoon in the wake of the
first leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding, writes Karen Zagor in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which spent most of the day in a narrow
range in lethargic trading, fell 24.15 to 2,917.49. After fairly thin New
York SE volume of 153.3m shares, declining issues outscored advances by 840
to 720. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 2.76 at 377.32.
Stock prices started losing ground in the late afternoon on the back of a
weak treasury market. Bond prices were depressed by the results of the
Treasury's Dollars 13.5bn sale of three-year notes in the first round of its
Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding. Demand for the three-year notes was not as
strong as expected and the treasury's benchmark long-bond, higher for most
of the day, showed a net fall of 5/16 at 95 7/8 , yielding 8.24 per cent, in
late trading.
NCR, which finally surrendered to AT&amp;T's hostile Dollars 110 a share offer,
eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 103 1/2 while AT&amp;T lost Dollars 1 to Dollars
36.
IBM retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 102 after the computer manufacturer
said it would reduce the prices of its workstations by as much as 60 per
cent.
First Capital, an insurer 28 per cent owned by American Express, plunged
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 1 1/8 amid concern about the lack of progress in its
rescue plans. American Express was off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 25 1/8 .
American Waste dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 7 3/4 in active trading
after PaineWebber lowered its earnings estimates for 1991 and 1992. Waste
Management and Browning Ferris, the two biggest waste companies, were down
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 5/8 and unchanged at Dollars 28 5/8 .
Air Wisconsin Services, a commuter airline linked to United Airlines, forged
ahead Dollars 1 to Dollars 9 7/8 after an analyst at PaineWebber increased
his rating on the stock. UAL, parent of United Airlines, slipped Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 156 1/8 .
Walt Disney, which was added to the Dow Industrials this week and made a
strong contribution to Monday's 2.78 rise in the Dow index, receded Dollars
2 1/4 to Dollars 119 7/8 .
JC Penney, the department store group, put on Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 5/8
after an analyst at Kidder Peabody predicted improved same-store sales for
April.
The secondary market held up yesterday, with the Nasdaq composite 0.03
firmer at 491.51.
Thornapple Valley, an animal slaughterer, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 38 as
traders covered short positions. Although there was no news to fuel
yesterday's gain, about two weeks ago a brokerage firm issued a trading buy
on the stock on the basis of its low valuation and the company's earnings
growth potential.
Canada
A FIRM start for the Toronto market was reversed, leaving a slightly easier
close for the third consecutive trading day.
The composite index lost 8.8 on balance at 3,478.8, after touching 3,498.4.
Declines led rises by 299 to 249 after a moderate volume of 23.7m shares, up
from Monday's 15m.
George Weston, which fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 44, said it expects 1991
net to be about 20 per cent below 1990's results, after reporting
first-quarter net of 20 cents a share against 55 cents a year earlier.
Trimel jumped CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 6 3/4 . The company said it has
acquired 50.1 per cent of Swiss pharmaceutical firm Biovail for an
undisclosed price, with an option to buy the rest of the equity in two
years.
Stelco announced a reorganisation under which its two operating divisions
will be absorbed into the main company's organisation, and named Mr Robert
Milbourne president and chief operating officer. The 'A' shares gained
CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 7 3/8 and the preferred 'C' stock rose CDollars 1
to CDollars 8 3/4 .

FT  08 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR failed to develop an advance based on comments from a Bundesbank
official that Germany has no intention of raising interest rates at the
moment. On this remark it hit resistance at around DM1.7320, but then
retreated through support at DM1.7200 to a low of DM1.7150, before rallying
slightly at the London close.
Mr Norbert Kloten, a member of the Bundesbank council, said the central bank
has 'no intention at the moment to raise interest rates', but that the
Bundesbank is concerned about high wage settlements and the effect on
inflation. Mr Kloten added that he expects the German economy to recover
next year.
Concern about US President George Bush's health, which caused some selling
of the dollar on Monday, faded into the background as he returned to work in
the White House.
Trading was subdued, on lack of economic factors, with the next important US
figures not due until Friday, when data on producer prices will be
published.
At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.7210 from Friday's DM1.7460
(DM1.7317 on Monday in New York); to Y137.95 from Y138.50 (Y138.25 in New
York); to SFr1.4580 from SFr1.4750 (SFr1.4675); and to FFr5.8275 from
FFr5.9150 (FFr5.8595). London was closed on Monday for a public holiday. The
Bank of England's dollar index fell 0.6 to 66.0.
Sterling was generally firmer, as the market took the view that last week's
poor performance by the UK's ruling Conservative party in local elections
had effectively cancelled the option of a general election next month.
Dealers do not expect an election before October at the earliest, and noted
that although wholesale interest rates in London discount a cut of  1/2
point in bank base rates there is little electoral reason for an immediate
reduction.
The Bank of England has given no encouragement to rate speculation, and has
underlined the present structure by lending to the money market at 12 per
cent on the last four Fridays.
Compared with Friday, sterling gained 2.60 cents to Dollars 1.7210. It also
climbed to DM2.9625 from DM2.9600; to FFr10.0300 from FFr10.0250; to
SFr2.5100 from SFr2.5000; and to Y237.50 from Y234.75. Its index rose 0.3 to
91.5. In New York, the pound ended 65 points higher at Dollars 1.7275.
In the European Exchange Rate Mechanism sterling improved to third from
fourth strongest, on figures from the European Commission.
The D-Mark was steady around the middle of the system, but lost a little
ground to the second strongest lira at the Milan fixing and to the weakest
placed French franc at the Paris fixing.
In terms of the Japanese currency the D-Mark showed a firmer tone, breaking
through resistance at Y80.00. It had improved to Y80.15 by the London close,
from Y79.85 on Monday in New York, and Y79.30 last Friday in London.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviets and Jamaicans to meet
over bauxite shipping deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAMAICAN and Soviet government representatives will begin negotiations later
this month to resolve problems which have bedevilled an agreement for the
island to ship bauxite for use in refineries in the USSR.
The agreement replaced a pact which expired last December, and committed
Jamaica to supplying 1m tonnes of ore annually over five years starting this
year.
Jamaican officials said that instead of taking the 250,000 tonnes of ore
which was scheduled in the first quarter of this year, the Soviets took only
30,000 tonnes. They said a deteriorating economic situation in the Soviet
Union was the cause of the breakdown of the agreement.
The USSR is paying Jamaica with hard currency for the bauxite, but the
island is committed to spending 25 per cent of its earnings from the deal to
purchase Soviet-made goods.
Soviet officials, however, have been unhappy with aspects of the earlier
agreement, and industry sources here say similar concerns are affecting the
new contract.
One representative of the trade ministry in Moscow recently described the
agreement as 'limited' in what it offered in trade between the two
countries. The Soviets have also expressed concern that the trade balance
has always been in Jamaica's favour.
The Jamaica Bauxite Institute, a state agency, reported that Jamaica's raw
ore exports of 1.1m tonnes in the first quarter of this year were 108,000
tonnes more than the corresponding period of last year.
'Shipments would have been better had we supplied the additional 220,000
tonnes to the Soviet Union as was expected under the contract,' the
institute said.
While seeking to repair the agreement with the Soviets, Jamaica, which is
the world's third largest bauxite producer after Australia and Guinea, has
secured another contract to supply ore.
Pechiney of France is purchasing 450,000 tonnes of ore from Jamaica, through
the Bauxite and Alumina Trading Company, a Jamaican state agency. The
Jamaican industry says the deal is worth more than Dollars 11m.
The government's effort to further expand bauxite production with the
reopening of some mines which were closed seven years ago has not been
successful.
The General Electric Company of the US had proposed reopening the mines
which were previously worked by a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals. The US
company had told the Jamaican government that it would produce and market
the ore, and use the profits to cover investments it planned to make in
electricity generating plants in the island.
Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the Bauxite Institute, said this
week that the proposals for marketing the ore were 'too tenuous'.
The reopening and rehabilitation of the mines, and the power plant General
Electric had proposed, would have represented an investment of Dollars 275m
in the island.
Mr Davis said that the problems with the Soviet agreement should not affect
Jamaica's chances of achieving this year's production target of 11m tonnes.
The island's bauxite production last year was 10.92m tonnes, 1.27m tonnes
more than in 1989. Earnings of the industry last year were Dollars 714m,
Dollars 156m above 1989.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Decrees to change Peruvian
agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori has given Peruvian agriculture its biggest
shake-up in more than 20 years. Two supreme decrees are to change land
tenure legislation for the first time since the Velasco military
government's land reform law in 1969.
The new provisions allow for agricultural land to be transferred and sold
without restrictions and permits those who are not themselves farmers to own
land.
Workers in the cooperatives formed after the expropriation of vast sugar,
rice and cotton haciendas in the 1970s will now be able to elect to form a
limited liability company and to become shareholders, with the consequent
right to dispose of those shares. Limited liability companies had been
prohibited from land ownership.
In another departure from current law, land may now be used as collateral
against agricultural loans. The maximum area permitted has been raised to
1,000 hectares from the previous 150 top limit if the owner has installed
irrigation.
Federico Uranga, former Minster of Agriculture in the 1980-85 Belaunde
administration, praised the 'courage' of President Fujimori. 'He is doing
what the democratic governments which followed the military regime could not
or would not do,' he said.
The changes incorporate many of the demands of Peru's embryonic, but
potentially vast, agro-industrial sector. Principal peasant and small
farmers'organisations are opposing at least some of the measures. They argue
that land-owning by limited liability companies runs counter to the 1979
Constitution.
Some agricultural experts also fear that changes in the law may force
impoverished small farmers to sell out to agro-industrial businesses. Few,
however, disagree about the need to reform Peruvian agriculture. Production
of cotton, rice and sugar, once important exports, has slumped by about half
during the past two decades. Peru now imports hundreds of millions of
dollars a year in foodstuffs.
This year, the sector is in more acute crisis than ever. The 1990 harvest
was disastrously affected by the most severe drought on record. Farmers were
left with virtually no resources; seed potatoes were eaten up by the
half-starved, while livestock was slaughtered wholesale for lack of grazing.
The already decapitalised sector was harmed further by the arrival of the
Fujimori administration last July. Fiscal austerity measures meant that
indiscriminate monetary emission to finance cheap loans to farmers via the
state Agrarian Bank disappeared overnight. The vast majority of small
farmers, especially in the Andes and in the jungle, did not have the
collateral to obtain commercial credit.
This shows up in this season's figures. The Ministry of Agriculture says
that throughout Peru 91,000 hectares (225,000 acres) fewer had been planted
by March than at the same time last year. Almost all of this is accounted
for by diminished sowings of yellow corn, cotton and rice. There were also
more than 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) fewer for wheat and barley than
last year. The only crop to register an increase in area planted was sorghum
 -almost 10,000 hectares more than 1990.
Ministry figures show that the coast has been worst affected, because of
water shortages. Crops in the jungle have been less affected.
It is not known, however, how much of the 'missing' 91,000 hectares has been
planted with short-term crops which ministry statistics do not measure.
Increased competition from imports is another threat. In March, the
government slashed import tariffs as part of general trade liberalisation
policy. Surcharges have since been placed on five key products - corn,
wheat, powdered milk, rice and sugar - to give local producers some
protection from dumping and 'unfair' competition from cheap imports.
The main problem, however, lies in the exchange rate. Peru's currency, the
inti, is overvalued, economists calculate, by between two and three times.
Local costs are disproportionately high. Producers calculate the farm-gate
price of yellow corn in Peru's jungle department of San Martin at Dollars
392 (with a 30 per cent profit margin). The imported equivalent costs
Dollars 186.
Of Peru's 7.6mn hectares of potential agricultural land, only about 2.7mn
are cultivated at present, according to estimates from Onern, the Peruvian
natural resources organisation.
The main hope for agricultural expansion is the coast and the jungle - the
Andes are already over-farmed. Peru's 52 coastal valleys, where the
agro-industrial take-off will come, provide the country's best agricultural
land. The desert soil needs irrigation to make it flower and that may cost
between Dollars 800 and Dollars 6,000 per hectare.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall after 3-year auction
disappoints
</HEADLINE>

US TREASURIES turned lower yesterday afternoon after a disappointing auction
of three-year notes in the first round of the Treasury's Dollars 37bn
quarterly refunding.
Demand for the three-year notes, which has been fairly strong in recent
auctions, was lighter than anticipated, although the average yield of 7.09
per cent with no tail was in line with expectations. The results drove down
bond prices across the board ahead of the remaining auctions.
Bond prices, which had risen modestly in thin morning trading, lost ground
on the release of the auction results. In late trading, the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond was off  1/4 at 95 15/16 , yielding 8.24 per cent
while shorter-dated maturities were about  1/32 lower.
The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market when Fed
funds were trading at 5 3/4 per cent, in line with the newly perceived
target for the rate.
Yesterday's three-year note auction was for a record Dollars 13.5bn.
Two-year and five-year notes will be auctioned in the next fortnight.
THE FIRST new Federal government bond issue in Germany since January met
with a good reception yesterday.
This helped to stabilise some early weakness in bond prices, which appeared
to stem mainly from heavy selling of bond futures for the purpose of hedging
holdings of the new paper.
The new 10-year bund, which has a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent, has proved easy
to absorb so far, according to traders. The German government issued DM3bn
at a price of 100.7 through the German bond consortium yesterday, though the
price later slipped to 100.2. Bids will be invited at a tender of a further
DM5bn today, giving a total new issue of DM8bn.
There was some speculation that the government may be forced to raise more
money this month through another 'Unity Fund' issue, to help cover the cost
of rebuilding east Germany.
The previous issue of Unity Fund bonds, carrying a 10-year maturity, was in
February.
Traders said the market took comfort from a statement made by Mr Norbert
Kloten, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, to the effect
that the Bundesbank had no intention of raising interest rates at the
moment.
THE UK government bond market rallied yesterday as traders said political
worries had receded after last week's local elections.
Traders said that the short end of the gilts market was well supported by
hopes of a base rate cut.
The market expects to see a fall in the retail price index on May 17 and
there is speculation that this could trigger a half percentage point cut in
the base rate.
At the short end, the Treasury 9 per cent stock due 1993 rose from 99 7/16
at the opening to 99 17/32 by late afternoon. Among the longer-dated stocks,
the Treasury 9 per cent due in 2008 moved up half a point from 92 7/32 to 92
23/32 , though it is still some way below the minimum tender price of 94 1/4
.
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped in low-volume trading ahead of this
week's auction of 20-year JGBs.
Traders expect about Y300bn of 20-year JGBs with a coupon of 6.8 per cent to
be auctioned either today or Thursday. Although retail interest appears to
be lacklustre, traders expect the new issue to be absorbed easily.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 6.655 per cent, closing at
6.68 per cent in Tokyo and traded at around 6.675 per cent in London.

ALFA-LAVAL, the Swedish industrial, dairy and food processing equipment
company, yesterday announced a 4 per cent fall in its profits after
financial items to SKr293m (Dollars 47.23m) in the first quarter of the year
compared with SKr304 for the same period of 1990.
Sales advanced by 5 per cent to SKr3.794bn from SKr3.603bn.
Mr Lars Kylberg, the outgoing president and chief executive officer, said
the company would find it difficult this year to achieve the 1990 profit
figure of SKr1.6bn because of the weaker business climate.
The annual meeting yesterday removed the foreign ownership restriction
clause from its articles of association. This will ease acquisition of its
shares by Tetra Pak which made a successful bid in January for Alfa-Laval.

COLES Myer, Australia's largest retail group, reported a 2 per cent increase
in sales for the third quarter to April 28, to ADollars 3.47bn (USDollars
2.71bn). The rise was mostly due to improved turnover in New South Wales and
Queensland.
Mr Brian Quinn, group chief executive, said he believed the improvement
suggested the recent decline in the company's performance, caused by the
depressed economies in Australia and New Zealand, had 'been arrested'. He
said that the Coles Myer group would continue its stringent cost-control
programme.
Sales in New Zealand, where Coles Myer acquired the Progressive chain of
stores two years ago, improved 1.4 per cent, indicating continuing flat
conditions.

BUHRMANN-Tetterode, the Dutch graphic paper, office supplies and packaging
group, said net profit fell by 10 per cent in the 1991 first quarter. It
cautioned that the trend in profits was not expected to show an improvement
later in the year.
The company, which does not publish specific first-quarter figures for
profit or sales, said the decline in early 1991 came despite a 10.7 per cent
increase in turnover.
The sales rise was due entirely to acquisitions made in 1990. The lack of
organic growth meant Buhrmann-Tetterode was unable to offset increases in
costs caused by inflation.
In 1990, Buhrmann-Tetterode posted net profit of Fl 260.3m (Dollars 133.5m)
on normal business operations, up 11.4 per cent on 1989.

DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's leading financial institution, is launching a new
plastic card in association with the German Tennis Association, in further
signs of new life being injected into the domestic bank card market.
While cash and cheques continue to be the Germans' preferred form of
payment, there have been some important developments recently, indicating
competition in the realm of bank cards is sharpening up.
Since the beginning of the year, the big German banks have begun issuing
their own Eurocard (Mastercard) products - hitherto the preserve of a
central issuing cartel - and some have started for the first time selling to
customers of other banks.
The cards, however, remain charge cards, with no revolving credit facility
other than any arrangement clients may have with the bank.
Deutsche Bank's first 'co-branding' agreement with the Tennis Association is
designed to give the bank, which services some 5m customers, access to a
wider field of perhaps 6m tennis players.
The card, a gold Eurocard costing DM140 (Dollars 79) a year, will be
marketed by the Tennis Association, and will carry the names of both
institutions.
Meanwhile, the German banks' recent surge of activity is putting established
card issuers on their toes. American Express, for instance, recently
announced that it would lower its annual fees for the green card to DM100
from DM140.

THE fate of FNN, the business news media group put up for sale in November
and entered into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year, hung in The
balance yesterday after a bidding war erupted between the two groups vying
for it, writes Karen Zagor.
A joint venture between Dow Jones and Westinghouse Broadcasting increased
its bid from an all-cash offer of Dollars 115m to Dollars 167.1m, made up of
Dollars 125m in cash, Dollars 32.8m in future revenues and Dollars 9.3m of
assumed liabilities.
CNBC, a cable television subsidiary of General Electric, has also submitted
a revised bid, of Dollars 146.1m, including Dollars 140m in cash and Dollars
6.1m in assumed liabilities.
Dow Jones/Westinghouse has filed an anti-trust suit in an attempt to prevent
an acquisition by CNBC, which operates the only major competitor to FNN's
24-hour business channel.

PAN AM, the financial-ly-pressed US airline which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, said yesterday it would resume
transatlantic services to London later this month, writes Nikki Tait.
Its announcement comes as profitability in the US industry recovers from the
shock of the Gulf war.
Pan Am sold its routes into London's Heathrow airport to United Airlines in
April, after its cash needs had become acute. Its jets will now fly into
Gatwick airport only.
Pan Am said its daily non-stop Miami-London service would start on May 18,
using Boeing 747 equipment. Although this authority has been operated by
United recently, Pan Am said it would honour all reservations issued by the
larger carrier for flights after May 17. On May 23 it will resume service on
the Detroit-London route.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAND Araskog, whose compensation as chairman of ITT has been sharply
criticised because of the group's flat earnings, yesterday forecast that the
company would have stronger operating profits this year.
Mr Araskog, speaking in Leominster, Massachusetts, where the
hotels-to-insurance conglomerate held its annual meeting, did not elaborate.
In 1990, the group had operating profits of Dollars 1.11bn, excluding its
investment in the telecommunications equipment company Alcatel.
The largest public pension fund in the US, the California Public Employees
Retirement System, voted against re-election of the company's directors at
the meeting in protest against Mr Araskog's 1990 compensation. However, the
directors were overwhelmingly re-elected.
In a year when ITT's earnings rose 3.9 per cent, to Dollars 958m, and its
share price sank 18 per cent, Mr Araskog's cash compensation rose by about
50 per cent to Dollars 5.5m.
Mr Araskog's compensation has become a lightning rod for mounting US
shareholder concern over apparent disparities between generous executive pay
and poor corporate performance.
According to a recent survey by Business Week magazine, the average chief
executive's salary and bonus rose by 3.5 per cent last year, to Dollars
1.21m despite a 7 per cent drop in profits.
The Californian pension fund, which is taking a lead among institutional
investors on pay issues, said Mr Araskog did not deserve his pay rise
because the company's performance had been 'mediocre'. It calculated that
his pay over the past four years had been more than double the going rate
for chief executives of companies of a comparable size and performance.
But ITT replied that the board's compensation committee, which used outside
compensation consultants, felt the chairman's pay was entirely appropriate
in the light of his performance and accomplishments. Mr Araskog said
yesterday that the sum fairly reflected long-term performance.

risk

<TEXT>
MR Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier recently ousted as head of
Pathe Communications, may be losing his grip on MGM-Pathe, the film and
television studio he acquired for Dollars 1.3bn last year.
In a delayed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Pathe
Communications revealed it must sell a 40 per cent stake in the studio by
December 1 to repay Credit Lyonnais, the French bank and an important backer
of Mr Parretti's acquisitions, including Cannon Pictures in 1987 and Pathe
Communications in 1988.
The SEC filing suggests that Credit Lyonnais, which has provided Dollars
250m in loans to Pathe and has promised an additional Dollars 145m, will
gain voting control of Pathe at the end of November or earlier if Pathe
defaults on its loans or fails to meet other agreements.
Credit Lyonnais will be allowed to sell 51 per cent of MGM-Pathe or Pathe
Communications if Pathe has not reduced its indebtedness to Dollars 125m by
the end of November. Mr Parretti and his relatives own more than 80 per cent
of Pathe and control three of the nine seats on Pathe's board.
If Pathe manages to slash its obligations to Credit Lyonnais to Dollars
125m, the bank will drop the voting rights plan.
Although the glamour of Hollywood has helped film studios command high
prices, analysts have doubts about the value of the MGM-Pathe stake.
Pathe stripped the studio of some of its most valuable assets, including its
film library, to finance the takeover. The studio is so cash-hungry it has
been forced to delay the release of several films because it could not cover
marketing costs.
Although MGM's television operations have been reasonably successful, thanks
to the popularity of series including thirtysomething and In the Heat of the
Night, its film studio has produced several recent box office failures,
including Not Without My Daughter.
A group of creditors which claims it is owed about Dollars 10m by MGM-Pathe
have filed a suit to force the studio into involuntary liquidation. Pathe
expects the case to be heard next week.
Apart from the Credit Lyonnais loans, Pathe's funding of the MGM takeover
has been shrouded in mystery. The identities of of several European
investors remain secret. The SEC filing did not disclose all the sources of
Mr Parretti's funding.
In 1990, Pathe extended its annual net loss to Dollars 107.7m, or Dollars
1.59 a share, from about Dollars 32.4m, or Dollars 1.13, a year earlier.
Pathe's loss before extraordinary items was Dollars 120.9m, or Dollars 1.79
a share, in 1990 compared with Dollars 61.1m, or Dollars 2.13, in 1989.
The company recorded a fourth-quarter net deficit of Dollars 85.8m, or
Dollars 1.22 a share, against net earnings of Dollars 22.2m, or 37 cents, a
year ago. The fourth-quarter 1990 results included Dollars 66.8m for
reserves on investments and loans to unidentified affiliates.

quarter

<TEXT>
ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled a 14 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits to SKr1.01bn (Dollars 163m) for the first
quarter of the year.
This is the first time since 1986 the company has suffered a decline, and it
comes after a period of strong growth. The latest quarterly figure compares
with SKr1.18bn for the same period last year.
The order book also fell, by 12 per cent, to SKr10.73bn from SKr12.19bn.
Consolidated net sales rose by only 2 per cent to Skr10.65bn, from
SKr10.41bn last time.
The company said profits for this year would be lower than those in 1990,
which were a record high of SKr4.85bn. It blamed continuing investment in
technological development and the effects of weak business conditions in
many of its key markets.
Ericsson said its decision to increase development costs in the public
telecommunications and mobile telephone sectors by SKr500m to around
SKr3.7bn in the first quarter contributed largely to the drop in profits.
The expenditure was in response to the move from analog to digital systems
in the US, Europe and Japan.
The small rise in net sales was due to 'the worldwide downturn in business
conditions', while the decline in order bookings resulted partly from 'the
unusually high volume of orders booked during the corresponding period of
1990, as well as delayed purchasing in 1991'.
However, Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive officer, said the level of
Ericsson's profits continued 'at a satisfactorily high level'.
He said the company was well placed for the 1990s, thanks to its high level
of expenditure in research and development and aggressive marketing.
There was a 2 per cent drop in first-quarter sales in the company's public
telecommunication business, to SKr5.26bn from SKr5.35bn. The radio
communications division pushed up sales to SKr2.87bn from SKr2.71bn, helped
by strong growth for mobile phones in the US.

TWO dissident shareholders of Sears, Roebuck, the troubled US retailing and
financial services group, yesterday asked a Federal judge to postpone the
company's annual meeting tomorrow, accusing it of failing to disclose
important financial information.
The judge said he would give his ruling today.
Sears' directors face a separate challenge from Mr Robert Monks, a leading
figure in the US shareholder rights movement, who is seeking a seat on the
board at the company's annual meeting. The directors oppose his candidacy.
The new challenge comes from two small investors, together holding some 500
Sears shares, who are suing the company in a Pennsylvanian court.
They maintain that the annual meeting should not be held until Sears
distributes to shareholders new proxy, or voting literature, disclosing that
for the past three years the company has been involved in a legal suit in
Chicago.
The Chicago case - which the company has not mentioned to shareholders  -
centres on allegations that the company's officers hastily initiated a
restructuring programme in 1988, mainly to foil any hostile bid for the
business and entrench themselves in office. Sears has dismissed the
Pennsylvanian suit as without merit.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Holzstoff withdraws motion to
limit shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALLIANCE of foreign and Swiss pension funds yesterday scored the first
success against Swiss companies' restrictions on ownership of their shares.
At its annual meeting in Basle, the board of Holzstoff Holding withdrew a
motion that would have limited the number of registered shares which one
person or group could hold to 2 per cent of the total and voting rights to 5
per cent of the total.
This is the first occasion on which opposition from shareholders has
prevented a Swiss company from imposing shareholding limits since Nestle,
the foods group, opened its stock register to foreigners in 1988 but at the
same time restricted the number of shares an investor could hold.
Mr Alexander de Beer, a Zurich lawyer representing a UK pension fund, said
he hoped Holzstoff's decision would serve as a signal to other companies.
Earlier attempts by Swiss pension fund managers to block the imposition of
limits by such companies as Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, the big chemical groups,
faded.
Both foreign and Swiss pension funds have built up stakes of more than 5 per
cent in Holzstoff, a rapidly diversifying paper manufacturing group with
substantial net assets.
They would have been partially disenfranchised had the board's proposal been
accepted yesterday.
Informal contacts between the pension funds led to agreement to vote against
the motion. The board, noting an unusually high 71 per cent of the voting
stock was represented at the shareholders' meeting and having apparently got
wind of the alliance, said it was withdrawing the restrictive proposal.
Under the existing statutes the board has the discretion to decide which
shares it will register.
The board said it wanted to wait for expected amendments to Swiss corporate
law and for developments in EC corporate rules before proposing new rules.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: New billboard battle beckons after site buy
 -Steven Watkins considers the consequences of the acquisition of Dolphin
Media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT purchase by Mills &amp; Allen, Britain's largest roadside poster
company, of the outdoor advertising division of Dolphin Media, a smaller
competitor, registered in the Isle of Man, has raised yet again the question
of whether the UK industry is concentrated in too few hands.
The deal, completed last month, raised Mills &amp; Allen's share of the main UK
billboard market - '48-sheet' advertising hoardings - to more than 39 per
cent. Together the top two companies, Mills &amp; Allen and Arthur Maiden,
control 65 per cent.
The Office of Fair Trading has already begun to consider whether to
recommend a Monopolies and Mergers Commission study of the concentrated
market. It would be the MMC's third inquiry into the business in 10 years.
With an estimated annual revenue of Pounds 110m, the market accounts for
more than half the UK outdoor advertising spend.
The last inquiry, completed in November 1987, occured because Mills &amp;
Allen's share of the 48-sheet market reached approximately 40 per cent,
following the acquisition of London Continental Advertising Holdings by its
parent, then MAI, the diversified financial services company.
That merger established Mills &amp; Allen as the only group able to offer
national coverage from its own sites. The MMC found the concentration
against the public interest, giving MAI sufficient market power to lift
prices above competitive levels, especially in the case of nationwide
advertising campaigns, and to reduce advertisers' freedom of choice.
The MMC also concluded that MAI's predominance would have allowed it to
'inhibit the emergence of effective new competitors', by outbidding them in
the acquisition of new sites and through the selective lowering of prices.
Mr Peter Brown, managing director of Multimark, a small outdoor poster
contractor which was active in the submission of evidence to the 1987
enquiry, was particularly upset by the implications of Mills &amp; Allen's
latest acquisition.
He claimed that the largest outdoor advertising firms employed a number of
other anti-competitive practices, to the disadvantage of their smaller
competitors. These allegedly included the use of 'onerous hidden contract
clauses' to prevent the loss of leased poster sites to smaller competitors,
and the manipulation of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Great
Britain.
The findings of the 1987 inquiry resulted in MAI being required to reduce
within 12 months its share of the national 48-sheet market to 34 per cent.
Other poster groups have since assumed this to be the maximum permissible
for a single company.
The ruling required MAI to dispose of some 2,000 48-sheet poster sites, with
no repurchase for four years.
In November 1988 Dolphin took the opportunity of purchasing 1,868 48-sheet
billboards from MAI, as part of an expansion drive which had earned it third
position in the market by 1990.
Dolphin subsequently fell on hard times, giving Mills &amp; Allen the chance to
buy its billboard division. The deal included 1,500 sites the MMC had
earlier required it to sell.
However in July 1989 MAI sold Mills &amp; Allen to Avenir Havas Media, a French
company which is Europe's largest outdoor advertising group, in exchange for
an equity stake.
MAI now holds about 15 per cent of Avenir Havas, exempting the group from
any of MAI's 1987 MMC undertakings, said Mr Philippe Santini, Mills &amp;
Allen's chief executive.
The Dolphin acquisition is therefore being treated by the OFT as a fresh
case, which particularly upset Multimark's Mr Brown.
In representations to the OFT, Multimark and other parties opposed to the
acquisition, are likely to emphasise the similarities between the situation
found to operate against the public interest by the MMC in 1987, and the
present state of the 48-sheet market, with its alleged malpractices by
larger firms.
Mr Santini, however, emphasised that the situation was the unexpected
outcome of his company's involvement in a financial rescue package that was
being prepared for Dolphin's outdoor interests.
Having expanded rapidly at a time of downturn in the advertising industry,
Dolphin Outdoor hit financial difficulty. It was negotiating a partnership
in which Mills &amp; Allen would take a minority stake, rising to 51 per cent
over two years.
When other backers withdrew last April, Mills &amp; Allen stepped in to save the
group from receivership, in a deal involving Pounds 3.48m cash, a
substantial working capital injection and the acceptance of liability for
Dolphin Outdoor's debts.
Mills &amp; Allen added that the market had developed significantly in recent
years. Mr Santini argued that nationwide 48-sheet poster companies now faced
more competition within the outdoor market, for example from strong regional
contractors and the widespread, though smaller, illuminated boards.
Mr Santini also said that the outdoor advertising industry now needed large,
nationwide poster companies which could provide a complete marketing service
to compete with other media.
Mills &amp; Allen had lead efforts to develop the industry, he said, investing
about Pounds 700,000 this year in such innovations as its 'Twins' campaigns,
where a pair of advertisements are run on adjacent billboards and the
computer mapping of poster sites.
What view the industry, and the OFT, eventually takes of the Dolphin
acquisition will depend upon its finer details, which have yet to emerge.
However Mills &amp; Allen has sought to pre-empt widespread criticism, by
writing to concerned parties, explaining its strategy and what it sees as
future opportunities for the industry. Moreover, Mills &amp; Allen was 'prepared
to give undertakings,' to advertisers, said Mr Santini.

IAN AND Diana Sykes are beginning to rue the day five years ago when they
bought the 12-bedroom Swan House country house hotel two-and-a-half miles
outside Stratford-on-Avon.
'It seemed a good idea at the time,' recalls 30-year-old Mr Sykes. 'Everyone
wanted to stay in a hotel in the country and the banks were only too willing
to lend us money to renovate the house from top to bottom.'
But the dream has turned sour. High interest rates, fewer Americans visitors
because of the weak dollar and Gulf crisis, and a dearth of weekenders
willing to enjoy short-breaks in the countryside has left the Sykes
desperately trying to sell up.
Two years ago their hotel was valued at Pounds 1m, but after several months
on the market at Pounds 700,000 Mr Sykes is contemplating a further price
cut to tempt buyers.
'It looks as if we shall have to sell our boat and our house if things don't
pick up soon,' he says.
The Sykes are not alone in their dilemma. Over 100 country house hotels are
estimated to have been put into receivership so far this year as a result of
the recession and slump in tourism. Many of these forced sales represent the
end of their owners' dreams.
'It was relatively easy for people in the 1980s to sell their town house and
buy a country hotel property and think they could become hoteliers as simply
as that,' says Mr Bruce Williamson, chief executive of Druce Hotels and
Leisure, the property agency which specialises in country houses.
'But the reality of the recession has brought home to many that it is not as
easy as it looks to survive the bad times as well as good,' he adds.
The slump in the country house hotel market is but a microcosm of the state
of the UK hotel industry in general. After years when the most pressing
concern for many British hoteliers was simply finding the best sites for
hotels to meet the burgeoning leisure and business demand, the downturn this
year has hit hard.
During the early part of this year, UK hotels - especially those in London -
saw their occupancy drop to their lowest ever level: down to 20 per cent in
many cases. Newly-opened hotels such as the refurbished Dorchester in Park
Lane were said to be hit even harder. Since then, both business and leisure
travel has picked up substantially, to about 60 per cent on average
occupancy in UK hotels.
But the outlook is far from buoyant: City analysts expect at least a 20 per
cent shortfall in overseas tourist numbers to Britain this summer. While
individual business travel is returning after the clampdown during the Gulf
war, some companies have decided to maintain a tight control on travel
expenses. Conference and incentive group travel, moreover, will take several
months, if not longer, to recover judging by the experience of the last
downturn in trade during the post-Libyan bombing scares in 1986.
'Of course occupancy levels in hotels are higher than they were in January
and February,' points out Mr Jonathan Bodlender, chairman of hotel
consultants Horwath Consulting. 'But they would be expected to pick up in
March and April. The question is, how far have they still to go to reach
last year's levels: I would think quite a way.'
Britain's top two hoteliers - Trusthouse Forte and Mount Charlotte Hotels -
recently made clear the impact of the war and recession on hoteliers. THF's
pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent to Pounds 190m for the year to end-January,
while those of Mount Charlotte stayed virtually static at Pounds 47.5m in
spite of a 55 per cent increase in turnover after acquiring Thistle Hotels
last year.
Only Queens Moat Houses, the third largest UK hotels operator, appears to
have shrugged off the gloom that has afflicted its rivals - its recent
pre-tax profits figures were some 51 per cent higher at Pounds 94.09m. But
this reflected the fact some 40 per cent of its hotel stock is based on the
continent where the impact of recession has been felt less.
THF's response will be unveiled today when it announces the long-awaited
restructuring of its 350 UK hotels, creating some five 'core' brands and
possibly changing its corporate identity to simply Forte.
'We want to emphasise our strengths and make people clearly aware of what
they can expect from our hotels under each brand name,' says Mr Rocco Forte,
THF's chief executive, who refuses to confirm or deny until today the
dropping the Trusthouse part of the THF name.
Under the THF restructuring, its hotels will be brought together under three
main brands: Travelodges, Post Houses, and Crest. Other hotels which do not
fit these three categories will be rebranded under such names as Heritage
Hotels, for country house properties, or Exclusive hotels. Those that fall
into none of these five categories will be sold. THF has already earmarked
some 32 hotels for sale - expected to raise over Pounds 100m - which do not
fit its new strategy.
It is a strategy honed to perfection over the past decade by US hotel chains
such as Marriott and Hyatt as well as Holiday Inn, now owned by the Bass
brewing group.
These hotel groups have increasingly realised that hotel guests are not one
homogeneous market: not only does the business executive during the week
become the leisure traveller at weekends but both business and leisure
travellers at all time want different types of accommodation.
French group Accor has identified such niche marketing more than any other
European hotel group and now has its growth strategy firmly targetted on the
UK.
In France it operates a multi-tier strategy: Sofitel hotels aimed at the
city centre luxury market; Novotel, three-star properties sited close to
airports and motorways; Ibis, two-star hotels for families; and Formula One
 -basic accommodation with shared facilities.
'We believe that the UK market is right for a similar segmented strategy,'
says Mr William Miller, Accor's UK chairman. Already Novotel and Ibis hotels
have been opened in the UK, with basic Formula One properties to be built
shortly.
But THF's decision to segment its hotel chain may not necessarily help it
out of the industry's present doldrums. 'Branding is no panacea,' says Mr
Paul Slattery, senior hotels analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson.
'Hotels in a branded portfolio may bear a family resemblance to each other,
but they are not and cannot be clones as is the case with consumer product
brands.'
THF's new brand strategy may seem far removed from the plight of Mr and Mrs
Sykes in Stratford-on-Avon. But not all country house hoteliers are feeling
the pinch.
The Lygon Arms, part of the Savoy Group and based in the Cotswold village of
Broadway, has been virtually full up with weekenders over the past month.
A combination of aggressive marketing and improved facilities - it recently
opened a Pounds 1.5m health complex and swimming pool - has kept the guests
coming, reports Mr Kirk Ritchie, the Lygon's managing director.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Investors make waves over a sea of money: Kenneth Gooding
looks at growing impatience with Minorco, which is sitting on a Dollars
1.9bn cash hoard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTMENT community is beginning to lose patience with Minorco.
Eighteen months ago, the Luxembourg-quoted investment arm of the South
African mining house, Anglo American, promised to transform itself into a
world-class natural resources group using its Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.47bn)
war chest.
Today the cash pile still amounts to Dollars 1.9bn.
Criticisms are being aimed at the group's apparent hesitancy to put its cash
to work, particularly its failure to pick up cheap companies last year when
share prices were depressed.
The let-down is more acute because of the excitement generated by Minorco's
unsuccessful hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK. Much of
Minorco's cash came from the sale of its stake in the target company to the
Hanson conglomerate in September, 1989.
Mr Rob Davies, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, reflects a widespread
view when he says: 'We continue to have doubts about the ability of the
management to make acquisitions and to run operations successfully.'
Minorco's institutional investors are mainly in South Africa. Most UK
institutions are not interested. They have been put off by Minorco's South
African parentage and Luxembourg quote, in addition to the management's
performance.
One UK fund manager typified the prevailing lethargy when he said: 'I think
we still hold a few Minorco shares for tax reasons. But it wouldn't trouble
me if we didn't have them.'
Mr Tony Lea, one of the three 'young Turks' who, with Sir Michael Edwardes,
led the disastrous attack on Gold Fields, agrees that 'the jury must be out
until we are fully invested and people can see what this company has
become'.
But Mr Lea, now joint managing director, suggests that Minorco is 'motoring
along' towards its objective.
Its most spectacular move so far was to buy Freeport McMoRan Gold in March
last year for Dollars 705m.
The cost, representing 50 times historic earnings, always looked high and a
falling gold price since has not improved the perception. Low prices and
some technical problems saw the gold company, renamed Independence Mining,
do little better than break even in the half-year to December 30.
Some analysts suggest that Minorco paid a substantial premium partly because
it wanted to prove that the US was not 'off-limits'. The Gold Fields bid
foundered because of decisions by a New York judge. Consequently, it was
widely assumed that Minorco would face a court battle about its South
African parentage any time it attempted to buy in the US.
If Minorco had taken over Gold Fields, it intended to keep the North
American gold interests and the UK group's ARC aggregates operations.
In March Minorco broke into the aggregates market by agreeing to buy for
DM178m (Pounds 59.9m) Elbekies Muhlberg in what used to be east Germany,
together with the rights to 230m tonnes of sand and gravel on the River
Elbe.
Again, the price looks high. But Mr Roger Phillimore, Minorco's other joint
managing director, points out that research convinced the group that 'you
can make a lot of money from aggregates if you get the costs right'.
Minorco aims to be a big player in Europe 'so that we can play in a bigger
game - in joint ventures with other major companies, for example . . . East
Germany gave us the opportunity to get big very quickly - but with some
risk. It is a super asset, but we might have a rough time for a while
waiting for demand to come right.'
Another recent deal did not exactly fit the main strategic thrust. Minorco
paid Dollars 30m for 81 per cent of the loss-making Beralt Tin &amp; Wolfram in
Portugal, which operates Europe's only wolfram mine. This move was widely
seen as Anglo American reshuffling assets because the seller was Charter
Consolidated, a 36 per cent-owned associate of Minorco. But Mr Phillimore
insists the deal had strategic implications. It gives Minorco a foothold on
the Iberian Peninsula, which promises to become a highly active mining
region.
Minorco also intends to acquire a world-class base metals business. The
group already has a stake in base metals through its 56 per cent-owned
subsidiary, Inspiration Resources, which owns Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
in Canada. Inspiration Resources is being reorganised by selling or closing
down all non-core assets, leaving just the Terra agricultural business in
the US and the Hudson Bay (Hudbay) group.
Analysts suggest this leaves the way clear for Terra to be sold and for
Minorco to take control of Hudbay. This company must invest CDollars 185m
(USDollars 160.8m) , including CDollars 50m on its smelter, to meet
stringent Canadian anti-pollution measures due to be introduced in 1994.
Inspiration would be hard pressed to finance the Hudbay project but Minorco
could afford it. 'We are paying a great deal of attention to Hudbay. There
is a big challenge there,' says Mr Lea. 'But Hudbay is not world class, by
any stretch of the imagination. And we want a world-class base metals
business.'
Changes at Inspiration Resources illustrate Minorco's approach to its
investments. Mr Phillimore says Minorco still intends either to take control
of assets or sell them off - 'but in our own time'.
'While we are waiting, we have been encouraging those assets to perform
better and become more valuable. We have encouraged them to focus on the
businesses they do best.'
Apart from Inspiration and Charter Consolidated, the quoted investments also
include Adobe Resources, a US oil and gas producer (49 per cent owned) and
Engelhard Corporation, a US speciality chemicals and precious metals group
(30 per cent).
Full control of Charter, however, would probably be politically impossible
unless Minorco sheds its Engelhard stake. Charter owns 38 per cent of
Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group and
Engelhard's main competitor.
US anti-trust legislators would not countenance both these important
platinum marketeers being under the direct influence of Minorco and, thus,
Anglo American, which is a big platinum producer.
Meanwhile, interest on Minorco's cash hoard is providing about 80 per cent
of its net earnings which totalled Dollars 58m in the first half of the
current financial year and Dollars 784.4m in the previous 12 months.
The share price has languished at a discount to net asset value of between
20 and 30 per cent.
Why not simply give the money back to the shareholders? Mr Phillimore laughs
and says: 'That would require a degree of humility we don't have.'

FT  08 MAY 91 / Smurfit upbeat despite 30% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEFFERSON SMURFIT Group, the paper and packaging company which accounts for
about one-sixth of the Irish stock market's capitalisation, yesterday
reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits, but a slight increase in earnings
per share.
The results were affected by the restructuring of Jefferson Smurfit's US
operations and the general downturn in the paper industry.
Mr Dermot Smurfit, joint deputy chairman, said the rise in diluted earnings
per share from 51p to 52p was an impressive achievement when set against the
troubles elsewhere in the paper industry.
'We think it's a big deal,' he said. 'We think Jefferson Smurfit is the only
major paper company in the world that has increased its earnings per share
this year.'
During the year to January 31, Jefferson Smurfit saw pre-tax profits fall
almost 30 per cent from IPounds 245.52m (Pounds 225.25) to IPounds 173.12m.
Sales were also sharply down at IPounds 992.6m (IPounds 1.66bn).
These declines, however, largely reflected the recapitalisation of Jefferson
Smurfit's US operations in December 1989. This resulted in the US arm,
JSC/CCA, being treated as a related company rather than a subsidiary.
The recapitalisation gave Jefferson Smurfit Dollars 1bn cash, which
transformed the company's borrowings position.
At the end of last year, the group had a cash pile of IPounds 854.35m set
against borrowings of IPounds 547.55m. Jefferson Smurfit received interest
of IPounds 26.1m last year, compared with the IPounds 31.91m paid out the
year before.
Tax payments also fell sharply from IPounds 101.51m to IPounds 41.78m.
Mr Smurfit said the company was still considering how it might best use its
cash.
'But we have nothing huge in the pot at the moment,' he said.
Jefferson Smurfit's capital expenditure last year was IPounds 133m last
year. The group made acquisitions worth IPounds 196m.
The company has aimed its expansion towards continental Europe, which now
accounts for 34 per cent of the group's consolidated sales.
The US operations are still suffering from the downturn in the industry.
JSC/CCA lost about Dollars 13m (Pounds 7.6m) in the first quarter.
'But we should be looking for some significant bump-up in terms of pricing
in the third and fourth quarters this year,' Mr Smurfit said.
The board has recommended a final dividend of 3.48p, which will bring the
total to 5.053p (4.7p).

FT  08 MAY 91 / Heseltine urges 'green club' for UK companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, is asking Britain's 1,000
largest companies to establish a 'green club' committed to achieving tougher
business standards for reducing pollution and producing environmentally
clean products.
He also wants them to set targets for increasing their share of the growing
worldwide market for environmental technology and pollution abatement
equipment. He was critical of management's performance in this area so far.
'What we need is - in effect - a green renaissance of Britain's economy,' he
said in the annual Shell lecture on the environment at the Royal Society of
Arts in London last night.
Mr Heseltine will today send letters to the chief executives of Britain's
1,000 largest companies seeking their 'active participation in the challenge
of the environmental decade ahead'.
He envisages them establishing a 'green club' committed to a strategy of
environmental review, target-setting and public reporting.
This would be on a voluntary basis but with the encouragement of the
Department of the Environment.
Mr Heseltine wants companies to carry out independent 'green audits' of
their environmental performance and make them public. A growing number have
such audits but are reluctant to publish them.
Separately, Mr Heseltine and Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary,
announced the appointment of an advisory committee on business and the
environment.
Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, is chairman, and
the 23 members include representatives of IBM UK, ICI, Norsk Hydro UK and
Bowater.
Mr Heseltine said he wanted a market-based approach to the environment. But
he warned: 'Where things do go wrong, sanctions and prosecutions must follow
 -the environmental equivalent of the short sharp shock'.
He feared that for all British success in this field, companies were still
winning less than 5 per cent of the available export market. 'I am sure that
part of the answer rests, as it does with other problems, in the quality of
British management,' he said.

FT  08 MAY 91 / IBM slashes prices to revive sales: Workstation makers
likely to enter price war to compete with cuts of up to 60 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer company,
yesterday slashed the prices of its computer workstations by up to 60 per
cent, a move that is expected to spark a price war throughout the computer
industry.
The cost of computer power in all segments of the market is falling. Leading
personal computer manufacturers have already announced sweeping price cuts
on their desktop and portable machines while minicomputers and mainframes
are selling at steep discounts from official list prices.
IBM's workstation price cuts are expected to prompt similar reductions by
its main rivals, Digital Equipment and Sun Microsystems, said industry
analysts.
The IBM price cuts, which range from 12 per cent to 60 per cent, follow the
introduction in March of an aggressively priced series of high performance
workstations by Hewlett-Packard.
IBM also said it was determined to be a 'price performance leader' in
workstations, one of the fastest growing segments of the computer market.
The company acknowledged in March that its workstation sales had been hurt
by the recession.
The company cut the price of one of its highest performance models, the RISC
System-6000 550 from Dollars 130,000 (Pounds 76,900) to Dollars 52,500.
This computer, introduced just six months ago, was originally sold as a
'mini-supercomputer' but IBM is now repositioning it as a technical
workstation.
IBM said it was able to reduce the prices of workstations because it had
achieved higher than expected production yields on microprocessor chips, the
devices that form the 'brains' of a computer.
The advent of very high performance microprocessors, such as the reduced
instruction set computing (RISC) devices used in IBM's workstations, 'has
turned hardware computer economics upside down', said Mr Steven Milunovich
of Salomon Brothers.
The impact of these semiconductor devices on the cost of computer power
would not stop at desktop systems, he predicted. 'Multiprocessor systems
will directly threaten mainframes and minicomputers,' he said.
While computer users can look forward to lower prices and higher
performance, manufacturers now face lower profit margins on hardware and
many companies are now forced to emphasise the software and service segments
of their business.
Advances in semiconductor technology are also affecting the market for the
very fastest 'supercomputers'. Convex Computer yesterday launched a series
of computers based on gallium arsenide semiconductors, which offer higher
performance than conventional silicon-based chips.

FT  08 MAY 91 / G7 members consult about asking Gorbachev to summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET President Mikhail Gorbachev may attend the forthcoming economic
summit of the world's seven leading industrial nations in London if
consultations among them lead to a decision to invite him.
The possibility of inviting Mr Gorbachev as an observer to the G7 summit,
due to be held from July 15-17, was first mooted by Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
the former prime minister, at the previous summit of G7 leaders in Houston,
Texas, last year. It was decided then to leave the question open until
nearer the date.
Mr Gorbachev's presence would give him the opportunity to try to persuade
the participants - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada
 -that he is going ahead with his economic reform programme, in spite of all
the indications that it has foundered.
The final communique after the Houston summit stated that the Soviet Union
would stand a better chance of receiving western economic assistance if it
introduced a genuine market economic system.
Though it would be for Mr John Major, as prime minister of the host nation,
to issue an invitation for July, he could do so only if all his partners
agreed to such a step. No decision to this effect has yet been taken,
British officials said yesterday.
In Moscow Mr Vitaly Ignatenko, the president's spokesman, said Mr Gorbachev
would consider going if he was invited. Moscow has made it clear that it is
extremely anxious to persuade western businesses to invest in the Soviet
Union and has been disappointed with the response, particularly from British
companies. One of the main Soviet complaints has been that some western
governments will not provide the financial guarantees which would give
companies worried by Soviet the present climate of instability, in the
Soviet Union, the confidence to do business there.
The US in particular has been cool to increasing economic co-operation with
the Soviet Union because the demands of the Baltic states for independence
or greater autonomy have not been granted.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Polly Peck aims to avoid break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International are to submit proposals to
continue operating the bulk of the fresh-fruit-to-electronics group as a
single entity at the long-awaited creditors' meeting later this month.
But they will propose selling certain 'non-essential affiliates' and, 'if
possible', existing investments in northern Cyprus and Turkey.
This seems to suggest that the administrators, who were appointed last
November, will try to soldier on without disposing of either Del Monte or
Sansui, Polly Peck's two flagship subsidiaries.
The summary proposals emerged from the text of a full-page advertisement,
aimed at the group's bondholders, which is being carried in today's Swiss
press.
A full list of proposals, together with a 20-page administrators' report,
should reach the group's approximately 100 banking and 28,000 commercial
creditors later today.
The proposals will be submitted to creditors in the form of a single
resolution on May 24.
Polly Peck has extensive fruit, electronics, leisure and packaging interests
in the Near and Middle East, which in 1989 contributed more than two-thirds
of the group's Pounds 161.4m in reported pre-tax profits.
However, administrators have been frustrated in their efforts to build up a
full financial picture of the group's activities in the region, and in
particular to track down interests worth Pounds 200m which the company said
were located in northern Cyprus.
It is not specified in the summary proposals which of the assets they
propose to sell. In March they said they hoped to float the Turkish and
Cypriot leisure subsidiaries on the Istanbul stock exchange.
The May 24 meeting will also see the appointment of a five-member creditors'
committee and a 10-member secondary committee. However, the latter will have
no formal powers.
The new proposals have been made public in the wake of a concerted and
puzzling buying spree of Polly Peck shares.
The buying spate has extended to Zurich, where Polly Peck is still quoted;
in London, the shares were suspended last September at 108p.
Mr Asil Nadir, the group's Turkish Cypriot chairman, has said that he knows
nothing about the buying spree.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Leading Article: An agenda for Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YUGOSLAVIA is in civil war. This is what the country's defence minister,
General Veljko Kadijevic, said on Monday. Tragically, his words are unlikely
to jolt the country out of the wretched cycle of ethnic hatred, violence and
unreason. Revenge, driven by historical grievances, cultural differences,
and nationalist-inspired political aspirations, hangs in the air between
Serbs and Croats, the country's two largest ethnic groups.
It is difficult to channel these animosities into the country's fragile
democratic institutions, or place them on the political agenda. That agenda
is no longer shaped by the collective presidency, which consists of
delegates from the six republics and two provinces. Instead, it is being
increasingly set by the federal army and armed Serb and Croat nationalists.
The federal army is determined to prevent nationalist mobs from controlling
the political agenda. Last week, it was sent in to prevent further bloodshed
between Croats and Serbs, after Serb militants killed 13 Croat policemen.
But Croats, under their president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, believe the military
is a Serbian-dominated army of occupation, intent on blocking Croatia's
quest for independence from the federation. That is why thousands of Croat
nationalists attacked an army base last Monday. The army's role, however, is
more complicated.
The defence minister realises that the collective presidency is unable to
agree on a peaceful political solution to Yugoslavia's crisis, or support
Prime Minister Ante Markovic's economic reforms. The crisis hinges on one
crucial disagreement between the six republics: should Yugoslavia continue
to exist within the present federal structures, or evolve into a loose
confederation of autonomous states?
Power vacuum
The paralysis of the presidency over this issue has created a power vacuum,
which paramilitary nationalist groups in the republics have tried to fill.
The army now believes the imposition of a state of emergency is one of the
few options available to break that paralysis, restore stability, and set a
new agenda.
Martial law will not win Yugoslavia many friends among western governments,
which, for their part, too often hesitated in linking economic aid with
respect for human rights and a market economy. But it could allow the army,
western governments and Yugoslavia's federal government an opportunity to
create a political environment aimed at encouraging the country's leadership
to establish an agenda for the future.
Army's role
The army's role in this agenda should be clear. It should immediately disarm
all paramilitary groups, regardless of their ethnic background. Once order
has been restored, it should withdraw to the barracks and the initiative by
Mr Alois Mock, Austria's foreign minister, to set up a group of European
'wise men', should be pursued. This group should include, besides
Yugoslavia's leaders and its neighbours, delegates from the European
Community and the G24, who are, after all, Yugoslavia's main creditors.
They should proceed to set an agenda for Yugoslavia continuing, not as a
unitary, federal state, but as a confederation of autonomous states within
their present borders. The republics should have no illusions about Europe's
intentions vis-a-vis Yugoslavia. The time has not yet come to place a
re-drawing of Yugoslavia's internal borders on the agenda; it would have
unbelievably unstable consequences for relations among the republics and for
the Balkan peninsula.
Furthermore, participants in the 'round table' negotiations should insist
that any future financial assistance, and Yugoslavia's aspirations for a
closer relationship with the EC, hinge on the foundations of democratic
institutions, respect for human rights, and a fully-fledged market economy.
Yugoslavia's leaders, with the exception of the prime minister and the army,
may baulk at such interference. But time spent viewing Yugoslavia from the
comfort of the sidelines has come to an end.

Last week a Belgian air force C130 transport aircraft, the only one making

war-torn Somalia, was transferred to the Kurdish relief effort.
It was a cruel illustration of the marginalisation of sub-Saharan Africa in
a world starting to tire of Africa's plight, even before competing demands
for attention and resources came from eastern Europe, Kuwait and Iraq, and
now Bangladesh.
For every Kurdish refugee facing cold and starvation in Iraq, Iran and
Turkey there are at least 15 Africans fighting famine in the
drought-devastated lands of Africa.
From Liberia to Mozambique, nearly 30m Africans are estimated to be at risk
from starvation. Thousands are dying. The final toll threatens to overtake
Ethiopia's losses of up to 1m people in the 1984-85 famine, which prompted
Bob Geldof's unprecedented fund-raising drive, Band Aid.
It is, say aid workers, the biggest disaster to threaten sub-Saharan Africa,
already debilitated by decades of conflict and mismanagement, and burdened
with a Dollars 161bn external debt it cannot repay.
Could the suffering have been avoided? Or is Africa doomed to unending
crises requiring the world's intervention?
The answer to the first question is a qualified yes, particularly if the
United Nations and the west had been prepared to play as assertive a role in
Africa as they are now in Iraq. While if current peace efforts succeed, an
end could be in sight to at least some of the civil wars which are at the
heart of Africa's agony.
For the first time governments and rebel movements are starting seriously to
look for solutions at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield. A
combination of war weariness, the superpower rapprochement that is bringing
an end to fighting by proxy, and a surge of support across the continent for
multi-party systems, has helped create a climate for talks.
Last week rival parties initialled a settlement of Angola's 16-year-old
conflict; this week the Mozambique government and the rebel Renamo movement
resume peace talks; US and Soviet officials, once bitter rivals in the Horn
of Africa, are currently playing a leading role in efforts to end civil wars
in Ethiopia.
But success will come too late for hundreds of thousands caught up in a
long-predicted catastrophe. Since last September it has been well known that
a serious drought and crop failure was looming across Africa.
African regimes bear much of the responsibility for the suffering of their
people. Dictatorships and uncaring rebel groups, blinded by pride and a lust
for power, have prepared the ground for the crisis, while war then made a
successful relief effort impossible. Inappropriate agricultural and economic
policies, corruption, diversion of resources and personnel to the war
effort, have all exacerbated the natural disaster of drought.
But outsiders also share the blame for the human catastrophe. Inadequate
aid, frustration at a continent where disaster seems never-ending, and
putting political considerations above humanitarian obligations have all
compounded the crisis.
US patronage of corrupt and authoritarian regimes such as Liberia and
Somalia has been matched by Soviet support for Ethiopia, while Angola
suffered under the attention of both superpowers.
But wherever the responsibility lies, the world's humanitarian response has
been inadequate. Aid workers lay part of the blame on competing demands both
on media attention as well as donors' pockets.
But 'aid fatigue' is only part of the problem. If any lesson is to be
learned from this crisis, say aid workers, it involves a fundamental
reassessment of how the international community deals with African regimes
which put a president's power ahead of his people's welfare.
Two crucial questions arise, aid workers and diplomats maintain. Does the
world place political considerations ahead of the delivery of humanitarian
assistance - judging, for example, that aid would simply extend the life of
a repugnant regime? And how far should the international community go in
overriding a nation's sovereignty when its government has demonstrated it is
incapable of feeding its own people.
The cases of two famine-hit African states leaves opinion divided.
In Sudan aid workers are battling to deliver food to 7m people facing
starvation. Even with help from the government, reaching most of the people
would have been a Herculean task. Roads are poor, the railways and ports
inefficient, and the transport fleet is dilapidated.
But help has not been forthcoming. Since last September, donors have had to
deal with an extremist Islamic government, with a notorious human rights
record, and which belatedly appealed for help too late to avert loss of
life.
Khartoum consistently underplayed the disaster as a 'mere food gap',
harassed aid agencies and denied them travel permits, and labelled talk of
famine an attempt to undermine the government.
Complex negotiations about the mechanics of the relief operation -
particularly who would distribute the food and how much would go to the
rebel-held south - seriously delayed the delivery of food, now beginning to
trickle in.
Many aid workers are now asking a painful question: 'Should we save 500,000
Sudanese people this year, and give the government another five years of
power, where every year there will be another disaster?' said one senior UN
official. 'Or should we let them die and hope to get rid of the government?
Which is the better in the long term?'
Mr Kosti Manibe, deputy general secretary of the Sudan Council of Churches,
strongly disagrees with this hard-headed stance: 'That is immoral and it may
not achieve its purposes.
'The whole question of sovereignty needs to be addressed for Sudan as in
Iraq,' he said. 'If a regime has proved absolutely intransigent, has used
food as a political weapon, and is incapable of feeding its own people, the
option of the international community should not be abdication and
indifference, but intervention. The precedent set in Iraq should be applied
to Africa, where the situation is more grave.'
The world community, however, shows no sign of treating the action to save
the Kurds as a precedent.
In Somalia, scene of continued warfare between the country's main clans,
relief efforts are almost non-existent despite a growing shortage of food
and medicine.
When the civil war engulfed the capital in late December, the UN, western
governments and all but one of the aid agencies evacuated their personnel.
The absence of a relief effort to date is a sign that the international
community's patience has been exhausted by the continued bloody fighting and
the lack of a political settlement between the warring parties.
'Frankly the security situation precludes any on-the-ground American
official presence,' said Mr Jack Davison, director of the US State
Department's Office for East African Affairs.
Dr Husein Mursal, the Mogadishu director of the Save the Children fund,
disagrees. 'Something could have been done in Somalia in the last four
months,' he says. 'If they were worried about the security of UN personnel
they could have employed Somalis. At least they could have organised an
airdrop of bandaging material and essential drugs to combat measles, malaria
and tetanus.'
Dr Mursal claims that Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, has been
'sitting on millions of dollars, waiting to act. By the time they come in
everybody will be dead.'
Yet the issue of sovereignty versus what many see as a moral obligation to
mount a humanitarian effort is complex. 'The problem since the overthrow of
(former President) Barre is that the country has divided into three
factions,' says Mr Fred Eckhart, a UN spokesman: 'For the UN to deal with
any one of these factions would imply political support from the UN, or
international recognition.'
'You can't do business like that in Africa,' replies Mr Abdul Mohammed, an
expert of relief in the Horn of Africa, arguing that the realities on the
ground make contact essential.
Further, he argues that the Kurdish relief operation has undermined the
whole concept that aid operations must respect sovereignty and require the
consent of the recipient country's government. 'But in Africa, where there
is a greater disaster, the UN still behaves as the last hide-out of
sovereignty . . . manipulated and paralysed by regimes which have no
legitimacy or respect from their own people.
'The UN's instinctive reaction to crisis is to evacuate. People are dying
and the niceties of international politics should be meaningless to an
organisation which is supposed to respond quickly to humanitarian needs.'
While no end is in sight to the war in Somalia, Angola's example
demonstrates that seemingly intractable conflicts offer hope for peace in
Africa and an important prospective role for the international community.
Last week the MPLA government, led by President Eduardo dos Santos, and Dr
Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebel movement initialled an agreement paving the way
for a ceasefire and multi-party elections in 18 months. Essential to the
agreements are provision for international monitoring of the process.
Yet questions about the level of support the outside world will provide have
elicited a cautious response from western diplomats. Even without massive
assistance, however, in the form of thousands of monitoring personnel, the
transition process will be under acute strain. Without outside help, it may
well fail.
If the west and the UN are really serious, say an increasing number of
Africa's diplomats and politicians, they should play a prominent mediating
role in other African conflicts. Outsiders cannot impose solutions,
officials say, but they can play a part ranging from honest brokers to
neutral monitors of ceasefires and elections.
A negotiated settlement to Africa's wars, they argue, goes to the heart of
an anti-famine strategy.
At the same time, the recovery efforts for the rest of the continent, where
most governments are implementing economic reform programmes, must be backed
by a combination of debt relief and new resources.
These resources should be tied - as many African governments now accept - to
what the World Bank calls 'better governance' - the introduction of
democracy and accountability.
Proposals designed to head off disaster generally meet a sceptical response.
Strategic food stockpiles in Africa are difficult to maintain and prone to
abuse.
African diplomats acknowledge that all this may be expecting too much from
the west - though pointing out that the UN-endorsed mobilisation for the
Gulf war and the Kurdish relief effort have shown what can be done if the
political will exists.
But the alternative, they warn, is grim. The cost of inaction in Africa will
not simply be more famines and more African governments imploding, ceasing
to exist as nation states, as in the case of Somalia and Liberia.
It will be an unhealthy Africa, they argue, which ultimately means an
unhealthy world. Environmental damage on the continent, further migration
into southern Europe from north Africa, the spread of Aids, all have
potentially disastrous implications, albeit some years away, for the rest of
the world.
'It may well be,' said one participant at a recent gathering of aid
officials and politicians, 'that only when the west fears for the welfare of
its own next generation will it be sufficiently motivated to address
Africa's disaster.'

London headhunter John Courtis has been seeking suggestions for a better

Instead of producing a substitute, however, his contacts have come up with a

Outhouse - counselling firm's office.
Outpatient - someone sacked but stoical.

It must be a buy signal. Rob Weinberg, James Capel's gold mining guru and
number one in the Extel survey, is out of the door with no job to go to.
Along with the departure of Tom Butler, author of Samuel Montagu's respected
bullion review, Rhona O'Connell (ex-Shearson) and Mike Coulson (ex-County
NatWest), it means that London's role as a centre of research into the
yellow metal has just about disappeared.
Andy Smith of UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew is the last rated Extel analyst still
studying gold, and since Swiss banks are more interested in the stuff than
most, his job is probably safe for the moment. Research activity seems to be
gravitating towards the gold-producing countries of North America and
Australia.
With the prospect of South Africa being welcomed back into the international
business community, it all seems rather short sighted. London is still the
most active gold market, the main international clearing centre, and has a
central bank which understands gold. It badly needs someone to plug the
research gap.
If RTZ, the world's biggest mining finance house, will not take up the
golden research ball dropped by Hanson's Consolidated Gold Fields, perhaps
the London Bullion Market Association should.

There are too many places to have a pint in Ireland. The Irish Vintners
Federation says the proliferation of pubs in the country is causing many
landlords serious hardship. In County Cavan, one village has 11 bars -
chasing the business of only 100 drinkers. In Ballaghaderreen in County
Roscommon there are 32 bars, a hotel and an off-licence for a population of
only 1,400.
The vintners say there should be fewer pubs, but longer opening hours to
cater for those with long thirsts.

If Yve Newbold, Hanson's company secretary, is good enough to sit on the

place on the inbred male board of Hanson - a company half BT's size? After
all, it could do with some beefing up.
Like all good lawyers, the 50-year-old Mrs Newbold knows how to duck that
question. She admits she wouldn't mind a seat on the Hanson board, but as
company secretary she sits in on all the meetings that matter.
Clearly, she isn't just your ordinary tame company secretary. A governor of
London business school, she has shot up the legal ladder at IBM, Xerox, Walt
Disney and since 1986 Hanson, besides rearing a sizeable family.
'If the 1980s was the age of the yuppie, the 1990s will be the age of women
in management,' she predicts. And while there may not be many female finance
directors at present, just look at who is winning the top accountancy
prizes. 'It is scary' - for men that is.
One senses that Mrs Newbold will not be spending the next decade with Hanson
unless their elderly lordships loosen up a bit.

Dreams, unlike razors, cannot be sold cheap. That's the lesson perfume
connoisseurs are drawing from the decision by Bic - the French
throwaway-lighters, razors and ball-pen specialist - to ditch its latest
disposable gadget, the ultra-cheap perfume.
Baron Marcel Bich, the company's 76-year-old chairman and founder, launched
his range of quick-shot perfumes three years ago in an attempt to repeat the
success of his other products by democratising posh scents. The four Bic
perfumes, at FFr20 to FFr25 for a plain glass phial in your local
supermarket, allowed women - and men - to buy a whiff of class for less than
a book of metro tickets. 'Puts Paris in your pocket,' was Bic's US
advertising slogan.
However, the idea failed to live up to Bic's expectations. Its perfume
division continued to exude losses as sales stubbornly stagnated despite
heavy advertising. After a final attempt at a perfume relaunch, the Baron
was reluctantly obliged to throw in the sponge.
The moral of this story is that scents do not sell on mere price. What is
needed is a luxury image, ideally linked to an haute couture designer, even
if few customers can actually afford the clothes that live up to the
bouquet.
'To separate perfumes from the world of dreams - that would have been a
revolution,' concluded one sweet-smelling expert yesterday.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Questions for the car makers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE motor industry has pre-dictably huffed and puffed over a recent study
for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which finds that some cars sell in
Britain for 50 per cent more than elsewhere in the European Community.
However, the MMC should not allow the car makers to side-track its
investigation by seeking simply to discredit the study or by arguing that
the car market is so complex as to frustrate attempts at exact price
comparisons.
Almost every recent independent survey has found wide discrepancies between
car prices in the UK and on the Continent. Such an accumulation of evidence
cannot just be dismissed as flawed or irrelevant. The onus is now on the
industry to demonstrate conclusively that substantial price differences do
not exist, or that they are due entirely to normal business costs. That
obligation is all the greater because UK and EC policies have long afforded
the industry special privileges. The MMC - and British consumers - need to
be satisfied that these are not being abused to distort competition.
The most obvious privilege is the block exemption of car distribution from
EC competition rules, which authorises manufacturers to sell exclusively
through designated dealers. Though the UK would need to seek European
Commission approval for any changes, the MMC findings are likely to carry
weight in Brussels, which is conducting its own review of the scheme.
Doubly dubious
The exemption was granted in response to industry arguments that cars
require expert maintenance which can only be assured if dealers enjoy
adequate profit margins and are answerable to manufacturers. But such
assertions are doubly dubious, given the reliability of modern cars and the
poor quality of much car servicing in the UK. Surveys by the Consumers'
Association have found standards to be no higher at franchised dealers than
at independent garages.
Nor have car makers themselves hesitated to bypass dealers when it suited
them. A recent study by the Retail Motor Industry Federation found that
about a fifth of all UK car sales were made directly to fleet buyers.
Discounts ranged up to 40 per cent - far higher than those offered to
individuals. The federation concludes that business users are being
subsidised by private buyers, who are denied the advantages of bulk
purchasing by the block exemption.
The distortion has been aggravated by tax concessions on company cars, which
have concentrated buying power in the hands of fleet operators. There is
also evidence that the scheme has restricted consumer choice. Mr Paul Tosch,
chairman of Vauxhall, acknowledged as much when he said last week that if
company car users had to pay for their vehicles themselves, they would buy
far more models from abroad. In effect, the scheme is a non-tariff barrier.
In the interests of a competitive market, the sooner the government removes
any residual subsidy to company cars, the better.
Third privilege
The third privilege enjoyed by the car industry is the 'gentleman's
agreement' limiting Japanese imports into the UK. The MMC has already
identified the restriction as a 'complex monopoly' but has yet to decide
whether it is harming consumers. However, a study for the National Consumer
Council has estimated that it adds as much as Pounds 2,000 to the price of
imported Japanese cars.
In any event, the 16-year-old restriction has long since outlived its
original purpose of sheltering the UK-owned car industry. It is curious, to
say the least, that a government which has so vigorously attacked trade
barriers in other fields should have continued to smile on this
protectionist relic. It is odder still that Whitehall is ready to have the
arrangement enshrined in the EC's planned restraints on Japanese cars.
The government showed courage in exposing the car industry to MMC scrutiny.
It needs to be prepared for the possibility that a really searching
investigation will uncover restrictive practices and market distortions
which will require as much firmness of purpose to eradicate.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Management: Why Chapter 11 does not tell quite the whole
story - Nikki Tait assesses the pros and cons of sending in the cavalry to
corporate casualties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a cold winter morning, the rust-belt town of Erie goes quietly about its
business. Only the local court seems abnormally active as flurries of
besuited lawyers hurtle up its steps.
Inside, a marathon session is getting under way. During the next 12 hours,
Judge Warren Bentz will hear how Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the nation's ninth
largest steelmaker, plans to haul itself out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings. He will snap at lawyers who raise long-winded objections to a
package agreed between the company, its workers and major creditors. He will
return for an unscheduled weekend sitting. And finally, several weeks later,
he will sign an order which returns the company to the land of the living
after five and a half years in corporate purgatory.
This unwieldy, yet ultimately effective, proceeding could only occur in the
US. Had Wheeling-Pittsburgh been a British company, it would almost
certainly have gone into receivership in 1985, when slumping demand for
steel coupled with heavy debts taken on to fund modernisation crippled its
finances. Assets would have been sold off and the proceeds given to
creditors.
In the US, by contrast, the notion that corporate casualties should be
rehabilitated is deeply ingrained. As one bankruptcy lawyer puts it: 'Our
founding fathers wanted to start a new life, and that attitude is still at
the heart of the legislation.' Even the American Constitution makes
reference to bankruptcy laws.
Accordingly, the 'Chapter 11' process has developed. In essence, this allows
an ailing company to ask the courts for protection from its creditors while
it reorganises its affairs. If granted, such protection prevents a company's
assets being seized; allows a debtor to suspend certain interest and debt
repayments; permits the debtor to cancel certain contracts; and means that
suits against the debtor can only be pursued as a claim through the courts.
Creditors, meanwhile, organise their own 'committees', which in turn gain
access to information about the company's finances. The aim is to negotiate
an agreement which either repays creditors (in part or in full), or gives
them some stake in a revitalised company.
To UK eyes, this arrangement is usually viewed with envy; earlier this year,
for example, critics of the ILG collapse have claimed that the travel
company's demise was needlessly swift. Indeed, in the last overhaul of UK
bankruptcy legislation, the 1985 Insolvency Act introduced an
'administration' procedure modelled on Chapter 11, although its successful
use has been limited.
But from a US perspective, matters are not so simple. Thanks to the
corporate leveraging rife in the 1980s and to the recessionary climate of
the 1990s, bankruptcy has been a growth industry. Coupled with the demise of
the takeover business, top law firms - like Skadden, Arps - have been
beefing up their presence in this area.
So what are the pluses and minuses of the process? On the first score,
Chapter 11 can obviously work - preserving jobs, manufacturing capacity and
so on. Wheeling-Pittsburgh is a good example. Today, the company still
employs over 6,000 people, has annual sales of around Dollars 1bn, and
forecast profits of Dollars 32.5m after-tax for 1991 - although, given the
present climate in the steel industry, analysts' expectations are
significantly lower. Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, have been repaid 71
cents in the dollar.
True, the company sold off major facilities in Monessen, a small steel
community outside Pittsburgh, while in Chapter 11. Although these operations
were largely acquired by other steel manufacturers, the town wears a
depressed air.
But Wheeling-Pittsburgh itself boasts a newly-modernised facility at
Steubenville on the Ohio-West Virginia border, and has generally adjusted
production to higher value-added items. That, suggests Leonard Wise, who
chaired the company through the final throes of the Chapter 11 process,
could only be done under its protection. 'The cost of terminating Monessen
would have lead to defaults on existing debt anyway,' he says.
More generally, figures for the success rate of the process are hard to come
by. According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the financial information group, around
60,000 companies failed last year and about one-fifth entered Chapter 11,
but it does not track subsequent performance.
Academic studies are limited in their scope. One, conducted at Tulane
University, New Orleans, looked at American or New York Stock Exchange
companies which went bankrupt between 1979 and 1986, and had their cases
handled in seven major jurisdictions. There were 51 filings altogether, and
by mid-1989, 30 companies had been rehabilitated.
Chapter 11 is time-consuming and costly. Periods spent under this protection
vary enormously from company to company, but Wheeling's 69-month sojourn is
by no means a record. The Tulane study, for example, suggested that the
average time taken by the 30 firms to reorganise was two and a half years
and the longest over eight years.
This means that the direct costs attached to the process can mount and eat
into the debtor's estate.
It only takes a brief visit to a bankruptcy court to see why. At the first
Pan Am bankruptcy hearing, for example, at least five airlines were
represented. So were suppliers and lessors, like GE Capital. So were
government agencies, such as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. So
were unions, ranging from the airline pilots to the Teamsters.
Most of these organisations employed outside counsel and, as lawyers
announced their credentials, the packed courtroom listened to a roll-call of
New York's most prestigious law firms.
Generalising about costs - even if the indirect impact on the business of a
bankruptcy filing is ignored - is difficult. However, at least one study has
suggested that the direct expense of an 'average' Chapter 11 proceeding may
be ten times that of a debt restructuring conducted outside the courtroom.
Judges, aware of this criticism, have made some moves to cut back fees. Last
month, for example, a judge in the complex Southmark bankruptcy case chipped
Dollars 3m off the Dollars 54.2m demanded for work in the year-long
proceedings.
There is also much debate over whether, and how, the process can be
shortened. One major bone of contention is a provision which gives a debtor
the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganisation for the first 120
days after a Chapter 11 filing. 'Exclusivity' can also be extended - and, in
the case of the Manville bankruptcy, the debtor succeeded in doing so ten
times. Only when this period ends can other parties make suggestions. Many
lawyers argue that a more restricted period of exclusivity would accelerate,
and enhance, the process.
But in reality, it is often down to a judge - like the one who dealt with
Wheeling - to keep matters on track. This can lead to some brutal bullying.
As claims in the Drexel bankruptcy rose to a ludicrous Dollars 20bn-plus,
for example, Judge Milton Pollack threatened to liquidate the investment
bank unless the lawyers pared their claims.
But here a second concern comes into play - namely, the extent of the
judge's discretion. Although the aim is a negotiated settlement, it is often
up to the judge to maintain the balance between debtor's and creditors'
interests.
This is no easy task, and a suspicion that courts bend towards the debtor is
widespread. The point was made forcibly in the case of Eastern Airlines.
Back in November, creditors were sufficiently alarmed at the rate of losses
made by the bankrupt carrier, to suggest that it should should be forced
into liquidation before all their money was lost. The judge decided
otherwise (supporting Eastern's management), but three months later, the
carrier grounded its fleet anyway. That decision may have cost the creditors
Dollars 135m.
Another difficult area concerns the extent to which claims can/should be
traded. At present, the situation is relatively permissive, and in practice
trade claims, as well as publicly quoted stocks, change hands. On the one
hand, this introduces practised 'bankruptcy investors' into the process. On
the other, it raises the question of how closely bankruptcies should be
monitored for possible 'insider trading'.
In Wheeling's case, for example, a group headed by New York-based
businessman, Ron LaBow, acquired most of the bank claims, making it the
principal secured creditor and, under the reorganisation scheme, the largest
single shareholder. This investor group then played a pivotal role in
pushing through a critical agreement between the company and its steel
unions.
While this may bring short-term advantages - such investors tend to be good
negotiators - it is questionable whether they always act in the long-term
interests of the company. Wheeling's 'rebirth' has been untimely in terms of
sector conditions, and Wise, a well-respected steel industry veteran, has
departed.
This leads on to the broader management question. When a company files for
Chapter 11, the incumbent directors are left in place - a clear contrast
with the UK's administration procedure, which introduces an independent
trustee.
Yet, in many cases, these are the very managers who have played a part in
the company's demise. It has been reckoned that only half the directors of a
financially distressed company are likely to stay with the business
throughout reorganisation. But the process of dislodging recalcitrant
executives often depends on the energy of the creditors' committee and the
leanings of the judge.
But perhaps the most fundamental worry about the process is that it keeps
ailing firms in business - and even offers them some additional operating
advantages. All too easily, the bankrupt company's need to chase cash flow
can produce business strategies which are detrimental to healthier
competitors.
This has been particularly noticeable in the airline industry. Eastern
Airlines, for example, drove down prices on some East Coast routes last
year. This, in turn, forced relatively successful rivals, like Delta, to
match such fares. Similar arguments could be made about the retail sector,
where distressed companies have exacerbated price-cutting.
At the end of the day, then, it is endlessly debatable whether the pluses of
Chapter 11 outweigh its minuses. But before European eyes glance jealously
at the American bankruptcy system, it might be wise to remember that
corporate rehabilitation does have its price.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Jobs: The problem without any clear remedy - Britain's
middle classes have been taken aback by what they saw as favourable events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW'S about this for a snapshot of the times in Britain? A reader dwelling
in west London writes: 'My regular bridge evening this week brought together
four people all in their early 40s who have held down senior positions in
areas as diverse as market research, quantity surveying, investment banking
and financial control. We have presently one further thing in common: we are
all near to or in unemployment with families to support, mortgages and in
some cases school fees to meet.'
Yes, there can no longer be any doubt about it. In redoubled, the British
middle classes are feeling the squeeze.
Unemployment, which they hitherto regarded as largely a working-class
preserve, has proved upwardly mobile. And lest the Jobs column be accused of
finding amusement in others' misfortunes, it had better be known that I'm
fairly closely affected. Of my four sons and a foster son, aged between 25
and 35, two at the older end have seen their career paths disappear, and a
third has had to take a 20 per cent cut in salary.
As too often happens, I didn't twig the reality of the development until it
struck close to home, although I had long seen it coming. For instance, it
is well over a year since I heard the first of several chiefs of large
companies confiding that he was regretfully going to take an axe to the
group's middle ranks, where it was heavily overstaffed by the standards of
competitors abroad.
In which case, since overseas readers in executive and higher specialist
work have presumably gone through the fire before, they may think I'm making
undue fuss on behalf of the newly burned Brits. But, although it may seem
like special pleading, people raised in the central layers of society on the
Continent and in America are not quite the same as their counterparts over
here.
Since at least the 12th century, when master craftsmen such as architects
began to break free of the feudal yoke and sell their services for money, we
have been differentiating ourselves from the workers. With the exception of
agricultural small-holders, individual shopowners and such, we've
traditionally shunned physical hands-on activities, being employed as
traders, august professionals and more lately managers. Indeed - probably to
a worse extent than our equivalents elsewhere - whatever we have been
educated for, it is not to make things for sale.
Now, ironically, just as the collapse of east European regimes has confirmed
our assurance that Marxism was no threat to us, we stand menaced by
influences such as market forces and computers we'd thought were on our
side. But there is clearly no point in apportioning blame, let alone in
nostalgia. The fact seems to be that more and more of us will need to find
uncustomary ways of earning our keep, which is a problem even knottier than
it may at first appear.
I say that on the evidence of a survey of an activity being taken up by many
of the managers and staff specialists ejected from companies' ranks. It is
to continue doing broadly what they did beforehand as independent
consultants.
The study has just been published by the GMS consultancy, one of 10 concerns
in Britain that act as go-betweens on such independent operators' behalf.
One stark finding is that, during 1990, the number on the books of GMS alone
rose from a bit under 2,100 to over 3,100. The minimum, maximum and average
gross earnings of the 337 thereof who took part in the survey, are shown in
the table below.
Surprisingly, says GMS - with its eyes on the overall 1.1 per cent rise in
earnings over 1989 - the market for independent consultancy has held up
well. Even so, as the table's lower lines show, conditions for different
broad specialisms have been distinctly patchy, and that is not all.
The differences between individual consultants within the same specialism
are often huge, the survey report says. Even in the averagely depressed
fields of personnel, computers and general management, the most successful
people are doing extremely well.
Indeed, in the highest growth field of engineering as well as the others, a
few such exceptional operators hoist the averages to well above the earnings
of most folk involved. A lot are hard put to make enough to live. Moreover
for them, the remedy seems unlikely to lie in the optimism shown by their
1991 forecasts even if demand for their services picks up.
For GMS says it has often met upper rankers propelled or persuaded out of
company hierarches who 'thought that a move into independent consultancy was
going to be no different than life before. So many failed to make the
grade.' Worse still, to judge by other research evidence on such matters,
not only is doing something successfully on a self-employed basis different
from doing same on someone else's payroll, but a lot of us lack what it
takes to make the change.
While the Jobs column wishes it knew of a cure for such cases, even if only
for family reasons, it simply does not. And although numerous middle-class
Brits who have been caught unprepared - including the reader quoted at the
outset - seem to be looking to government for a remedy, I cannot share their
hopes.
All I can say, which doesn't help much, is that the ruling party would be
foolish to think it can survive the upwardly mobile upheaval unscathed.
Anyone who doubts it need only read Roy Lewis's and Angus (later Lord)
Maude's The English Middle Classes, published by Penguin in 1953.
It shows that its subjects have been through upheavals before. The last came
after 1945 when they found the Labour government they'd been instrumental in
electing, was citing the national interest in imposing sacrifices on them
that the working classes were not made to share.
The eventual result, even if not morally justified, was that the Labour
party remained out of power for 13 years. What's the betting that the
Tories, who've been in it for the past dozen, will soon be doing the same?

FT  08 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: French judgment can be enforced in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister

<TEXT>
INTERDESCO SA v NULLIFIRE LTD
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Phillips:
May 1 1991
A FOREIGN judgment given in a country which is party to the 1968
Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention can be registered in the UK despite
defence allegations that it was obtained by fraud, because the English court
will not re-investigate facts decided by the foreign court and, although it
can hear fresh evidence as to fraud, it will not do so if the foreign
jurisdiction has an appropriate remedy.
Mr Justice Phillips so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendants,
Nullifire Ltd, from Master Miller's order that a judgment obtained against
it by the plaintiffs, Interdesco SA, in the Cour d'Appel, Paris, on
September 27 1990, be registered in the High Court.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Interdesco were manufacturers of paint with special
fire protection properties. Their best-selling product was marketed as S60,
indicating that it gave protection for at least 60 minutes.
On January 13 1982, by a five-year agreement, Interdesco gave Nullifire
exclusive distribution rights in the UK and Ireland.
In mid-1985 Nullifire terminated the agreement. It claimed that S60 failed
to satisfy the UK standard for 60 minute paint and was therefore
unmarketable.
Interdesco denied this. They contended that Nullifire was acting pursuant to
a carefully-prepared plot to replace them and steal their market.
Before the Tribunal de Commerce de Paris Interdesco claimed damages for
wrongful termination. A crucial question was whether S60 satisfied the
contractual standard.
Interdesco relied on tests by the Centre Scientifique et Technique du
Batiment (CSTE), the testing institution agreed under the distribution
agreement.
Those tests supported Interdesco's case that the paint was up to standard.
Nullifire relied on earlier tests by the Warrington Research Centre and the
Fire Insurers' Research and Testing Organisation (Firto), to prove the paint
was sub-standard.
The Tribunal attached little weight to the English tests. It gave judgment
for Interdesco on January 21 1987. On June 15 1988 the Cour d'Appel de Paris
rejected an appeal by Nullifire and appointed an expert to assess damages.
The expert assessed damages at Ff7.4m, (Pounds .04) on the premise that but
for Nullifire's breach of contract, Interdesco would have been able to
continue to sell in the UK.
Under the relevant French appellate procedure, each party filed with the
Cour d'Appel a document described as 'conclusions', which was not evidence
but was a statement of the party's case similar to a pleading in English
law.
Nullifire's conclusions averred that, after the breach of contract,
Interdesco had attempted in vain to obtain certified approval of S60 in the
UK. Interdesco filed conclusions confirming that it had not attempted to
obtain certified approval in the UK.
On September 27 1990 the Cour d'Appel substantially upheld the Ff7.4m
assessment of damages.
On December 4 1990 Master Miller ordered that the September 27 judgment be
registered in the High Court pursuant to the Civil Jurisdiction and
Judgments Act 1982.
On March 26 1991 Nullifire instituted before the Cour d'Appel a form of
appellate procedure known as 'recours en revision', to set aside the
September 27 judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud. The
procedure could be constituted any time after judgment, provided it was
initiated within two months of the appellant becoming aware of the facts
giving rise to his ground of appeal. If the recours en revision succeeded
the Cour would rehear the case on its merits.
Nullifire now appealed against Master Miller's registration order of
December 4.
Section 2 of the Act provided that the 1986 Convention on Jurisdiction and
Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters was to have force
of law in the UK.
Article 27 of the Convention provided that a foreign judgment should not be
recognised 'if such recognition is contrary to public policy in the state in
which recognition is sought'.
Nullifire contended that recognition of the judgment was contrary to English
public policy because it was procured by fraud.
On recently obtained evidence it made out a prima facie case that
Interdesco's averments in their conclusions were calculated to mislead, even
if not literally untrue.
In Owens Bank v Bracco, FT April 12 1991 Lord Justice Parker said that where
an English judgment was attacked on grounds of fraud the court would not
permit the new action to proceed unless the plaintiff could put forward
fresh evidence discovered since the first trial, which could not have been
produced then with reasonable diligence, and which, had it been put forward,
would probably have resulted in a different conclusion.
In the case of a foreign judgment, he said, the judgment debtor could defend
himself by showing fraud even though the plea would involve retrial in the
UK of matters adjudicated by the foreign court. He held that was clearly
established in Abouloff (1882)10 QBD 259 and Vadala (1890) 25 QBD 310.
In Owens Bank the court was concerned with proceedings under section 9 of
the Administration of Justice Act 1920, where the same principles applied as
in an action on a foreign judgment at Common Law. The issue here was whether
Abouloff applied in a Convention case.
Article 29 of the Convention, under the heading 'Recognition', and article
34, under the heading 'enforcement', each provided 'Under no circumstances
may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance'.
Where the foreign court had ruled on precisely the matters that a defendant
sought to raise when challenging its judgment on grounds of fraud, the
Convention precluded the court from reviewing the conclusion of the foreign
court.
Thus the rule in Abouloff could not, at least in its most extreme
formulation, be applied in a Convention case.
The question was what course should the court adopt where the defendant
sought to raise a fresh case or to rely on fresh evidence.
In the official reports on the Convention, Jenard commented that the public
policy ground for refusal of recognition in article 27(1) 'ought to operate
only in exceptional circumstances'.
Schlosser commented that to obtain a judgment by fraud could constitute an
offence against public policy. But, he said, the legal systems of all member
states provided redress for a judgment obtained by fraud, and the court in
the state addressed must therefore always ask itself whether breach of its
public policy still existed in view of the fact that proceedings for redress
could be lodged in the foreign court.
The English court should first consider whether a remedy lay in the foreign
jurisdiction. If so it would normally be appropriate to leave the defendant
to pursue his remedy in that jurisdiction.
It was not an area where rigid rules should be formulated. Estoppel
principles should be applied with care and a degree of flexibility to ensure
they accorded with rather than defeated the ends of justice - see Arnold v
National Westminster Bank, FT, April 30 1991.
Subject to that, the English court should not normally entertain a challenge
to a Convention judgment in circumstances where it would not permit a
challenge to an English judgment.
It was hard to see how the English court could reliably determine that
Interdesco's averment was instrumental in procuring the French judgment,
without re-trying the entire issue of measure of damages.
The proper course was to leave Nullifire to seek its remedy in the recours
en revision. The French court was plainly the best place to decide whether
there had been fraud.
Mr Hirst submitted the court had power under article 30 of the Convention,
to stay the proceedings until the result of the recours en revision was
known. Article 30 provided that a court might stay recognition proceedings
'if an ordinary appeal against the judgment has been lodged'.
In Industrial Diamond Supplies (1977) ECR 2175 the European Court ruled that
'ordinary appeal' within article 30 was an appeal 'the lodging of which is
bound . . . to a period which . . . starts to run by virtue of' the
judgment. The recours en revision could be instituted any time after
judgment. It was not 'an ordinary appeal'. The court had no power to stay
the proceedings.
The appeal was dismissed.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): MSF poll winner faces threat of
instant removal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WINNER of an election to head MSF, Britain's fifth-largest union, may be
removed from office two days after the declaration of the result next week,
Michael Smith writes.
The poll outcome is scheduled to be announced on Thursday of next week, but
a motion to be considered by the conference of the general technical union
on May 18 calls for the election to be declared null and void.
It has been proposed by the union's branch in St Pancras, London. Mr Roger
Lyons, assistant general secretary and one of the two candidates, is one of
its members. Supporters of Mr Lyons argued strongly for the election this
year of a general secretary-designate to succeed Mr Ken Gill, who retires in
August 1992.
Mr Gill, a standardbearer of the left in the trade union movement, opposed
the move, saying it was intended to undermine his position.
The union executive's decision to call the election in between annual
conferences last year and this year angered some members who believe the
timing should have been a conference decision.
In addition, the Commissioner for Trade Union Rights has indicated that the
election could be challenged legally on the ground that a general secretary
and his or her successor should not hold office together for more than six
months.
Mr Lyons' opponent in the election is Miss Barbara Switzer, another
assistant general secretary.
The St Pancras motion seeks to censure the executive for proceeding with the
election. It says: 'The conference is the proper place to take decisions of
this magnitude.'
Another motion, from Queen's University, Belfast, urges the conference to
ask Mr Gill to stand down immediately to allow a successor to take up the
reins. 'This would also avoid the possibility of any further legal action in
this area.'
The MSF said yesterday it had settled a pay dispute with more than 100
officers that led to a ban on overtime.
The settlement provides for 9.3 per cent rises, backdated to January 1. MSF
had originally offered 4.5 per cent. Negotiations are to take place on a
formula for determining future pay awards.

EMPLOYEES are more concerned about whether their jobs are interesting and
secure than they are about pay and benefits, according to a Mori poll
commissioned by the GMB general union.
The poll findings are intended to influence debate about priorities at a
special conference on the future of the Trades Union Congress due to be held
today. The GMB said the survey gave a clear warning that only one in 20
people counted working for an organisation with a strong trade union as
important.
The two factors, out of a total of 21, that were considered most important
in a job, were whether the work was interesting and enjoyable (62 per cent)
and whether it was secure (59 per cent).
A feeling of having accomplished something worthwhile (46 per cent) was
rated third, and basic pay (38 per cent) fourth. Among women, basic pay
ranked seventh. Fringe benefits were valued highly by only 6 per cent.
Having a chance to learn skills and develop abilities was important to 33
per cent but was negotiated in only 20 per cent of workplaces.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): W. H. Smith to retrain managers in
motivation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
W. H. SMITH, the multiple retailer, is to retrain up to 300 of its managers.
The decision follows an internal survey finding that staff thought managers
were far better at decision-making than at motivating employees and creating
a happy working environment.
Some board members of W. H. Smith Retail may be among those who will be
asked to attend assessments in June and July at which they will be
interviewed by an occupational psychologist. They will then be offered
retraining in how to improve staff performance.
The company surveyed about 3,500 of its 16,000 staff in one of the first
schemes in Britain allowing staff to assess managers. Each was asked to fill
in a questionnaire rating their managers' qualities.
On scales of one to five, the 400 managers whose performance was assessed
rated an average of 4.52 for being 'prepared to make decisions' but only
3.12 on being 'someone I could turn to if I have personal problems'.
Mr John Ainley, W. H. Smith Retail's personnel and training manager, said
the company had expected that managers would perform better in traditional
roles because the company had trained them to do so in the past. He said:
'Those are the things we have concentrated on, and they are the traditional
measures of a good manager, but we are now saying that a manager's job is
broader than it was in the past and we are asking more from them.'
The attributes on which the managers scored highest were: being prepared to
make decisions, being able to maintain discipline, being courteous,
providing advice when requested and delegating tasks when necessary.
They were rated lowest as being someone 'to turn to if I have a personal
problem'; 'who keeps me motivated'; 'is prepared to change his or her view
if I have something useful to add'; and 'creates a happy working
atmosphere'.
The company is planning to repeat the survey in two years' time.
BP Exploration, the BP subsidiary, has started implementing a similar scheme
under which managers' performance is being rated by their subordinates.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Paying for a wage rise with a promise
 -ICI's offer of 14 per cent is in return for big changes at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAY RISE of 14 per cent is a lot to offer if you do not know exactly what
you will get in return. Yet that, as well as a 36-hour working week, is what
ICI, the UK chemicals group, is offering workers.
In return, the company wants a promise of the biggest change in ICI's
working practices in its 50 plants since the late 1960s. Mr Brian Armstrong,
ICI's chief negotiator with unions, said: 'It is not just 14 per cent
dolloped out. People are going to have to work for it.'
The eight-page agreement, which would replace its 1969 precursor, is longer
on vision than detail. It sets out only the broad principles of the changes
workers would have to agree to before receiving an initial rise of 6 per
cent and two subsequent 4 per cent payments.
Leaders of the six unions representing ICI's 23,000 manual workers talk in
bold terms of what such a deal means. Mr Fred Higgs, the lead negotiator for
ICI manual unions, said: 'We have held the line for a number of years, but
there is a general recognition that things must change.'
The most important clauses cover the organisation of work, with all workers
having to be 'willing to undertake work which they have the skill,
capability and time to perform safely and effectively both individually and
as members of work groups'.
In practice, that is likely to break down skill demarcations between craft
and process workers. The company envisages employees' working in flexible
teams, not prevented from undertaking tasks by union membership or by work
titles.
Mr Armstrong said the company deliberately avoided spelling out specific
changes because it wanted subsidiaries to be free to choose their preferred
route. The safeguard is that ICI will pay the stages of the 14 per cent rise
only when specific changes have been agreed and introduced.
The ICI deal follows British manufacturing companies' practice for the past
decade of paying extra money to secure new working practices. Lever
Brothers, the detergents subsidiary of Unilever, has offered a staged 20 per
cent rise, including an annual pay rise, for changes in working practices.
ICI can ill afford to raise its costs unnecessarily. Recession and
restructuring costs cut pre-tax profits by Pounds 560m to Pounds 977m in
1990 and Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, has warned of possible job
losses above the 4,000 announced last year.
The initial pay and training costs of the changes will be higher than
savings, but Mr Armstrong is confident that the changes will 'eventually' be
self-financing through improved production efficiency.
ICI's approach to employee relations was illustrated by the way the deal was
negotiated nationally before talks at local plants. Rather than trying to
curtail the influence of unions, ICI has retained a strong national
negotiating structure with six manual unions.
Mr Higgs says that ICI's commitment to unions has brought the company two
benefits in its attempt to change working methods. The first has been the
level of trust in negotiations. 'Many other companies would not get what ICI
has got,' he said.
The second benefit is that Mr Higgs believes unions will co-operate more
within plants to ensure planned changes are implemented. 'The agreement is
framed so there is virtually no restriction on the type of working
arrangement that can be negotiated in plants,' he said.
It remains to be seen how quickly and smoothly the changes can be
introduced. One of the most delicate areas of negotiation will the ending of
craft demarcations. The unions have agreed that the small craft unions will
be allowed a veto of local measures.
If the deal is agreed, its significance in industry as a whole is likely to
be twofold. First, other companies may see the national union negotiating
structure as not constituting a barrier to progress.
Second, ICI's concession of a 36-hour week for manual workers by January
1993 (or a year after local changes are brought in, if that is later) will
bring the next step below the 37-hour week clearly into view and might
re-stimulate the efforts of engineering unions.
Much depends on whether the long sought-after national agreement is first
approved by workers in ballots and then achieves what the company hopes.
Managers admit that the deal has been held back in some areas until now, but
they emphasise that it might clear the way for a big step forward.
Mr Armstrong said: 'It is not a question of moving from the Dark Ages to the
20th century. Some of our chemical plants match the best anywhere.'
ICI will have to show clear benefits in the next few years if shareholders
are to approve of its latest investment in workers.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Engineering trainees fall by 30% in
south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING companies in the south-east are taking on 30 per cent fewer
trainees than they did last year because of the recession, according to a
survey of 126 companies by the Engineering Employers London Association.
Electronics companies have suffered particularly badly, with a fall of more
than 50 per cent in the number of apprentice technicians being taken on, the
survey found.
Mr Brian Young, the association's assistant director, said the figures were
worrying in view of forecasts of growing skills shortages in the sector.
Mr Young said: 'We are disappointed that the numbers being recruited show a
significant reduction compared to last year's, which in turn showed a major
reduction on the year before.'
The industry's response to recession was similar to that taken in the late
1970s. 'But is it good planning to take the same course of action?' Mr Young
added.
However, companies appeared to be more optimistic about longer-term
prospects: there was a nearly 40 per cent increase in students on
sponsorship schemes at universities and polytechnics. Members of the
National Union of Journalists employed by Haymarket Publishing yesterday
began a two-day strike over the company's ending of collective bargaining on
pay and conditions and the introduction of personal contracts. The strike
was aimed to disrupt publication of business journals such as Campaign and
Marketing.
Mr Martin Hover, Haymarket's group personnel director, said the company
would continue to recognise the NUJ on issues such as health and safety and
matters relating to the grievance procedure. There had been some disruption
to publications because of the bank holiday, he said, but all the magazines
would appear.
Balloting on industrial action over personal contracts is also being
conducted among NUJ members at two other publishers, IPC and Marshall
Cavendish.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Beckett pledges no increase in two
taxes - Finance Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCOMING Labour Government would not increase corporation tax or capital
gains tax, the Commons was told last night.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, denied any
intention to increase corporation tax,and Mr Nicholas Brown, another Labour
front bench spokesman, said there were no plans to increase the capital
gains tax.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, clashed repeatedly with
Mrs Beckett and her colleagues when he argued that Labour's public
expenditure commitments would inevitably involve higher taxation.
The exchanges dominated the start of the committee stage of the Finance
Bill, which gives legal effect to the March Budget.
Mr Mellor emphasised that in the run-up to the general election, ministers
would make known the results of a detailed analysis of the likely cost of
Labour's programme.
He argued that the closing off of areas like corporation tax provided
pointers to where increases would be imposed.
With support from the government benches, Mr Mellor contended that the
number of taxes which Labour was undertaking not to increase suggested that
'the poor old chap on the standard rate of income tax' would bear the main
brunt of the extra burden arising from its proposals for increasing public
expenditure.
Mr Brown held to his statement that there were no plans to increase the
capital gains tax when it was pointed out from the government side that
keeping the existing 40 per cent rate meant that it would not be aligned
with the 50 per cent rate of income tax Labour intended to impose on the
'top slice' of earnings.
Mr Mellor forecast that the coming to power of a Labour government and the
introduction of measures such as the abolition of the present Pounds 20,280
ceiling on national insurance contributions would result in the return of
the 'brain drain' as professional and skilled workers decided to leave
Britain.
Mr Chris Smith, another Labour front bench spokesman, highlighted the fact
that that when Labour left office in 1979, only 34 per cent of the gross
national product was taken in taxation by the Treasury compared with the
current 37 1/2 per cent.
A Labour amendment designed to 'target' proposed reductions in corporation
tax on the manufacturing sector instead of applying them to all sections of
business and commerce was defeated by a government majority of 95 (264-169).
The committee stage will be resumed later today.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to focus on key Tory
marginals - Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is convinced that unemployment, particularly among white collar
workers, could hold the key to the coming general election, amid evidence
that joblessness is rising most swiftly in Tory marginals.
Party officials believe the pattern of job losses is now quite unlike those
in the early 1980s with the impact falling disproportionately on seats in
the south and south east.
Figures now being drawn up aim to maximise the impact of the issue among
target voters in the 87 constituencies identified from the last week's local
government elections as showing a swing towards Labour.
These are expected to be published today in an effort to dispel a view
widely held among the Conservatives that rising unemployment has little
impact on its vote at a general election.
Total unemployment is rising faster in Tory-held seats than Labour ones,
officials claim, pointing out that in the south east, claimants have
increased by 260 per cent as vacancies have dropped by 48 per cent. Party
analysts say the pattern of job losses means the issue will influence an
election outcome much more than in 1983 and 1987.
Yesterday, Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, signalled the shift
in emphasis when he launched a fierce attack on Mr Michael Howard, the
employment secretary, for failing to fight for adequate resources for his
department.
Accusing Mr Howard of complacency as unemployment was rising 'faster than in
any other country in the western world', he said the department's training
budget for the jobless now stood at half its real value the last time
unemployment reached two million.
Mr Blair said the unemployed had become the 'forgotten people of the
country' and warned that the summer would see a further round of closures
and redundancies.
Countering the charges, Mr Howard insisted the government had produced
measures to help the unemployed back to work. He went on warn Labour's plan
to introduced a national minimum wage would destroy up to two million jobs.
'As you put up the minimum wage as a proportion of the average wage, the
average wage in turn goes up and you will embark upon a never ending cycle
of job destruction,' said Mr Howard.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hospital opt-out issue dominates
campaign - Monmouth By-Election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE row about two local hospitals, which Labour claimed were under
pressure to opt out and become self-governing trusts, dominated the opening
of the second half of the Monmouth by-election campaign.
The controversy was fuelled by the weekend statement from Mr Roger Evans,
the Tory candidate, that on occasions he used private health care rather
than the NHS.
Mr Huw Edwards, the Labour candidate, accused Mr Evans of advocating
policies 'to break up our NHS', while Ms Frances David, for the Liberal
Democrats, said he was 'egging on' the hospitals to opt out.
The by-election, caused by the death of Tory MP Sir John Stradling Thomas,
is seen as crucial by all three main parties, and health has already emerged
as a key issue.
An unapologetic Mr Evans said that private medicine was 'complementary' to
the NHS, and use of it released resources to the health service.
Expressing his full support for the NHS, and calling Labour's tactics
'spurious' he emphasised that there were no proposals for the Nevill Hall
hospital in Abergavenny and the Royal Gwent hospital to become trusts.
He added, however, that if particular local hospitals concluded that they
could be run more effectively as self-governing trusts, then they would have
his support.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, used his visit to the
constituency yesterday to launch Labour's campaign 'to alert every community
in Wales to the threat to their NHS.' Mr Edwards said that opting out would
mean a cut in the standards and range of patient services.
Ms David joined the attack, saying patients were already worried about the
prospects of hospitals opting out. She denied that the importance of health
in the campaign helped Labour, saying the party's commitment to health
spending was 'extremely woolly'.
The Liberal Democrats were committed to make up 'underfunding' and then
increase spending by two per cent more than inflation each year.
They would also end prescription charges, though this pledge was later
glossed with the comment that there was no timescale on its achievement.
The prime minister ruled out changes to Britain's electoral system
yesterday, following remarks by the Liberal Democrats that a system of
proportional representation would be their price for supporting the largest
party in the event of a hung parliament after the next general election.
Proportional representation left 'minority parties determining government
policy, and striking bargains for their support,' said Mr Major.
General election 1987: Sir John Stradling Thomas (C) 22,387; Mrs K Gass (L)
13,037; Mr C Lindley (SDP/All) 11,313; Ms S Meredudd (Plaid Cymru) 363. Con
Maj: 9,350.

Hansard

<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major yesterday rejected claims that he had 'doctored' Hansard, the
official parliamentary report, after misrepresenting the British Medical
Association's views on the health service reforms, Emma Tucker writes.
During question time last week, Mr Major cited views in favour of the
reforms from a magazine which he identified as a BMA publication.
The quotes were taken from GP magazine, which is not associated with the
BMA.
Labour MP Mr Dale Campbell-Savours accused Mr Major of seeking to 'cover up
his mistake by doctoring Hansard'.
He said the Prime Minister 'owed someone an apology'.
Mr Major said: 'In this case the name of the correct source was put into the
record.'
Mr Bernard Weatherill, the speaker, said yesterday that a Hansard sub-editor
had 'inadvertently' changed the sense of the prime minister's reply after a
member of Mr Major's staff had given the name of the magazine to Hansard.
Challenged at question time yesterday, Mr Major said: 'I am entirely happy
for the original words to be reinstated.
'The magazine I quoted from was GP Magazine, but similar sentiments to those
I quoted, endorsing the reforms, have been expressed in the British Medical
Journal, published by the BMA.'

FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Borrie points to 'disarray' -
Takeover &amp; Merger Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS TOO EARLY to judge the success or failure of the government's policy
on UK acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies, Sir Gordon Borrie,
the Director-General of Fair Trading said yesterday.
Sir Gordon told the Commons Trade and Industry Committee investigation on
takeovers and mergers, however, that following the clearance by the
Monopolies and Mergers' Commission of the Pounds 300m acquisition by Elf
Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil group, of the UK downstream
assets of Amoco last week, the so-called 'Lilley doctrine' was 'in some
disarray.'
Sir Gordon said since last July there had been a number of mergers which
qualified for referral to the MMC under the new policy. In six cases, Mr
Lilley had accepted the director-general's advice not to refer. In three
cases, Credit Lyonnais-Woodchester, Signet-Sligos and Elf Aquitaine-Amoco,
he had not taken the director-general's advice.
In two other cases, Kemira Oy-ICI and British Aerospace-Thomson CSF, there
were issues of competition involved which required investigation.
In the light of the MMC's clearance of four of these five mergers, Mr Lilley
would no doubt want to review his policy, Sir Gordon suggested.
It would be wrong for the director-general to stretch his independence to
include any matter which he personally thought should be referred, Sir
Gordon said.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: High ratings herald renewed
optimism - Scottish Tories gather for their 1991 conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH Conservative party activist, looking ahead to her party's annual
conference which begins this afternoon, said: 'I expect we'll be a pretty
happy bunch.'
Scots Tories are always fairly happy when they get together, if only because
they can temporarily drop that wariness about expressing their views too
forthrightly which comes from being in a country where only 24 per cent of
the electorate voted Conservative at the last election.
Their happiness is increased by the knowledge that the party's standing in
the opinion polls in Scotland is now, according to System Three in the
Glasgow Herald, 27 per cent - one of its highest ratings since the early
1980s.
The fact that before Mrs Margaret Thatcher was replaced by Mr John Major the
party stood at 16 per cent tells its own story.
In recent months the Scottish party has done better in local government
by-elections than at any time since the 1970s. Mrs Thatcher herself helped
to heal divisions last autumn by removing Mr Michael Forsyth, the right-wing
Scottish Office minister, from his disastrous 14-month tenure of the
Scottish party chairmanship.
He was replaced by Lord Sanderson, a long-serving party dignitary.
Yet in Perth the party is having to swallow the planned replacement of the
community charge - introduced in response to the Scottish Tories' outrage at
the 1985 rating revaluation - by the property-based council tax.
It is also being asked by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to accept
that the creation of a Scottish legislative assembly is a 'fantasy' to which
few Scots attach much importance.
Cannily the party managers have shoved most of the controversy into the
first debate of this afternoon (many delegates do not usually arrive until
Thursday), discussing an anodyne motion on the funding, functions and
structure of local government.
Of the 33 motions submitted on finance, nearly half supported the principle
of the poll tax and none a property tax.
Mr Lang gave every sign of fighting in cabinet to preserve the community
charge in some form before accepting the council tax.
His protestations that this interpretation of his role is, as he put it in
an interview with the Financial Times 'a fantasy,' are politely disbelieved.
'The diehards are absolutely furious about the abandonment of the principle
of the poll tax,' says a prospective Tory candidate, 'and in places there've
been some resignations. But most see the greater cause (that of the party)
as more important.'
The idea of creating one tier of local government in Scotland instead of two
is popular with most Tories, provided it can be done in a way that preserves
existing pockets of Tory support.
But the debate will allow an opportunity to raise the issue of creating a
Scottish assembly, even if only to supervise those aspects of local
government that could, under reform, revert to the Scottish Office.
Mr Lang insists that local government and an assembly are unconnected, and
asserts his strong opposition to an assembly, especially one with
tax-raising powers. At the weekend, he dismissed opinion polls that showed
60 per cent of Tories and about 80 per cent of Scots favoured some kind of
assembly.
But in recent weeks there have been signs that the Conservative Party is
thinking again about devolution. Mr Struan Stevenson, Tory candidate for
Edinburgh South, argued for a strong assembly with power to levy all taxes
paid in Scotland.
Mr Lang said at the weekend Mr Stevenson's claim that demand for devolution
was an immovable force was 'absolute nonsense.'
Even if devolution is only raised in passing on the floor of the conference
hall it will come up in fringe meetings, with the Scottish Young
Conservatives strongly against and the Scottish Tory Reform Group gently in
favour.

FT  08 MAY 91 / New car sales show lowest April total since 1982
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales plunged by 24.2 per cent to 126,588 in April compared with the
same month last year. It was the lowest April total since 1982.
Sales fell sharply again after a slight respite in March, when sales reached
168,854, stimulated late in the month by the imminent increase in value
added tax.
New car sales in the first four months of the year, at 583,318, were 22.2
per cent lower than a year ago. April was the 18th consecutive month that
new car sales have been lower than in the corresponding month a year
earlier.
Most leading car makers are now forecasting that sales for the full year
will drop below 1.7m, compared with sales of 2m in 1990. That would
represent a 26 per cent fall in new car sales since 1989, the steepest
decline in any two-year period since 1974-75.
Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that
imported cars captured 56.3 per cent of the market in April, compared with
57.6 per cent a year ago, while in the first four months the share of
imported cars fell to 54.6 per cent from 57.6 per cent a year ago.
The recession in the commercial vehicles market continued, with a 27.6 per
cent fall to 19,406 in April. In the first four months, new commercial
vehicle sales dropped by 31.6 per cent to 79,457.
The top-selling car in the first four months was the Ford Escort/Orion range
at 49,775, followed by the Ford Fiesta at 44,194, the Vauxhall Cavalier at
43,683, the Ford Sierra at 33,245 and the Rover 200/400 at 33,068.
Ford remains the dominant UK new car market leader, but its car sales volume
fell by 31 per cent in April compared with the overall fall in the market of
24.2 per cent and its share of the market in April dropped to 23.5 per cent
from 25.8 per cent a year ago.
The Fiat group of Italy, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, traditionally
the weakest of the big six European volume car makers in the UK market, saw
group car sales fall 38.9 per cent in the first four months.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Banks are left impaled on the town hall railings: David
Lascelles and Richard Evans on the government's decision not to act over
local-authority swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government faced a tricky decision over the local-authority swaps
affair. Its intention, announced yesterday, to do nothing about it angered
many more people than it pleased.
Swaps enable two borrowers to improve their financial management by
exchanging debt service payments.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, could have introduced
retroactive legislation to legalise billions of pounds' worth of swaps
contracts entered into by local authorities but ruled by the House of Lords
to be illegal.
The advantage of doing so would have been to regularise numerous complex
financial deals and save the banks involved from heavy losses. Mr Heseltine
would have placated a powerful banking lobby and heeded the advice of the
Bank of England, which is worried about the damage the affair is doing to
the City of London's reputation.
The arguments against that were also powerful. Governments do not like
retrospective legislation, particularly to validate something the courts
have declared illegal. Although new laws would legitimise many deals entered
into in good faith by banks and authorities, it would do the same for
councils such as Hammersmith and Fulham, which has been described in court
as a gambler.
It was also far from certain, as the government saw it, that the banks were
quite the innocent victims of the affair that they claimed to be. There are
doubts as to whether they heeded warnings from legal experts or checked that
local authorities had empowered officials to sign swaps contracts. By acting
to straighten out the matter, the government might also reinforce the
impression that it stood behind local authorities - which it does not.
The immediate losers from the decision are the 80 banks that arranged the
swaps and must cancel them and bear losses estimated at Pounds 550m.
One factor that weighed in Mr Heseltine's decision was the calculation that
banks' actual losses will be as little as half of that. They will still be
able to obtain via restitution proceedings up to Pounds 125m that they have
paid over to the local authorities under the swaps contracts. Of the
remaining Pounds 425m loss, more than a third will be set against their
corporation tax bill.
Most of the 130 local authorities involved may also lose by the decision
because they now have the prospect of lengthy litigation with the banks -
and the worry that relations in general with the financial community will
continue to be soured.
One exception is Hammersmith and Fulham, which welcomed the decision as 'a
clear and definitive statement from the government that it will now be left
to the parties to resolve the matter between themselves.'
Mr Ian Ward, a finance expert at the Association of District Councils, said
the decision was unhappy for local authorities as well as bankers because
most deals would now have to go to court to be resolved. As every deal was
slightly different, it was bound to be a lengthy process.
Mr Ward said local authorities were also uncertain about whether they had
the power to enter into a compromise agreement with the banks, and that had
not been resolved in any way by the government. The asociation had been
seeking not only validation of the deals that had been done, but permission
for swaps to be entered into in a properly controlled treasury operation.
Similarly, the attitude of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities was
that there should be full validation of past deals. Mr Keith Beaumont of the
AMA said it was now very likely that there would be extensive litigation and
that might compromise the financial standing of local authorities.
Only in the longer term will it become clear whether the affair has done
lasting damage to the City, as has been claimed by Sir Jeremy Morse and Sir
Martin Jacomb, the chairmen of the City's two biggest lobby groups,
representing the clearing banks and the merchant banks.
Their main worry was that many foreign banks faced losses and that the
affair exposed possible weaknesses in the City's legal underpinnings.
The government's view was that whatever damage had been done was very
localised, and there is little evidence of business leaving London.
Still unresolved is whether the government should legislate to enable local
authorities to engage in swaps in future. Mr John Maples, the Economic
Secretary at the Treasury, said there were no plans to do so, and it was not
clear that that would be desirable. But the Treasury would listen to
proposals.

   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRESS on Northern Ireland's future ran aground yesterday when the
province's political leaders again failed to agree on where talks involving
the Irish government should take place.
Unionist and nationalist leaders met Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland
secretary, for more than six hours of bilateral meetings at the Stormont
parliament buildings in Belfast.
The planned 'round table' discussions have been delayed until later today at
the earliest.
Mr Brooke wanted 11 weeks of talks, but one week has already passed with no
agreement on the venue for the second strand of talks, when the Dublin
government joins in the discussions.
The location is regarded as symbolic by all sides and the political leaders
are anxious not to be seen by their respective grassroots supporters as
giving way.
The fact that there has been no agreement on compromise locations shows how
deep divisions run.
Mr Addie Morrow of the Alliance party delegation said: 'It has been a
frustrating day.' The Irish government wants the talks to be held in
Ireland, either in the Republic or Northern Ireland.
Unionists insist that the talks should be held elsewhere, preferably London,
because of the republic's constitutional claim on the north and perhaps
because they fear protests from their supporters about the fact that
negotiations with Dublin are taking place. Unionist leaders prefer London.
Compromise locations in Europe - such as Strasbourg - would present travel
difficulties. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said: 'Once
you get to Strasbourg it is like house imprisonment. It is impossible to get
out. There are no flights from Belfast and no flights from Dublin.'
Mr Brooke and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, thought the
difficulty was small-scale when they met in London two weeks ago.
The location of the third and final strand of the talks - to consider a
replacement for the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - has not been decided yet.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Funding council fears for medical education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over the government's health service reforms was revived
yesterday when the Universities Funding Council said it was 'extremely
concerned' about their possible effect on medical education.
The council's comments have prompted the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals to write to the government seeking assurances that there will be
'adequate safeguards' in the implementation of the reforms to protect
high-quality teaching and research.
Difficulties facing teaching hospitals in inner London, the funding
council's medical committee said in a report, were sufficiently serious to
'raise doubts about their future ability to deliver a viable education
programme, unless urgent corrective action is taken'.
The council's warning comes less than a fortnight after one inner London
teaching hospital - Guy's - announced plans for about 600 job losses to
improve its financial position.
Under the health reforms introduced last month, hospitals are funded on the
basis of their success at negotiating contracts with health authorities and
general practitioners. Regional allocations of overall funds will be
determined by the size and other characteristics of local populations.
The potential effect of those changes on universities with medical schools,
the council says, is 'very great' and has not been fully understood by some
schools.
The council says: 'From the point of view of the teaching hospital, failure
to attract sufficient contracts from purchasing authorities could ultimately
render the hospital unviable.' Some teaching hospitals would need to
contract with 60 or 70 health districts to maintain their current workloads.
Undergraduate teaching required a broad clinical base, but essential
'run-of-the-mill' work was most likely to be lost to teaching hospitals.

FT  08 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: County sought to avoid disclosure,
court told - Court Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NATWEST wanted to avoid disclosing in its year-end accounts the Blue
Arrow holdings taken by advisers to the 1987 rights issue because of the
stock market's ignorance of these holdings, the Blue Arrow trial was told
yesterday.
Mr James Riddell, a former County financial control director, agreed with Mr
Nicholas Purnell, QC, prosecuting, that disclosure of the holdings taken in
the September issue was the one thing everyone had tried to avoid.
He agreed there was no alternative to the eventual disclosure of a 9.8 per
cent holding made on December 17. The losses suffered in the stock market
crash had to appear in some form in County's results.
Mr Riddell was cross-examined by Mr Roy Amlot, QC, for Mr Alan Keat, a
solicitor with Travers Smith Braithwaite who advised County, over
discussions between the two men on the presentation of the losses in
County's accounts.
Mr Riddell agreed Mr Keat had expressed concern over a number of options
being considered. Mr Keat had warned him disclosure would be necessary if
some options were followed. If NatWest acquired the holdings of both County
and County NatWest Securities, the aggregation rules of the Companies Act
would apply.
He said Mr Keat had advised him that, if NatWest gave CNWS a guarantee
against losses on its holding, that would put into doubt the market makers'
exemption from disclosure. He had said the written indemnity given to UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew for its holding could not be extended because that would
undermine its market makers' exemption.
Mr Riddell said that Mr Keat had also expressed concern over the favoured
option of transferring the stake held by County's corporate advisory
division to the parent bank as a long-term trade investment. Mr Keat had
advised that that depended on the intentions of NWB's directors and had
agreed with Ernst and Whinney, the auditors, that such an option was not
possible.
He had considered Mr Keat's advice to have been honest throughout, Mr
Riddell agreed
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of
the Pounds 837m rights issue. The trial continues today.

FT  08 MAY 91 / N Sea oil and gas projects approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Energy yesterday gave the go-ahead for two North Sea
projects, worth a total of Pounds 2.4bn: the development of a new oilfield
and the construction of a gas pipeline system.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, said the announcements were a 'positive
indicator of the continuing potential of the UK continental shelf'.
He announced the approval of the Alba oilfield, which will be developed by
Chevron, the UK arm of the US oil company, at a cost of about Pounds 1.3bn.
He also approved the Pounds 1bn-plus construction of a gas-gathering system
by a joint venture headed by Amoco, the UK exploration arm of the US
company, to transport gas to Teesside in north-east England.
The Alba oilfield has an estimated 400m-plus barrels of recoverable oil but
is complex and difficult to drill. The field is scheduled to start
production by 1994 to reach peak output of 100,000 barrels a day by the end
of the decade, when the field's second facility comes on stream.
Mr Charles Smith, managing director of Chevron UK, said he believed Alba to
be one of the largest oilfields that remain to be developed in the UK
sector.
The Amoco gas pipeline system, which should be complete by 1993, will take
gas for the first time into the UK's industrial heartland at Teesside. It
will supply the proposed Enron power station project, planned by ICI and a
group of four regional electricity companies, but could be extended to serve
other industrial customers.
The pipeline system will transport 300m cu ft of gas a day from Amoco's
Everest and Lomond gas fields. Its 1.4bn cu ft daily capacity would allow it
to take gas from other fields. Other partners in the project include Gas
Council Exploration, Amerada Hess, British Gas, Phillips Petroleum, Fina
Exploration and Agip.
