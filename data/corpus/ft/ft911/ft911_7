FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Epsep suspends two year-old
contract with Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Peruvian state fisheries company Epsep has decided to suspend a two
year-old fishing contract with the Soviet Union, Sally Bowen writes.
Epsep intends to sue for the Dollars 18m (Pounds 10.60m)it claims the
Soviets owe.
A delegation from the Soviet state fishing company Svibra is in Lima for
talks but Mr Felix Canal Torres, Fisheries Minister, said in a televised
interview: 'They seem not to have the slightest intention to recognise their
debt.'
The treaty with the Soviets came into force in January 1989. It permits 13
Soviet factory ships to fish outside Peru's 30-mile limit, turning over 17.5
per cent of the 400,000 ton quota to Peru.
Mr Canal said there were several grounds for claiming breach of contract.
The Soviets had delivered only about half the agreed catch, they failed to
employ Peruvians as crew, the quality of fish landed was unacceptable and
the Soviets had refused to supply invoices showing quantities of fish sold
abroad on Peru's behalf.
The final decision on the fishing treaty will lie with President Alberto
Fujimori.

RAW SUGAR prices plunged to the lowest levels for more than three years in
London yesterday. The London Daily Price for raws was down Dollars 16.50 to
Dollars 194 a tonne.
In New York raw sugar futures were also sharply down from the start. The May
contract, approaching expiry yesterday afternoon, hit a new low of 7.30
cents a lb after midday.
Mr Chris Pack, analyst with Czarnikow, the London trade house, said the
market was again talking about rumours that Mexico had sold a block of
500,000 tonnes of whites to China over three years.
Yesterday saw the first delivery of Cuban sugar against a London Futures and
Options Exchange (Fox) contract. A total of 400 lots (24,000 tonnes) is to
be delivered against May.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC assurance to US on oilseeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's long-running dispute with the US over its subsidies for the
production and processing of oilseeds could boil over again unless
Washington accepts undertakings from Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner.
During talks in Washington tomorrow and on Friday Mr MacSharry will tell his
counterparts that the EC will implement the 1990 Gatt ruling on oilseeds in
July next year, but not before because of legal constraints.
Mr MacSharry told journalists: 'The seed is in the ground, the contracts are
signed, we can't change this year.'
The EC had originally planned to implement the ruling as part of the results
of the Uruguay Round, which reached deadlock over farm subsidies in
December.
The US warned at a Gatt trade council in Geneva last week that it would take
action unless the EC changed the subsidies regime immediately.
This regime pays the subsidy to oilseed crushers rather than farmers, to
compensate them for buying higher-priced EC soyabeans, rapeseed and other
oilseeds.
The Gatt ruling found the payments to be more than the difference between
the EC price and world market prices and therefore discriminatory.
US soyabean farmers have lost valuable market share to competitors from
Brazil and Argentina as well as the EC.
Mr MacSharry says since 1987 - and including this year's proposed price
package - the EC has cut prices by 25 per cent for rapeseed, 30 per cent for
sunflowers and 46 per cent for soyabeans.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry calls for new realism
about subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW realism about gradual dismantling of farm subsidies is needed to get a
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks,
according to Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner.
Speaking on the eve of his first talks in Washington tomorrow with Mr Ed
Madigan, the new US secretary for agriculture, he stressed that 'it is
important to be realistic because it's becoming much more difficult to
deliver' on the EC offer, the rejection of which brought the round to a
standstill in December.
But Mr MacSharry confirmed that he wanted to put the details of his radical
plan to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to EC farm ministers in
June - whether or not member states resolve their two-month old dispute over
this year's price package by then.
Mr MacSharry said the EC's offer remained the same, a 30 per cent cut in
domestic farm subsidies over 10 years counted from 1986. He insisted that
this would unlock more access to the EC market for farm produce, as well as
bring down export subsidies. But EC member states' continuing inability to
agree to keep within this year's spending guidelines, growing pressure from
east European imports and signs of subsidy increases by competitors like the
US had made internal consensus on even this offer harder.
The US and the 14-nation Cairns Group of agri-exporters led by Australia
insisted at last December's failed Gatt summit on a 75 per cent cut in
internal subsidies and 90 per cent reduction of export refunds over the next
10 years.
But the commissioner pointed out that the Community's adversaries in the
round had moved from their original demand for total elimination of
subsidies to an acceptance of a 50 per cent cut in internal support when the
round broke up. Talks have since resumed in Geneva to define technically
what constitutes each class of subsidy, and Mr MacSharry hoped Gatt would
produce a framework paper by July, enabling a ministerial attempt to break
the deadlock in the autumn.
The reform plan now scheduled for June, intended to move the emphasis of
farm support from subsidised prices to direct payments to farmers, so
cutting output and eventually export subsidies, is the Uruguay Round's main
beacon of hope.
Confirmation that Mr MacSharry intends to press ahead with its timetable
should strengthen the hand of Mr Madigan and Mrs Carla Hills, the US special
trade representative, whom the commissioner will also see. They are pushing
Congress to renew the US administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating
authority, vital to get the round through as a package which US legislators
cannot undo parts of.
The EC commissioner had originally intended to wait until this year's price
package was out of the way before continuing the reform offensive, in line
with the Commission's almost theological desire to keep these two issues and
the inter-related Gatt talks separate.
Mr MacSharry said he personally wanted to see a full six months debate
before introducing reform, so it would begin to bite in the 1992 farming
year.
Tactically, the Commission wants to avoid the current farm budget wrangle
going to the European summit of June 29, in case member governments fix new
spending guidelines which pre-empt the severe cuts envisaged in the reform.
Privately, senior officials admit the Gatt-CAP link by expressing concern
that the Uruguay Round timetable could collide with the US electoral
timetable unless EC farm reform is speeded up.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salmon farmers pour oil on
troubled water / A look at an environmental controversy in Chile's Lake
District
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a group of angry Mapuche Indians and hotel owners attacked a truck in
the idyllic surroundings of Chile's Lake District last winter it was time
for salmon farmers to take stock of the effects of the unbridled expansion
of their business.
Chile's salmon exports have been doubling every year since commercial
production started in 1984. Last year 18,000 tonnes of the fish was flown
abroad, netting almost Dollars 100m. The salmon business is one of the
success stories of Chile's efforts to diversify exports away from copper,
but that success has at times run roughshod over the sensitivities of local
inhabitants.
Southern Chile is ideal for salmon farming. The eggs are hatched in the
crystalline rivers that spring from the Andes, the young smolts grow in
unpolluted lakes and the salmon mature in the relatively warm waters of the
south Pacific.
But the people of the Lake District fear their budding tourist industry
might be endangered if the lakes become contaminated by intensive fish
farming techniques.
Last year a colony of Mapuche Indians living on an island in the huge and
breathtaking Lake Ranco began to complain that the water was no longer safe
to drink. Hotel owners around the lake noticed a brown slime on beaches
close to where salmon cages had been installed.
Their alarm grew on learning that one salmon farming company planned to
increase the number of cages on Lake Ranco from 30 to 180. When appeals to
the authorities failed the locals took the law into their own hands, setting
up roadblocks to prevent feed trucks from reaching the salmon cages.
After two drivers were attacked last August a truce of a kind was declared.
Eicosal, the Arab-owned company at the centre of the dispute, agreed to
scale down its expansion to 50 cages. It also asked university scientists to
investigate the impact on the lake of their salmon cages and the
high-protein fishmeal used as nutrient.
The study showed that phosphate levels in Lake Ranco had increased
four-fold, but that the young smolts were not its primary cause. The main
polluting agents appeared to be the fertilisers that drained into the lake
from the pastures of nearby dairy farms.
Mr Eduardo Espinoza, the mayor of Lake Ranco, accepted the findings of the
report. 'But the problem is only half solved. He would like measurements to
be taken regularly, over a longer period. 'Lake Ranco is one of the purest
lakes in Chile. If we allow it to deteriorate we will also be destroying our
livelihood.'
Mr Espinoza says part of the ill feeling towards the salmon farmers was
caused by ignorance of this new activity and poor communication. This is
gradually being redressed.
Salmon farmers argue that it is in their best interests to keep the lakes
clean. Mr Pablo Achurra, director of operations of Marine Harvest
International, says: 'If the lakes became polluted, the young salmon would
be the first fish to die.' He says the Chilean authorities have imposed far
more stringent environmental standards on the salmon business than on dairy
farmers.
Marine Harvest International, a Scottish subsidiary of Unilever, has
invested Dollars 25m since it launched its Chilean operation in 1987. It
runs two hatcheries, four lake sites and 12 sea-water sites, which last year
produced 4,700 tonnes of salmon - more than three times the catch in 1989.
Mr Achurra says Marine Harvest and other companies have decided to put a
brake on this frenzied expansion. Overproduction in other countries,
particularly Norway, which is facing dumping charges in the US, have led
Chileans to reasses their marketing strategy.
Mr Achurra says: 'We no longer want to grow at exponential rates. We now
have to consolidate the industry, refine our techniques and aim for
consistent high quality.'
The success of intensive salmon farming has brought a fall in prices. Five
years ago a kilogram of salmon was fetching Dollars 10 in the US and Japan.
Last year prices hovered around Dollars 5.50.
Mr Rodrigo Infante, markettion of Chilean Salmon Exporters, believes this
will lead to a shake-out in the industry. The high profit margins attracted
a lot of cowboys to the business, but it is really an activity which favours
big companies with access to the latest technology and the benefits of
economies of scale.
The association forecasts exports will grow 11 per cent this year to 20,000
tonnes in spite of lower prices. Profit margins are narrower, but they are
not about to wipe out the business.
Chilean salmon has three advantages over its competitors in Canada, Scotland
and Norway. It supplies the US and Japan in winter, when fresh salmon is out
of season in the northern hemisphere, Chilean salmon grows faster and to
bigger sizes than its northern brethren, and its deep pink flesh is
particularly prized in Japan.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: History lesson spreads
optimism / A look at the pattern of US bond yields in recessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economists and bond market analysts feel that the current US recession is
different from other post-war economic downturns.
'The months preceding the typical post-war recession are characterised by
rising core inflation, rising interest rates and rising levels of
inventories relative to sales,' said Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the US
Federal Reserve bank in the bank's annual report.
'None of those conditions prevailed in any significant way in the months
preceding the downturn in economic activity last year. The roots of this
recession can be traced more directly to a combination of events that
precipitated a sharp decline in confidence and corresponding pull back in
spending.'
Against this background, measures of investor confidence take on extra
significance. Equity prices provide a broad measure of anticipated growth in
corporate earnings. A more sensitive gauge may be provided by corporate
yield spreads (the extra yield on corporate bonds against government bonds)
and credit spreads (the extra yield of bonds issued by weak companies
against those issued by strong companies).
When the economic outlook is bleak, corporate yield spreads against
government bonds widen in anticipation of deteriorating credit quality. A
recovery is prefaced by a tightening of spreads.
Moreover, by looking at the yield spread between company bond issues of
different credit quality, investors' perception of the risk to various areas
of the economy can be judged.
JP Morgan, the US securities house, calculates a number of industrial bond
yield indices in the US market according to the credit quality of the
issuer. These show that yield spreads and credit spreads have already
peaked.
'Credit spreads usually start widening after the onset of a recession and
reach a peak just before or after the end of a recession, at which point
economic activity has reached a trough,' said Mr Jan Loeys, bond market
analyst at JP Morgan.
The yield spread between top-rated triple-A corporate bond issues and
medium-grade Baa rated bond issues peaked at 192 basis points in December
last year. The spread between the two credit grades has since steadily
narrowed to 151 basis points.
This compares favourably with the recession of the early 1980s, when the
credit spread soared to 293 basis points as investors ran to the best
quality bond issues.
In contrast, the current downturn in confidence looks more serious than the
recession of the early 1970s. In 1974 the yield spread between top-rated and
weaker corporate bonds hit a peak of just 154 basis points, 40 basis points
less than the 1990-91 peak.
Weaker companies are seen to be more at risk than strong companies this time
around. One explanation is that the financial system is no longer seen as a
willing supplier of emergency credit to stretched industrial companies.
'This recession was different to the early 1980s or mid-1970s. Fears of a
credit crunch and the high degree of leverage among US corporations were new
factors, over and above depressed demand,' said Mr Loeys.
Yet for top-rated triple-A companies, the yield spread over government bonds
widened to a peak of just 70 basis points against 197 basis points in 1974.
For those companies in good financial health, with low gearing and strong
cash flow, the current recession is seen as a less serious threat than in
the early 1970s.
There are pitfalls in taking this analysis too far. For example, the
credit-rating agencies were aggressive in their downgrading of companies
coming into this recession, so the data may not be strictly comparable.
However, the tightening of yield spreads and credit spreads, during the last
two months in particular, suggests a definite upswing in investor
confidence.

Barclays, the largest UK clearer, writes David Lascelles, Banking Editor.
Although the bank is suffering a high level of domestic loan losses, IBCA

IBCA says certain parts of the group are not earning adequate returns,

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Equities: Maxwell breaks monopoly with Pounds
245m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers, the UK newspaper publisher controlled by Mr Robert
Maxwell, yesterday broke the monopoly of US companies offering equity to
international investors.
MGN is raising Pounds 245m in total, with 78.5m shares or 40 per cent of the
offering being placed internationally, more than the 30 per cent previously
anticipated. Salomon Brothers has underwritten the international tranche and
is leading a group of international banks on the deal.
Shares were priced yesterday at Pounds 1.25 per share, giving the company a
capitalisation of Pounds 501m (Dollars 837m). Mr Maxwell will retain a 51
per cent holding in the company. At the issue price, the company has a
notional dividend yield of about 7 per cent.
Salomon expects strong demand from international investors attracted by the
high dividend yield. As an equity market sector, US newspaper publishing
firms trade on a dividend yield of about 3 per cent.
In addition to anticipated buying from US institutions, Salomon said
yesterday that there were early expressions of interest from Swiss and
German investors.
Elsewhere, Duracell, the US battery company owned by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, is expected to price its 25m share offering later today. The size
of the issue has been increased from 20m shares, and now 5.625m shares will
be offered internationally via Merrill Lynch. The indicated price range has
been increased from Dollars 12-14 per share to Dollars 15-16 per share.
There is no sign of a slackening in the pace of medium-sized US companies
filing share offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For
example, Viacom, a media and communications company, filed for an offering
of 9m shares on Friday, 1.8m of which will be placed internationally via
Morgan Stanley. The issue will raise Dollars 285m in total.
Supply of convertible bonds also continues in the international market. On
Friday, Chubb, the US insurance and development group, came with a Dollars
250m seven-year convertible bond issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley.
The bonds carry a coupon of 6 per cent and the right to convert into Chubb
equity at a Dollars 86 per share, a conversion premium of 24.4 per cent over
the Dollars 69.8 share price when the deal was launched. However, the
company's share price had slipped back to Dollars 67 yesterday and the bonds
were trading at 97.5 bid, having been launched at par.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: British Land braves dearer
borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH LAND, the UK property company, raised Pounds 100m of bonds due 2016
yesterday, braving higher borrowing costs in the long-term sterling bond
market, writes Tracy Corrigan.
According to research by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, there is a positive cost in
issuing long-term bonds relative to bank finance for the first time since
1987.
However, the company was keen to lock in long-term funding in order to
extend its maturity profile. 'Property is a long-term business,' said Mr
John Weston-Smith, finance director of British Land.
The bonds were launched at a substantial 250 basis point margin above the
yield on the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. But the bonds yield less than 12 1/2
per cent, so, in absolute terms, the widening in spreads has been countered
by the fall in gilt yields in recent months.
British Land could have borrowed more cheaply by securing its debt on
property assets, as Land Securities did earlier this year.
However, Mr Weston Smith said that secured financing is both cumbersome and
expensive to administer. In addition, the documentation of the company's
unsecured bank lending limits the circumstances in which it can raise
secured funding.
In February, British Land issued Pounds 78.75m of convertible capital bonds
due 2011. The company also has substantial short-term funding, including a
Pounds 175m revolving credit facility set up late last year.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: International Bonds:
Convertible capital issue allows low-cost cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATED Security (ASH), the UK electronic security company, yesterday
launched an issue of convertible capital bonds due 2006, which combined the
features of a convertible and a rights issue. The structure allowed the
company to raise more funds at a lower cost, analysts said.
The Pounds 60m deal, increased from Pounds 50m, includes a clawback feature
which allows qualifying shareholders to take up to 75 per cent of the issue.
The remaining 25 per cent, equivalent to 5 per cent of new equity, is
offered internationally. The issue was arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Such a structure is useful because UK companies are only allowed to issue
new equity to a maximum of 5 per cent of their market capitalisation in any
year, without offering a 'clawback' which prevents equity dilution by
allowing existing shareholders to take up the new equity. Because ASH is
capitalised at just over Pounds 300m, it could only have brought a small
convertible bond offering, without a clawback feature.
The company could have brought a rights issue instead. But a rights issue
would have had to be priced at a discount to ASH's share price, while the
convertible structure allowed the company to set the conversion price at a
13.1 per cent premium, at 250p.
Further, a rights issue would have been essentially domestic. The company
was keen to widen its investor base abroad in order to reflect its business
expansion into Europe and the US. ASH, which has had an ADR facility since
1989, is awaiting approval to list its shares on the Nasdaq system.
The deal will be counted as equity for accounting purposes, and so will
allow the company to reduce its high level of gearing. ASH estimates that
its gearing of 85 per cent will be brought down to under 40 per cent.
Mr Jim Grantham, director of convertible research at County NatWest,
described the deal as 'further evidence of how a Euro-structure can be more
flexible than a domestic issue.'
Dealers reported firm demand for the deal which was considered quite
attractively priced. However, some predicted that placement would be largely
domestic, because the company is not very well known outside the UK. The
issue traded at a half point premium to its par issue price.
In the Swiss market, Sunkyong, the Korean trading company, launched a SFr65m
convertible offering. The deal was quoted at 101 3/4 bid, a premium to its
par issue price.
British Gas brought a SFr75m issue of promissory notes via Swiss Bank
Corporation.
Staatsbank, the former East German central bank, has increased the size of
its floating rate note issue, launched on Tuesday from DM4bn to DM5bn.

<TEXT>
FOLLOWING Volvo's announcement yesterday that it was to withdraw from the
Helsinki bourse due to the high listing costs, Swedish industrial gas
company AGA said it would discontinue its Helsinki listing due to a
requirement that listed companies join an association to help cover costs,
writes our Financial Staff.
'The new requirements for membership and the increased fees to be introduced
are not justified at the level of trading activity that the AGA share has
had on the Helsinki Stock Exchange,' AGA said.
The company said it would have had to pay the association FM300,000 a year,
for 'marginal' trade. AGA is listed on six other exchanges, and American
depositary receipts are also traded.

Morgan Grenfell

<TEXT>
MORGAN Grenfell, the UK merchant and investment bank owned by Germany's
Deutsche Bank, announced yesterday that it had taken a 30 per cent stake in
K&amp;N Kenanga, Malaysia's fifth largest stockbroker by volume.
The deal ends two years of searching for a Malaysian partner by Morgan
Grenfell. 'Kenanga is well-managed, clean, with no hidden liabilities,' said
Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, regional managing director.
The acquisition will strengthen Morgan Grenfell's ambition to establish a
strong, independent presence in the south-east Asian securities market, in
which Malaysia has been one of the most tightly controlled.
Industry reforms introduced last year by the government, particularly
through a 10-fold increase to MDollars 20m (Dollars 7.24m) in the minimum
capital requirement, have forced Malaysian brokerage houses to restructure
their businesses.
Entry by foreign brokers remains difficult; in Morgan Grenfell's case, the
acquisition was made possible by the decision of John Hancock International,
the previous partner in Kenanga, to retreat from Malaysian equities and
focus on insurance instead.
Trading volumes at Kenanga, which controls a 10 to 15 per cent share of the
market, are likely to rise once Morgan Grenfell transfers the business from
its regional headquarters in Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.
The group's move into Malaysia is also strategic, necessitated partly by the
split between the local and Singapore bourses in January last year.
Over-the-counter trading in Singapore is expected to disappear when the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange introduces scripless trading by next year.
Morgan Grenfell has the option to raise its Kenanga stake to 49 per cent -
the official limit - within three years. This reflects the fact that the UK
group is the most active foreign brokerage in Malaysia.
W I Carr is the only other large international securities group with any
equity involvement in the country; it operates a research office, but its 30
per cent shareholding in Seagrott and Campbell has largely been passive.

15.7%
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLINER Bank has reported 15.7 per cent higher earnings of DM43.4m (Dollars
24.6m) for last year and an unchanged dividend of 10 per cent.
The bank, which since mid-1990 has expanded strongly in east Germany,
expects improved results this year on the basis of performance in the first
three months, Mr Wolfgang Steinriede, board spokesman, said recently.
A not insignificant part of earnings last year came from 'reserves' built up
over the years in a bank subsidiary.
Berliner Bank aims to complete its takeover later this year of Berliner
Stadtbank in east Berlin which contributed 38,000 of Berliner Bank's 90,000
clients in the east.
The merger with Stadtbank was held up by delays in presenting an opening
balance sheet.
A total of DM3.4bn in new deposits came from east Germany where the bank has
21 outlets, including those of its east Berlin affiliate.
For the first time in its 40-year history, Berliner Bank was able to expand
in its own immediate surroundings as other banks had done, Mr Steinriede
said.
The bank's main volume business in the east was financing new ventures. It
also planned to invest with partners in prime urban property sites.
Last year, Berliner Bank formed a joint subsidiary with Baron Edmond de
Rothschild's investment group.
Mr Steinriede noted that Berliner Bank was waiting for the green light from
the city to merge with Landesbank Berlin, the former Sparkasse of Berlin.
The city of Berlin is a majority shareholder in both banks. The merger was
desirable if Berlin were to play a greater role as a financial centre, he
said.

<TEXT>
MR JIM Scott, Air New Zealand's chief executive, has resigned, apparently
over differences with the airline's controlling shareholder, Brierley
Investments, which is believed to be strengthening its control.
This follows the announcement that Mr Bob Matthew, former BIL New Zealand
chief executive, has stepped down to concentrate his energies on the
airline, the position widely seen as making him the airline's executive
chairman.
At the same time, several key Air New Zealand appointments have been filled
by the former executives of another BIL subsidiary, Magnum Corporation, a
company formerly run by Mr Matthew.
There were also differences in style and personality between Mr Scott and
BIL executives. Mr Scott wanted to concentrate on strategic long-term growth
for the company and New Zealand tourism: BIL seemed more concerned with
improving retail earnings. On several occasions statements from Mr Scott on
such areas as manning and expansion, appeared to clash with those of Mr
Matthew.
Mr Scott's background was as a senior executive and specialist in forestry
with Carter Holt. He is being replaced in an acting capacity by the deputy
chief executive, Mr Jim McCrea, a long-serving employee who has considerable
standing with BIL executives for his skill at negotiating the purchase of
new aircraft at favourable rates.
A statement from Mr Matthew said he accepted Mr Scott's resignation with
regret, saying he had played a leading role in the changes since the airline
was privatised.

payments

<TEXT>
FUJI Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, said yesterday that
dividend payments would be passed for the year to end-March, as the company
would incur an after-tax loss of Y66.4bn (Dollars 4.82m).
The company reported an after-tax profit of Y5.7bn for the previous year,
but had offset an operating loss with sales of securities holdings. The
stock market plunge last year had restricted the com-pany's ability to sell
further shares, and the previous dividend of Y6 will not be repeated.
Fuji Heavy has close ties to Nissan Motor, which owns 4.2 per cent of the
company and has indicated it could take a more active role in management.
Nissan has consigned production of one of its models to Fuji Heavy from
October of this year.
Officials at Fuji Heavy said yesterday that the company had suffered an
after-tax loss of Y51.3bn in the first half and a Y15.1bn loss in the second
half, despite strong consumer demand last year.
Total output for the Japanese industry in the year to end-March rose 4.9 per
cent, while Fuji's output rose 7.3 per cent and its domestic sales, by
volume, rose 14.8 per cent.
However, the domestic car market has turned down in recent months and
Japanese makers are also reporting slower sales in the US and Europe,
complicating Fuji Heavy's plans to break even this year.

CARTER Holt Harvey, which is selling assets to pay for its purchase of NZ
Forest Products, has sold its Hawkes Bay forests and all but 10 per cent of
the giant Pan Pac mill in Napier, to its Japanese partners for NZDollars
260m (USDollars 152.9m).
Under the deal, Carter Holt has a two-year option allowing it to return to a
50 per cent stake in the partnership.
Mr Richard Carter, executive chairman, said the group expected to release
NZDollars 635m from the sale of Elders Resources NZ non-forestry assets.
Further money would come from the sale of the Australian Simsmetal business
and the sale of 49 per cent of Bridge Oil, which would raise NZDollars 100m.
An exchange of contracts on Simsmetal to an unnamed buyer is due over the
next month.
CHH had a majority holding in Carter Oji Kokusaku Pan Pacific, and had been
discussing the position with its two Japanese partners, Oji Paper and
Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, which helped fund the mill in the 1960s.
The forests, bought to support the mill, were among 94,000 hectares CHH
purchased from the government last year for NZDollars 383m.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: MIM posts ADollars 14.8m
quarterly loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK WESTFIELD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLOODS and weak metal and coal prices plunged MIM Holdings, the Australian
mining group, into operating losses of ADollars 14.8m (USDollars 11.56m) in
its third quarter for the 1991 financial year.
As a result, the group is undertaking a rigorous cost-cutting programme at
its Mount Isa copper and lead mine and is reviewing future projects, said
Sir Bruce Watson, chairman.
The result for the 16 weeks to April 7 was MIM's first quarterly loss for
five years and compares with a ADollars 35m operating profit for the
previous quarter and a ADollars 67.6m in the same quarter last year.
MIM was caught in a squeeze between a ADollars 60m decrease in sales because
of severe production losses during the quarter and a ADollars 29m increase
in costs.
Last quarter's loss clawed back profit for the first nine months of the year
to just ADollars 30m, compared with ADollars 164.2m for the same period last
year.
MIM's share price dropped 5 cents to ADollars 1.77 on the news of the
quarterly loss and predictions by stock market analysts that the company's
annual dividend would be cut to 5 cents or 6 cents, compared with 12 cents
last year. The interim pay-out was trimmed to just 3 cents from last year's
4 cents.
The 16-week period proved to be disastrous for MIM, with the collapse of a
cooling tower at Mt Isa, closing the lead smelter for four weeks, and heavy
flooding in northern Queensland, disrupting the rail link between the city
and its export port, Townsville. The flood also cost four weeks' production
from its Newlands and Collinsville coal mines.
While MIM can do little about the weather, the company has embarked on a
vigorous cost-cutting exercise to improve margins.
MIM sacked 150 workers from its loss-making Collinsville coal mine in
January and warned then that it would slash ADollars 100m from annual
operating costs of the Mt Isa mine over two years.
Sir Bruce revealed that MIM was discussing with its banks the future of the
Collinsville and Newlands coal mines, given that earnings from the mines
failed to fully service interest costs. Weak export coal prices and the
stubbornly strong Australian currency had conspired to erode coal earnings
for the group.
MIM's coal operations lost ADollars 37m over the three quarters. 'The return
to profitability of the Newlands and Collinsville coal operations is a
matter for urgent resolution,' Sir Bruce said yesterday.

decline in turnover

<TEXT>
MULTI-PURPOSE, the diversified Malaysian group, unveiled a 46 per cent drop
in turnover to MDollars 279m (USDollars 101.4m) last year, reflecting the
extent it has shrunk from its previous status as one of the country's
largest conglomerates.
Its profit margin rose, however, from 1.5 per cent to 10 per cent to help
raise pre-tax profit from MDollars 30m in 1989 to MDollars 52m, the best it
achieved in more than a decade of its troubled and heavily borrowed life.
After-tax profit and minority interests stood at MDollars 26m, or 3.5
Malaysian cents in earnings per share, compared with 0.8 cents previously.
Over the past year, the group, under Mr Lim Thian Kiat, chief executive, has
shrunk from six divisions to four; banking, shipping, property and lottery.
The rationalisation - which produced MDollars 110m in net extraordinary gain
and MDollars 136m in attributable profit last year - still leaves shipping
yet to be sold, after the trading and engineering and plantation divisions.
Multi-Purpose's lottery operation remains its biggest earner, with after-tax
profit doubling to nearly MDollars 34m. This is followed by banking and
property.
The group plans to use the proceeds from last year's sales, in particularly
MDollars 478m from its plantations, to lift its Dunlop Estate stake in the
Magnum lottery, leisure and finance group from 40 to 100 per cent.
Last March, Dunlop raised MDollars 310m, MDollars 260m of it in 10 per cent,
five-year loan stocks, to acquire 30 per cent in Magnum from a friendly
party. But Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank has urged minority shareholders to
reject the rest of the offer, at MDollars 7.42 a share, compared with more
than MDollars 10 being traded.
Reconstruction at Magnum and Dunlop is in the pipeline, by consolidating its
lottery operations under a new listed group and expanding its finance
operations through the acquisition of a stockbroker.

GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket chain, has warned
that if current trends continue, the group could see a sharp profits slump
in the three months to mid-June.
Mr Jim Wood, the company chairman, said results from A&amp;P's Canadian

'A continuation of the present trend in the current quarter which ends June
15, could result in a decline in overall profits by as much as 30 per cent
below the same of last year,' he said.
In the first quarter of its 1990-91 calender year, A&amp;P said that it had
earnings per share of Dollars 1.33 and net income of Dollars 51m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOINT Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker
owned by Boeing of the US, should be allowed to go ahead, despite strong
local political and union opposition to the deal, said Mr Fausto Cereti,
chairman of the Italian aerospace group Alenia.
He was speaking at the first shareholders' meeting of Alenia, the company
created by the merger in December of Aeritalia and Selenia, the Italian
state-owned aircraft and defence electronics companies. Mr Cereti confirmed
that Canadian government approval for the de Havilland acquisition was still
some way off.
Negotiations between Alenia and Aerospatiale, its French partner, and
Investment Canada, the Canadian federal body responsible for vetting foreign
investment projects, were 'in a preliminary phase', he said.
Presenting Alenia's first post-merger figures, Mr Cereti announced a sharp
cut in the dividend to L90 a share from the L130 paid by Aeritalia in its
last full year as an independent company in 1989. Selenia was not previously
quoted.
Mr Cereti blamed the decline on new uncertainties in Italian and
international defence spending following the collapse of the eastern bloc.
Changes in Italian defence policy have already damaged Alenia's cash-flow.
Working capital and net borrowing rose sharply last year after the
government's decision to pay a much lower proportion of the value of its
defence contracts in advance. Overall group sales amounted to L4,900bn
(Dollars 3.8bn), while net profits were L101bn.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Japanese to lift stake in
Brazilian steel mill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN obstacle hindering Brazil's first significant privatisation - that of
Usiminas, its largest steel mill - was removed yesterday with the signing of
an accord substantially raising the equity of the company's Japanese
shareholders.
After months of negotiations it was agreed that Nippon Usiminas, a Nippon
Steel-led consortium of 54 Japanese companies as well as the Japanese
government, would have its stake in Usiminas increased from 4.6 per cent to
13 per cent.
The agreement resolves years of complaints by the Japanese over the
systematic reduction of their equity which, as a result of government
accounting practices, was reduced from 25 per cent.
Usiminas was established in 1958 as a joint Brazilian-Japanese venture to
provide steel for the motor and naval industries. The Japanese put up 52 per
cent of the capital and retained 40 per cent of the equity, the maximum a
foreign company could hold.
Nippon Steel provided the latest equipment and technical assistance making
the mill the most efficient in Brazil. But government price controls on
steel to subsidise other industries, and more recently to keep down
inflation, prevented it becoming the profitable venture envisaged. So, as
Brazil increased investment in Usiminas, the Japanese cut their
participation to hold only 25 per cent of the equity.
The real blow came in 1976 when all state steel companies were brought under
the control of Siderbras which, through redirecting tax reimbursements,
drastically reduced the equity participation of Nippon Usiminas from 25 per
cent to 4.6 per cent.
The story of Usiminas is seen as highlighting the problems Japanese
investors have had in Brazil. 'This is Japan's saddest experience in
Brazil,' said Mr Toshiro Kobayashi, president of the Council of the Bank of
Tokyo and also head of the committee to promote Brazilian-Japanese
relations.
'Not only was Japanese equity slashed, but because of government
intervention in the steel sector Japanese investors have never received a
dividend.'
Consequently when Usiminas was placed top of the Collor government's targets
for privatisation the Japanese threatened to block it unless their equity
was increased.
Yesterday's accord to raise their share to 13 per cent means the
privatisation is expected to proceed in July. There is unlikely to be any
Japanese interest.
Mr Hiroyuki Nakagawa, president of Nippon Steel in Brazil, said, 'With price
controls active I can't see any Japanese buyers. We have enjoyed nothing
from our investment in Usiminas.' Last year Usiminas made a real loss
despite a declared profit.

TWO leading US steel companies reported first-quarter losses as the US
recession hit demand for their products, particularly in the automotive and
consumer white goods markets.
USX, the largest steel manufacturer in the US, reported a first-quarter net
loss of Dollars 237m, or 94 cent a share, compared with net income of
Dollars 176m, or 66 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Sales
were Dollars 4.5bn, against Dollars 4.7bn. The figures included Dollars 346m
of one-time restructuring charges.
Its steel business reported an operating loss of Dollars 502m, or Dollars
180m without restructuring charges, but its Marathon energy operations
produced operating income of Dollars 229m, including a Dollars 24m
restructuring charge, aided by a strong downstream performance.
Mr Charles Corry, the chairman, said the downstream energy business should
be helped by the coming summer driving season.
National Steel, the fifth largest US manufacturer, reported a net loss of
Dollars 64.4m in the first quarter on sales of Dollars 524m, compared with a
net loss of Dollars 4.2m on sales of Dollars 612m in 1990.

<TEXT>
A US District court judge has ruled that bondholders at Trans World Airlines
are entitled to repossess at least 10 aircraft, together with some
additional jet engines, as a result of the carrier's failure to meet
payments on certain notes.
Connecticut National Bank, trustee for the relevant notes, would not comment
on the ruling. But TWA said it had proposed a settlement which would involve
the outstanding interest and a moratorium on the outstanding principal until
February 1992, which it hoped would be accepted.
The investors brought an action against the carrier last month, after
negotiations to reschedule payments on the notes failed to reach a
conclusion. TWA, which made heavy losses in 1990 and has amassed debts of
Dollars 2.5bn, failed to meet payment on some of its bondholder debt in
February.
Judge Gerard Goettel's ruling, which followed a hearing last week,
acknowledged that 'by forcing TWA to turn over the property, its ability to
serve consumers may well be diminished and there may also be a threat to the
jobs of TWA employees.'
There has been much debate about TWA's future recently, with its owner, Mr
Carl Icahn, anxious to sell its London routes to American Airlines for
Dollars 445m, while West Coast investor, Mr Kirk Kerkorian, offered to buy
the entire airline if it retained those routes. The US Department of
Transportation approved the sale of the three main London routes last week,
but TWA's unions and the city of St Louis have now filed an appeal against
this decision.
TWA said it would not accept less than Dollars 445m for the sale of the
three routes.

COMPAGNIE de Suez, the French investment and banking conglomerate, has
announced final net attributable profits of FFr3.71bn (Dollars 620m) for
last year, slightly higher than its earlier estimates, writes George Graham
in Paris.
Suez said yesterday that the result represented a 9 per cent fall from
1989's FFr4.06bn, but only a 4 per cent decline if the FFr189m one-off
negative effect of a change in accounting policy on swaps and deferred
taxation were stripped out.
The company said it planned to convert all its outstanding preferred
non-voting stock, with a proposed dividend of FFr8.08, into ordinary shares,
whose proposed dividend is FFr7.80, on the basis of 21 preferred for 20
ordinary.
This operation, with the absorption of the last 10 per cent stake in Societe
Generale de Belgique that Suez has agreed to acquire from Cerus, the holding
company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, and the incorporation of its investment
vehicle Compagnie La Henin, will result in the creation of 9.1m new shares.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: GM and Ford post heavy losses as
recession bites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SEVERE slump in US automobile demand was underscored yesterday when
General Motors and Ford, the two leading American manufacturers, reported
heavy first-quarter losses. Ford warned the US recession would make it
difficult for the company to earn a profit in 1991.
However, while Ford produced figures worse than analysts' expectations, GM's
losses were not as great as Wall Street had feared. GM's performance in
Europe was also markedly better than Ford's.
GM announced a loss of Dollars 461m, or 78 cents a share, compared with
earnings of Dollars 619m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in the same period last
year. Revenues dipped from Dollars 30.1bn to Dollars 29.2bn. But GM's
figures were flattered by two non-recurring items: a Dollars 403m gain on
the sale of its New York office building and a Dollars 303m accounting
change. Excluding these, the company suffered a net loss of Dollars 1.17bn,
but even that was better than analysts forecasts of losses as high as
Dollars 1.8bn.
Ford reported a loss of Dollars 884m on revenues of Dollars 21.3bn, against
earnings last year of Dollars 506m on revenues of Dollars 23.6bn. That
compared with Wall Street loss forecasts ranging from Dollars 625m to
Dollars 800m.
The US motor industry is suffering from a slump in domestic demand at a time
of severe manufacturing overcapacity, exacerbated by the rapid build-up of
Japanese manufacturing plants in the country. Producers have slashed prices
to move stock and the Big Three US companies - GM, Ford and Chrysler - are
implementing cost-saving programmes.
Both GM and Ford forecast a gradual economic recovery in the US, but Ford
said it was unlikely the company would be profitable for the second quarter
and would probably record a loss for the full-year.
Over the past year GM and Ford's US problems have been partly offset by
strong performances in the European market, but that is weakening. This was
reflected at Ford, which said its overseas operations lost Dollars 208m in
the quarter, against earnings of Dollars 155m a year ago. In the US, Ford's
automotive operations lost Dollars 947m, against earnings of Dollars 160m.
GM said its overseas profitability was strong, helped by record earnings in
Europe.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Thomson announces FFr2.47bn
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY restructuring costs forced Thomson, the flagship of the French
state-owned electronics industry, into a FFr2.47bn (Dollars 414m) net loss
last year, from profits of FFr497m in 1989.
The group yesterday announced a FFr2.9bn one-off charge, to cover job losses
in its two main divisions, Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) and the
partially privatised Thomson-CSF defence electronics group. There were no
provisions in 1989.
Consumer electronics has been hit by a plunge in US demand, the dollar's
fall and a price war against fierce Japanese competition, while defence
electronics has suffered from the pressure on military budgets worldwide.
Last month, the French government pledged nearly FFr2bn of fresh capital for
Thomson, which is forecasting a return to profits this year, at least at
group level.
The state has also promised to provide FFr4bn during the next two years to
Bull, the computer maker which forms the other main leg of the state
electronics industry, and which recently announced a record FFr6.8bn loss
for 1990. The European Commission is studying whether the capital injections
contravene EC controls on state aid.
Thomson's group net operating profits, before the exceptional charge, rose
by 2.5 per cent to FFr1.6bn last year from FFr1.56bn in 1989. Turnover fell
by 1.9 per cent to FFr75.23bn from FFr76.66bn during the same period, mainly
because of the dollar's decline. North America accounted for nearly a
quarter of last year's sales. Pre-tax profits were unchanged at FFr1.43bn.
Yesterday's net loss was no surprise, since both TCE and Thomson-CSF had
already published their results, showing that the group had had a tough
year. TCE announced a 1990 loss of FFr2.7bn after charges of FFr1.8bn, while
Thomson-CSF's net profits fell 17.4 per cent to FFr2.17bn, after a FFr1.1bn
charge.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Tobishima president replaced by
father
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a change of generations yesterday at Tobishima Corporation, a
century-old Japanese construction company with a recent history of
aggressive and unsuccessful property dealings. Mr Akira Tobishima was
replaced as president by his 78-year-old father, Mr Hitoshi Tobishima.
Mr Akira Tobishima was forced yesterday to take the blame for leading the
company into debt and for making it a symbol of the many conservative
Japanese firms led astray by speculative temptation.
Tobishima, one of the country's leading contractors, is entangled in the
financial mess left by Nanatomi, a stock speculator and land developer which
collapsed earlier this year with debts of about Y300bn (Dollars 2.2bn), the
third largest Japanese bankruptcy on record.
Nanatomi was formed by seven ex-Tobishima officials, known as the 'seven
samurai', and, when the company collapsed in January, Tobishima had
outstanding loans and guarantees totalling Y123.4bn. Tobishima had become a
keen property developer, and Mr Akira Tobishima, who authorised a spate of
US purchases, wanted to run a international chain of five-star hotels.
Mr Tobishima, whose resignation will be formally put to a shareholders'
meeting in June, yesterday confessed that he had relied too little on
construction and too much on real estate development 'in attempting to
increase profits rapidly'. The company is now being restructured by Fuji
Bank, which wants properties sold quickly to reduce the present debt of
Y370bn by Y150bn.
Mr Hitoshi Tobishima had left the presidency to take the largely ceremonial
post of chairman six years ago, and it is expected that a new chairman will
be appointed by Fuji Bank, which has a 4.8 per cent stake in the contractor.
As is expected of Japanese banks in such situations, Fuji has indicated to
creditors that it is handling Tobishima's financial affairs and assured them
that there is no danger of the company defaulting.
It is known that Fuji Bank, Japan's fifth largest, is embarrassed by the
close links between Tobishima and Nanatomi, which had bought shares in
tandem with the Koshin speculator group. Koshin's leader, Mr Mitsuhiro
Kotani, has admitted to charges of stock price manipulation.
Tobishima is hoping that some of the Nanatomi losses will be recouped
through the completion this year of a Y100bn businessman's resort, the
Nanatomi Club, which the failed company had boasted would offer next-century
facilities at this-century prices.

</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's largest retail bank, yesterday reported
a 26 per cent rise in first-quarter cash-flow to Pta70.3bn (Dollars 645m).
Pre-tax profits advanced 6 per cent to Pta31.8bn.
BBV's operating profits of Pta83.9bn were nearly 5 per cent below the
Pta88.4bn reported in the first quarter of last year. However it was 3.4 per
cent up on the Pta83.9bn posted in the final three months of last year.
The bank endured a marked narrowing of its margins in 1990 when it launched
costly financial products during a fierce battle for market share among
Spain's retail banks.
BBV said the latest quarterly result, which still bore the burden of the
1990 marketing effort, would be the most unfavourable of those to be
reported this year.
In contrast to BBV, Banco Popular, the Spanish bank 43 per cent-owned by
foreign investors, reported after-tax profits for the quarter of Pta11.6bn,
14.6 per cent up on the same period last year.
The results, which extend the strong performance shown by the bank in recent
years, represent an operating margin of 6.6 per cent, against the 6.47 per
cent for 1990.
A third Spanish bank, Banco Hispano Americano, posted a 0.3 per cent rise in
margins, to Pta23.2bn, and pre-tax profits of Pta13.2bn, an 11.3 per cent
increase on the first quarter of 1990.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Baird seeks Pounds 39m for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM BAIRD, the textile and engineering group, yesterday joined the
rights issue rush by announcing plans for a 1-for-5 issue at 210p to raise
Pounds 39m for further expansion.
Mr Donald Parr, chairman, said Baird was keen to expand organically and by
acquisition within both textiles and engineering in the UK and other
countries. He said the troubled state of both industries has created 'many
interesting opportunities' for acquisitions.
Baird's shares, which have rallied in recent months, fell by 20p to 238p on
the announcement. In the rights issue, which is underwritten by Robert
Fleming and distributed by James Capel, Baird will issue 18.62m new ordinary
shares.
News of the cash call came on the same day as the takeover battle between
Coats Viyella and Tootal, two other large UK textile groups, gathered
momentum as Coats raised its offer for Tootal.
The textile industry has suffered severely in the present recession. Baird,
one of the more resilient members of the industry, with long-established
contacts with Marks and Spencer, recently reported static pre-tax profits of
Pounds 33.8m on turnover of Pounds 519.6m for 1990.
Mr Parr said the emphasis of expansion in textiles would be in the low
labour cost economies of Asia, although Baird also plans to continue
investment in the UK. Baird, like other British textile groups, is sourcing
an increasingly high proportion of its products - 25 per cent of last year's
Pounds 400m textile turnover - from Asia.
Baird is also keen to expand its engineering interests in continental
Europe, where it already has operations in France and Belgium.
The group had Pounds 33m of borrowings - with gearing of 26 per cent - at
its last year end. This meant it was comfortably within its committed
facilities of over Pounds 70m. However, Mr Parr said the proceeds of the
rights issue should enable Baird to take advantage of future expansion
opportunities without allowing gearing to reach an 'uncomfortable' level.
Baird also yesterday announced changes in its senior management team. Mr
Nicholas Webster is leaving his current post as finance director - where he
will be succeeded by a new recruit - to become chief executive of Baird
Textiles. Mr Ken Patton, a senior executive in the textile division, is
joining the main board.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: S&amp;U improves 21% to Pounds 3.43m

<TEXT>
Shares of S&amp;U Stores, the consumer credit, TV rental and hosiery maker,
yesterday rose 12p to 138p after Mr Derek Coombs, chairman, unveiled a 21
per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.43m for the year to
end-January.
The advance, from the previous year's Pounds 2.83m which included Pounds
343,000 from property sales compared with only Pounds 24,000 this time, was
on turnover of Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 43.6m).
A proposed final dividend of 6p raises the total by 2p to 8p. Earnings
emerged at 21.53p (17.8p) per share.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift held back by US offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NU-SWIFT, the fire protection and office services group, reported marginally
lower profits of Pounds 31.17m for 1990.
The outcome, which compared with taxable profits of Pounds 31.83m in 1989,
came on turnover of Pounds 342.31m (Pounds 444.26m). About Pounds 99m of the
fall was attributable to the disposal in February 1990 of its holding in
Sicli, the French fire extinguisher company.
As reported at the interim stage, net profit on the disposal was taken as a
below-the-line credit of Pounds 115m; this generated interest receivable of
Pounds 22m by the year-end.
UK operations showed improved profits of Pounds 6.08m (Pounds 5.99m), but
National Cleaning, the US offshoot, encountered 'difficult trading
conditions' in the second half and contributed Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 8.88m).
Favourable currency fluctuations, however, helped reduce financing costs of
the operation to Pounds 5.44m (Pounds 6.36m).
Nu-Swift currently holds a 27.7 per cent stake in London Securities, the
property group, and investments taken out through the joint venture were
expected to show both revenue and capital gains in the future, directors
said.
Earnings per 5p share emerged at 42.18p (36.85p) and a proposed final
dividend of 10p lifts the total by 3p to 18p.
The company's shares will move from the main market to the USM on May 7.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Yule Catto slips to Pounds 20.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1990, a year of significant change, Yule Catto, the plantations,
chemicals and building products company, reported pre-tax profits down by
almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 20.51m.
However, the Essex-based company still managed to improve earnings per
share, from 13.9p to 14.2p, for the tenth year in succession.
Mr Allister McLeish, finance director, said that the earnings performance
was helped by the sale of the Malaysian plantations, profits of which had
been subject to a high tax rate and a 35 per cent minority interest.
The shares improved 10p to close at 143p.
Lord Catto, chairman, said the sale, plus four acquisitions during the year
completed the company's move from its traditional activities in tropical
agriculture to an industrial company with a well balanced portfolio.
There was a turnround for speciality chemicals towards the end of the year
with margins partially restored and many operations enjoying good demand
from new overseas customers. However, there was a depressed market for
consumer chemicals.
Building products produced good organic growth helped by acquisitions.
Unilock Holdings, bought in August, had been integrated into the division.
Lower harvests and commodity prices reduced the contribution from the
agriculture and land division. At the end of October agreement was reached
to sell its stake in Yule Catto Plantations for Pounds 16.5m cash.
Gearing increased over the 12 months from 25 per cent to 81 per cent largely
as a result of writing off acquisition goodwill of Pounds 19.5m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 253.66m (Pounds 251m). A proposed final dividend
of 2.7p makes a total for the year of 4.7p (4.5p).

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle Australian bid battle
intensifies
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS TRUST Australia, the fund manager, has emerged with a 7.9 per cent
stake in Bundaberg Sugar which could block Tate &amp; Lyle's bid for the
Queensland sugar miller and refiner, or force the UK sweetener group to
increase its hostile ADollars 325m (Pounds 150m) offer.
Tate &amp; Lyle's bid for Bundaberg is conditional upon 90 per cent acceptance
and approval by the foreign investment authorities in Australia.
BTA has been the dominant buyer of Bundaberg's stock since Tate &amp; Lyle
launched its offer on March 19 at an initial ADollars 3.70 per share. Tate &amp;
Lyle revised its bid to Dollars 4.10 per share when it mailed its formal
documents last week.
The fund manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bankers Trust of the US, has
bought 2.1m shares, lifting its stake from the 5.2 per cent held before the
Tate &amp; Lyle offer.
BTA is understood to have valued Bundaberg at ADollars 4.40 per share. It
lodged a substantial shareholder notice with the Australian stock exchange
yesterday, revealing its increased holding in Bundaberg.
Macquarie Bank, Bundaberg's adviser, has valued the stock at between
ADollars 4.54 and ADollars 5.16 per share, supporting a recommendation from
directors for shareholders to reject the Tate &amp; Lyle offer.
Mr Bill Beerworth, Tate &amp; Lyle's Australian adviser, described the Macquarie
valuation as 'disappointing, incomplete and rose-coloured.'
BTA is Australia's third largest fund manager with more than ADollars 10bn
under management. It has developed a reputation for astute investments and
high returns.
Mr Ross Finley, a BTA director, declined to reveal the strategy behind his
bank's heavy buying. Logically, BTA's aim is to force Tate &amp; Lyle to pay
more for Bundaberg.
Bundaberg's share price has consistently traded below the offer price,
however, because investors generally fear that the UK group might withdraw
its offer.
Bundaberg shares closed at ADollars 3.83, 27 cents below the bid price.

Bellwinch, the south of England housebuilder, said yesterday it was in
negotiations for an injection of capital to 'strengthen its position.'
The company, which had been due to announce results for the half-year to
end-December yesterday, said it hoped the negotiations would be concluded
satisfactorily in the near future. It would then announce interim results.
At yesterday's 10p share price, Bellwinch was valued at Pounds 3.3m.
The company reported a taxable deficit of Pounds 4.85m, against pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3.22m, for the year to end-June 1990.
Gearing at the last balance sheet date stood at 77 per cent. That was after
taking account of Bellwinch's acquisition last September of the remaining
shares, and the debt, in Basingshire, a former associated company which owns
the freehold to a parcel of land at Millwall.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENACRE GROUP, which last November changed its name from Brewmaker to
reflect its concentration on nursing and residential care home activities,
lifted taxable profits from Pounds 496,733 to Pounds 535,521 in the year to
end-January.
Turnover declined to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 5.64m) due to the sale of the
homebrew manufacturing business in August.
Mr Tony Acton, chairman, said that nursing and residential homes had been
firmly established as the group's main business, with more than 80 per cent
of earnings coming from that source.
The group expects to more than double the number of beds in its homes from
209 to 500 by the end of the year.
It has already raised an initial Pounds 3.78m through a rights issue and a
partly paid subscription of convertible preference shares.
The sale of the brewing business resulted in a deferred extraordinary loss
of Pounds 90,000 but the group expects this to be cancelled out by the sale
of the related leasehold property, which is expected to result in an overall
profit of Pounds 100,000.
Group borrowings of Pounds 850,000 put gearing at about 11 per cent.
Earnings per share were down to 0.47p (0.55p) and a recommended final
dividend of 0.125p brings the total to 0.225p (0.2p).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Computers (ICL), the UK-based information technology company
in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, has formed a new joint
venture company specialising in computer disaster standby services.
Its partner is Sherwood Computer Services, a Gloucester-based company which
specialises in computer systems for the insurance market.
Computer disaster recovery services involve providing a fully equipped data
processing centre which a concern struck by fire, flood or other disasters
can take over at a moment's notice.
Heightened awareness that many companies run the risk of going out of
business if their computers are put out of action has encouraged computing
services companies to believe disaster recovery would be a strong growth
sector.
However, the recession has dampened those expectations and price competition
has been fierce.
Sherwood had been looking for a partner to share the costs and risks of its
existing disaster recovery business for some months to enable it to
concentrate on its core business: its disaster recovery service made losses
before tax of Pounds 242,000 on revenues of Pounds 2.7m last year, leaving
the company with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m.
The deal is subject to options giving Sherwood the right to require ICL to
acquire its shareholding in 1994 for a maximum of Pounds 975,000 and ICL the
right to require Sherwood to sell its shareholding in 1996 for a maximum of
Pounds 1.5m.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Burnfield raising Pounds 7.6m for
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNFIELD, the acquisition vehicle of Mr Brian McGowan, former chief
executive of Williams Holdings, has bought the privately-owned Budenberg
Gauge Company for Pounds 8m.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 4.3m new ordinary
shares, of which 4.1m have been placed with institutions to raise Pounds
7.59m, subject to clawback on the basis of one for every 3.5 shares held.
Net assets of Budenberg, a manufacturer of pressure gauges and testing
equipment, amounted to Pounds 5.9m before taking into account the valuation
of the freehold properties. It also has Pounds 500,000 cash.
Its three directors, who are brothers, are retiring. They will take 200,000
of the new Burnfield shares and Pounds 7.59m in cash. Mr McGowan described
them as Cambridge academics who had not managed their company as
aggressively as they might.
Burnfield was created in September 1990 out of Isopad, a surface heating
system maker, as a holding company to purchase businesses.
Budenberg will bring Burnfield's assets to Pounds 15m, with a little less
than Pounds 1m of debt. 'We are not in the business of getting geared up.
Those that do often go bust,' Mr McGowan said.
He added that the acquisition of Budenberg, at a price approximating to net
asset value, showed that there were many good opportunities to buy
companies.
Earlier this month Burnfield announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
2m to Pounds 1.4m, before exceptional items, for the 11 months to December.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Blackwood Hodge Pounds 17.9m in red and
ceasing payouts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKWOOD HODGE, the international distributor of earth-moving equipment
taken over last autumn by BM Group, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.9m
for the six months ended last December compared with a profit of Pounds
11.4m a year earlier.
It said it would cease paying dividends on preferred or ordinary shares
because difficult trading conditions were likely to result in a 'substantial
deficit of distributable reserves' for the period to end-June.
Turnover fell from Pounds 240.1m to Pounds 181.7m, reflecting disposals and
other actions initiated by BM. Restructuring costs and the write-down of
assets resulted in an extraordinary loss of Pounds 13.9m. The net loss after
the charge and the last preference share dividends totalling Pounds 725,000
was Pounds 34.9m (12.74p per share) against a profit of Pounds 6m (5.09p)
before.
The company will continue to report results because its preference shares
remain outstanding but it has changed its fiscal year-end to June 30 to
match BM's.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Polly Peck's bank creditors jostle for
committee places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK CREDITORS of Polly Peck International, the fresh fruit to electronics
group which has been in administration since last October, are jostling for
scarce places on the formal creditors' committee to be set up later this
month.
Under the terms the Insolvency Act the committee, to be appointed at a
creditors' meeting on May 24, can consist of no more than five members.
So, with about 100 bank creditors, and 28,000 creditors in all, competition
for a seat is believed to be intense.
A place on the committee will give a bank power to influence the detailed
restructuring proposals being drawn up by the group's three administrators,
from Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Touche Ross.
Those said to be in the best position to win a seat on the committee are
banks which, though not large creditors in their own right, lead banking
syndicates and so can count on the support of other banks within these
groupings. They include Credit Suisse First Boston, Hungarian International
Bank and Mizrahi Bank.
Warburg Soditic, the Swiss arm of Warburg, which led several Swiss franc
bond issues for Polly Peck, is also likely to have the backing of enough
creditors to secure a place.
That leaves only one seat for other bank creditors. Standard Chartered, one
of the largest creditors, is known to want a place, but other banks are
likely to be competing as well.
To appease creditors, Mr Michael Jordan, one of the administrators from
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has proposed to give a further ten institutions a say
through an additional, informal committee.
But under law these institutions could have no vote and therefore no direct
say in the progress of the administration.
Most of the ten informal committee places will go to banks, but some are
being reserved for Polly Peck's trade creditors and shareholders.
Competition between banks to get on to the formal, five-member committee is
likely to present a problem for the administrators at the creditors'
meeting, to be held at Alexandra Palace in north London. Under law, a
creditor can only be appointed to the committee if it gets the support of
other creditors who speak for at least 50 per cent of the company's debts.
It is thought likely that, with banks competing for a place, the vote will
be split and few if any will achieve the necessary 50 per cent level.
A broad outline of the Polly Peck administrators' restructuring proposals is
due to be sent to all creditors on May 7, to be voted on at the May 24
meeting. The documents are expected to contain some detail on the financial
state of the group, but little new information on the state of its finances
in northern Cyprus, where administrators have been trying to track down
Pounds 200m.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 108m leveraged buy-out at Devro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESS which dominates the British market for sausage skins has come to
the rescue of that recently most unfashionable piece of financial
engineering, the leveraged buy-out.
Scotland will be the headquarters of the international sausage casing
manufacturer Devro, which has moved into independent ownership through a
Pounds 107.7m management-led buy-out from its US parent Johnson and Johnson,
the healthcare group.
The buy-out has been masterminded by Charterhouse Development Capital, a
subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The deal has been carefully structured to take account of Scottish
sensibilities. A previous buy-out in 1989 was abandoned after attracting
considerable hostile reaction from Scottish politicians and trade unions.
Devro has guaranteed the jobs of all 600 people it employs at its plants in
Moodiesburn, outside Glasgow, and Bellshill in Lanarkshire. It also has
manufacturing facilities in New Jersey, Canada and Australia.
Although the headquarters of the independent company will be at Moodiesburn,
it aims to continue to expand, notably in the Far East and Europe. Last year
it made operating profits of Pounds 17.6m on turnover of Pounds 70.1m.
Devro's chairman and chief executive is Mr Frank de Angeli, 65, a former
main board director of Johnson and Johnson, who retired at the end of 1989.
He will be based in London, but will travel extensively between Scotland and
the overseas operations.
Although the sausage market is slowly declining in mature developed regions
such as the UK, Mr Angeli said there was growing demand for the group's
products in areas such as the Far East, as younger people adopt more Western
tastes.
Charterhouse will be the main institutional investor. The others
participating in the Pounds 30m of institutional equity are Baring,
Citicorp, Clydesdale, County NatWest, Dunedin and Standard Life.
Senior debt finance of Pounds 68m has been provided by a syndicate of
international banks led by the First National Bank of Chicago, Industrial
Bank of Japan and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mezzanine finance of Pounds
12.2m has been provided by a syndicate led by Mezzanine Management.
Mr Gordon Bonnyman, managing director of Charterhouse, said Devro was a
textbook candidate for a buy-out with a quality product and high earnings.
It was not too highly geared, with the interest bill covered twice by
operating profits.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Evered Bardon to Pounds
44m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS in the UK and US helped Evered Bardon, the quarrying products
group, to a 12.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 39m to
Pounds 43.9m.
Although the group's name has been changed since Evered's merger with Bardon
two months ago, the 1990 results reflected Evered's performance.
Turnover rose by 32 per cent to Pounds 253.1m (Pounds 192.5m), operating
profit was some 19 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.9m (Pounds 41.8m) and net
interest costs more than doubled to Pounds 6m (Pounds 2.8m).
However, earnings suffered from the extra paper issued to make acquisitions,
including a 3-for-10 rights issue at 125p per share in September 1989. In
spite of a low tax charge, earnings per share fell 15 per cent to 12.7p
(15p). Fully taxed, the decline would have been been 21 per cent to 10p.
Mr Roy Kettle, deputy chairman, said that acquisitions - mostly early in the
year - and capital spending totalled about Pounds 250m last year.
The biggest chunk was the Pounds 114m purchase of Civil and Marine (CAM), a
UK producer of sand and gravel. It contributed Pounds 10.5m of operating
profit and enabled the recovery of Pounds 3.1m in advance corporation tax.
CAM had a favourable effect on UK operating margins. Turnover rose 20 per
cent to Pounds 139.2m (Pounds 115.6m), while profit increased by 29 per cent
to Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 19.5m). Without CAM, the decline would have been
just over 25 per cent.
In the US, the main newcomers, Millville and Superconcrete in the
Maryland/Washington DC area, helped turnover nearly double to Pounds 106.9m
(Pounds 55.7m), but lower margins were reflected in a 34 per cent operating
profit increase to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 16.3m).
Mr Kettle warned of the ill effects on the Maryland business of a state
moratorium on road building. The group had two big quarries, but there was
only enough work for one.
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said the combined group's workforce had been
reduced.
A maintained final dividend of 3.66p makes a total of 5.595p (5.46p).
In 1990, Bardon's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 3.9m from Pounds 12.1m for
nine months to December 1989 after US losses. Turnover was Pounds 118.3m.
COMMENT
Evered, which came into the quarrying business through the London and
Northern acquisition in 1987, has splashed out a lot of cash, or more
particularly paper, to claw its way into the top half dozen aggregates
companies, behind the likes of Tarmac, ARC and RMC. With the group barely
pausing for breath to make its existing businesses sweat, a disappointing
earnings line has been reflected in a near-30 per cent underperformance of
the market since last summer. Nearly 100m more shares issued for Bardon,
plus a rising tax charge, means that the combined management will have to
run hard just to limit the earnings damage. Pre-tax profit is forecast to
fall to Pounds 33m-Pounds 35m, giving a prospective p/e of 14 to 15 on
yesterday's close of 94p. On anything less than a three-year view, it looks
expensive.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Water companies in rationalisation pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPROVAL HAS been given for three water supply companies in south-east
England to rationalise their day-to-day operations under a single management
team.
Eastbourne Water, Mid Sussex Water and West Kent Water are to retain their
separate identities and continue to supply water to 650,000 customers under
their existing company names, but there should be significant cost benefits.
This year's average K figure - the amount above the rate of inflation the
companies are allowed to increase their charges - will be about 2.7 per cent
lower.
Mr Ian Byatt, director general of water services, the industry's economic
regulator, has agreed that a single licence will be issued to a new holding
company, South East Water, to cover all three companies.
Water company mergers are not welcomed by the regulator because of the need
to make cost and efficiency comparisons with as many operators as possible.
However, the new arrangements do not involve a reference to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission as the three companies are already controlled by Saur
Water Services, which acquired its controlling interest before January 11
1989 when merger references were made compulsory.
Mr Byatt said yesterday: 'I would argue strongly against any reduction in
the number of independent water companies if it affects my ability to make
comparisons of their efficiency . . . but there is a strong argument in
favour of grouping the three companies under a single management team. It
will mean customers will stand to benefit from lower charges.'

FT  01 MAY 91 / Jaguar to stay in the red with Pounds 70m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the UK luxury car maker and a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is
expected to report later this month a pre-tax loss of around Pounds 70m for
1990, a further deterioration from a loss of Pounds 49.3m in 1989.
Mr Bill Hayden, Jaguar chairman, said financial pressures were forcing a
delay of up to 12 months in development programmes of crucial new models for
the second half of the decade.
Jaguar, taken over by Ford in late 1989 for Pounds 1.4bn, was hit hard last
year by the recession in the UK luxury and executive car market and by the
weakness of the US dollar. The US is its largest single market.
World sales fell 9.8 per cent last year to 42,754 with a 25.1 per cent UK
fall. Production was cut by 13 per cent to 41,883.
The pressure on the luxury car market has intensified this year. In the
first quarter, Jaguar's world sales plunged 45.4 per cent to only 6,774,
while output fell 57.8 per cent to 5,339 from 12,652 a year ago.
In North America, first-quarter sales were 2,278, a 54.7 per cent drop from
a year earlier. First-quarter sales in the UK fell 43.2 per cent to 2,104
and in the rest of Europe by 34.5 per cent to 1,582. The only bright spot
was Japan, where sales were unchanged at 590.
The company has taken drastic action to lower output and cut costs. It
stopped production for six weeks in the first quarter in order to cut
bloated stock levels.
Jaguar forecasts 1991 output of about 34,500 cars and sales of 36-37,000,
the lowest levels since 1984 when it was privatised.
It is completing a programme to cut its workforce by around 1,050 through
early retirement and voluntary redundancies. Up to 500 more jobs could be
cut by the end of the year.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Ex-chairman jailed for insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER company chair-man was jailed after pleading guilty at St Albans
Crown Court yesterday to what the court was told was the biggest insider
dealing operation discovered in the UK.
Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the Leeds-based timber and
clothing company, will be the first person convicted of insider dealing to
serve a jail sentence.
He was sentenced to 18 months, of which nine months were suspended. As he
had been in custody awaiting trial for five months he will have four more to
serve, subject to any remission. He was also disqualified from acting as a
company director for 10 years.
A warrant for Mr Goodman's arrest had been issued by the court when he
failed to appear for trial in September. He was arrested in Leeds in
December.
Yesterday he pleaded guilty to a single charge under the 1985 Company
Securities (Insider Dealing) Act, which alleged that while chairman of
Unigroup and prohibited from dealing in its shares he sold 690,209 Unigroup
shares.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which brought the prosecution, alleged
that he avoided a loss of about Pounds 1m by disposing of the shares just
before the company announced worse-than-expected figures in October 1987. Mr
Tudor Owen, for the DTI, said the operation had begun when Mr Goodman
purported to give the shares to his girlfriend. A few days later the holding
was sold for Pounds 1.67 per share, netting Mr Goodman just under Pounds
1.2m.
The shares had been sold, and Mr Goodman had resigned as chairman, a few
days before Unigroup's shares were suspended by the Stock Exchange at the
company's request. When dealings were resumed five months later the shares
traded at 55p.
In November 1987 Chase Manhattan Securities, Unigroup's broker, confirmed
that it had acquired the 690,209 shares and had started civil proceedings
against Mr Goodman. The crown court heard that the action had resulted in
the share sale to Chase being set aside.
Only two other people have been given jail sentences for insider dealing
since it was made an offence almost 10 years ago. But in both cases the
sentence was suspended.
One was Mr Geoffrey Collier, former joint head of Morgan Grenfell
Securities, who was fined Pounds 25,000 and sentenced to 12 months in July
1987.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Acas sees strikes at record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD low in the number of strikes last year was matched by the highest
level of individual claims to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (Acas), the service said yesterday in its annual report.
The number of officially recorded strikes fell to a 55-year low in 1990. At
the same time, the number of individual conciliation claims that statutory
employment rights had been infringed was the highest since Acas was
established in 1975, the report stated.
The chairman of Acas, Mr Douglas Smith, said the low level of strikes
reflected a 'shift in the balance of power'. Unions had lost one in four of
their members over the past 10 years and were finding it difficult to
recruit among such groups as part-time workers and financial services
employees. Trade unions were also much more pragmatic about what needed to
be accepted in order to preserve jobs, he added.
Complaints alleging sex and race discrimination in employment were the
highest ever; formal complaints of unfair dismissal rose by almost a quarter
over 1989; and allegations of unlawful deductions from pay rose by about 50
per cent. Overall, there were more than 52,000 individual cases for
conciliation, the report stated. Requests for collective arbitration in
industrial disputes rose by 8 per cent to about 1,300.
Individuals were increasingly prepared to pursue their rights under the law,
said Mr Smith. In addition, the 'shake-out of labour' resulting from the
recession had increased all Acas's activities, he said.
The number of complaints relating to the implementation of redundancies
almost doubled during the year. These complaints often involved the methods
of selection for redundancy, according to the report.
An increasing number of organisations had sought to move away from
long-standing 'last in, first out' agreements in favour of other
arrangements which they considered offered the best path to a skilled and
balanced workforce, Acas said.
While unions still sought to match pay claims to inflation, it was
increasingly employers' views about what they could afford to pay that were
determining pay increases, said the report.
'It was notable, in particular, that where employers had been open and frank
about difficult trading circumstances and what might be needed to preserve
jobs, lower settlements proved possible,' Acas concluded.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Letter: A healthy lesson for teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER TEMPLETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The testing of seven-year-olds in schools is under way. For up to six
weeks this term my daughter's education is being replaced with a routine of
assessment and testing. The experience of the first week of this process has
been damaging and disruptive.
It is not entirely the actual testing which is at fault. My daughter appears
to find that relatively unproblematic. What upsets and confuses the children
is the change in the teacher's role which the testing requires and the
difficulty of managing the rest of the class while small groups are tested.
The close relationship of co-operation, investigation and questioning which
characterises good primary education has been replaced for the period by a
teacher who is not allowed to answer children's questions and cannot be
approached for lengths of time.
The process demands that children be tested to the point of failure. That in
itself is clearly wrong educationally. But to do this at the outset of
children's education, to deny them the possibility of learning for the value
they find in it for themselves, to defeat them as they start, is the action
of a government with no genuine educational intentions,
This week William Waldegrave, the health secretary, commended the management
of Hospital Trusts and suggested they know more about delivering patient
care than his department. Why does this not apply to teaching? The
discreditable behaviour of Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, in
continually intervening in points on teaching practice sits badly in
contrast.
The introduction of the national curriculum, despite its under-resourcing,
has required the development of pupil profiles. These provide a much more
informative picture than the levels one, two or three that these tests will
reveal and without weeks of classroom damage. Profiles could be used to
engage parents, teachers and pupils in constructive assessments.
We are fortunate that quality control in the workplace is not designed by
this government. This first round of testing at seven must be the last.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Listening to employees' (April 23), cites the Involvement
and Participation Association/Institute of Personnel Management code of
practice on employee involvement and says Mr Michael Howard, the employment
secretary, 'should consider endorsing it'. This association welcomes Mr
Howard's initiative, but you should be aware that the code was endorsed by
the then employment secretary, Tom King, at the time of its publication in
1983.
We feel that something more than endorsement is needed and would like to see
the code underpinned by statute. This would set clear minimum standards for
employee involvement. Such a development would be infinitely preferable to
the present Brussels proposals on employee involvement, would cause no
problem to those companies which have already made progress in this
direction, and could have a real impact on improving employee involvement.
We are currently collecting examples of where employee involvement has made
a direct impact on business performance.

Sir, If I understand Anthony Harris correctly ('Lesson from the indexed

likes plain chocolate and dislikes index-linked bonds.
I bought Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 1992 at Pounds 94 in 1987. Today
they stand at nearly Pounds 128, a potential tax-free gain of 36 per cent.
The 2 1/2 per cent 2001 I bought in 1988 shows a (tax-free) gain of about 25
per cent. No other stock (or share) has done as well for me.
By the way, I like both milk and plain chocolate. Perhaps that is why I do

Sir, Richard Lapper's report ('Lloyd's names face Pounds 100m cash call',

I trust that Names will require to be satisfied that syndicate managers were

FT  01 MAY 91 / Letter: No quick route to creating a free market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM EGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Implicit in Stanley Katz's excellent article ('East Europe should learn
from Asia', April 24) are also some lessons for the west with respect to the
regeneration of the former command economies.
First, despite the reservations that many would share about Mr Katz's
specific suggestions, there should be a wider acceptance of the fact that
western nations are no more experienced at building market economies in a
matter of weeks and months than anyone else. While the theoretical appeal of
an overnight metamorphosis is great, the (as yet still unknown) costs in
terms of jobs and livelihoods seem frequently to be dismissed rather
lightly.
Of course, the transition will inevitably involve high costs but, given the
fragile nature of the new democracies, failure to account correctly for the
crucially important public support for reform risks the failure of the
reform process itself. The exercise continues to be an experiment where
there is no place for narrow minds and capitalist dogmatism at the expense
of political and social sensitivity.
Moreover, to say we live in free market economies is to make a claim that
must be riddled with caveats. It is rather sanctimonious to insist that the
eastern Europeans should embrace the market while the west is often
reluctant to do the same. For example it is clear that the question of
property rights is central to the reform process and that the case for
privatisation is extremely strong.
However it could be argued that the British can hardly afford to preach
about privatisation on the basis of its recent experience, which boasts the
conversion of public monopolies to private ones and the legally enforced
protection of utilities from competition as its main features.
The temptation must be avoided smugly to assume that the west has all the
answers. There are far too many opportunities and aspirations at stake.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Foreign Affairs: Europe's teetering pillar - The French are
resisting Nato leaders' efforts to modify the continent's defence
arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government, I discovered on a recent visit to Paris, is strongly
against building a 'European pillar' of Nato, and is determined to thwart
British efforts to use the Western European Union (WEU) for that purpose.
Although it has joined in discussions on the Nato strategy review, it does
not like the way these discussions are going and has no intention of joining
any integrated Nato command structure, still less any of the 'multinational
corps' promised by Nato leaders in their London Declaration last year.
For President Francois Mitterrand, it seems, only two things are important.
One is the Atlantic alliance, which he sees as the essential reality of
European security today. He believes it works well as it is. France's
performance in the Gulf war showed, according to French officials, that you
do not need to be part of the integrated command in peacetime to function as
a good ally in war.
France, they point out, has always accepted that, in a war with the Soviet
Union, the US would take command. Without that, in their view, there would
be no US nuclear guarantee - and therefore France is against the idea,
sometimes canvassed by Americans, of having a European as Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (Saceur).
But, they say, the only rationale for having an integrated command in
peacetime was to enable Nato to respond quasi-automatically to a surprise
attack. The proposal for multinational corps tends to reinforce this
'automaticity' at the very time when the diminution of Soviet conventional
forces, and their withdrawal from eastern Europe, are making a surprise
attack impossible.
In future crises, the French argue, there will be time for political
consultation, and it will be absolutely necessary. As an example, they cite
the German experience in January, when German aircraft were called on, as
part of the joint mobile force permanently assigned to Allied Command
Europe, to defend Turkey against possible Iraqi retaliation for US attacks
from Turkish bases, about which Germany had not been consulted. France does
not want its political options to be foreclosed in this way by the
'automatic' involvement of its forces.
So France's ideal alliance, in theory, would be one with no integrated
military command in peacetime. Nato's military committee (composed of
national chiefs-of-staff) would 'resume its preponderant place', with the
task of proposing military solutions to the North Atlantic Council. The
military command would be adapted to the particular solution chosen in any
given crisis.
This arrangement would give all Nato members the same freedom of action that
France now enjoys. Whether the French would really welcome it, one may
doubt. Had the US, Britain and others not been used to working together in
Nato - indeed, had France not been used to liaising with Nato command for
practical purposes - the allied performance in the Gulf might have been very
different. However, the French know their suggestions are in no danger of
being accepted, and they insist that France is not demanding anything: if
others want to reinforce the integrated command that is their affair. France
is quite happy with the alliance as it is.
The other thing Mr Mitterrand cares about is, of course, Europe: the future
European Union. He accepts that this cannot be implemented today, but
insists that when finished it must have competence in defence as well as
foreign and security policy. France wants this written into the treaty on
European political union, since to leave it out would imply 'a Europe of
limited sovereignty'.
If WEU can be gradually developed into the defence arm of the European
Union, well and good. But the French will not accept it as a 'pillar' of
Nato, nor yet as a 'bridge' between Nato and the EC. 'To build a bridge you
need two banks,' they say, 'and the European bank does not yet exist.' The
Dutch and British are accused of wanting to 'absorb Europe into Nato'. But
the main argument is seen as being between France and Britain. The French
are confident that the Germans, Italians, Spanish and Belgians are all on
side; they consider that Portugal will go along with whatever Britain
decides; and they speak with scorn of the Dutch desire to have things all
ways at once: pacifism, a supranational Europe, and defence run by the US.
On one point, at least, France and Britain are agreed: foreign and security
policy is too important to be handed over to supranational institutions.
These aspects of European Union will be kept firmly inter-governmental, much
to the disgust of Mr Jacques Delors.
As might be expected, the French bristle with indignation at the round robin
sent to European governments in February by Mr Reginald Bartholomew, a
senior US state department official, warning Europe not to set up any kind
of caucus which might pre-empt Nato decisions. In general, the French reject
as 'childish blackmail' any argument that Europeans should abstain from a
given course of action in order not to isolate or alienate the Americans.
They stick to the old Gaullist view on this point: the US is in Europe for
its own interests, not out of sentiment. Any conceivable US president will
want to keep it there, and Europeans should not be taken in by any threats.
Yet in the same breath they say that Europe must eventually be ready to
assume its own defence, because it would be unwise to count on the Americans
being here for ever.
This contradiction is reconciled by reference to the US Congress, which in
French eyes seems to be a mysterious, elemental force, unpredictable and
quite unamenable to European influence. Here, no doubt, lies the key to
Franco-British differences. The British see, or think they see, the US from
inside, and believe their actions can have some effect on its political
processes. The French think, or pretend to think, that this is quite
pointless, and that Europe should be prepared for the worst even while
hoping for the best.
Ironically enough this attitude brings the French very close to the US
position on the substance of the immediate point at issue: they don't want
any 'European caucus' within Nato either. Senior military figures in France
are even sceptical about the idea, fashionable in some European circles, of
a WEU 'rapid reaction force' for use outside the Nato area. Talk of 'double
hatting' this force, to make it available also for use by Nato in an
appropriate context, arouses French suspicions that it is yet another
British wheeze to inveigle them back into the Nato structure.
From all this I deduce that the prospects for any concrete manifestation of
Europe's much-touted 'defence identity' are less good than they looked a
month or two ago. While Britain and Holland drag their feet for fear of
upsetting the Americans, the French will drag theirs for fear of setting up
something which would reinforce American hegemony. Probably Britain will
compromise to the extent of allowing some vague phrase in the treaty on
European political union to the effect that defence is not excluded, on the
understanding that nothing will actually be done. Meanwhile Nato will
restructure itself in some diminished and rather undramatic form; the WEU
will confine itself to co-ordinating marginal European contributions to
American-led operations outside Europe; and nothing much will happen until
the next crisis.
But of course that could be tomorrow.

Sir, Isn't it rather ironic that on Monday, the Bank of England launched an
initiative, spearheaded by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, to identify areas of
legal uncertainty that might harm London's standing as an international
financial centre?
Is this the same Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton who refuses to answer
Parliamentary questions under oath regarding the Harrods takeover by the
Al-Fayed brothers? It must be an uncanny coincidence.
May I suggest that one of the Al-Fayeds spearheads the campaign, as this
might attach more weight to it]

When you think about the effects of putting a dam across the Euphrates, or
atoning for past genocidal crimes by ceding water rights to Indian tribes
such as the Shoshone and Arapahoe, it puts into perspective any difficulties
the damp land of Britain may experience from drought. However, water is
clearly such an important and fraught subject that it makes good sense for
BBC2 to mount a series called Water Wars to deal with such matters (8.10).
Charles Stewart, master of the hand-held camera, takes his gear aboard the
London-Leeds express to tell the story of the people who try to keep British
Rail's trains running in Inside Story (9.30 BBC1).
Dontcha love the Americans? Given the technology of cable TV and the
protection of freedom of expression under the Constitution they came up with
Manhattan Cable (11.00), a system which permits every health freak, sex nut,
and religious loony to get on the screen and proselytise. And why not?
Channel 4 begins a new series showing excerpts from MC.
Later C4 screens Ingmar Bergman's The Rite (12.15), not a film but a TV
production made in nine days.

<TEXT>
The first joke-riddle many of us ever heard was probably asked by our
grandmothers: 'Do you know the difference between an elephant and a pillar
box?' No Granny. 'Then I shan't send you to post a letter'. For those who
work at ACBS (A Certain Building Society) this has now been superseded by
another question: do you know the difference between swimming with sharks
and swimming with dolphins? No? Then we shan't be doing any more business
with your company.
ACBS is responsible for the most irksomely pretentious television commercial
in living memory; that breathtakingly expensive bit of nonsense (modishly
shot in black and white, with the sort of inverted snobbery so
characteristic of the advertising business) in which a man with trendy
designer stubble and an oh-so-sincere voice (would you trust this poseur as
far as you could throw him? nor would I) reads out a letter to his son, full
of voguish green sentiments.
It is the most portentous claptrap imaginable: 'You have left your home to
seek your paradise, to find your truth, to walk softly in the footsteps of
older, wiser people, to swim with the sharks and the dolphins ..'
'Flog a mortgage company to a TV audience? Piece of cake old boy; shoot 'em
the green and caring line. They'll lap it up ..' Well, perhaps a few
credulous teenage greenies will, but they don't have much money to spend on
mortgages, and experience as a Gallup Poll interviewer suggests that most
ordinary people will not remember which particular company this commercial
is supposed to promote.
Lacking a memorable jingle, rhyme, or pack-shot to serve as a trade-name
mnemonic, a commercial can actually be counter-productive and help increase
the sales of your competitors. Research by an American brewer suggested that
their commercials with tempting shots of foaming glasses did prompt the
drinking of more beer - usually the viewer's favourite brand, whichever that
happened to be. The ACBS ad is so preoccupied with looking fashionable that
the business of ramming home the brand name is forgotten. Can you name the
company?
The admen, those chaps in designer stubble, granny glasses and recession
chic (suits that don't fit) have two standard responses to this sort of
criticism. First 'Say what you like, we've got you talking about our
commercial and that was the idea', and secondly 'Whatever you may say, the
more advertising a company does on television the more it sells, so it
works, you see'. The first argument is specious: over the years we have been
induced to talk plenty about Aids and mugging but that does not make us want
them. We can be well aware of the existence of something and wholly against
it.
The second argument is a classic example of the fallacy of the undistributed
middle. In primary schools the children with larger feet invariably have the
better handwriting, but only a fool concludes that the former causes the
latter: those with the larger feet happen to be older. Those that buy the
most advertising on television happen to be the bigger companies, but there
is no proof that the former causes the latter. Companies have achieved
enormous success and even brand leadership without buying any advertising
(Babe Ruth chocolate bars in the US, Sainsbury's in Britain).
So advertisers who are told by the stubble and granny specs brigade that it
doesn't matter if the public makes fun of your commercials, so long as they
notice them, might try murmuring to themselves 'You're never alone with a
Strand'. This notorious cigarette campaign attracted endless attention yet
killed the product stone dead. Everyone noticed it but no one wanted to
identify with a brand so favoured by the lonely.
Of course it takes all sorts to make a world, different viewers react in
different ways, and likes and dislikes among the commercials can arise from
little more than prejudice. My current bete noir - 'If yore sat arahnd at
'ome, Make new friends on the tell-er-foam' - no doubt seems like a godsend
to some people. There may be saintly viewers who, upon being told for the
17th time that everyone's after Bernard Maffews' crispy crumbly turkey
stools (or is it steaks?) do not scream at the television 'Oh no they're
not, I'm not'.
The likes are just as idiosyncratic. Who would have dreamed that the naughty
roller-skating pandas could continue to get laughs for Kit Kat after so many
months? Or that the Nazi hero and the squawking Lancaster navigator in
Carling's dam-buster spoof would go on and on seeming funny? As for Robbie
Coltrane and his granny in the Persil liquid ad, do they seem especially
welcome in their own right, or is it because we had all become so fed up
with those deadly Nanette Newman commercials? There is, surely, a serious
point behind all this. It must be better to be funny and create affection
than to be too clever by half and create fury or, equally counter
productive, bafflement.
On television at present there are a number of motor car campaigns which are
either baffling or off-putting or both. Would you really want to buy a car
that was so boring it sent you to sleep? That is what Rover's agency seems
to imagine: they show a chap taking a baby for a drive and before long both
of them are zizzing away.
According to Audi's agency theirs is the sort of car bought by people who
crash head-on into each other and climb out grinning inanely. Will this
persuade you to buy? And how about that other one which, until recently,
kept hurtling through the plate glass on the top floor of a factory? 'Built
by loonies for suicidal Scandinavians' seemed to be the message. Merely to
get noticed is not enough: you can hardly not notice the fact that Cadbury
and Ford are both currently using Dave Brubeck's 1961 hit 'Take Five', the
first to promote Twirl and the second to promote the Orion, but if you are
anything like me that will ensure that you never buy either.
Having a reputation for cleverness and wit, as British commercials do, is
all very well even if the people who pay the fees of the designer stubble
chaps might prefer a reputation for improved sales. For viewers, cleverness
and wit is far more entertaining than hard sell, but when it backfires -
when you lisp away huskily about swimming with the sharks - and irritate
viewers, the entire process has surely been turned on its head.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Edward II - The Pit, Barbican
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Russell Beale
If you want to see a play wrecked by a wrong choice of costume, go to the
Royal Shakespeare Company's Edward II, which has arrived at The Pit from
Stratford. To be fair to the designers, there are a lot more faults in this
production than the wardrobe, but the clothes do set a tone. If you dress
the characters in black and white leather jackets, trousers to go with them,
and heaven knows what the Queen is wearing, you are at a disadvantage from
the start.
For a number of reasons, the production never quite recovers from this
self-inflicted wound. Simon Russell Beale is an actor of great versatility;
he is not, however, one of nature's Edward IIs. The point about the part is
that he has a strong homosexual attraction to his favourites. He is also the
King of England with wars to fight, civil and foreign. To carry this off, in
the court and on the stage, requires a certain style. Beale plays the role
as someone short, fat and stupid who hops about like a bloated frog.
The message may be that you do not have to be beautiful to have homosexual
passions. Yet it would help if there were a certain style. Beale is simply
gross. He never rises to the part. Moreover, he shouts - repeatedly and
unnecessarily. So do much of the rest of the cast. This is not a production
of light and shade.
Edward II, admittedly, is not Christopher Marlowe's best play: not a patch
on Tamburlaine the Great or Dr Faustus. But it does have its moments as well
as unmistakeable affinities with Shakespeare's Richard II. Its greatest
attraction is Piers Gaveston, the King's first favourite. The RSC's
Gaveston, played by Grant Thatcher, comes into his own only when he has been
beaten up and his mouth is covered in blood - like lipstick. By then, he has
little left to say. Before that, he is dressed in his ridiculous white
leather clothes with sequins. The only surprise is that he does not wear an
earring. That is left to the King's next favourite, Spencer, whom we first
see under a sheet with a curate.
The nobles and the clerics are wooden. This may be deliberate. For if the
King does not behave like a king, even a deviant king, the court can hardly
be expected to behave like a court. The general entourage is more like that
of a rotary club faced with unseemly goings on, which cannot have been what
Marlowe intended. There ought also to be room for some humour, since most of
the characters go through a remarkable number of changes of mind. That is
not there either.
The best performance is by Ciaran Hands as the young Mortimer. By the time
he has become an accomplice to murder, his black jacket is decked with
phosphorescent green. For the rest, it is a pretty grim evening. The
direction is by Gerard Murphy.

FT  01 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Swiss bank instructions are set aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF CRETE SA v KOSKOTAS AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker,
Lord Justice Staughton and Sir David Croom-Johnson): March 14 1991
THE COURT has power to order a defendant to instruct his Swiss bank to
disclose account documents for the purpose of a contested application for
continuance of a Mareva injunction; but the order will be set aside if its
purpose disappears in that the defendant abandons his opposition to the
injunction, and if an application to stay or set aside the main action is
pending which, if successful, would make disclosure unnecessary.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Mr Georgis Louvaris
and Brockton Investments Ltd, the ninth and 10th defendants in an action
against Mr George Koskotas, Mr Panayottis Vakalis and others, from Mr
Justice Mummery's decision ordering Mr Louvaris to instruct his Swiss bank
to disclose account documents for the purposes of a Mareva application by
the plaintiff, the Bank of Crete SA.
LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that Mr Louvaris lived in Greece. Brockton was
said to be controlled by him.
The facts alleged in the action were that Mr Koskotas held an important
position in the Bank of Crete, and had misappropriated Dollars 200m from its
assets with the assistance of Mr Vakalis, who also held a position with the
bank. Some of that money was said to have come into the hands of Mr Louvaris
and Brockton.
Two particular sums were identified, of DM250,000 and DM650,000. Out of
those monies Brockton was said to have bought a flat in Finchley Road in St
John's Wood.
The Bank of Crete claimed to be able to trace the monies and to have a
charge on them, and similar remedies in respect of the flat.
On May 2 1990 Mr Justice Mummery ordered Mr Louvaris to sign a letter
instructing his Swiss bank, United Overseas Bank, to disclose his account
documents for the period January 1 1987 to October 31 1988. By the order, if
Mr Louvaris defaulted in signing he would be debarred from defending the
action.
Counsel were given an opportunity to agree the letter. It said: 'I hereby
instruct you to proceed and make single copies at my cost of each of the
foregoing documents.' It released the bank from any liability under Swiss
law and asked that the documents be sent to a firm of Swiss lawyers acting
for the Bank of Crete.
When the judge made that order there were other motions shortly to be heard
in the Chancery Division. One was a motion to continue a Mareva injunction
which had been granted ex parte over the English assets of Mr Louvaris and
Brockton.
There were also motions by Mr Louvaris and Brockton to set aside the
proceedings for want of jurisdiction, or to stay proceedings on the ground
that England was not the appropriate forum.
The reason Mr Justice Mummery made the somewhat unusual order was that there
had already been a contest as to whether the existing Mareva injunction
should be continued. Mr Louvaris and Brockton were saying they had been
guilty of no misappropriation and that there was no cause of action.
At an earlier stage Mr Justice Morritt had said there ought to be a measure
of discovery to enable the Bank of Crete to check the assertions in the
affidavits made on behalf of Mr Louvaris and Brockton. That was an unusual
measure. Normally a judge made up his mind on the affidavit evidence at that
stage.
After the original order for discovery a consent order was made, on February
7 1990, for production of documents relating to Mr Louvaris's D-Mark account
with the Swiss bank, and also relating to an item in his account described
as 'vente devises'.
At first the documents were not produced. Then documents relating to the
general account were produced with account numbers obliterated. There was a
protest and further copies were produced, again with account numbers
obliterated. Eventually proper copies were produced. Documents relating to
the 'vente devises' were not produced and the solicitors for Mr Louvaris and
Brockton, no doubt on instructions, said they did not exist. Eventually a
document relating to that transaction was produced.
So there was quite some history when the matter came before Mr Justice
Mummery.
Mr Louvaris now appealed against his order.
Mr Hollington for Mr Louvaris pointed out that on June 18 1990, while the
present appeal was pending, his instructing solicitors wrote to the Bank of
Crete's solicitors, saying they abandoned their opposition to the Mareva.
Eventually it was said that the abandonment applied to both Mr Louvaris and
Brockton.
Accordingly, Mr Hollington submitted, since Mr Justice Mummery's order had
been made for the purpose of the Mareva application, it was no longer
necessary. Mr Thomas for the Bank of Crete said the purpose of the order was
not solely to enable the bank to sustain its application for continuation of
the Mareva.
When one looked at the affidavit of the Bank of Crete's solicitor, it was
plain that the immediate purpose of the application to Mr Justice Mummery
was to enable the bank to sustain its application for a Mareva injunction.
At first sight it seemed there was no longer any need for Mr Justice
Mummery's order. It might be that at a later stage the ordered documents
might be relevant and discoverable in the action.
But the application by Mr Louvaris and Brockton to set aside or stay the
proceedings was due to be heard shortly after the May 2 proceedings. When
the appeal was lodged against the May 2 order, it was decided to adjourn the
application until the appeal had been disposed of.
In the result, an application to set aside or stay the proceedings was still
pending.
Mr Hollington submitted that the application had some chance of success. He
observed that Mr Louvaris lived in Greece. Little affecting him took place
in the UK, except perhaps for the purchase of the Finchley Road flat.
The application to set aside or stay the proceedings was not frivolous. If
it succeeded there would never be a substantive order for discovery of the
documents in the action against Mr Louvaris and Brockton. They were entitled
to have that application determined before there was a substantive order for
discovery. If it failed there could then, if necessary, be a renewed
application for discovery.
So, although the documents might prove relevant at a later stage, that was
not sufficient ground for upholding the judge's order now that opposition to
the Mareva injunction had been abandoned.
Mr Hollington's second point was that there was no power to order that a
party should send a letter to his bank and that if he defaulted he would be
debarred from defending.
The court was referred to Order 24 rule 16 of the Rules of the Supreme
Court.
Under Order 24 rule 16 the same effect could have been achieved by ordering
Mr Louvaris and Brockton to disclose the documents and, if they were in
their power, to obtain them from whoever had custody of them. If they failed
to comply, they could have been debarred from defending.
It was said the judge should not have made the order because there was only
a trivial interface between the dollar account of which disclosure was
sought and the D-Mark account which was relevant to the proceedings.
That was a matter for the judge's discretion in the light of the action's
history of discovery. He was entitled to take the view that the dollar
account ought to be disclosed.
It might be that the judge's order short-circuited the matter somewhat, but
it was not on that ground, in view of the history of the case, an order he
had no power to make.
It was said for Mr Louvaris that a Swiss bank would not comply with a
request in the form of the letter scheduled to the judge's order.
Evidence was produced from a Swiss lawyer to that effect. The Bank of Crete
produced evidence from another Swiss lawyer to the contrary effect. The
issue was not determined.
The Swiss were sensitive about their banking secrecy laws and also about
intrusion into their affairs by court order from other countries.
But even if the Swiss bank would not or might not comply with the request in
the letter, that by itself would not be a ground for the judge not to make
the order.
The order should not be interfered with on those other grounds. However, in
the events that had now happened it should be set aside. The appeal was
allowed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For the Bank of Crete: Neville Thomas QC and Ian Geering (Denton Hall Burgin
&amp; Warrens).
For Mr Louvaris: Robin Hollington (Zaiwalla &amp; Co).

'WHAT'S a challenge to one person may be stress to a second, and a third's
breaking point.' Besides being perennially one of the truer maxims about
working life, that saying can rarely if ever have been of more urgent
relevance to so many people.
Recession added to sharpening trade rivalry create conditions suited only to
supreme optimists, who characteristically see every setback as short-term,
one-off and above all the fault of someone or something other than
themselves. Challenges to them tend to be anxieties to those of us who are
less sure of our own perfection, regarding failures as symptoms of personal
deficiency.
Nevertheless even habitually self-critical people's tendency to be stressed
by things others take nonchalantly is often not their own fault. I say that
on the evidence of research by the Leeds University psychologist Jenny
Firth-Cozens which, although focused mainly on junior hospital doctors, has
produced findings her other work suggests apply to executives too.
Her studies show that proneness to stress is linked with conditions of
upbringing. So it seems probable that by recognising such links, people
suffering from the liability can make themselves more robust.
For instance, readers who feel stress-prone may care to consider their
father's age at their birth. The research revealed an impressive contrast in
robustness between those respectively born to fathers under and over
approximately 35.
Among the junior doctors, all aged 22-23, those who never felt stressed had
fathers whose average age at the time of the study was 52. That compared
with 59 for the dads of the doctors who were 'cased' - the technical term
for people who, although still physically well, are distractingly worried.
Another factor apparently strongly linked with vulnerability was the
mother's death before the child was 15. On the other hand, divorce had only
a weak link and death of the father showed no association at all.
But in the particular case of executives, the Leeds psychologist believes
the main contributor to vulnerability is paternal rather than maternal
influence. Among managers she has studied, it was those with powerful and
critical fathers who most saw their bosses at work as sources of anxiety.
The explanation may be that, as Freud conjectured, they project their
father's stressful personality onto their chiefs, interpreting them as ogres
although they may in fact be considerate souls.
Even so, Jenny Firth-Cozens is well aware that bosses can be exceedingly
stressful in their own right. Witness her finding that, regardless of
personal vulnerability, the junior doctors in teaching hospitals - where top
consultants have traditionally treated their underlings in domineering style
 -were markedly more stressed than the juniors employed elsewhere.
That, she says, is noteworthy evidence that something in the management of
teaching hospitals is wrong. To the Jobs column's mind, it is also something
even hospital chiefs short of money ought to be able to put right.
NOW to the table alongside giving a sample of the results of Day Associates'
latest quarterly survey of pay and perks in some five dozen international
banks and investment houses in the City of London. Anyone who wants the full
report, which covers 191 types of staff, should contact Joe Clark at Suite
2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723.
The price to concerns not taking part in the survey is Pounds 175 plus VAT.
My figures refer to a mere 15 fairly senior positions. First come base
salaries, the lower quartile representing the person a quarter way up from
the foot of a ranking of all in the same kind of work, the median the person
mid-way, and the upper quartile the one a quarter way down from the top.
Then we have the average salary, followed by the percentage of it typically
received as an additional bonus. Lastly come the percentage of the people in
each type of job who have a company car, and its average price.
HEADHUNTER Paul Chambers of the Freshman Consultancy seeks two recruits for
separate clients he may not name. So he promises to honour applicants'
requests not to be identified to the employer at this stage.
His first quarry is a head for the German sales operations of an American
financial information group. Although its Frankfurt office where the
newcomer will be based is small, it already has numerous established
customers.
The job is to take the lead in building up the German business, and
candidates should have a record of go-getting success in the financial
information market. They must also be fluent in German.
Salary indicator DM200,000-250,000. Car among other benefits.
The second post, London-based but again with a US group, is for a seller of
software for capital markets uses. Computer knowledge is not needed, but
candidates must have detailed understanding of capital markets trading
especially in off-balance-sheet instruments.
Salary plus bonus on results about Pounds 50,000. Perks include car.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: An alternate route in the
paper chase - Why beverage carton manufacturers are claiming that recycling
is not all it's cracked up to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers throughout the world are discovering an interest in their
dustbins. As the environmentalist wave gathers momentum, consumers from
Adelaide to Anchorage are paying increasing attention to the domestic waste
they produce and are peering into the smelly depths of their rubbish bins to
discover what lurks within.
Even though consumer rubbish represents only a small proportion of the total
waste generated by modern industrial economies, it has become a high
environmental and political priority because of its visibility and immediate
connotations with a 'throw-away society'.
Something must be done, the environmentally aware voters cry, and the
politicians respond by introducing legislation to address the problem. Last
month , for example, the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German
parliament, passed a complex law drawn up by Klaus Topfer, the environment
minister, to introduce a 'dual waste' system which forces industry to
recycle rubbish.
The system is known as 'dual waste' because industry has been charged with
recovering from the consumer all waste materials that can be reused, while
municipal authorities retain responsibility for collecting and disposing of
the remaining rubbish.
Products which have to be taken back and re-used by industry will be marked
with a green dot. The law requires that this should apply to 65 per cent of
all packaging by 1995.
'Sorting rubbish is suddenly becoming a more popular pastime than jogging,'
says one rather jaundiced observer of the waste industry.
The lead the Germans have taken with the dual waste system has rattled many
in industry who fear that its philosophy may be reflected in the European
Commission's packaging directive which is currently wending its way around
the corridors of Brussels and is due to be published in the autumn.
The logic for recycling seems compelling: it has been estimated that in the
UK, for example, about 90 per cent of the packaging bought during an average
family shopping trip goes straight into a landfill rubbish site after a
single use. This is a waste not just of material but also of money: the
costs of packaging Pounds 65 worth of grocery products amount to about
Pounds 10.
What could be more sensible than encouraging industry to re-use waste
material as many times as possible?
But some members of the paper and packaging industry fear that the obsessive
interest in recycling could well lead to undesirable and self-defeating
results. They argue that different packaging materials should be treated
separately to ensure that their impact on the environment is minimal,
particularly on a cradle-to-grave basis rather than just at the point of
disposal.
Take, for example, the case of beverage cartons, which are widely used for
packaging milk, juices and soups.
The environmental case against such forms of packaging is clear: they
represent a wasteful use of raw materials - mainly paper and aluminium  -
which when combined in six layers of packaging sheet, as is the case with
the widely-used Tetra Brik Aseptic packaging, cannot be recycled easily.
This has led to their being a prime target of environmental campaigners and
has even resulted in some US states, such as Maine, banning them altogether.
Rather than use such products, the environmentalists argue, it is far better
to use refillable glass milk bottles or, as Migros, a big Swiss supermarket
chain has done, to introduce lightweight polyethylene milk bags which can be
slotted into a more robust re-usable plastic jug.
The makers of beverage cartons have become increasingly alarmed at such
arguments and, not surprisingly, have challenged the environmentalists'
claims.
The big suppliers and manufacturers of these cartons, including
International Paper and Weyerhauser, of the US, Elopak, of Norway, Tetra
Pak, of Sweden, and Enso-Gutzeit, of Finland, have formed the Alliance for
Beverage Cartons and the Environment, which promotes their case.
The alliance argues that its products, which are safe, lightweight and
energy efficient, come out on top when its environmental effects are
compared with other packaging systems on a life-cycle basis.
Less energy is used to manufacture beverage cartons than other forms of
packaging, the alliance claims, and less energy is also required to
transport and store them.
For instance, a one-litre beverage carton weighs less than 30g compared with
400g for a comparable glass container and because it can be stacked up
easily accounts for only 5 per cent of the volume of a delivery compared
with 40 per cent for other materials.
Although this may not make a great difference in small countries, such as
the Netherlands, it can have a profound implication in terms of costs and
environmental effects in countries where goods have to be transported long
distances, such as Sweden or Australia.
The fact that beverage cartons can be hermetically sealed also counts in its
favour, the alliance suggests, because this obviates the need to refrigerate
products such as UHT milk, reduces wastage and prolongs shelf-life.
The great problem with beverage cartons, however, is what can be done with
them after use. The alliance has been investigating the possibilities and
has come up with two solutions, although neither is wholly satisfactory.
The first is to attempt to recycle the product. Tetra Pak, the Swedish
liquid packaging group which sells 57bn cartons a year (which works out at
more than 10 cartons for each inhabitant of the planet), has invested DM
2.5m (Pounds 845,000) in a recycling plant in Diez, Germany to investigate
the technical and commercial possibilities.
The theory is simple. The plant takes the polyethylene coated board used for
cartons, shreds it into strips about 5mm long, spreads the strips on a metal
plate and heats and presses them for about 10 minutes.
The polyethylene in the strips acts as a binding agent allowing the material
to be thermoformed. The end-product is a dense board that is waterproof,
fire-resistant, and has good insulation properties. So far the company has
investigated using the recycled material to replace chipboard in a number of
options ranging from floor tiles, pallets, exhibition stands and loudspeaker
boxes. Tetra Pak is also working with Ikea, the Swedish furniture company,
to use the material in its furniture designs.
Other companies in the alliance are investigating ways of repulping beverage
cartons. In Canada and the US cartons are mixed with household plastics to
produce plastic lumber which can be used to produce garden furniture, fence
posts and road cones. The paper content in a carton can also be separated
from the aluminium foil and polyethylene by applying hot water and can then
be recycled as kitchen or toilet paper.
Although the alliance points out that it is technically possible to recycle
its cartons it questions whether it makes commercial sense to do so. The
alliance does not believe in recycling purely for the sake of it and argues
that recycling must be economically viable to ensure its long-term
continuation.
It is, as yet, far from clear whether companies could collect and re-use
beverage cartons on a commercially viable scale.
The other recycling option, which the alliance prefers, is to incinerate the
used cartons to recover energy. Beverage cartons have a high energy content
 -two tonnes of cartons have the equivalent energy value of one tonne of oil
 -and the alliance suggest that beverage cartons could be used as a fuel for
industrial boilers, cement kilns or generating plants.
Beverage cartons can also be burnt as part of the general waste stream to
provide energy to heat homes. One example of where this is done is at Sysav,
the South West Scania Solid Waste Company, based in Malmo in Sweden. The
company, which is owned by nine municipalities, collects 500,000 tonnes of
waste a year. Roughly two-thirds of the waste comes from the region's
industry and the rest is produced by its 455,000 inhabitants.
The waste is sorted at source and recycled wherever feasible. But about
220,000 tonnes of waste is incinerated and the energy produced is supplied
to the district's heating system and is sufficient to satisfy 25 per cent of
the needs of Malmo city's 250,000 inhabitants.
Although the Swedish government has greeted the system favourably some
environmentalist groups and other European governments are still opposed to
incineration, arguing that any gas emissions - even if they have been
rigorously filtered as they are at Sysav - are undesirable. Incinerator
waste is also highly toxic and difficult to dispose of safely in landfill
sites, they say.
Whatever arguments are advanced by both sides it is clear that there are no
simple solutions to the problems of waste management. Evaluating the total
environmental impact of various packaging products is an immensely
complicated business; all life-cycle analyses are to some extent based on a
set of subjective premises. Recycling offers no panacea.
But ultimately it will be the market which resolves this dilemma. Consumers
will have to evaluate which packaging materials represent the best solutions
for them. They will have to decide whether they are prepared to use heavy
refillable glass containers or flimsy polyethylene bags; or whether they opt
for plastic packaging or cartons on the basis that the material is only
marginally more damaging to the environment. In the process they will also
determine which packaging solutions - and companies - survive. No wonder
that the battle for the shoppers' hearts and minds is hotting up.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: Plastics recycling attacks new
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of plastics recycling will make a serious impact on sales of new
plastics in western Europe, according to a study by Chem Systems, the
London-based consultancy. This will exacerbate the overcapacity which
already threatens the profitability of the petrochemicals industry.
According to most estimates, about 7m tonnes of plastic are handled every
year by Europe's municipal waste authorities. If 'long-term' wastes such as
cars and televisions are included, the total amount of plastic discarded may
be as much as 15m tonnes per year. Polyethylene forms the largest component
of plastic waste.
The proportion of Europe's plastic waste that is recycled is likely to
increase from about 6 per cent today to 16 per cent in 1996, as governments
promote recycling on environmental grounds through a mixture of compulsion
and financial incentives.
According to Chem Systems, the direct effect of recycling will be to reduce
consumption of virgin polymer (freshly manufactured plastic) by more than 2m
tonnes a year from the mid 1990s. Assuming an average price of Dollars
1,500/tonne, that would mean the loss of Dollars 3bn worth of sales, at a
time when the industry will have increased its manufacturing capacity in
anticipation of sustained growth in demand for new plastic.
Eric Johnson, the consultant responsible for the study, says: 'The planners
and business managers in the plastics and petrochemicals industry have not
yet perceived the impact of recycling. They say they have but they really
have not.'
Since recycling is more suitable for some plastics and for some applications
than for others, its impact will vary between companies. Producers of
low-performance plastics are most vulnerable.
Germany is taking the lead in promoting European plastics recycling. The
German target is for 80 per cent of packaging to be recycled by 1995. This
will require 40 recycling plants to be built, with an average capacity of
10,000 tonnes per year and a cost of DM1bn (Pounds 330m).
Several other countries have ambitious recycling targets. Italy, for
example, is aiming for 40 per cent recycling of plastic containers by
December 1991. The UK is taking less action than most of its European
partners and has no national recycling target.
Although the plastics industry is adopting a co-operative attitude, its
spokesmen maintain that the costs of collecting and sorting different types
of plastic make recycling uneconomic. The industry is promoting instead the
idea of using waste plastics as a fuel by controlled burning.
For petrochemical manufacturers, incineration has the advantage that used
plastics do not re-appear to compete with their new polymers. But according
to the Chem Systems analysis, recycling may be a better economic
proposition.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Gas union rejects changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF white-collar workers at British Gas have rejected a package which
would allow the organisation to offer a fuller service to customers outside
normal office hours.
If accepted by the unions, the management's proposed deal would have led to
considerable changes in working practices in exchange for better pay and
improved benefits.
However, leaders of Nalgo, the public service union, have rejected the
proposals on the grounds that the financial incentives were not enough.
British Gas was offering to raise basic salaries, ranging from Pounds 7,500
to Pounds 22,000, by 3.25 per cent from next March, and offering a one-off
payment of Pounds 450 on September 1.
If the plan had been accepted by the unions, customers would have been able
to contact white-collar workers, including those who arrange schedules of
meter readers and industrial workers, and those who prepare bills, between
8am and 7.30pm on weekdays and between 8am and 6pm on Saturdays.
At present British Gas white-collar staff work normal office hours. As part
of the deal, the management wanted to make their hours more flexible. It
would have asked employees to work four-day weeks, of longer hours, and
nine-day fortnights.
British Gas also wanted staff to take on more responsibility, seeing jobs
through from start to finish, rather than performing single tasks.
The management also wanted to reorganise the 11 existing grades into just
six.
In return for the changes, the company was offering an improved career
structure for staff, and help with childcare for parents with pre-school
children. They would have been offered Pounds 30 a week towards their
childcare arrangements.
Nalgo's gas section leaders say most of the package was 'well balanced', but
argue that the payment being offered is insufficient to compensate for the
changes that workers are being asked to accept.
Nalgo wants a higher consolidated increase than 3.25 per cent, and the gas
section leaders were concerned that the timing of the increase could have
complicated next year's pay negotiations. Talks on more flexibility,
covering about 45,000 workers, have lasted more than two years.
British Gas said: 'At the end of negotiations the gap between trade unions
and ourselves was such that they did not feel it could be bridged.'
Similar talks to achieve more flexibility with unions representing manual
workers broke down last year.

<TEXT>
THE LABOUR Party promised a 'fresh start' review of competition, consumer
choice, and prices in the brewing industry, Philip Rawstorne writes.
Government orders introduced after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report on the industry, had 'failed to stem the tide of takeovers and
closures,' said Mr Doug Henderson, a Labour trade and industry spokesman.
'The brewing industry is being carved up between giant retailing chains and
increasingly large brewers,' he said.
Government changes had done nothing to to cut the price of a pint or give
consumers greater choice of beers. Price rises in the brewing industry had
been 'staggering'.
Retail prices increased by 142 per cent between March 1979 and March 1991.
Beer prices rose by 222 per cent over the same period, he said.

Defence Questions

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, yesterday challenged the
government to deny reports that Ministry of Defence estimates for
expenditure over the next ten years exceeded treasury forecasts by Pounds
21bn, Emma Tucker writes.
He demanded to know why there had been a delay in the publication of the
white paper this year and asked whether it was because 'long term costings
were now indicating that over the next decade there will be an overrun of
Pounds 21bn'.
Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, said Mr O'Neill was 'muddled'.
'He knows that the chief secretary has already confirmed that the defence
estimates for this year are likely to be Pounds 1.5bn above its originally
planned level,' said Mr King.
He said publication of the defence white paper had been delayed by the Gulf
War and he hoped to publish it before the summer. Earlier, he said the war
had cost Britain Pounds  1/2 bn.
Total expenditure had been around Pounds 2.5bn but Mr King said the
contributions made to those costs by other countries now exceeded Pounds
2bn.
Mr King also said that 20 British officers were serving with the UN mission
which would take full control of the demilitarised zone along the
Iraq/Kuwait border tomorrow.
Later, defence minister Mr Kenneth Carlisle said that the government was
looking at the future of all naval bases. It had, in addition, not yet
chosen the tank to replace the Chieftain as the army's main battle tank, but
hoped to make an announcement soon.

FT  01 MAY 91 / SmithKline and Glaxo fight over new cancer drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL BATTLE has begun between Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, the two
largest UK pharmaceutical companies, over a new class of drug designed to
prevent nausea in cancer patients. The world market for these medicines is
expected to exceed Pounds 500m a year in the mid 1990s.
SB has filed a complaint in the US District Court in Philadelphia, alleging
patent infringement against Glaxo's drug Zofran, which was launched in
Europe last year and in the US in February.
The dispute has been simmering behind the scenes for four years, and
yesterday Glaxo issued a statement saying it had been notified of SB's
complaint.
'Glaxo believes its patent position regarding Zofran is strong and that it
does not infringe any valid patent of SmithKline Beecham,' it said. 'Glaxo
will vigorously defend its position, and expects to prevail.'
SB said it hoped to settle the dispute by negotiation with Glaxo and without
having to proceed with the lawsuit.
SB has a patent covering the use of a new group of drugs, known as 5HT3
antagonists, used as anti-emetics (to prevent the nausea and vomiting which
are a common side-effect of chemotherapy for cancer). It claims Zofran
contravenes that patent, even though it has a different chemical structure
from SB's anti-emetic drug, called Kytril.
Glaxo has won the race to market. Zofran is almost two years ahead of
Kytril, which SB expects to launch in the US in 1993. That would normally
give it a big commercial advantage.
Sandoz, a Swiss pharmaceutical company which has developed a third 5HT3
antagonist, recently recognised SB's patent claim and signed a worldwide
licensing agreement with the UK company.
Mr Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals analyst at County NatWest Securities, said he
believed SB wanted to force Glaxo to pay it a royalty on sales of Zofran.
If the lawsuit is successful, Glaxo may end by paying SB Dollars 100m
(Pounds 59m) a year in the late 1990s.
Mr Robin Gilbert of James Capel said the legal move was a sign of more
aggressive management at SB, the company formed in 1989 when Beecham of the
UK merged with SmithKline Beckman of the US.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Further tough period seen for manufacturers: CBI Industrial
Trends Survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS face a further tough period before growth prospects improve,
according to the latest quarterly survey by the Confederation of British
Industry.
The survey, published yesterday, provides a broad perspective of likely
conditions across manufacturing over the next four months. It finds that
companies' order books and levels of output are still weak, with little
evidence of any rapid recovery in production or profits.
The extent of the decline in manufacturing output in the first quarter
exceeded expectations, and the proportion of companies working beneath
capacity has climbed to more than two thirds, the highest figure for eight
years.
However, the survey is broadly consistent with indications that the
recession will reach its bottom around the summer, with modest growth
starting in the second half of the year. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's
director of economic affairs, said it was 'not over-optimistic' to talk
about a recovery being in sight. Pointers about a possible end to the
recession are contained in a number of specific replies to the survey, which
involved 1,297 companies, accounting for roughly half of manufacturing
employment. It was conducted between April 2 and April 17.
One important indicator is the section of the survey dealing with business
confidence. This shows that optimism among companies is continuing to
decline, but at a less marked rate than at any time over the past two years.
Altogether, 32 per cent of companies said they were less optimistic about
business prospects than four months ago, while 15 per cent said they were
more so. That adds up to a balance of companies expressing relative
pessimism of 17 per cent. In the CBI's January survey, the comparable figure
was 51 per cent, and in October last year it was 47 per cent.
A further hopeful sign for manufacturers concerns new orders. A balance of 8
per cent of companies expects orders to be lower over the next four months,
a much smaller number than the balance of 35 per cent recorded in January.
The relatively upbeat sentiment on orders is the best result for this
indicator since the CBI's survey last July.
A balance of 41 per cent of companies reported a decline in orders during
the first four months, an indication of just how bleak 1991 has been so far
for many of Britain's factories. The figure compares with a balance of 33
per cent reporting a decline in the four months to January 1991, and marks
the biggest downturn in order books since January 1981.
A balance of 43 per cent of companies reported a fall in output over the
past four months, the biggest decline since October 1980. However, a balance
of just 8 per cent expects a cut in output over next four months, a
healthier position than in January when the comparable figure was 30 per
cent.
The rate of fall in export optimism apparent from previous surveys also
appears to have slowed, with a balance of 8 per cent expressing pessimism
about prospects for overseas sales, compared with a figure of 26 per cent at
the time of the last survey.
The same number of companies in the survey reckoned they would increase
export sales over the next four months as believed sales would decline. The
consequent balance of zero was better than the balance of 13 per cent which
in January said export revenues would fall.
Capital investment intentions are still weak, according to the survey, while
spending on training and retraining appears to be holding up. Just over a
quarter of companies expect to spend more in this area during the coming
year, compared with 18 per cent which think they will spend less.
As for employment, the outlook has become marginally less bleak, with a
balance of 39 per cent of companies expecting that they will reduce their
labour force over the next four months. In the CBI's surveys in January and
in October 1990, the comparable numbers were 49 per cent and 37 per cent.
Some 200,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the past year, roughly one
in 20 of the factory labour force.
Manufacturing employment fell by more than 80,000 in the first quarter of
1991, and the CBI believes that a further 68,000 jobs will go in the second
quarter.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Business school to probe competitiveness of City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Business School is to conduct a wide-ranging independent
investigation into the competitiveness of the City of London, it was
announced yesterday.
Funding of Pounds 1.5m for the City Research Project is being provided by
the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City. Professor
Richard Brealey, Professor of Corporate Finance at the LBS, will be project
director.
The investigation is expected to take three years. Its purpose is to
identify and, where possible, to quantify the elements making up the City's
competitive position. They will be compared with those of other financial
centres - particularly New York, Tokyo, Paris and Frankfurt.
The corporation's initiative follows consultations with the Bank of England
and the Department of Trade and Industry.
Professor Brealey said yesterday that the main thrust of the research
programme would be identification of 'the key determinants of
competitiveness and how these are shifting over time'.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Migrants halt decline in Scottish population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running gentle decline in the Scottish population was reversed last
year for the first time since the mid-1970s as Scotland, normally a reliable
source of emigrants, received an influx of migrants.
In the year to June 30 1990 the estimated population rose by 11,700 to
5,102,400, according to Scotland's registrar general.
A net 13,500 people migrated into Scotland, most of them from the rest of
Britain, but also from abroad.
This offset a natural fall in the population of 1,400 caused by a high
number of deaths from influenza in the winter of 1989-90 and a relatively
low number of births.
The gradual decline in the Scottish population and, until recently, high
levels of emigration have long been a matter of concern to the government,
as well as a source of political point scoring by opposition parties,
notably the Scottish National party.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Fimbra bids to regulate 'multi-tied' agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE troubled Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory
Association has thrown its hat in the ring as a potential supervisory body
of the 'multi-tied' financial advisers.
Such advisers are expected to emerge after the Securities and Investment
Board's review of the way packaged investment products are sold to the
public.
Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, which supervises independent
financial advisers, said he would consider the creation of a new category of
'multi-tied' financial advisers if they were regulated by his organisation
and did not threaten the future viability of the independent sector.
Multi-tied advisers would sell several companies' products, standing between
independent advisers (who advise on all products on the market) and tied
agents (who sell only one company's products).
Mr Jillings stressed that his comments could not yet be interpreted as
Fimbra policy.
The Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation is expected to
propose a formula under which all tied agents would come under its
jurisdiction.
However, Mr Jillings said that multi-tied advisers should not be regulated
by Lautro because it is responsible for product providers.
Recommendations on how banks should account for loans were proposed in a
draft statement put forward by the British Bankers Association yesterday.
The Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice (SORP) addresses issues
such as the valuation of advances, treatment of provisions, recognition of
interest and fees, and disclosure of concentrations of exposure. It
proposes, for example, that banks should list their exposure to countries
with financial problems.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturers feel comfortable about their presence in Europe and
indicate that, to avoid conflict, localisation of operations and management
is essential, Emiko Terazono reports from Tokyo.
A recent survey of manufacturers, carried out by the Japan External Trade
Organisation (Jetro), showed the number of companies with at least 10 per
cent Japanese ownership operating in Europe increased to 676 at the end of
last January, a 27.8 per cent year-on-year rise.
Of these 676, 187 chose the UK as their base, 122 France, 109 Germany, and
64 Spain, 39 Italy, and 36 the Netherlands. The survey suggests the reasons
were ease of distribution, availability of English-speaking managers, a pool
of highly-skilled workers, and a well-developed infrastructure.
Almost half the companies responding expressed optimism about relationships
with their local communities. But some 20 per cent expressed concerns about
employee friction triggered by lack of localisation of management or by
implementation of Japanese-style management.
The main reasons cited for setting up operations in Europe were to avoid
problems with anti-dumping actions, to reinforce research and development in
Europe. Some 30 per cent said their operations followed acquiring an US
company with European links.
About 40 per cent said local content of purchased parts had increased, while
6.9 per cent claiming a decrease. In explaining the background to the
local-content increase, 32.7 per cent cited the improvement in the quality
of locally manufactured goods, 29.7 per cent increased in-house parts
manufacturing, with 24.8 per cent saying they had turned to buying parts
from Japanese suppliers in Europe.
Local personnel were assigned to a chief executive post in a third of the
companies, while director or managing director were the highest posts in a
quarter of the companies.
When asked about cultural and social community activities, 53.7 per cent
said they had no specific policy. Only 9.8 per cent said they were actively
sharing in community events under company direction.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Midlands boosts Soviet region in barter
deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS from the gas-rich Tyumen region of western Siberia are touring the
UK Midlands this week, examining the plants providing them with goods in a
series of cash and barter deals set up by Orbicom, a company based in
Shrewsbury, Shropshire.
The deals are based on a traditional pattern. Raw materials and a limited
amount of hard currency come from the Soviet Union in exchange for capital
projects and goods needed to raise living standards there.
Mr Mark Jones, Orbicom chairman, is working on the basis that to consider
the Soviet Union as a unified market is an illusion.
In his view, it is necessary to take seriously the Gorbachev reforms, most
notably the movement to greater regional autonomy.
But barter trade continues to attract those interested in the Soviet market.
Despite the gradual opening of the Soviet market, 'the rouble is subject to
arbitrary manipulation,' Mr Jones said. Given the Soviet Union is
perennially short of hard currency, trade profits for western businessmen
have to be earned in other ways.
Orbicom's business splits into two parts, each with gas as the base and
springing out of the relationship Mr Jones has developed with
Neftekhimkombinat, the publicly-owned petrochemical company based in
Tobolsk, a city of 260,000 people in Tyumen.
The first part is long term. Orbicom has negotiated with Neftekhimkombinat
the heads of an agreement for a joint venture to establish a gas
fractionation unit. This takes gas and splits it into different fractions -
methane, propane and so on. The cost would be Pounds 80m. Of that sum,
Pounds 20m would come in the form of hard currency-spending on plant and
equipment. The balance would come in sales from the new plant.
This is orthodox project financing of a type common in natural resource
exploitation for 20 years. But the difficulty comes both in obtaining the
export credit guarantees on the sale of the plant and in obtaining the
project finance from banks which remain cautious about Soviet joint
ventures.
The second part of the Orbicom business hinges around the sales price for
propane gas. Orbicom is taking from Neftekhimkombinat a series of propane
gas shipments, despatched through the port of Riga. Five shipments have been
delivered; one is being loaded at the port. The value of these could reach
Pounds 15m.
In return, Orbicom is setting up a maternity hospital, said to be the first
in the Soviet Union to meet UK Department of Health standards, under a
scheme to boost health services in Tobolsk. Orbicom has also brokered a deal
under which Rover is supplying Pounds 1m-worth of cars and spares for
Tobolsk's police force.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Paper industry 'faces new environmental
pressures'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING environmental pressures will make the 1990s a more challenging
decade for the paper industry than the previous turbulent one.
This forecast came yesterday from Mr Stephen Walls, chief executive of
Wiggins Teape Appleton, the EC paper company. He told a pulp and paper
conference organised by the Financial Times and the European Paper
Institute, that competition would intensify in the European industry,
because of greater consolidation and over-capacity.
Mr Walls' speech echoed themes touched on earlier by, among others, Mr
Hartwig Geginat, president of the European Paper Institute. Mr Geginat
forecast that demand for paper products would remain strong, with the total
market for paper and board products growing at 3-4 per cent a year in the
next five years.
But he added that changing consumer attitudes could affect the quality and
consumption of paper, as governments introduced legislation aimed at cutting
the use of packaging materials. 'Not only is the industry's use of
materials, processes and recycling under attack by pressure groups, but the
product itself is. This represents the main challenge facing the industry
into the next century.'
Mr Desmond Smurfit, joint deputy chairman of Jefferson Smurfit Group, the
Irish paper and packaging company, said the concept of quality would be
critical in the present business environment. The big European players would
continue to get bigger, he added.
Mr Takao Teresaki, a general manager at C. Itoh, the Japanese trading group,
said the Japanese market was suffering from over-capacity, caused by
'overly-aggressive' capital investment. But he forecast the industry would
quickly overcome its difficulties and return to a stable growth of 3-3 1/2
per cent a year.
Mr Hugh Whalen, executive vice-president of Canadian Pacific Forest
Products, said the paper industry was 'all too often at the centre of an
environmental issue, sometimes distorted beyond reason'. He pointed to a
dispute over the endangered spotted owl in the American North-west. Last
June, President George Bush signed legislation barring log exports from
state and federal lands in the region, preserving 1,000 hectares of old
forest per pair of owls.
The value of the forest reserve equated to Dollars 95m (Pounds 55.8m) for
each pair of owls, Mr Whalen said, while direct and indirect job losses in
the forest industry could exceed 100,000 in the next decade. 'Does this make
sense to you?' he asked.

committee

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOVIET Union yesterday was granted observer status in Gatt's
Anti-Dumping Committee, marking a further step to eventual membership of the
world trade organisation. Last May, Moscow won observer status in Gatt
itself. In March this year, it won a similar standing on Gatt's import
licensing committee.
Yesterday's approval means Moscow has access to two of the codes, to which
Gatt members subscribe separately and which are meant mainly to lower
non-tariff obstacles to trade. Observer status means Soviet officials can
join talks, but not vote on decisions.
Mr Evgeny Makeyev, the Soviet ambassador, said Moscow considered it
important to be able to follow the anti-dumping committee's work because the
Soviet Union had just passed a new law on customs tariffs, which could allow
anti-dumping duties to be imposed.
Gatt's anti-dumping code lays down the conditions under which governments
may charge duties as a defence against 'dumped' imports. There are 25
signatories to the code, the EC counting as one. Moscow is expected to apply
next for observer status in the customs valuation committee which aims at
harmonising national valuation systems.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, yesterday served notice that Britain would
push hard for a reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural
Policy and the liberalisation of world trade in agriculture.
In a hard-hitting speech to the development committee of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank he also said Britain would only be prepared to
give assistance to east European countries that maintained democratic
institutions and respect for human rights. He said the IMF and World Bank
should put more pressure on countries they were helping with economic reform
programmes to avoid excessive spending on arms.
Mr Lamont said that EC farm support was 'spiralling upwards' in the wake of
rising production and surplus stocks. The CAP was again imposing severe
strains on Community finances and taxpayers in addition to the substantial
costs borne by EC consumers through high food prices.
He said the dumping of European farm surpluses on foreign markets was
damaging many agricultural producers in the developing world.
It was 'nonsensical' that richer nations should give financial aid to
eastern Europe and third world nations at the same time as frustrating their
efforts to export the goods and agricultural products which the aid had
helped them to produce.
Mr Lamont called on fellow finance ministers to back Britain's proposals to
ease the debt burden of the poorest developing nations.
He said he hoped the Paris Club of creditor nations would develop a
practical package of measures incorporating the main elements of the
so-called Trinidad terms.
These terms, first proposed by Britain last autumn, envisage creditor
countries writing off two thirds of the official debt owed by very poor and
insolvent developing nations that are implementing economic reforms and
stretched out repayment terms for the debt that would remain.

MR Charles Dallara, one of the US Treasury's key international officials for
the past decade, is leaving the administration to join JP Morgan, the New
York banking company, writes Peter Riddell in Washington.
He will start at Morgan in June as a managing director, working in the
international area and dealing, in particular, with emerging market
economies in eastern Europe and Latin America.
Aged 42, Mr Dallara has spent virtually all his career in the Treasury,
where he has been assistant secretary since early 1989. Previously, he was
the US executive director on the International Monetary Fund board.
As deputy to Mr David Mulford, the Treasury's top international official, Mr
Dallara has been at the heart of the US's more active role in international
financial policy in recent years. He has been especially involved in the
structural impediment initiative (SII) talks with Japan, intended to open
markets, and in recent discussions over burden sharing in the Gulf crisis,
as well as the regular series of Group of Seven meetings.
He said yesterday that he was leaving the Treasury partly for financial
reasons - he has two children approaching college age and wants to be able
to safeguard their position.
It is not unusual for someone with Mr Dallara's experience to spend some
time in the private sector before returning to government at a more senior
level.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Brazil's economy minister, has signed a Dollars
350m (Pounds 205.8m) loan agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank
(IADB), writes Stephen Fidler in Washington.
The loan, to improve urban sanitation, will create about 45,000 jobs. It had
been delayed because of US concern over Brazil's growing arrears with
commercial banks.
The loan was approved by the bank's board last week, following an agreement
in principle last month with leading bank creditors over the arrears. Ms
Cardoso yesterday met Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
She told journalists she hoped Brazil could 'start as soon as possible'
negotiations over its external debt and hoped the IMF and other institutions
would provide 'necessary support' for the process.
Asked about the possibility of debt relief for Brazil from creditor
governments, she said she did not want to anticipate any proposal - which
would have, in any case, to follow agreement with the IMF. However, Brazil
applauded the decision to write off at least 50 per cent of Poland's debts
and said the treatment 'should be extended to other middle- and low-income
countries'.
The US and Japan have agreed to lead a support group of countries friendly
to Peru to help it erase its Dollars 2.1bn in arrears to the IMF, World Bank
and Inter-American Development Bank. This would allow borrowing from the
institutions to resume.
Agreement came at a meeting on Monday afternoon in Washington. Mr Camdessus
said another meeting would take place in May, at which other countries
friendly to Peru would be present, to take the issue forward.
The size of the arrears in relation to Peru's resources complicates the
problem. Mr Camdessus also said he hoped the IMF would provide support for
programmes in Argentina and India.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Bank Washington 1991: US seeks to raise World Bank's
private profile - Fears the bank will lose relevance if it deals only with
the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD the World Bank start lending directly to the private sector? Although
the US, the bank's dominant shareholder, says the move should be seriously
considered, it would change fundamentally the basis on which the institution
has operated since its birth after the Second World War. It has lent only
under government guarantee.
The debate has been prompted by a call from the World Bank affiliate, the
International Finance Corporation, for a doubling of its Dollars 1.3bn
(Pounds 764.7m) capital. The IFC, headed by Sir William Ryrie, a former
British civil servant, is the part of the World Bank group created to lend
and make equity investment direct to the private sector.
It cannot lend with a government guarantee but claims its capital
limitations are already preventing it from growing at the pace it should.
It believes its 20 per cent annual growth rate in the late 1980s should slow
to 12 per cent, but without a capital infusion soon its growth would slow to
6 per cent or less.
The timing for a capital increase could not be better.
The collapse of the communist model in eastern Europe has reinforced a
sea-change already under way in many developing countries. This has placed
the private sector and functioning markets at the centre of development
plans.
While applauding this, the US wants to see any debate on the capital
increase dependent on the World Bank itself increasing its role in the
private sector.
The price for any capital increase would be for the World Bank group -
including the IFC - to direct 50 per cent of its lending to the private
sector by 1995. The US also envisages that eventually the bank might change
its articles of association to allow it to lend directly to the private
sector.
As explained by US officials, the reasoning behind the proposal is that  -
with the increasing role of the private sector in developing countries - the
bank risks losing its relevance in the 1990s if it deals only with the
public sector. A capital increase by the IFC alone would not meet the needs
for private sector development.
The suggestion has prompted the bank to suggest a series of changes which
will increase its explicit involvement in the private sector. But there is
concern among bank officials about the US proposal.
Mr Barber Conable, the bank's president, says a 50 per cent target for loans
directed to the private sector risks 'subterfuge', suggesting the bank would
simply redefine loans so they fitted into the right category.
Mr Larry Summers, the bank's new chief economist, speaks of a confusion
between measures which help the private sector to flourish and direct aid to
companies in the private sector.
The former area, providing the so-called 'enabling environment' for the
private sector - roads, telephones and electricity - is where the bank has
its comparative advantage, he says.
The establishment of significant private sector expertise in the bank also
risks expanding its 6,000-strong bureaucracy and overlapping with the work
the IFC already does.
Even if the proposal were adopted, it is unclear what it would mean. The
term 'lending directed towards the private sector' has an elasticity which
makes its impact vague.
On its proposal for the bank to lend directly to the private sector, the US
is in a minority among shareholders, possibly numbering one.
But given the importance of the US agenda, and the need to push the
regularly requested capital infusions of international institutions through
the US Congress, the proposal cannot be ignored.
The prospect of lending to the private sector frightens some bank officials.
The reason is simple; the bank's top credit rating enables it to borrow at
premium rates in the world's financial markets. Lending to the private
sector would add immeasurably to the risks it already faces, adding the
question of commercial risk to that of a country's willingness or ability to
pay.
The IFC's own portfolio is said to reinforce this view. Some bank officials
argue its lending record is at best chequered.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Algeria offers nuclear inspection

<TEXT>
Algeria yesterday offered to submit its nuclear programme to international
inspection following a series of western newspaper allegations that it had
embarked, with China, on a secret project to develop atomic weapons, Francis
Ghiles writes.
Ministry of Scientific Research officials in Algiers told the El Moudjahid
newspaper: 'Now is the time to supply international public opinion with
information concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy'. The nuclear
programme is being developed in Ouessera, near the town of Bouira 80km from
Algiers.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Major's UN police force move gains more support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S proposal for the United Nations to send its own police units to
northern Iraq to protect Kurdish refugees and replace 9,000 allied troops on
duty there appeared to be gathering further support within the world body
last night.
Diplomats said a letter from Mr Major was delivered to Mr Javier Perez de
Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, who discussed the plan with Sir David
Hannay, Britain's UN representative, and US and French delegates.
Although there was no official reaction from the secretary-general's office,
a UN source said he saw merit in the proposal and felt it could be carried
out possibly without need for a formal Security Council resolution.
Western diplomats again emphasised their view that the secretary general had
adequate authority to deploy UN civilian police in the area, to where an
estimated 20,000 Kurdish refugees are returning every day. Nevertheless, the
Soviet Union and China, the other permanent members of the Security Council,
have been brought into the consultations.
They were described as 'not negative' in their initial reactions.
'They are still thinking about it and we can take some encouragement from
that,' a western delegate said.
The west was said not to be worried by Iraqi objections, since Baghdad had
changed its mind in the past, notably in agreeing eventually to allow the
setting up of Kurdish safe havens.
In northern Iraq, Kurdish refugees, started streaming home to the security
zone carved around Zakho by allied western troops after peshmerga guerrillas
took down roadblocks and let the refugees pass.
The UN ran up its flag across from the first allied camp near Zakho, 10km
from the border, establishing a regular presence alongside and separate from
that of the allied troops. Many of the refugees arriving back in their home
area passed the blue-and-white allied tent city and straight to the houses
they had abandoned over the past two months.
Allied commanders said that despite the UN presence any handover to the UN
was still a long way off.
The UN sanctions committee met yesterday but failed to take a decision on a
request by Iraq for the unfreezing of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) of
assets, mainly in the UK, the US, Japan and Switzerland, and on the
application by the Iraqis for the easing of the sanctions so that they might
sell oil to the value of Dollars 945m and spend the proceeds on food and
medicines. The committee has scheduled another meeting for Friday.
The committee, comprising all 15 council members, operates on the basis of
consensus and officials said neither request could survive the current
strong objections of a number of members.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Beirut stirs cautiously beneath the ruins of 16 bloody
years: Lara Marlowe wanders through the rubble and talks to some great
survivors of a civil war that claimed 150,000 lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIXTEEN years ago 27 Palestinians died at the hands of Christian Phalangist
militiamen in the Beirut suburb of Ain El-Roumaneh. Since then, Lebanon's
civil war has claimed 150,000 lives.
Yet today, the utter despair of the 1989 and 1990 'Aoun wars' - when
Christian leader General Michel Aoun attempted to take control of all of
Lebanon - is gone, and most Lebanese say cautiously that they believe their
civil war is over.
Ships now queue up outside Beirut port to unload their cargo. Tens of
thousands of Lebanese abroad have overwhelmed the rosters of Beirut schools
with enrolments for next September. Families are reclaiming summer homes in
the hills of Sofar, Aley and Chemlan, sometimes paying thousands of dollars
to dislodge their militia inhabitants. Shops are being refurbished with
chandeliers and marble facades.
Well-to-do Moslems venturing for the first time in many years to the Vieux
Quartier restaurant in Ashrafieh now comprise 20 per cent of the
establishment's clientele. 'No one becomes president without passing through
here,' Mr Rizkallah Akiki, the Vieux Quartier's maitre d'hotel, boasts.
But if Lebanon's finest restaurant has survived, so have its ghosts. There
is the table where President-elect, Mr Bashir Gemayel, sat with Mr Ariel
Sharon - then Israeli defence minister - before Mr Gemayel's assassination
in 1982.
Mr Dany Chamoun, son of the late President Camille Chamoun, who was
assassinated with his wife and sons last October, was an habitue. If you
hold your restaurant bill to the light, you can still see a triangle inside
a circle - the Phalangist symbol - blotted out. When President Elias Hrawi's
government ordered the Phalange to pull out of Ashrafieh in December, the
restaurant refused to continue paying the 5 per cent Phalangist militia tax.
'When the Christians were fighting the Christians last year, I knew the war
had to end,' Mr Akiki says. 'We hit the bottom of the abyss. I know many
people who died and it makes me sad. Why did it take 15 years? Why didn't
this solution come sooner?'
The solution is embodied in a fractious, 30-member cabinet officiating over
the lurching but, none the less, real implementation of the October 1989
Taif peace accords.
Mr Marwan Hamade, the minister of commerce, believes that the internal
political reasons for the war no longer exist. 'Religious animosity has
almost totally disappeared and has been replaced by power struggles within
each community,' he said. 'Psychologically, the Lebanese are so exhausted
that they have convinced themselves that whatever they have obtained from
the war is enough.'
He points out that economically, the country is incapable of generating a
financial base to continue the war. 'The militias skimmed off everything
there was to take. The Soviets won't send any more weapons to Jumblatt (the
Druze leader). The Saudis won't give money to the Palestinians and the
Israelis are not sending dollars to the Lebanese Forces (Phalange). Libya
has stopped helping the extremists. The Iranians may still be helping the
Hizbollah, but even their fervour has decreased - it's part of the general
weariness,' he said.
Many Lebanese believe the Gulf war helped their country. 'Because the
Americans and the Syrians are close now, the Americans are putting real
pressure on the Christian militias and the Syrians are putting pressure on
the Moslems,' Mr Hamade said.
President Hrawi's government is attempting to revive Lebanon's devastated
economy. The European Community and Saudi Arabia have given at least Dollars
820m in aid and soft loans but a government study estimates the cost of
reconstruction at Dollars 25bn.
A quarter of Lebanon's 3.5m population emigrated to escape the war and a
third of the remaining work force are unemployed.
In recent years, Lebanon has suffered triple-digit inflation and the
Lebanese pound has tumbled from 2.5 to the dollar in 1975, to a current rate
of 940.
The Lebanese government's priority has been to repair the electricity and
water works destroyed in the 'Aoun wars'. Residents of Beirut now receive an
average of six to 12 hours electricity each day as opposed to no electricity
at all a year ago.
Filling government coffers poses more of a challenge. Mr Hamade recently cut
an annual Dollars 80m wheat subsidy which had encouraged Lebanese to smuggle
wheat and flour abroad.
Other measures include the updating of pre-devaluation customs duty. From
yesterday - the latest deadline set for the disarming of all militias - the
government claims it will control, and tax, all ports in Lebanon. It will
also re-establish a tax on subsidised fuel, which accounted for nearly 20
per cent of government spending in 1989.
Symbols of a renascent Lebanon are everywhere. Mrs Rima Shehadeh, a Sunni
Moslem married to a Christian doctor, is one of the war's great survivors.
For 15 years, she and her husband, Najib, clung to his family's 125-year old
Ottoman stone mansion in the heart of west Beirut, moving from room to room
depending on the direction of the artillery fire as the militias
foughtacross their garden.
Mrs Rima Shehadeh continued her interior design business, sometimes taking
seven hours to cross on foot to east Beirut, a journey which now takes five
minutes. When roads were closed she transported furniture for clients in
vegetable carts.
'I always knew it was going to be worth it one day - if we survived
physically,' Mrs Shehadeh says. This year, six Lebanese bankers have
returned to Beirut and hired her to furnish their homes.
A few months before her death from cancer last year, Mrs Leila El-Hoss, the
wife of former prime minister Mr Selim El-Hoss and another Christian married
to a Moslem, visited Rima Shehadeh's home.
'The house which is alive in a country which is dead,' she wrote in the
guest book. Today that country appears to have been re-born.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Maghreb rivals look to future: UN-backed referendum signals
peace for Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH parties to the conflict over the status of the former Spanish colony of
Western Sahara, Morocco and the Polisario Liberation Front, have made
concessions - especially, it seems, Polisario and its main ally Algeria.
This made it possible for the UN Security Council on Monday to agree
proposals for a referendum, drawn up by Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar,
secretary-general.
Under the plan, Morocco will cut its troops by two-thirds, to 65,000, within
11 weeks of a ceasefire. All remaining Moroccan troops will be confined to
defensive positions along the protective wall Morocco has built to defend
itself from Polisario guerrilla attacks.
Polisario's estimated 7,000 fighters will also be confined to camps around
the main refugee centre south of Tindouf, in south-western Algeria. However,
the existing Moroccan administration will remain, contrary to Polisario's
initial wishes. Considerations of cost strongly militated against a UN
take-over of the administration of the territory before a referendum. An
election commission is to decide who is eligible to vote in the referendum
which a force of 2,000 UN peacekeepers will supervise.
Morocco's King Hassan has accepted the idea of a referendum but said the
result could only 'ratify' what most Moroccans strongly felt was theirs.
President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria has gone to great lengths to rebuild
links with Morocco, notably by re-establishing diplomatic ties, broken off
in 1976, three years ago. But the outcome of the first-ever free elections
in North Africa, due next July in Algeria, could bring to power people far
less willing to compromise.
Furthermore, Morocco and Algeria know that the pipeline project to carry
natural gas to Spain, across northern Morocco and the Straits of Gibraltar,
will be given a big impetus if the north African countries settle the
dispute.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Iran-US relations ease despite hardliners' anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST US supplies of clothes and blankets for Kurdish refugees arrived
in Iran this week, to be greeted by the hardline Tehran newspaper,
Jomhuri-ye Islami, as Aids-infested rejects which should be returned.
This is in stark contrast to the official position of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's government which has been to welcome international aid,
including any from the US, while the country remains swamped by the sudden
influx of over 1m refugees. President George Bush called the Iranian
decision to receive the US supplies as 'a new and welcome thing'.
The delivery came in the second US aircraft to land in Tehran since the 1979
revolution - the first carried a chocolate cake brought by Mr Robert
McFarlane, then US national security adviser, as part of a secret attempt to
improve relations and obtain the release of US hostages in Lebanon, through
the sale of arms.
The hostages remain the main block to any radical improvement in relations
between Tehran and Washington as Mr Bush made clear a fortnight ago. He did,
however, hope for better ties with Iran.
There has nevertheless been a definite thaw in relations. In January,
Washington relaxed a three-year ban on Iranian oil imports, though the
proceeds of such sales would have to be deposited in an account at the Hague
designed to compensate US claimants.
On Monday the Middle East Economic Survey, the Cyprus-based oil newsletter
reported that Iran had concluded oil deals with two American buyers, for oil
deliveries totalling 130,000 b/d to non-US destinations, thereby avoiding
the Hague payment restrictions.
Last month, the US administration did not attempt to block a Dollars 250m
World Bank loan to Iran for earthquake reconstruction, despite Iran being on
its list of 'terrorist' nations.
The thaw has been prompted by strategic developments in the Gulf region. Now
that Iraq's power has diminished and Iran has gone out of its way to improve
relations with the Gulf emirates, the US is contemplating the role Iran is
likely to play in the future.
Iran itself, is anxious to resume the mantle of guardian of the Gulf which
it wore under the Shah. Mr Rafsanjani has just completed a visit to Syria
and is now in Turkey, to discuss regional issues.
He is concerned that Iran should never be as isolated as it was when Iraq
invaded the country in 1980, the start of an eight-year war.
If tensions were to erupt with Iraq, Iran would want to make sure it did not
stand alone.
But Iranian hardliners are on the defensive and have attacked Mr
Rafsanjani's policy of restoring relations with some of the US's closest
regional allies, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. The daily Kayhan,
warned against following a 'policy of appeasement' in order to achieve a
'prestigious place in the so-called Persian Gulf security order'.

<TEXT>
GERMANY IS prepared to assume greater international responsibilities, but is
not seeking amendments in the United Nations Charter which would allow it
become a permanent member of the Security Council, Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Genscher, who had talks in London with Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was clearly at pains
to counter criticisms that Germany was reluctant to assume the international
political responsibilities which its economic weight demanded.
'We do not want to renationalise our foreign policy,' Mr Genscher said,
emphasising that Germany intended to exercise its international
responsibilities through an integrated European Community. In the UN
Security Council, it was perfectly possible for Germany fully to express its
views to the two permanent members who were also members of the EC: Britain
and France.
He welcomed the fact that the British government under Mr Major was adopting
a more constructive attitude towards the development of the EC.
Stressing that a country's influence inside the Community was a reflection
of how positive a stand it adopted towards the EC, Mr Genscher said: 'We see
British policies are gaining weight and importance that further the
interests of the Community.'
He believed that an agreement on a common foreign and security policy would
be reached this year.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S president, Mr Lech Walesa, yesterday postponed a meeting of
economists organised by his advisory council in a move which indicates his
backing for the government's economic policies.
The meeting, due to take place on May 6, was widely seen as an attempt to
force a change in the government's anti-inflation economic policies
engineered by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the deputy prime minister.
Mr Walesa made the decision after holding talks yesterday morning with met
Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the prime minister. His decision followed a
report issued last week by the government's Central Planning Office.
It warned that Poland's gross domestic product could fall this year by up to
5 per cent, the rate of inflation would exceed 80 per cent, the trade
deficit would reach Dollars 2.1bn and unemployment would edge towards 2m.

FT  01 MAY 91 / The Trabi splutters off into history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRABANT, the unprepossessing little car that west Germans took to their
hearts when the opening of the border brought freedom to the east, rolled
off the assembly line in Zwickau ((above) for the last time yesterday,
writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
The spluttering, polluting Trabi brought thousands of East Germans over the
border after travel to the west suddenly became possible in November 1989.
Some came to start new lives while others simply came to look.
Looking like something a clever mechanic might have run up in his back-yard,
the Trabi became an unlikely symbol not only of freedom and hope, but also
of east Germany's industrial backwardness. The car lacks style and power. It
looks incongruous on west Germany's high-speed autobahns pottering along in
the slow lane among the lorries and the dawdlers.
With its fibre-glass body and its two-stroke engine, the Trabi is no longer
wanted. It was costing too much to make and nobody, especially not east
Germans, wanted to buy it any more.
But its memory will live on - not least as star of the film 'Go Trabi, Go',
a comedy about an east German family who bravely, and successfully, take
their Trabi on holiday from grimy Bitterfeld to sunny Naples.

FT  30 APR 91 / Dominican Republic escapes US sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED States has concluded that there are no grounds for implementing
trade sanctions against the Dominican Republic over the treatment of Haitian
migrant workers.
The calls for sanctions, including the removal of preferences granted under
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, followed claims by human rights
organisations that Haitian workers, particularly those in sugar cane fields,
were being mistreated.
The human rights organisations said the conditions under which many Haitians
were working in the Dominican republic amounted to forced labour.
Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola. A shortage
of field labour in the Dominican Republic has attracted workers from across
the border.
Unemployment in Haiti is 60 per cent, and wages are low. The charges led the
office of the US Trade Representative to start an investigation two years
ago, and last year President Jaoquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic
ordered all employers of Haitian workers to provide the government with
information on the condition of their employees.
The president also decreed that all contracts made out to Haitian workers
should be in Spanish and Haitian creole, so the workers would be clear on
the terms of their employment.
There are an estimated 750,000 Haitians in the Dominican Republic, most of
whom are believed to have entered the country illegally. They are employed
in cane fields, rice and coffee farms and in the construction industry.
The US report, which is unlikely to appease the human rights organisations,
said there had been improvements in workers rights and the conditions of
Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL charities have often found Japan hard going. Japanese will
make great sacrifices for the sake of family and close friends but are less
easily moved by the plight of strangers.
There have always been exceptions, but Japan lacks a single international
charity of the scale of Oxfam in the UK, Medecins sans Frontiers in France
or Care in the US.
While the Japanese government is the world's largest provider of assistance
to developing countries, contributions by private organisations are small in
comparison with the west.
Japan is a relative newcomer to the club of rich nations; its
self-consciously insular people have little experience of involvement in
international affairs; their religious traditions lack the missionary spirit
of Christianity. When the Japanese government last year asked for volunteers
for medical missions to the Gulf, only about 20 people responded.
But there are signs that things are changing. The graphic television
coverage of the destruction of Kuwait, the bombing of Iraq, and the
sufferings of the Kurdish refugees has made Japanese more aware of the world
around them. The appointment of Mrs Sadako Ogata, a tough-minded university
professor, as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has made people
realise that they have a role to play beyond their shores.
Government has led the way, with Dollars 128m being given from the public
purse for refugees and other victims of the war. Of this, Dollars 100m is
going for the Kurds, fully one quarter of the Dollars 400m worldwide appeal
launched by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation. Japanese
business has followed with a Y1.4bn appeal fund, to which Sony, the
electronics group has contributed around Y400m.
People also seemed to have been moved by the refugee crisis as never before.
Miss Chikako Saito, an official of the UNHCR in Tokyo, says it has collected
Y400m in the past few weeks, less than the Y500m donated for famine relief
in the 1980s but money is still pouring in. 'The difference this time is
that people want to know about the refugees. At the time of Ethiopia they
just felt a vague sympathy. Now they want to know where the victims are and
how they are suffering,' said Miss Saito.
The Japan Red Cross says it collected 7,000 gifts worth Y300m in the first
week after the war broke out in January.
However, an official of the Non-Government Organisation for International
Co-operation, an umbrella group for 13 volunteer groups, says it is too
early to say whether Japanese attitudes have changed or not. 'Buddhists are
passive, accepting things as they are and not trying to change them. So
Japanese tend to feel sympathy but not to act. We need to establish
organisations to make sure people can express their sympathies.'

Poland's privatisation minister, Mr Janusz Lewandowski, has announced that
the country's next public share offer would open around May 20 with the sale
of the Swarzedz furniture factory, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Five per cent of the shares in Swarzedz, near the western city of Poznan,
are to be awarded to three former owners of workshops taken over after the
Second World War to set up the factory.
The ministry is also expected to sign an agreement at the same time selling
a 51 per cent share of the Polkolor television works to the French Thomson
defence and electronics group. The purchase will cost the French company
Dollars 35m, with Polkolor valued at Dollars 68.6m.

FT  30 APR 91 / The heat is on for British Gas: New price controls will
create a harsher business climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When householders get their first quarterly gas bills after April next year,
they could see some reduction in their payments. This would be one result of
the tough new price controls imposed on British Gas, which were announced in
a formula yesterday.
But if those same householders are among the 5m small investors who bought
British Gas shares when the utility was privatised nearly five years ago,
they could see the reduction in payments matched by a slowdown in the rate
of growth of the company's dividends.
British Gas stressed that the stringent new ceiling on the prices it can
charge its 17m domestic gas users will not affect its policy of increasing
dividends by more than the rate of inflation. But many City observers are
sceptical, and believe the straitjacket into which British Gas has fitted
itself by accepting proposals put by its regulator, the Office of Gas Supply
(Ofgas), will prove tighter and tighter over the next five years.
'Ofgas will maybe help the government meet its inflation objectives with
these price proposals,' said Mr Peter Nicol, a gas expert at Warburg
Securities in London, 'but it will also help them along the way to 3m
unemployed.' He said this was because British Gas's new price constraints
would force it to make substantial job cuts.
The new formula means that British Gas can increase its domestic prices by 5
percentage points less than the rate of inflation  - rather than the current
2 percentage points. Thus, if inflation falls below 5 per cent, gas prices
will actually fall. Ofgas estimates that the new controls could leave gas
prices 15 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been at the end of
five years. Domestic users could benefit in another way. In a complex
algebraic formula, the regulator will force British Gas to buy North Sea
supplies at a lower price by capping any rise in costs that is passed on to
consumers.
In response to calls from consumers that cuts in British Gas's costs should
not be reflected in a lower standard of service, Mr James McKinnon,
director-general of Ofgas, has also set targets for standards of service to
which the company must stick. This includes, for example, the time it takes
to respond to gas leaks, and how soon new customers can be connected. If
British Gas consistently fails to meet these service targets, Mr McKinnon
will refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which can then
impose a further price cut.
British Gas was sanguine yesterday about its ability to work within the new
price formula - the severity of which has shocked many observers. 'This is a
very tough package,' said Mr Bob Evans, British Gas chairman, 'but
nevertheless, we are confident we can continue to generate satisfactory
rates of return and profitability'. The formula envisages a rate of return
on capital employed for the domestic business of 5 to 7 per cent. Mr Evans
said this was consistent with the company's performance since privatisation
when the rate of return had been just over 6 per cent before adjustment for
seasonal factors.
He said the company had debated the proposals and had had three tense board
meetings before deciding to accept the proposals, rather than submit the
issue to a Monopolies investigation  - the only alternative. One overriding
reason for accepting the formula had been the need to remove the uncertainty
hanging over the company's domestic business since Ofgas began its review 11
months ago. This could have meant a cloud over the company for at least
another six months.
Mr Evans said British Gas had reduced its number of employees by 10,000 over
the past four years while at the same time connecting an additional 1.2m
customers and putting in 2m central heating units. He said the company
expects continued growth in the number of new gas users which will help it
to increase its efficiency. It also plans to make more use of information
technology and to impose tighter scrutiny of managers in the company's 90
regions.
At the moment the City remains unimpressed as to whether these assertions
can be translated into the sort of cost-cutting needed for British Gas to
stay within its new price limits. Mr Nicol estimates that even with some
measures already in place, and 3 per cent growth in the company's business
each year, it would not be able to meet the new formula's target. He
believes that if British Gas continues its current trend, the formula will
knock Pounds 90m off profits for five years from April 1992. That amount
theoretically could be saved by a cut of 6,000 jobs or 7.5 per cent of its
workforce each year the controls are in place.
Ofgas's price control guidelines mar the outlook for British Gas. There
could be some hard bargaining over details when the consultation period
begins in a few weeks because Mr McKinnon interprets broadly his brief of
achieving value for money for domestic customers. But he is also applying
pressure to remind the company that it is not a monopoly supplier in another
sector: the industrial market, where each consumer uses more than 25,000
therms of gas a year and where competition was meant to flourish after
privatisation.
So far, competitors have captured only 2.5 per cent of the total industrial
market  - Ofgas wants British Gas to yield 30 per cent of the industrial
sector to competitors by 1993. The Monopolies Commission is currently
investigating the workings of a government recommendation that encourages
British Gas to buy no more than 90 per cent of the gas coming on stream from
new fields so that competitors have access to more supplies. But the
commission is expected to look into the whole question of industrial gas
competition and its report, due for release in about six weeks, could force
British Gas to undergo an overhaul as thorough on its industrial side as the
new tariff formula will impose on its domestic side.
Competition in the industrial sector of the market has been made all the
more pressing by the sharp increase in demand from power generators and by
British Gas's fear that it would not have enough gas to fill that demand.
One of the first fruits of electricity privatisation has been the
electricity industry's abandoning of large coal-fired plant. Observers
expect gas demand from generators to grow at a rate of about 2 per cent a
year.
British Gas attracted widespread criticism earlier this year when its supply
and demand calculations failed to predict the surge in demand in power
station gas. In the absence of gas to supply this demand, it moved to choke
it off by imposing a 35 per cent price increase on new gas purchases in
March. Many commentators blamed the management of British Gas for failing to
foresee the problem. Ofgas has now forced the company to remain in
negotiations with two power station projects - Thames Power and a Mobil and
Eastern Electricity joint venture  - over supplying gas at the old price in
a move that could end in a court battle.
One development that seems almost certain to result from the perceived gap
in supply and Ofgas's new price ceiling is that the UK government will have
to overcome its resistance to gas imports from Norway. British Gas is itself
negotiating with Norway's Statoil over gas imports in spite of having a
government veto imposed on its attempt to buy gas from the huge Sleipner
field in 1985. The government must almost certainly give the go-ahead later
this decade for imports in view of the fact that Norwegian gas is likely to
be cheaper than UK gas from the North Sea.
These mounting pressures on British Gas mean that the company will have to
introduce significant changes in the way it runs it business unless it wants
to see its profits slip. Ofgas has called the existence of the company in
its current form into question in the industrial market where it will have
to start thinking like a competitor rather than a monopoly supplier. Mr
Evans says a break-up of the company is not under consideration at present,
but many observers believe that would be the only way to foster real
competition in the industrial market and ensure fair prices for domestic
users.

FT  30 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Gas weak on pricing formula
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSY two-way trade developed in British Gas after the company agreed to
abide by a new pricing formula for the company's 17m-plus domestic customers
from the gas industry regulator, Ofgas. The new formula, the inflation rate
minus five points, was said by analysts to have been as bad as they could
have expected.
Gas dropped to 238p on the news, compared with last Friday's close of 244
1/2 p, but then rallied to 245p before dipping again and closing a fraction
easier on balance at 244p. Turnover of 21m was the day's highest of the
Footsie stocks.
Among bears of the stock, Mr John Toalster of Strauss Turnbull, described
the pricing formula as 'very tough', while Mr Steve Turner at Smith New
Court said that 'at a stroke Mr McKinnon (director-general of Ofgas) has
removed any prospect of real earnings growth over the next five years'.
BZW's utilities team said it was 'still negative' on Gas, while County
NatWest told clients to switch from Gas to British Telecom, where the
company faces a better earnings dividend and regulatory profile.
Kleinwort Benson, a strong supporter of Gas, said that although at first
glance the Ofgas terms were 'not good', the company said its dividend
policy, promising 15 per cent growth, remained unchanged. Mr Jeremy Hudson
at Shearson Lehman remained bullish, also highlighting the 'powerful'
dividend argument.
Internationals rise
The strength of the dollar at the opening of trade gave international stocks
a boost. The rise was led by ICI, on good weekend press comment and as
brokers continued to argue that last week's cautious annual meeting marked
the low point in the company's fortunes during the current recession. ICI
shares climbed 16 to 1076p.
Hoare Govett's assessment that Reuters was undervalued helped sentiment, and
steady US buying made its presence felt in Hanson. Reuters advanced 23 to
831p in good turnover for the stock of 1m. Hanson rose 4 1/2 to 229 1/2 p in
more typical levels of business as 4.1m changed hands. Glaxo continued last
week's recovery with a rise of 21 to 1124p.
Asda slipped a penny to 121p against the wider trend on 2.2m shares traded
as brokers reduced their profits estimates following meetings with the
company at the end of last week.
Hoare Govett, which had already surprised the market by forecasting lower
profits for 1992/93, cut its estimate for that year still further, from
Pounds 189m to Pounds 175m.
A slower stores opening programme in 1991/92 combined with increased
competition from its rivals and larger interest payments are eroding Asda's
profitability, Hoare said.
Unilever shed 3 to 748p on switching out of the plc shares into the NV.
There was also some unease ahead of the first-quarter figures, due in May.
Profits of Pounds 340m to Pounds 350m, against Pounds 369m, are expected.
Barclays was among the best performers in the banks, edging up 4 to 446p
after a buy recommendation from Panmure Gordon's Mr Tim Clarke. He said
Barclays was within a whisker of being the highest yielding stock in the
sector and yet is one of the strongest and most profitable.
Bank of Scotland, scheduled to report preliminary figures tomorrow, with
County NatWest expecting Pounds 135m against last time's Pounds 193.5m,
eased 2 1/2 to 132 1/2 p.
CE Heath, the insurance broker, came in for rough treatment, closing 10
lower at 512p after Ms Julianne Jessup at BZW downgraded her profits and
dividend estimates. Ms Jessup said BZW was an 'emphatic seller of Heath',
and chopped her March 1991 estimate from Pounds 30m to Pounds 27.3m and that
for 1992 from Pounds 33m to Pounds 29m. She reduced her 1992 dividend
forecast from 27p to 26p.
Ms Jessup said Heath's dependence on investment income made it vulnerable to
falling interest rates, and also cited continuing soft insurance markets and
adverse movements in the dollar. She believed Heath's broking operations had
had a disappointing renewal season.
Reports that both the chairman and chief executive of Allied-Lyons will this
week announce early retirement from July, rather than 1992, caused brief
dullness in the shares. They recovered, however, to end 7 higher on the day
at 527p.
Sterling/dollar influences combined with American buying ensured a firmer
trend for Grand Metropolitan, which rose 13 to 803p.
The buoyancy of the equity market aroused speculation of takeover
possibilities both for Footsie and lesser-known industrial stocks.
Pilkington was inevitably to the fore, advancing 8 to 194p in relatively
thin trading as hopes resurfaced of a bid from a UK conglomerate. Once again
the principal choice was BTR.
Cookson benefited from both views of the stock being a good recovery play as
well as a possible bid target. Again, business was rather light, but the new
fully paid shares moved ahead 7 to 132p.
Trimoco, the automotive distributor, was bought on suggestions that either
the Saudi Arabian Jameel organisation, a major shareholder, or the UK's Tom
Cowie group might be interested in acquiring the company. Trimoco
appreciated 3 to 22 1/2 p.
Reports that a predator was looking at CIA Group stimulated support for
shares of the USM-quoted media-buying company, and they rose to 146p before
closing 16 ahead on balance at 141p.
Worries that digestion of the new shares resulting from the rights issue
could hold back Morgan Crucible saw the old fall 13 to 224p ex-all; the new
nil-paid lost 2 to 6p premium.
Demerger stories combined with further dividend buying - the interim results
are scheduled for May 8, and thus fall within the current three-week trading
account - boosted Trafalgar House again. In trading volume of 2.6m shares
the price climbed 10 to 264p.
Hopes revived of MB Caradon finding a buyer for its stake in French group
CMB Packaging and the stock climbed 10 to 226p.
British Telecom put on 4 1/2 to 364p, helped by the County recommendation to
switch from Gas.
Marks and Spencer firmed just a penny to 255p, underperforming a stronger
market as dealers anticipated reductions in profits forecasts following the
announcement of provisions of Pounds 16m to cover the cost of 850
redundancies. Only a proportion of this will affect the bottom line and
profits estimates are likely to be cut from between Pounds 615m to Pounds
620m to Pounds 610m.
EuroDisney moved ahead 32 to 1175p after the company said it was contesting
legal action by architects Atelier. Any dispute with Atelier, EuroDisney
said, would not affect plans for completion of the attractions in its theme
park near Paris.
Granada rallied from an initially depressed 181p to finish a net 3 up at
190p following reports that institutional investors are pressing for
top-level management changes ahead of an expected Pounds 150m rights issue
and a number of disposals needed to reduce debt burden.
Electricity distribution stocks lacked support, but water issues were given
another push by several brokers, notably Smith New Court. The latter was
heavily involved in the Water Package, which moved up 28 to Pounds 2983.
Tootal appeared to win the latest round of the verbal battle with hostile
bidder Coats Viyella. Its forecast of a 40 per cent rise in profits for the
year to next January was criticised by Mr Neville Bain, the Coats chief
executive, as being 'imprecise'. He said that 'we are not going to overpay'
for Tootal, but the shares gained 2 to 79p, reflecting views that the 65p
cash per share offer would be increased, probably by way of an all-paper
bid. Coats Viyella firmed to 141p xd.
TR High Income became the first investment trust managed by Touche Remnant
to tap the market for funds. It called for Pounds 9m through a rights issue,
consisting mainly of new shares, although some new subscription shares are
also being issued. The proposals left the former 4 lower at 106p and the
latter 2 off at 30p.
Property and motor distributor Wyndham rallied 7 to 14p after Friday's steep
fall on a sell recommendation.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops after early rise on
March economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
CONCERTED computerised selling during the afternoon sparked a 50-point
turnround in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday from a moderate rise
made earlier in the session on the back of positive US economic statistics,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow blue chip indicator was down 35.40 on balance at
2,876.98, having initially been over 15 points ahead. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending 5.36 off at 373.66.
The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, which had been lower all
day, registered a drop of 6.90 at 487.74.
Turnover on the New York SE was thin at just 150m shares. Declining issues
outpaced advances by more than two-to-one.
Share prices had been higher in early trading after the Commerce Department
released figures showing that new home sales rose by 1 per cent in March and
by a revised 18.6 per cent in February. Statistics outlining a 0.2 per cent
rise in personal income and a 0.6 per cent increase in personal consumption
in March were also released.
The figures were better than expected and suggested that economic activity
was picking up, albeit slowly. While this encouraged the stock market to
improve at first, the buying was never convincing and afternoon programme
selling quickly sent prices into retreat.
The market's losses in the past week, and the ease with which the Dow has
fallen through several technical support levels, has convinced many
professional investors that shares are embarking on a medium-term decline.
Only a cut in interest rates could bring the market out of its present
slide, said analysts.
Pepsico slipped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 on volume of 4.8m shares
after reporting a modest rise in first-quarter profits to 26 cents a share
from 23 cents.
A&amp;P, the supermarket group, dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 45 3/4 in the wake
of Friday night's warning that its first-quarter profits might be as much as
30 per cent below the Dollars 1.33 a share earned at the same stage in 1990.
Boeing eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 on turnover of 2.2m shares after
revealing a modest rise in first-quarter income to 90 cents a share from the
year earlier level of 87 cents.
News of a Dollars 346m charge against earnings and a resultant Dollars 237m
first-quarter loss left USX, the steel and energy group, Dollars 1/2 lower
at Dollars 31 7/8 .
Vista Chemical climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 52 1/8 in response to the
decision by RWE-DEA, the German utility group, to extend the deadline on its
Dollars 55 a share offer for Vista from May 13 to May 21.
Playboy Enterprises advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 on reporting an
increase in fiscal third-quarter operating profits to 3 cents a share from
the 2 cents registered a year ago.
Other stocks to rise on news of improved profits included Universal
Corporation, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 1/4 , and Unum, Dollars  3/8
firmer at Dollars 62 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices drifted lower from the opening and accelerated their
fall late in the session on fears that the Ontario budget, the first by the
province's socialist-oriented New Democratic Party, would include a sharp
deficit and new taxes. Trading was moderate.
The composite index lost 25 points to close at 3,472.2, while declining
issues were ahead of rises by 351 to 176 after a volume of 21m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-groups finished lower, led by transportation, off 2.18
per cent, while gold issues declined 1.60 per cent and mining 1.45 per cent.

FT  30 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar finishes below peak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR touched a peak of DM1.7825 in Europe yesterday after the weekend
Group of Seven meeting failed to present a united front aimed at limiting
the currency's advance.
The market took this as a green light to push it higher, suggesting that the
dollar was heading for DM1.80, but it ran out of steam before the close of
trading in London. Dealers said there was some uncertainty about direction
in the early European morning, but when the central banks did not intervene
the dollar moved up sharply.
Its failure to attack DM1.80 and a lack of follow-through commercial demand
led to retrenchment later in the day. The downward trend continued in New
York, the US unit touching the DM1.75 level before finishing at DM1.7512,
and leading to comments that the currency may have peaked at DM1.7825 for
the time being.
Earlier at the London close the dollar was up to DM1.7690 from DM1.7545; to
SFr1.4840 from SFr1.4785; and to FFr5.9650 from FFr5.9200, but had declined
to Y137.60 from Y138.15. On Bank of England figures its index rose to 67.2
from 66.8.
The D-Mark remained among the group of weaker currencies in the European
exchange rate mechanism, losing ground to the pound, French franc and
Italian lira. It also slipped to Y77.80 from Y78.75 against the Japanese
currency.
Uncertainty continues about the prospects for interest rates. A joint report
from Germany's leading economic research institutes said continuing threats
to inflation were no reason for tighter monetary policies from the
Bundesbank.
Referring to the problems caused by unification, it argued that an increase
in indirect taxation produces a one-off rise in prices and did not represent
a sustained acceleration in inflation, while high budget deficits are also
no reason for the Bundesbank to reduce the supply of money.
The report also warned that rising interest rates could slow economic growth
and claimed that high wage awards which outstripped productivity would be
inflationary only if fin-anced by the injection of extra funds from the
central bank.
At the same time, Mr Helmut Geiger, president of the German Association of
Savings Banks, said a cut in rates will not take place this year, and 'next
year, too, there will be no considerable easing'.
At this week's securities repurchase agreement tender, the Bundesbank has
offered one-month money at an unchanged fixed rate of 8.60 per cent.
Sterling fell 90 points to Dollars 1.6770 and declined to Y230.75 from
Y233.00 and to SFr2.4875 from SFr2.4925, but rose to DM2.9675 from DM2.9575
and to FFr10.0025 from FFr9.9800.
The pound's index eased 0.1 to 90.7, but the currency rose to third from
fourth strongest place in the ERM. Trading was nervous ahead of Thursday's
local government elections in England and Wales.
In New York, sterling rallied to end 2.10 cents up at Dollars 1.6980.

FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tight nickel stocks predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET NICKEL exports now account for about 13 per cent of Western nickel
supplies, leaving the market vulnerable to any disruptions in shipments,
according to a report from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the London stockbrokers.
The recent unrest in the Baltic states has highlighted concern over the
reliability of supplies, says the report.
'This major factor should prove supportive to prices over the coming months,
particularly as the steady erosion of the political and economic
infrastructure of the Soviet Union gathers pace.'
A large amount of nickel is shipped from the ports of Riga and Tallinn, says
the report, which also points out that production at the primarily
coal-fired nickel complex at Norilsk has been disrupted by the strikes in
the Soviet coal fields.
Meanwhile the normal seasonal increase in stainless steel production is
expected to tighten the finely balanced supply-demand situation in the next
two to three months. The report predicts stocks will decline further from
the already minimal level of seven weeks' consumption.
The situation is likely to be exacerbated by production problems at a
several primary producers and a shortage of stainless steel scrap. The
report points out that some steelmakers depend on scrap for up to 70 per
cent of their nickel supplies.
Carr is predicting an average nickel price in the second quarter of Dollars
4.40 a lb, compared with Dollars 3.93 a lb in the first quarter. Last night
cash nickel on the London Metal Exchange closed at Dollars 8,967.50 a tonne,
or Dollars 4.07 a lb, down Dollars 32.50 on the day.
However, once the second quarter is past prices are likely to weaken again,
resuming the downtrend that was in evidence before this year, says the
report. Stainless steel production is expected to fall by 1 per cent this
year, the third year of decline.
'As a result Western world nickel consumption should be lower by about 2.3
per cent at 635,000 tonnes in 1991, compared with 650,000 tonnes in 1990,'
says the report, which puts Western refined production this year up 1.8 per
cent at 575,000 tonnes.
After allowing for 85,000 tonnes of imports a surplus of 25,000 tonnes is
likely by the year end.

FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Heated arguments over effects
of drought - There is controversy about how imminent irrigation restrictions
should be applied / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no dispute that there is a drought in the south and east of
England. But the row between the National Rivers Authority (NRA) and farmers
who irrigate crops about the best way to use and conserve limited supplies
is becoming increasingly acrimonious.
The south-east has always been the breadbasket of England, growing cereals
for that most basic human food and, of course, for feeding livestock. It has
also, because of its proximity to the main centres of population, been the
main producer of vegetables.
During the last 10 to 15 years, however, with the development of
sophisticated irrigation techniques, the importance of crops like early
potatoes, carrots and fresh salad vegetables in general for sale in
supermarkets has increased dramatically and with it the profitability of the
light-land farms concerned. Without adequate irrigation such enterprises
would quickly collapse.
Experience suggests that yields would probably be halved and quality would
deteriorate to the point of unsaleability.
Today's consumers have come to expect evenly grown, smooth-skinned, clean
vegetables free of scabs and spots, which can only be grown with optimum
moisture. Neither the supermarkets nor their customers would willingly
accept anything less, and farmers are fearful that buyers would seek
alternatives from overseas suppliers.
The NRA, however, has stated that because of the shortage of water caused by
33 months of drought - one of the longest dry periods this century - it
might be forced to restrict crop irrigation to six hours a day in some areas
and perhaps ban it altogether in others.
Back in January it was warning of problems ahead. Even then the cumulative
deficit since August 1988 was equivalent to about 12 inches of rain. The NRA
said at the beginning of the year that to avoid restrictions we needed that
kind of quantity of rain by the end of April. But average rainfall over most
of the area has been only about five inches.
It is now almost inevitable, therefore, that some sort of restriction on
irrigation will soon be imposed by the NRA on all farmers licensed to
abstract from ground water-supplies via bores, or from surface water, such
as rivers. Farmers with their own reservoirs in which they have stored water
collected during the winter are unlikely to be affected.
For the majority who do not have storage facilities, however, it is the type
of restriction proposed which is disputed. The NRA claims it has consulted
farmers' representatives, the Ministry of Agriculture and others and that
the consensus was to limit irrigation to the hours between six am to noon
each day.
Most of the irrigating farmers, on the other hand, point out that this would
be inefficient because much of the water would evaporate during the heat of
summer days. They would rather, they say, be permitted to use an agreed
percentage of their entitlement when they believed it would do their crops
most good, or as a second choice to irrigate at night, when crops would
derive maximum benefit from the water applied.
The NRA replies that nighttime irrigation cannot be policed, and that it
could be dangerous. By this, they mean that, if unattended, mobile
irrigation guns might collide with electricity wires and the like. The
farmers say they feel insulted by the NRA's implication that they are
dishonest or irresponsible or both.
Then things get even nastier. The farmers say the NRA is unjustified in
claiming that aquifers, that is, the deep limestone rocks which hold the
water, are much lower than they really are. Their own records, they claim,
show little difference in bore water levels from previous years, in spite of
the drought.
They also accuse the NRA of wasting water, and of transferring supplies from
this driest area of the country to wash cars in other areas and to top up
rivers and wet-lands for conservation reasons while seeking to penalise the
production of food. The farmers say the NRA's priorities are domestic
consumers first, industry second, conservation third, and food and farming
at the bottom of the list.
The NRA denies that it has any list of priorities, although it does concede
that water wastage because of leaky pipes could be between 10 per cent and
40 per cent of supplies. It points out, however, that it has no power to
control the water used by domestic consumers because this is now the
responsibility of the water supply companies.
Last week two of the region's highest-powered MPs got involved in the row.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the House of Commons and MP for South Norfolk,
and Mrs Gillian Shepherd, Minister of State at the Treasury and MP for South
West Norfolk apparently persuaded the NRA to review its policy towards
irrigation. They are scheduled to meet Mr John Gummer, the Minister of
Agriculture, for further discussions on the matter this week.
Clearly they recognise the threat to the livelihoods of many of their voters
 -not just the farmers, but also the thousands who work in processing
plants, pre-packing vegetables for the supermarkets.
Meanwhile, the drought continues. Soil moisture deficits - that is, the
amount of moisture in that part of the soil to which crop roots can
penetrate compared to what they require for optimum growth - are already
high and increasing. According to the Agromet Unit run by the Ministry of
Agriculture at Wolverhampton deficits for crops of grass, for instance,
exceeded 25 mm last week across most of the southern two-thirds of England
for the second year running.
Last week the irrigation advice service run by Norsk Hydro, the fertiliser
company, was warning that autumn-sown crops of cereals on some of East
Anglia's lightest land would need irrigating within a few days if there was
not substantial rain. It should be noted that the irrigation of cereals even
in June is normally a rather dubious economic exercise, but in late April or
early May it is almost unheard of.
It is, of course, still possible that adequate rainfall during the next few
crucial weeks will provide farm crops on heavier, more moisture-retentive
soils with what they need. But although weather forecasters expect
significant rainfall in the west this week, they see little prospect in much
reaching the parched east.
Irrigating and non-irrigating farmers are becoming increasingly concerned.
That concern was exacerbated last week by Prof Keith Clayton of the
University of East Anglia's Department of Environmental Sciences. He
predicted that, even given rainfall up to average, increasing usage of water
by households, industry and agriculture would mean East Anglia would be
forced to import supplies from Wales by the year 2000. It appears that this
water-shortage story will run and run.

FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Namibia gets tough to defend
its fishing grounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMIBIA, which has long had its rich fishing grounds plundered by other
countries, is taking tough action to preserve what it hopes will become a
major source of foreign exchange.
South Africa, the country's former ruler, was itself exploiting the fish
stocks and, as the rest of the world did not recognise South Africa's
jurisdiction over Namibia, the Namibian coast became open range for fleets
increasingly restricted by measures to conserve falling stocks elsewhere.
Last April the newly-independent Namibia declared a 200-mile Economic
Exclusion Zone (EEZ) and announced that fishing would be by licence only
until research could be done into fish stocks.
Stocks are believed to have plummetted, according to one survey. In 1977 60%
of hake - the target of Spanish ships - caught off Namibia was past breeding
age. In 1989 82% was less than a year old. The average annual hake catch is
now half the 1972 peak of 800,000.
The country has announced a total allowable hake catch of 60,000 tonnes in
1991, but only 15% of this is open to foreign fleets. This is less than 5%
of what the EC fisheries directorate felt would be a reasonable compromise.
Namibia has previously been powerless to prevent poaching because it lacks a
credible fisheries protection fleet. But last November five Spanish ships
were caught fishing illegally inside the EEZ in a daring helicopter
operation
Two weeks ago the Namibian Supreme Court sentenced the captains of the five
Spanish vessels to pay fines totalling R155m (Pounds 33m) or serve prison
terms of between 3 1/2 years and six years. Their ships were seized, with
their equipment and catches.
The day after the arrests Mr Manuel Marin, the European Community
commissioner for fisheries, scuppered fishing quota talks between the EC and
Namibia, citing Namibia's 'apparent conflict with a member state' and the
low quotas offered to the Community.
Mr David Morris, MEP for Mid and West Wales and a member of the fisheries
committee of the European parliament, has written an open letter to the
parliament protesting against what he regards as the use of the commission's
powers to protect the interests of the large Spanish fishing companies.
Mr Morris says: 'Namibia is not in conflict with the European Community. It
is not even in conflict with the Spanish government.' The decision to halt
negotiations 'has created the impression that the European Community as a
body endorses the criminal activities of Spanish fishing crew.'
Spain is the country with most to lose by Namibia's assertion of its fishing
rights. Spanish ships net half the hake caught off the Namibian coast.
Around ports like Vigo in Galacia, 50,000 people are said to be directly or
indirectly dependent on the fishing industry.
Spanish companies have been among the worst offenders in the widespread
violation of Namibia's fishing moratorium. The Spanish government 'deplores
and regrets' the poaching and has warned its fishermen that they face
'strict legal measures' if they violate Namibian waters. It has apprehended
seven ships whose catches came from the area.
Eventually Spain will have to accept a drastic reduction in its fishing off
the Namibian coast if stocks are to recover and Namibia is to be allowed to
build up its own fishing capability. The Spanish government's problem is
that this will have severe domestic repercussions.
Commissioner Marin has said there is 40% overcapacity in the EC fishing
fleet; the north Atlantic has been seriously overfished; in the south
Atlantic European fleets are finding that African governments such as
Namibia and Sierre Leone - which last month arrested a French trawler - are
becoming increasingly assertive. As Spain makes up such a large proportion
of European tonnage, Spain will have to bear the brunt of the cuts if this
overcapacity is to be reduced.
In the past Namibian fishermen accounted for only 18% of the fish caught
within the EEZ and little of the Pounds 100m-worth of catches by foreign
fleets contributed to the country's economy. The government is keen to build
up its own fishing fleet and processing industry after stocks have been
given time to recover. This will be based around the deep water port of
Walvis Bay, which, though currently part of South Africa, is widely expected
to revert to Namibia soon.
The Namibian government believes fishing could overtake mining as the
economy's most important sector in five years time. In 1988 it constituted
2.5% of GDP and 4.4% of exports.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Campeau retailers unveil debt
restructure
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERATED Department Stores and Allied Stores, the two US retailing groups
owned by Canada's Campeau Corporation but operating under the protection of
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code since 1990, yesterday filed their 'plan
of reorganisation' with the bankruptcy court.
The much-publicised bankruptcies came to symbolise the end of the leveraged
bid wave which engulfed corporate America in the Eighties. Campeau's Dollars
10bn acquisitions of Allied and Federated in 1986 and 1988 respectively
turned sour a few years later when the two were unable to service debt which
funded the purchase.
In the plan filed in Cincinnati yesterday, the retail groups - which take in
the prestigious Bloomingdale's store in Manhattan - said they hoped to
emerge from protection early next year.
The aim is to give creditors a mixture of cash, new debt securities, and
equity in a retail group formed by the merger of Federated and Allied. These
shares would probably be listed.
Some Dollars 8.2bn of claims - the figure at the time of the bankruptcy
filing - would be 'compromised', so the business could emerge with debts of
Dollars 2.8bn and equity of Dollars 2.3bn.
General unsecured claims against Federated and Allied would receive shares
in the merged group; general unsecured claims against subsidiaries would
receive a mixture of cash and new medium-term notes. Claims against
Federated Stores Inc (FSI), the immediate parent company of Federated
Department Stores and Allied Stores would be satisfied by distributing stock
in Ralphs, a Los Angeles-based supermarket subsidiary of FSI. Campeau, a
leading FSI creditor, would receive 14.79 per cent of Ralphs. Another 8.6
per cent would go to Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas.
The companies stressed yesterday that the plan does not have approval of any
creditors, although it said that some key concepts were discussed with them.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: First Boston junk bond fund
to be relaunched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST BOSTON Asset Man- agement is to relaunch its Total Returns junk bond
fund to European investors, in the hope that changes in economic and market
conditions since last summer have boosted investor interest.
The fund, planned to total Dollars 250m, closed at Dollars 51m last
September. Fund managers were putting off decisions, as they focused on the
Gulf crisis and the decline of the US economy.
The First Boston fund focuses on higher-quality paper, usually trading at
between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of its par value.
Mr Richard Lindquist, high-yield portfolio manager, said the market offers
an opportunity for investors which will last only a few years, as companies
achieve a greater balance between debt and equity.
The First Boston fund, which has another 18 months to run, will close in
May. Mr Lindquist said the fund hopes to raise a further Dollars 50m to

FT  30 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Bunds hold nerve after G-7 interest rate
pressure

THE GERMAN government bond market showed resilience yesterday following
calls for lower global interest rates from the weekend meeting of finance
ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised countries.
The benchmark 9 per cent 10-year Bund closed yesterday at 103.86, for a
yield of 8.39 per cent, against 8.41 per cent on Friday. On the London
International Financial Futures Exchange, the long bund futures contract
closed at 85.42, against 85.19 at Friday's close.
Although the G-7 statement contained a commitment to lower global interest
rates in the longer term, there is no sign that the German authorities will
ease monetary conditions. Indeed, figures released yesterday confirmed that
inflationary pressures persist within the German economy.
Money supply data for March showed the M3 measure of broad money growing at
a yearly rate of 4.4 per cent over the last quarter of 1990, for a
year-on-year increase of 20.3 per cent over the first quarter last year.
Statistics also showed inflation rising in March by 0.5 per cent over
February, for an annualised rate of 2.8 per cent, against 2.5 per cent last
time.
Moreover, money market conditions remain tight. Yesterday German call money
interest rates were only just below the 9 per cent Lombard rate, the
Bundesbank emergency funding rate.
Hence the bund market will watch Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting in
anticipation of higher, rather than lower, interest rates. Analysts will be
watching industrial production and manufacturing orders figures this week
for signs of overheating.
However, yesterday the Bundesbank signalled that it would supply short-term
liquidity to the market at an unchanged fixed rate of 8.6 per cent at its
regular repurchase operations today. This might indicate that any tightening
of monetary conditions will be postponed beyond this week.

US GOVERNMENT bond prices eased after a variety of economic data provided a
mixed view of the state of the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  7/32 at 96
1/16 , to carry a yield of 8.224 per cent. The short end was also weaker,
with the two-year note  1/32 lower at 100 3/16 , to yield 6.881 per cent.
Among the welter of economic statistics, it was the 0.6 per cent gain in
personal consumption for March that created the biggest stir. The rise was
larger than forecast and, allied to a 0.2 per cent rise in personal income
during the period, suggested that the economic recovery was gradually
picking up pace.
The market was also surprised by figures showing new home sales rose 1 per
cent in March, and a revised 18.6 per cent in February. New home sales are
traditionally regarded as a useful indicator of future economic trends.
Any evidence of an economic upturn strengthens the hands of those at the
Federal Reserve who see no further need for an interest rate cut, and who
believe policy should be left unchanged to prevent a return to high
inflation.
Activity through the day was light, although in the afternoon bond prices
fell further on reports of a large seller of bond futures contracts and a
large seller of two-year notes.
In the credit markets, the Fed intervened to push the Fed funds rate back up
to its target of 6 per cent.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds weakened slightly, continuing the upward correction in
yields seen on Friday in the face of sterling's weakness on the foreign
exchange markets.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt maturing 2003/2007 closed down just 1/16
of a point on the day at 109 31/32 for a yield of 10.258 per cent. The long
gilt futures contract closed at 91.17, after opening at 91.20.
The market is focusing on Thursday's local government elections for pointers
to the timing and outcome of a general election expected this year. The
Confederation of British Industry industrial trends survey for March,
released today, is expected to show a marginal upturn in business confidence
and an improvement in forward indicators.
JAPANESE government bonds moved higher in London in lacklustre trading, with
the Tokyo market closed for a public holiday. The benchmark government bond
issue No 129 closed on a yield of 6.71 per cent, against 6.74 per cent on
Friday.
Although trading is likely to remain thin for the rest of the week, analysts
are watching for signs of the Bank of Japan's reaction to G-7 pressures for
lower global interest rates.
THE DUTCH government raised Fl 1.6bn through tap sales of its 8.5 per cent
bond due 2006 yesterday. The tap price was lowered to 99.40 from 99.55 on
Friday, raising the yield by two basis points to 8.57 per cent.
The sales brought the total raised to Fl 3.1bn since the tap sale was opened
last Thursday.

SHARES in Vista Chemical, the Houston-based company at the centre of an
agreed offer from the German utility, RWE, rallied Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars
52 1/2 yesterday after the bidder conceded it had problems with the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) over one aspect of the bid, but indicated that a
possible solution was under consideration.
The FTC's concerns centre on the alumina interests of the two companies -
thought to be a relatively small part of both groups' business. RWE said
yesterday it was in talks with an unnamed third party and the FTC's staff
'concerning the establishment of a new entity to engage in the alumina
business'.
There were suggestions in the market that the solution involved the creation
of a 'new entity' which would provide competition in the area of high-purity
alumina.
The bidder stressed that 'there could be no assurance as to whether or when
an agreement acceptable to all parties and to the FTC can be reached'.
The German bid was announced in December, with RWE offering to pay Dollars
590m, or Dollars 55 a share, for Vista. The price did not include the debt
which the buyer would assume; at the end of September, that stood at almost
Dollars 600m.
RWE yesterday extended its tender offer for a week, from May 13 to May 21.

<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer, yesterday reported slightly higher
first quarter income on lower revenues but said it expected second quarter
sales and deliveries to be substantially above those in the first three
months of this year.
Net income was Dollars 309m or 90 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars
6.09bn, compared with Dollars 302m or 87 cents on sales of Dollars 6.44bn in
the same period last year.
Commercial aircraft earnings were below those for the first quarter of 1990,
due to lower sales volume and higher research and development costs,
principally for the 777 airliner programme. Offsetting this were lower
defence and space operating losses, higher other income and a lower tax
rate.
Mr Frank Shrontz, the chairman, told the annual meeting the company expected
sales to be substantially higher in the second quarter, while total 1991
sales were projected to be around Dollars 28.5bn, up from Dollars 27.6bn in
1990.
The increase would result from higher commercial jet transport deliveries,
primarily 737s, partially offset by a small decrease in defence and space
sales.
He said airline requests to reschedule deliveries as a result of reduced
traffic had affected a relatively small number of aircraft and that there
had been no cancellations.

PEPSICO, the world's second biggest soft drinks company, yesterday turned in
a 13 per cent rise in first-quarter net earnings with strong growth in its
soft drinks and restaurants businesses offsetting lower results from snack
foods operations.
The figures were in line with expectations and shares in PepsiCo fell
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 at yesterday's close.
For the three months to March 23, PepsiCo recorded net income of Dollars
205.4m or 26 cents a share, against Dollars 181.9m or 23 cents a year
earlier. Sales advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 4.12bn. Pre-tax profits in
the first three months of 1991 rose 15 per cent to Dollars 316m.
PepsiCo's soft drinks business suffered from the loss of the Burger King
account and volume fell 1 per cent. Sales , however, rose 7 per cent to
Dollars 1.4bn and operating profits increased 8 per cent to Dollars 161.1m.
Operating profits from PepsiCo's international soft drinks business surged
45 per cent to Dollars 17.7m on sales which climbed 35 per cent to Dollars

<TEXT>
NCR, the Ohio-based computer manufacturer engaged in a multi-billion dollar
bid battle with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), has moved to enlarge
the size of its board, thus allowing its chief executive, Mr Charles Exley,
to remain on it.
In March, NCR shareholders voted in favour of an AT&amp;T motion which sought to
replace Mr Exley, together with three other NCR directors, by four AT&amp;T
representatives on the board.
As result, Mr Exley and his three fellow directors were due to leave the
board tomorrow when four AT&amp;T nominees would take their places.
However, the NCR board decided at a meeting on Sunday that it would increase
the size of the company's board to 14. It would reappoint Mr Exley to one of
the new vacancies, while Mr Gilbert Williamson, NCR's president, would fill
the other. Mr Exley would continue as chairman of the board, NCR said.
There was no immediate response from AT&amp;T, and it declined to say whether it
had been warned of the changes. After further talks at the weekend, both
companies said they were making progress towards an agreed deal, although
AT&amp;T yesterday described the state of play as 'delicate'.
AT&amp;T offered to increase its bid price to Dollars 110 a share earlier this
month, but only in an all-paper deal.

<TEXT>
COMINCO, the mining and metals group, continues to encounter problems with
its zinc-lead smelting operations at Trail, British Columbia, and may write
down one-third of the CDollars 145m (USDollars 125m) value of its new lead
processing unit, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The German-designed lead smelter, an important environmental advance, was
started-up at the end of 1989 but rapidly ran into operating problems. The
old lead smelter was brought back into production after extensive repairs
but the new unit then had to be shut down completely for major modification.
In the first quarter, Cominco posted a net loss of CDollars 10.2m, or 14
cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 17.1m, or 20 cents, a year
earlier, on sales of CDollars 275m, against CDollars 309m. The first two
quarters are normally weakest for the group since it ships concentrates from
its two Arctic mines only in the second half.
Teck, the Vancouver-based mining group which effectively controls Cominco,
reported first-quarter profits of CDollars 11m, or 14 cents a share, down 54
per cent from a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 104m, down nearly 14
per cent.

ATLANTIC Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company,
yesterday posted a decline in underlying first-quarter earnings, in line
with its earlier predictions, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Arco's 1990 results were distorted by a Dollars 323m gain from a change in
accounting methods and Dollars 233m after-tax charges relating to
environmental clean-up costs and tax provisions.
Including these one-time items, Arco's net income for the first three months
of 1991 dropped 41 per cent to Dollars 351m or Dollars 2.17 a share from
Dollars 592m or Dollars 3.55 a year earlier.
Mr Lodwrick Cook, chairman, said the first-quarter results reflected
unseasonably low natural gas prices, lower average crude oil prices and
lower margins and volume for chemical operations. These more than offset
stronger refining results and higher crude oil and natural gas production
levels.
Arco's worldwide oil and gas exploration and production operations earned
Dollars 261m after tax, down 19 per cent from Dollars 319m a year ago.
Refining and marketing earned Dollars 74m against Dollars 72m.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: US legal eagles may clip
Schneider's wings - The challenge for Square D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The takeover battle being waged by Groupe Schneider of France for Square D
of Illinois is about to enter a critical phase. During the next two weeks,
two key legal decisions will be made that could spoil the French company's
plans.
At hearings on May 9 and May 13, Judge Leonard Sand, of the US District
Court for the Southern District of New York, is scheduled to decide whether
there are grounds to Square D's allegations that a takeover by Schneider
would violate American anti-trust laws.
Square D has asked for preliminary injunctions against Schneider to halt its
proxy solicitation and tender offer of Dollars 78 per share, or Dollars
1.9bn. Both Schneider and Square D make electrical equipment.
If Judge Sand were to find in favour of Square D, Schneider would find it
difficult to resolve the legal challenge in time for the US company's annual
meeting on June 21 , when proxy votes will be cast for the board of
directors.
A simple majority vote would win the proxy fight and allow Schneider to
replace the current board. The replacement Schneider-affiliated board could
then clear the way for completion of the takeover transaction.
The board would have to remove the company's poison pill provision and waive
Square D's obligation under the law of the state of Delaware, which requires
that hostile bidders acquire 85 per cent of the company's shares. This done,
Schneider could then purchase the shares tendered to it.
At the last count, on April 12, Schneider said that some 78 per cent of
Square D's shares had been tendered to it. While falling short of the 85 per
cent requirement, Schneider's chances of obtaining at least a simple
majority of proxies would appear to be rather good.
Square D has spurred anti-trust reviews of Schneider's bid in the US,
Canada, Britain, and Italy, according to a letter by Square D chairman, Mr
Jerre Stead to Schneider chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne. Square D's
US anti-trust allegations rest principally on one point. It charges that
Schneider's slate of nominees for the board, submitted in February, violates
the provision of American law regarding interlocking directorates.
The slate contains directors, officers and consultants of Schneider and its
affiliates.
While Schneider has argued there is no merit to Square D's legal challenges,
it submitted an alternative slate of board candidates in early April. While
these nominees apparently would not violate US laws on interlocking
directorates, it was received too late to qualify under company by-laws,
Square D says.
The deadline for board of director's nominations was at the end of February,
which is when Schneider sent in its original list.
Besides trying to thwart Schneider's takeover by legal means, Square D has
been pursuing other options. It was reported last week to have sought
Dollars 1bn in financing for a leveraged recapitalisation.
Although the company would not comment on its intentions the loans could be
used to pay shareholders a special dividend. This could at least cover the
tender offer's price and thus convince shareholders to stay on board with
the current management.
As Square D's financing proposal to banks was reported last week, Mr
Pineau-Valencienne offered to raise the tender offer's price if Square D's
management would come quietly to the table. But relations between the two
chairman are now so embittered that even a sweeter deal is considered
unlikely to be persuasive.
Analysts believed the original Schneider offer of Dollars 78 was a generous
one. This is partly because they feel Square D, while weathering a difficult
economic period relatively well, has not lived up to its own assessments of
success.
After news of a possible price increase from Schneider last week,the market
boosted Square D shares to Dollars 81.25, a Dollars 3.25 premium over the
tender offer price. They closed last week slightly down from that peak, at
Dollars 80.12.

aircraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A US District court judge yesterday ruled that bondholders at Trans World
Airlines are entitled to repossess at least 10 aircraft, together with some
additional jet engines, as a result of the carrier's failure to meet
payments on certain notes.
Connecticut National Bank, trustee for the relevant notes, would not comment
on the ruling. But TWA said it had proposed a settlement which would involve
the outstanding interest and a moritorium on the outstanding principal until
February 1992, which it hoped would be accepted.
The investors brought an action against the carrier last month, after
negotiations to reschedule payments on the notes failed to reach a
conclusion. TWA, which made heavy losses in 1990 and has amassed debts of
Dollars 2.5bn, failed to meet payment on some of its bondholder debt in
February.
Judge Gerard Goettel's ruling, which followed a hearing last week,
acknowledged that 'by forcing TWA to turn over the property, its ability to
serve consumers may well be diminished and there may also be a threat to the
jobs of TWA employees.' But he rejected arguments by TWA, which claimed it
had been affected by events beyond its own control - like the Gulf war -
making payment impossible.
There has been much debate about TWA's future recently, with its owner, Mr
Carl Icahn, anxious to sell its London routes to American Airlines for
Dollars 445m, while West Coast investor, Mr Kirk Kerkorian, offered to buy
the entire airline if it retained those routes. The US Department of
Transportation approved the sale of the three main London routes last week,
but TWA's unions - together with the city of St Louis, - have now filed an
appeal against this decision.
Yesterday, TWA said it would not accept less than Dollars 445m for the sale
of the three routes but added that American was unwilling to pay that.

THREE leading US steel companies yesterday reported first quarter losses as
the US recession hit demand for their products, particularly in the
automotive and consumer white goods markets.
USX, the largest steel manufacturer in the US, reported a first-quarter net
loss of Dollars 237m, or 94 cent a share, compared with net income of
Dollars 176m, or 66 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Sales
were Dollars 4.5bn, against Dollars 4.7bn. The figures included Dollars 346m
of one-time restructuring charges.
Its steel business reported an operating loss of Dollars 502m, or Dollars
180m without restructuring charges, but its Marathon energy operations
produced operating income of Dollars 229m, including a Dollars 24m
restructuring charge, aided by a strong downstream performance.
Mr Charles Corry, the chairman, said the downstream energy business should
be helped by the coming summer driving season. No appreciable improvement in
steel prices was expected until the second half, but the steel division's
second quarter results were expected to improve.
LTV, the third largest US steel group, reported a first quarter net loss of
Dollars 46.3m on sales of Dollars 1.43bn, compared with income of Dollars
44.2m in the same period of last year on sales of Dollars 1.49bn. The loss
per share was 46 cents, against earnings last year of 32 cents.
LTV's steel operations reported a first quarter operating loss of Dollars
48.8m, before restructuring charges, compared with operating income of
Dollars 41.1m in the first quarter of 1990.
National Steel, the fifth largest US manufacturer, reported a net loss of
Dollars 64.4m in the first quarter on sales of Dollars 524m, compared to a
net loss of Dollars 4.2m on sales of Dollars 612m in 1990.

CONTROL DATA, the US computer manufacturer, reported stronger than expected
first-quarter results, boosted by a one-time restructuring gain. The company
warned, however, that it did not expect to be able to maintain this pace of
recovery, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
First-quarter net earnings were Dollars 7m, or 16 cents per share, compared
with Dollars 6.8m, or 16 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues fell
to Dollars 405.8m from Dollars 421.6m in the first quarter of 1990.
First-quarter earnings per share from operations were 6 cents per share,
compared with 3 cents per share in 1990.
Revenues in the 1990 period included contributions from several operations
that have since been sold or discontinued.
Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive, said: 'We do not expect
the company's operations to sustain the pace of improvement recorded in the
first quarter. However, we remain optimistic that Control Data can achieve
better results in 1991 than it did in 1990.'
In 1990, Control Data reported earnings of Dollars 2.7m, or 6 cents per
share, on revenues of Dollars 1.69bn.
Net earnings in the 1991 first quarter include a net pre-tax restructuring
gain of Dollars 5.4m.
The gain resulted in part from the sale of an equity stake in Seagate
Technology, but was balanced by restructuring charges of Dollars 40.9m.

PHILIPS of the Netherlands, the world's biggest lighting manufacturer, is to
take over Narva Lamp Factory, a maker of vehicle and other types of
speciality lamps in eastern Germany.
The Dutch company declined to say how much it will pay for the company but
it said that it would be making substantial investments in modernising the
factory over the next few years.
Narva Lamp, located in Plauen, has annual sales DM40m (Dollars 22.6m). The
company exports a large part of its output to other parts of Europe, where
they tend to be sold in shops which cater for the lower end of the price
range.
Philips will retain the Narva name for the factory's international
shipments.
Under an agreement reached between Philips and Germany's Treuhand, the
agency handling the privatisation of eastern German industry, Narva's
workforce will number 500 when Philips assumes formal control on May 1.
A year ago, Narva employed as many as 1,300 but the workforce has been
reduced sharply as the company was prepared for privatisation, a Philips
spokesman said.
Last month Philips reached agreement on acquiring a 51 per cent stake in
Polam-Pila, a Polish lighting maker with annual sales of Dollars 50m and
substantial exports to west-ern markets, including the US.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Siemens to buy unit from Texas
Instruments

<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is to acquire the
industrial controls subsidiary of Texas Instruments, the US computer
software company.
The German group said the takeover would enhance its automation technology
activities, in which it claimed to be one of the world's leaders.
Siemens added that the intended purchase would increase its presence in the
field of computerised controls in both the US and other world markets.
Texas Instruments explained the proposed deal by citing its desire to focus
more on computer equipment, software and services.
Siemens said the size of the world market for industrial controls was around
DM7bn (Dollars 4bn), concentrated mainly in western Europe, the US and
Japan.
The German company has around 20 per cent of this market, equivalent to a
turnover of around DM1.5bn. Among its competitors are Allen-Bradley of the
US, Fanuc of Japan and Germany's AEG.
The Texas Instruments subsidiary employs 900 people in the US at its Johnson
City, Tennessee, plant and 300 elsewhere in the US and abroad. No turnover
figure was given, but analysts said revenues of the unit were around Dollars
120m.
After the transaction, Siemens will continue to sell both companies'
products in parallel. Texas said it is also considering the sale of its
process automation business.
Neither side would give a price for the deal with Siemens, but Texas said
the financial effect would be positive for the US company.
Texas Instruments also said that it is evaluating the possible disposal of
its Process Automations Systems business which is based in Hunt Valley,
Maryland. It said its Custom Manufacturing unit was not part of the sale to
Siemens.
Siemens' current US operations employ nearly 35,000 people at 60
manufacturing or assembly plants.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: IBM fails to see any sign of
market improvement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, which earlier this month reported a 50 per
cent drop in first-quarter earnings, said yesterday that it had not yet seen
any sign of an improvement in the market outlook.
The downbeat assessment of global business conditions by the world's largest
computer manufacturer follows expressions of doubt about the strength of the
expected US economic recovery from companies in several large US sectors
over the past few weeks.
Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, told the company's annual meeting that the war
in the Gulf and economic problems worldwide had made the business
environment increasingly difficult - not just in North America but in Europe
and Asia as well.
During the quarter many customers had deferred buying decisions and product
installations. This had been felt fairly uniformly across IBM's product line
and around the world but particularly in the US and in its large systems.
'How long this cautious approach by our customers will last is hard to
tell,' Mr Akers said. 'Our operating rates will only improve when our
customers' confidence about their business improves.
'We have seen no evidence yet to indicate any improvement in the near term,
and consequently the year remains uncertain.'
For the first quarter IBM reported net earnings of Dollars 500m, down from
the Dollars 1bn earned in the same period of last year, on revenues down 4.5
per cent at Dollars 13.5bn. The figures disappointed Wall Street, despite
IBM's earlier warning of a sharp drop.
Analysts were particularly surprised at the depth of the fall in its
hardware sales and some questioned whether this was entirely due to general
economic conditions.
Yesterday Mr Akers said the future of the computing industry remained bright
for those who managed their business well and IBM must prepare to take best
advantage of the eventual economic improvement.
IBM shares fell Dollars 2 1/2 in on the New York Stock Exchange to stand at
Dollars 107 3/8 at lunchtime.

<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the resignation of Mr James Tildesley as chairman and chief
executive of Norton Group on Friday, the revamped board has launched an
investigation into the US and German subsidiaries.
Norton said yesterday that 'strenuous inquiries' were being made into the
financial and trading position of Pro-Fit Piping, in the US, and FUS, the
German subsidiary.
The Pounds 8.2m purchase of FUS, a fasteners maker, caused controversy
because the vendor was a Channel Islands trust company set up to benefit Mr
Tildesley's offspring.
His former company, PSM, had founded the German business and a poorly
supported Pounds 6.5m rights issue to help complete the purchase had a
troubled conclusion in January.
The company, which is best known for its motorcycle business, is being
investigated by the Department of Trade and and Industry.
Its shares were suspended at 18p on April 1 because of a delay in publishing
results for the six months to October 31.

Redoute owns or had received valid acceptances for 50.1 per cent of Empire's

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Phoenix plans to end timber importing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PHOENIX TIMBER, the Essex-based timber products group, is to sell its timber
importing business in order to cut its Pounds 10m borrowings and concentrate
on Protim Services, its property services subsidiary.
The decision, announced after the Stock Exchange closed last night, was
taken 'in view of continuing losses incurred in the company's timber
importing activities and the deteriorating prospects for the construction
industry', said Mr Peter Quinn, chairman.
The group is due to announce its results for the year ended March 31 in
early June. They will show that its trading position has deteriorated. Mr
Quinn warned of an increased deficit in the second half, but expected full
year losses not to exceed Pounds 2.5m pre-tax.
The group reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 656,000 (Pounds 1.42m) for the
year to March 31 1990, but four months later announced that the construction
downturn was forcing it to close its joinery subsidiary based in Stoke on
Trent.
For the six months to end-September Phoenix ran up a taxable loss of Pounds
379,000 compared to the previous year's profit of Pounds 479,000.
The share price closed unchanged at 39p.

FT  30 APR 91 / Venables offers Pounds 3.25m for Tottenham Hotspur stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY Venables, manager of Tottenham Hotspur, the London football team,
has opened the scoring on the refinancing of the debt-weary club.
But the Pounds 3.25m offered yesterday by a new consortium, Edennote,
involving Mr Venables and his business partner Mr Paul Riviere, falls far
short of the Pounds 20m that Mr Venables was originally trying to assemble
to take over the club and relieve its Pounds 10m-plus debt to Midland Bank.
Edennote has offered to buy 5.4m new shares at 60p each, giving it a 35 per
cent stake. No response came from the Tottenham board yesterday.
Messrs Venables and Riviere recently took a controlling stake in the Scribes
dining club in Kensington. The club was to have been the venue for a press
conference elaborating on the deal yesterday evening, but Mr Riviere said it
had been postponed so as 'not to contravene Stock Exchange regulations'.
Mr Venables showed a little less concern for the niceties of approaching a
quoted company - albeit one whose shares have been suspended for six months
 -when he made a personal statement to the Press Association sports desk on
Sunday night. This sparked some complaints to the Takeover Panel.
He spoke vaguely of a package that would enable the club to keep England
international Mr Paul Gascoigne, for whom the Italian club Lazio has offered
around Pounds 8m, and answer the refinancing requirements of Spurs. He ended
by saying: 'I hope the board and Midland Bank accept my offer which I
believe secures the future of Spurs'.
After this, the Panel suggested the consortium make an announcement. 'If
this goes any further, there will have to be a shareholders' meeting and a
circular sent beforehand.'
Yesterday's statement from Edennote said the offer had various conditions.
One was 'certain board changes'. As Mr Irving Scholar, football club
chairman and holder of 26 per cent of the shares, is no longer on the board,
was the request to remove any of the rest? Mr Paul Bobroff, ex-chairman? Mr
Nat Solomon, newish chairman? Mr Ian Gray, chief executive? Mr Tony Berry,
former chairman of Blue Arrow and a go-between in earlier discussions? Or
was the purpose to bring Mr Venables into the team? Mr Riviere would not
elaborate.
Another was that the Takeover Panel should waive the rule triggering a bid
when a holding surpasses 29.9 per cent.

FT  30 APR 91 / Etam threatened by SA takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAMILY that controls one of South Africa's largest women's fashion
chains has taken the first public step towards a possible bid for Etam, the
UK fashion chain.
Oceana Investment Corporation, a vehicle for the Lewis family, which owns
the 700-store Foschini chain in South Africa, has made a tender offer of up
to Pounds 22.3m for 18.5 per cent of Etam's shares. This would take its
stake to 25.1 per cent.
The maximum price offered is 185p per share, putting a market value of
Pounds 121m on Etam. This compares with Pounds 114.3m at yesterday's closing
price of 175p, up 15p.
Mr Michael Lewis, a director of Oceana and Foschini, said Oceana was
considering making an offer for the whole of Etam. It did not want to make a
hostile bid and the tender offer was a way of gauging shareholder response.
Etam responded angrily to the move, describing it as 'an attempt to gain
back-door control at an unacceptably low price.' The board had already
rebuffed a cash and shares takeover proposal, worth about 150p a share, from
Oceana early this year.
Mr Alan Howard, chairman, said: 'Oceana is aiming to profit at our
shareholders' expense from the very significant benefits still to flow
through from Etam's substantial investment over the last three years and the
upturn to come in the retail cycle.'
Over the past four years Etam has invested Pounds 78m to increase floorspace
by 60 per cent. It has added the Snob teenage fashion and Peter Brown
menswear shops to its portfolio as well as expanding the established Etam
and Tammy Girl chains. Turnover has increased by more than 80 per cent to
Pounds 206.5m.
But the 1990-91 results announced last week showed a 51 per cent fall in
profit to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 17.5m), which compares with the record Pounds
17.9m set back in 1987-88. The figure was the worst since 1983-84. However,
after a first-half loss of Pounds 1.1m, Mr Howard said the management had
proved its ability by effecting a dramatic second-half recovery in adverse
market conditions.
Mr Lewis said that if a bid were launched for Etam, it would be at a maximum
price of 185p. This was nearly 25 times the earnings per share announced
last week and 15 to 20 times this year's earnings forecasts.
The offer for up to 12.1m shares is being made by Campbell Lutyens Hudson,
the investment bank, on behalf of Oceana Retail Holdings, set up for the
purpose. The closing date is May 7 and the striking price will depend on the
number of shares subscribed.

FT  30 APR 91 / Managers at Brent Walker bid for brewery and pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT at Brent Walker, the heavily-borrowed leisure group, yesterday
offered to buy out the company's brewing operations and several pubs.
Mr Alistair Arkley, the managing director of Brent Walker Brewing and
Trading and leader of the buy-out team, said it was hoped that 'the company
will view favourably this firm offer against other options which it is
understood to be considering'.
Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks group, said last week that it had been
discussing a possible deal with Brent Walker. One suggestion was that Allied
could agree to supply Brent Walker's 1,122 pubs, putting extra volume
through its own six breweries.
Such a move might involve the closure of Brent Walker's Camerons brewery in
Hartlepool, which employs a staff of 400. Union representatives from the
brewery yesterday delivered a petition against such a move, signed by 20,000
Hartlepool residents, to the company.
Camerons' main beer brand, Strongarm, is sold mainly in the Teesside area.
Mr Arkley said yesterday that his buy-out team, which includes the
division's finance, production and commercial directors and is being advised
by accountants, Price Waterhouse, had secured support from several banks and
institutions.
An 'indicative offer' had been made to Brent Walker for the brewery and
several pubs in the locality. The team is awaiting further negotiations.
The buy-out team declined to reveal the value of the offer.
Brent Walker, which is due to publish its 1990 accounts next month, is
working with its bankers on a restructuring of liabilities. The leisure
group must raise cash and prune operations to service its Pounds 1.4bn debt.
It has been discussing the sale of various assets for some time.
There have been reports that some bankers are pressing for the sale of the
William Hill betting shops chain. Brent Walker still owes Pounds 50m on the
Pounds 615m purchase price from Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks, food and
retailing group.
Brent Walker's board has been restructured since the group ran into
difficulties. Lord Kindersley became non-executive chairman in January, and
Mr Nicholas Ward, former chairman and chief executive of the healthcare
group, Macarthy, was appointed group managing director.

FT  30 APR 91 / French store's stake triggers bid
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLEX interlocking family and shareholding structures of France's
department store sector appear to be on the point of being unravelled,
opening the prospect of a FFr5.4bn (Pounds 541m) bid for the Nouvelles
Galeries group.
Galeries Lafayette, owner of the elegant Boulevard Haussmann department
store, appears likely to be forced to bid for Nouvelles Galeries after
buying 16.4 per cent of its capital last week from Proventus, the Swedish
retailing group.
The acquisition takes Galeries Lafayette's overall stake to 39 per cent,
past the 33.3 per cent level at which a full bid must normally be triggered
under French law, but the company had hoped to be exempted from the
obligation since control of Nouvelles Galeries remains in the hands of the
Devanlay textile group which is headed by Mr Leon Cligman.
But the French stock exchange council has ordered it to bid, making an offer
for Nouvelles Galeries of FFr950 a share, the price Galeries Lafayette paid
Proventus, seem inevitable.
The irony is that if Galeries Lafayette had wanted to take control of
Nouvelles Galeries, it could have bought the whole of Proventus' 25.7 per
cent stake. Instead, it insisted on taking only 16.4 per cent.
Despite these peaceable intentions, however, Galeries Lafayette appears to
have provoked Mr Cligman's irritation, raising the possibility of a stock
market battle over Nouvelles Galeries.
The origins of this upheaval go back to the acquisition two-and-a-half years
ago of stakes in Galeries Lafayette, Nouvelles Galeries and Bazar l'Hotel de
Ville by Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand investor.
Sir Ron sold his shares in Galeries Lafayette last August to Axa, the
insurance company, and then sold his BHV and Nouvelles Galeries shares to
Proventus. This week's developments, however, provide belated recognition
for his analysis that the sector was ripe for restructuring.
Proventus, which had obtained French government permission to take its stake
up to 33 per cent, appeared bent on provoking this restructuring but
withdrew, although it kept its 16 per cent stake in BHV.

FT  30 APR 91 / Marks and Spencer adopts a harsh diet: Reasons for the
retailer's cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just one month into his tenure at the helm of Marks and Spencer, Mr Rick
Greenbury has made it abundantly clear that a new regime reigns at Britain's
best-known retailer.
Although the review of head office staff was begun six months ago under Mr
David Sieff, the director of corporate affairs, few analysts in the City
were in much doubt yesterday about who was the driving force behind the
changes.
'What we are seeing is the transition from a safe, jobs-for-life type
organisation into a meritocracy,' said Mr Mark Husson, retail analyst at
Warburg Securities. 'A lot of dead wood is now to be thrown overboard. Mr
Greenbury is a very hard and very commercial man who is quite prepared to
take the tough decisions.'
Marks and Spencer presented the decision to shed 850 jobs as just an
exercise in good housekeeping; but there is little doubt that its hand has
to some extent been forced by the severity of the recession sweeping the
UK's high streets. 'We are determined to keep a strong hold on our cost
base,' a spokesman for M and S said yesterday.
In the early days of the recession, M and S appeared to be weathering the
storm well and a quiet optimism suffused the company at a time when all
around were screaming. Customers remained loyal to the company and, if
anything, seemed to be attracted to the M and S reputation for dependable
products and conservative styles - virtues criticised as dull in the
previous decade.
The company also benefited from its financial prudence during the 1980s. It
had retained the freeholds on most of its properties rather than indulge in
the fashionable sale-and-leasebacks which enabled other companies to fund
their great expansion drives.
A big investment in information technology - estimated at Pounds 300m during
the last three-and-a-half years - has also enabled the company to increase
its productivity levels and trim its cost structure.
Its total payroll costs as a percentage of sales - at 9.9 per cent - is
second only to Argos in the retailing sector and way ahead of such
competitors as Burton at 14.3 per cent and Boots at 15.1 per cent.
But despite these undoubted strengths, the company cannot expect to combat
the general industrial trends indefinitely. As Mrs Joan D'Olier, retailing
analyst at County NatWest, says: 'Although M and S is well-placed to cope
with the recession, that does not mean that it is immune from it.'
Analysts' forecasts reflect that view. Since the beginning of the year, they
have been trimming profits expectations. County NatWest, for example, has
pencilled in Pounds 620m for the company's pre-tax profits  - to be
announced on May 14 - representing only a modest advance on last year's
Pounds 604.2m.
Uncertainty about the economic climate has also had an effect on the
company's staff. They are not so keen to take a chance by leaving to join
other less solid companies.
A spokesman for M and S said yesterday: 'We have had exceptionally low
turnover in junior management over the last 18 months which has led to
over-staffing and meant that we cannot progress these people through to a
meaningful management position.'
This low turnover had already forced the company to postpone the entry of
100 of the 150 graduate trainees it was due to take on this September.
It is not yet clear what other areas may be affected by the reappraisal of
the M and S business structure. But one possibility is a review of staff
benefits.
Ever since the establishment of the company's welfare department in 1934,
for example, M and S has set the gold standard in occupational healthcare.
The seventh floor of the Baker Street head office houses a gym, a dentist,
doctors, nurses, an osteopath, physiotherapists and health administrators.
Breast and cervical screening are available to female staff and also to
wives of male employees. Even ex-employees may, some years after they have
ceased to work for the company, be entitled to follow-up healthcare.
Exhibitions, videos and health literature form part of the extensive
preventative programme: a video and leaflet, for example, on testicular
self-examination were designed to make sure male employees did not feel
excluded.
Most of this provision is an act of faith. When asked why the company spends
so lavishly on the health of its employees, managers reply that it 'feels
right' to do so.
There is no doubt that occupational healthcare of such a high standard cuts
down on absenteeism and increases productivity. But there is unlikely to be
much hard financial evidence of this within the organisation, due to the
long-term nature of the provision. At least some pruning of healthcare
would, therefore, not be unexpected.
The same could be the case for other staff benefits, where a trend away from
paternalism is already in evidence: hairdressing and chiropody, for example,
are less popular perks than they once were, particularly among younger
staff.
'To a certain extent, M and S has always been carrying a lot of fat and it
is the first time that it has gone on a diet,' says Mr Husson of Warburg
Securities. The new dietary regime may be overdue; but under Mr Greenbury's
direction, it seems likely to prove a rigorous one.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer, the international retailing group, is to shed 850 jobs in
the next few days in the face of the most severe retailing conditions in a
decade.
The decision follows a six-month review of the company's head office
functions under the direction of Mr David Sieff, director for corporate
affairs, and a separate reappraisal of its store management requirements.
In total, M and S employs 62,000 staff in the UK and the company said no
further job cuts were planned.
Mr Sieff said the job cuts would 'create a more efficient and effective head
office that does not burden the business with excessive costs' and would
simplify decision making and provide greater job satisfaction for the staff.
The job cuts fall into two areas. About 300 of the company's 4,750 head
office staff are to be made compulsorily redundant and an additional 250
posts are also to be phased out by means of staff turnover, early retirement
and voluntary redundancy. But 300 of the company's 1,100 junior managers
will also be made redundant as a result of a low turnover of staff.
The company explained: 'When you set targets for recruitment you assume a
certain percentage will leave at some time during their training period.
What has happened over the last 18 months is that staff turnover has dropped
dramatically. We have far more people at this level than we expected.'
The company said it would be making generous redundancy payments, based on
length of service and seniority, which would be well above statutorily
entitlements.
The Baker Street head-quarters in London was gripped by gloom and confusion
after M and S management decided they wanted to speak individually to all
300 employees who were being made compulsorily redundant.
One employee said: 'They've got themselves confused as to whether they are a
big company or a small company. They didn't want to do a mass mailing, so
people are sitting around waiting to see if they will be getting the chop.'
The redundancy programme will cost Pounds 16m, which will be treated as an
exceptional cost when the company reports its annual results on May 14.
Analysts expect the company to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 620m (before
exceptional items), slightly ahead of last year's outcome of Pounds 604.2m.

FT  30 APR 91 / End in sight for Angolan civil war: Rebel leader outlines
agreement on ceasefire followed by elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END is in sight to the 15-year civil war in Angola, which has cost
hundreds of thousands of lives and has devastated a country rich in oil,
diamonds and coffee.
Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita rebel movement, said in London
yesterday that agreements leading to an internationally monitored ceasefire
and multi-party elections were due to be initialled in Lisbon today.
A formal signing ceremony will take place at the end of May, probably in
Lisbon, where officials from Unita and the Angolan government are meeting.
Western diplomats last night confirmed that an end was in sight to a
conflict which, from the start, was fuelled by superpower rivalries.
The factors that combined to push both parties to the negotiating table
include war-weariness, the rapprochement between Washington and Moscow, and
the Namibian settlement, which ended South African military support for
Unita, and saw the withdrawal of a 50,000 strong pro-government Cuban force
from Angola.
Diplomats stressed that implementation of the agreements, which include the
integration of rival armies during an 18-month transition period before
elections, would be fraught with difficulties.
The apparent breakthrough follows protracted talks co-ordinated by Portugal,
the former colonial power, and attended by officials from the US, the main
supporter of Unita, and the Soviet Union, once a staunch ally of President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola's ruling MPLA party.
The Unita leader, speaking on the eve of a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd,
Britain's foreign secretary, said he expected Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN
secretary general, Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr Alexander
Bessmertnykh, Soviet foreign minister, would attend the formal signing.
In giving his outline of the agreements to journalists in London, Mr Savimbi
said the US, the Soviet Union and the UN would be helping to monitor the
transition process. During the transition, which would end with elections in
September, October or November next year, the MPLA government 'will continue
to deal with normal affairs', he said.
But a 'joint political and military committee', comprising equal numbers of
MPLA and Unita officials, would 'deal with the whole process leading to the
ceasefire, elections, stability, and internal security,' said Mr Savimbi,
adding that he expected to arrive in Luanda, the capital, in early July. Up
to now he has been based in Jamba, the rebel headquarters in southern
Angola.
He said the commission would also during the transition oversee the creation
'of one national army', preferably no larger than 50,000, in which Unita and
MPLA would be equally represented. The air force and navy would remain in
MPLA hands, under close independent monitoring.
Responsibility for day-to-day law and order would lie with the existing
police force.
'We will also have a joint committee for verification of ceasefire,' said Mr
Savimbi. A post-war Angola would have an independent judiciary, a free
press, regular elections and a 'market orientated economy', he said.

FT  30 APR 91 / Royal Mail may open its network to private couriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POST Office is considering opening up its postal network to private
couriers.
The Royal Mail, the Post Office's letter service, is looking at proposals to
introduce more competition in anticipation of the European Commission's
green paper on liberalising postal services, due to be published in June.
The Royal Mail, which has a monopoly on all letters on which postage is
below Pounds 1, is compiling details of the cost of sending a letter to
enable it to draw up a pricing structure for the use of its services.
Private couriers such as TNT, the Australian delivery company, and DHL, the
international courier, might seek to carry mail and then, in rural areas, be
able to pay the Post Office network to deliver their letters on the final
leg through the Royal Mail.
The concept is similar to inter-connection in the telecommunications
industry, where long-distance telephone companies, such as Mercury, can pay
British Telecom to route the final part of a call.
The move by the Royal Mail to conduct a detailed account of its costs
follows the disclosure that the Department of Trade and Industry is looking
into the Post Office's finances as a prelude to possible privatisation.
Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director of the Royal Mail, said: 'In order to be
able to offer a delivery network to other companies we want to have a more
detailed understanding of our costs.
'If a company has no presence in a particular part of the country then we
may be able to offer them our services for the right price.'
Mr Alan Jones, managing director of TNT, said: 'This is a very interesting
idea. We will monitor it with great interest.'
However, private couriers may only decide to make full use of the Post
Office's services if the government abolishes, or reduces, its monopoly on
letters under Pounds 1.
Mr Cockburn disclosed that the Royal Mail is conducting its investigation of
costs with the Post Office Users' National Council, a government watchdog,
which will have confidential access to all the figures.
Mr George Brown, a member of the council's executive, said: 'We hope to get
to the bottom of how every penny of the first and second class stamp is
spent.'
Meanwhile, the Post Office published figures showing that 85 per cent of
first class letters arrive the day after posting, representing a 7.4 per
cent improvement in first class mail reliability.

FT  30 APR 91 / Waldegrave seeks to calm uproar over health reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government sought to calm the uproar over its health service reforms
yesterday with Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, accusing the Labour
party of stirring up a 'bogus pre-election row' ahead of Thursday's local
government polls.
There were clashes in the Commons after Labour produced a leaked document
which, it said, showed that managers at Guy's Hospital, London, knew they
faced serious financial problems two months before the hospital became a
self-governing trust.
Some 57 hospitals and other services became self-governing trusts when the
health reforms came into effect on April 1. Last week, Guy's announced 600
redundancies and the Bradford Hospitals Trust, West Yorkshire, announced 300
job losses.
In angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary,
called on Mr Waldegrave not to approve any further applications until after
a general election. 'He cannot press ahead with the second wave of opt-outs
while hospitals are already foundering in the first wave,' he said.
The leaked document indicated that managers of the Guy's and Lewisham Trust,
governing Guy's, its sister hospital at Lewisham and related services,
realised they faced 'very serious financial problems in relation to
maintaining the volume and present range of services provided'.
It went on to say that the management had been trying to establish the most
equitable distribution of cuts necessary to 'minimise the inevitable
reductions in direct patient care services'.
Mr Waldegrave defended the reforms, saying the government should not
interfere in management of hospitals.
He denied that the trusts had 'secret' business plans.
Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP whose constituency includes Guy's,
met Mr Peter Griffiths, the hospital's chief executive, yesterday.
Mr Hughes said afterwards he was far from satisfied that cuts could be made
without serious consequences for patient care.
He said he had been told during the meeting that it was likely there would
be fewer than 150 redundancies at Guy's, with the remaining job cuts being
achieved by unfilled vacancies.
When hospital managers announced their plans to staff last week they said
that they would 'attempt to avoid compulsory redundancies.'
'It was known that there was going to be a deficit at the end of the last
financial year when the plans were put up to the secretary of state,
although the amount was not specified,' said Mr Hughes.

FT  30 APR 91 / No relish in City for Ratner's humble pie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EATING humble pie does not seem to come easily to Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman
of Ratners, Britain's biggest retail jewellery group, who yesterday issued a
formal apology for describing his products as 'crap' at last week's
Institute of Directors' conference.
But even as Mr Ratner's uncharacteristically cowed statement was being
dispatched across London, the windows of some Ratners' shops were being
plastered with posters plying the merits of its 'Cheap Reliable and
Affordable Prices' - 'CRAP' for short.
The 'CRAP' posters are the latest in the apparently unending stream of
promotional ploys with which Mr Ratner has transformed his family's
floundering jewellery company into one of the most dynamic forces in US and
UK retailing.
The leitmotif of his style has been to liven up the dusty world of the
traditional jewellers - with their Dickensian decor and prim proprietors -
by turning his shops into glitzy places crammed with cheap'n'cheerful
products and price slashing promotions.
Mr Ratner's comments to the IoD conference a week ago on some of the secrets
of his success were similar to remarks he has made before, notably in the
FT. But this time his comments attracted widespread attention from the
tabloid press and prompted a reprimand from the British Jewellers'
Association.
An apologetic appearance on the Wogan chat show could not save Mr Ratner
from being relegated to the ranks of the 'businessmen the great British
public loves to hate'.
The chastened chairman sent an apology to his staff on Wednesday. A note of
'clarification' for customers was pinned up in Ratners' stores on Friday.
Yesterday's formal apology was intended to 'set the record straight'.
It remains to be seen what effect the apology, or the 'CRAP' posters, will
have on sales. The stock market has already cast its vote. Ratners' shares
rose by 6p to 184p last Tuesday, the day of the IoD conference, but fell by
7p to 180p yesterday.
The City does not seem to relish the sight of Mr Ratner eating humble pie.
Perhaps he should stick to prawn sandwiches.

FT  30 APR 91 / Taiwan's bridge to the mainland: As Taipei prepares to end
its 42-year-old state of 'war' with China, Peter Wickenden reports on the
challenges facing the tiny island state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WICKENDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist party, KMT) prepares to
end a 42-year state of 'war' with the communists in Peking, it is bracing
for the first time to fight for its own survival.
Tomorrow, President Lee Teng-hui will announce the end of the 'period of
communist rebellion', declared by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government
in 1948, one year before being driven off the mainland by Mao Zedong's
communist forces in 1949.
In one stroke, Mr Lee will set Taiwan rolling towards relative democracy
under a representative government, and also open the door to a new
relationship with Peking.
To bolster their claim to be the real government of China, the Nationalists
suspended the constitution and the president assumed extensive emergency
powers during the 'rebellion'. They also froze in office indefinitely all
mainland-elected members of both the National Assembly, which itself amends
the constitution and elects the president, and the legislative Yuan, or
parliament.
Four decades on, still represented in these two bodies by a minority of
Taiwan-elected members among a sea of ancient, bearded and doddery
mainlanders, the general public rose up in mass protest last year, demanding
rapid and thorough electoral reform.
After more than 200 meetings involving thousands of people, the KMT came up
with a constitutional reform plan that the old cadres in the assembly
reluctantly passed in exchange for party cash. When President Lee tomorrow
ends the state of war with China, the old guards' tenure will be ended. Then
the Taiwanese will elect a new parliament and National Assembly.
The new assembly, to be elected at the end of this year, will go on to
debate further reforms such as direct presidential elections, whether to opt
for a presidential or cabinet system, and the restructuring of electoral and
administrative areas.
The KMT regime will now have to prove its legitimacy at the ballot box, and
in theory it is laying itself open to a fair fight. However, to KMT
conservatives who dream of reconquering China, and to the younger
Taiwan-born cadres who have vested interests in the maintenance of the
status quo, defeat by another party is unthinkable.
Thus one of the most controversial parts of the KMT's reform plan is that
the president will retain his emergency powers. He will also remain directly
in charge of the powerful National Security Council, which co-ordinates
intelligence and anti-subversion activities.
Mr James Chen, deputy secretary-general of the opposition Democratic
Progressive party, says: 'The president will still have dictator-like
powers. The National Security Council falls outside legislative control.'
The DPP fears that the council, and two related bodies, will direct their
activities against the still-outlawed Taiwan independence movement as the
threat from China's communist regime diminishes.
President Lee assured the nation in a speech last week that he would use his
powers prudently.
The new National Assembly and parliament will also uphold the government's
most enduring shibboleth - that it is the sole legitimate government of all
China. About a quarter of the seats in the two bodies will be reserved for
nominal 'mainland' representatives, who will be elected in Taiwan but have
no constituency. This arrangement serves to convince Peking that the island
is not claiming to form a truly independent government, because it retains
an imagined link with the mainland.
The KMT's plan also includes a few seats for representatives of Chinese
communities overseas. The KMT believes ethnic Chinese worldwide should have
a say in the future of their homeland, and that some of them are rich and
powerful enough to lobby foreign governments on Taiwan's behalf. The DPP
wants these seats scrapped, arguing that the loyalty of anyone who holds two
passports and rarely visits Taiwan is questionable.
The DPP's Mr Chen thinks the KMT's continued monopoly of television and
radio will prevent his party getting more than a quarter of the votes in the
new National Assembly, and that this will enable the KMT to dictate the
course of future reforms.
But even with the dice heavily loaded in the KMT's favour, the DPP won a
fifth of the contested seats at a general election in December 1989, held to
fill seats vacated by mainlanders who had died in office.
Under the KMT's scheme, the new legislature will not be elected until late
1992, and although the new National Assembly is to be elected this year, it
will not elect a new president until Mr Lee Teng-hui's six-year term is up
in 1996.
That gives the KMT a breathing space in which to shore up its image in the
public policy areas where it has failed badly: corruption, law and order, a
seriously overloaded infrastructure, appalling pollution, and squalid urban
living conditions.
Conservative KMT premier Mr Hau Pei-tsun has therefore conceived a Six-Year
Plan costing 8.2 trillion New Taiwan dollars (more than Dollars 300bn),
which requires bond issues on an unprecedented scale. It also includes a new
north-south motorway, a high-speed railway, several urban rapid transit
systems, a fourth nuclear power plant, airports, industrial zones, parks,
leisure facilities, and shopping centres.
Starting just weeks after the end of the 'war', the Six-Year Plan is already
helping Taiwan break out of diplomatic isolation, which to its citizens has
often meant embarrassment and inconvenience in foreign travel and business.
Anxious to get a slice of the public works pie, France, Germany and Italy
have all recently broken diplomatic taboos by sending senior officials to
Taipei, while Australia, New Zealand and Canada have ignored Peking's
protests about violation of its 'sovereignty', and negotiated direct air
links. European countries are likely to follow.
From a weak point a year ago when it was ravaged by factionalism and forced
to bend to public pressure, the KMT is beginning to pull itself together. In
gradually strengthening and legitimising its rule by reform, it also hopes
to weaken and supplant growing support for the Taiwan independence movement.
Opinion poll results suggest that rather than outright independence, the
Taiwanese want two things that are contradictory, and are pushing the KMT
towards pursuing them: international recognition and the maintenance of
their de facto independence; and an open policy toward China that gives the
Taiwanese freedom to go there and make money.
Taking this into account, the KMT's long-term goal, with no timetable
attached, seems to be a kind of superficial unification with the mainland
that would leave Taiwan with its government, its system and its own
international connections intact. Anything remotely similar to the Hong Kong
arrangement, where Peking ultimately acquires control, would be regarded as
an unacceptable sell out, which the KMT would not risk attempting.
Jumping the gun that ends the war with a confidence born of investment
dollars and economic clout, the government on Sunday sent a semi-official
delegation to talk to Peking for the first time in 40 years.
Nominally private but mainly government funded, the Straits Exchange
Foundation is headed by top KMT politburo members, and takes its orders
directly from the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Commission.
Top KMT mainland policy architect Ma Ying-jiu says that unification, and
even direct trade and transport across the Taiwan Straits, are a long way
off. The SEF's first job is to facilitate 'people-to-people contacts', in
order to eliminate hostility and build up mutual trust and recognition.
When the SEF group returns from its week-long 'courtesy visit' to Peking,
Taiwan will have recognised the existence, though not the legitimacy, of the
enemy regime. How fast Taiwan continues to open up will depend on the warmth
or otherwise of Peking's reaction.

<TEXT>
Most Londoners squirm when they encounter a street beggar in the centre of
the city. Is this someone in genuine need? A threat, a potential mugger? A
lazybones who prefers to collect both the dole and coins from passers-by
rather than take an unappetising manual job? It is impossible to tell. The
result is that every decision to proffer or withhold one of the coins that
jangle in your purse or pocket is taken on ad hoc grounds. The temptation to
walk on by is strong, and not easily or often overcome. Sometimes there is
an especially plaintive look in a young face; out comes the silver.
Sometimes a largish youngster looks menacing enough to be worth buying off.
Pay again.
This is absurd. You expect beggars in Bombay or Calcutta. India is a Third
World country within which a First World middle-class is rapidly emerging.
The rise of the tide of street people in New York over the past decade has
been striking, but here again there is no surprise. The failure of the
United States to raise the standard of living of most of its black and many
of its Hispanic citizens is well-known. In France the steady inward flow of
indigent North Africans accounts for at least some of the unfortunates one
sees on the streets.
London is supposed to be different. The British welfare state was designed
to eliminate the need for begging among all sections of the population. It
is self-evidently not doing so. The reason why is plain. What we are
witnessing is a spin-off of the Thatcher years. That this is so is suggested
by an intriguing set of statistical tables in the latest issue of Economic
Trends, published by the Central Statistical office (proprietor: HM
Treasury).
The CSO's annual analysis of the effects on household income of taxes and
benefits has been reworked for earlier years, mainly to adjust the numbers
to take account of family size and composition. This makes comparisons as
close to reality as possible. A freshly-adjusted 1977-88 series is therefore
available. 'The main conclusion,' says Economic Trends, 'is that the
distribution of income has become more unequal over the 11 years'.
Yes yes, I am aware that 'more unequal' does not mean that the poorest are
necessarily worse off in absolute terms; it may be that their incomes have
simply not grown as fast as those of the rich. But consider the implications
of what Economic Trends has to say. The official statisticians try to get to
the heart of the matter. Taking raw material from the continuous family
expenditure survey, they record all cash income after tax. This includes
pay, dividends, and state benefits. They then subtract indirect taxation
such as VAT, and in some tables add a figure for assumed benefits in kind,
such as state education and health services.
The bottom line tells the story. In 1979 the poorest fifth of all households
accounted for 9.5 per cent of post-tax The British welfare state has
self-evidently failed to eliminate the need for begging
income (before benefits in kind); in 1988 the figure was 6.9 per cent. The
share of the second lowest fifth fell slightly. The middle bands remained
more or less level. The share of the top fifth rose from 37 per cent to 44
per cent, no doubt adding to the ranks of people whose feelings of guilt may
make it pay to beg. All this is after the redistributive effect of the
welfare state.
The explanation lies partly in the severing of the connection between
benefit increases and average earnings, and partly in the shift from direct
to indirect taxation. Raising VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in 1979,
plus other indirect tax increases, hurt the very poor. They paid 21 per cent
of their gross income in indirect taxes in 1979 and 29 per cent in 1988. The
top band enjoyed a slight fall - from 21 to 20 per cent. The disparity is
somewhat less when you take into account assumed benefits in kind, but not
very much.
There is little doubt that the relative living standards of the lower income
groups have deteriorated since these figures were compiled. The 1988 budget
was a bonanza for the rich. The hard-nosed social security reforms of Mr
(now Sir) Norman Fowler, introduced in the same year, were hardly a bonanza
for the poor. The first full year effect of these regressive measures was
felt in 1989. Even after rebates the poll tax, introduced last year, almost
certainly cost the lowest fifth of households more than the special increase
in social security payments given to them to offset it. This year, to offset
the cut in local taxation, VAT is up again, to 17 1/2 per cent. We have seen
how that hits the worst off.
We are talking here about state pensioners, single mothers, families with
large numbers of children whose head is unemployed and unlikely to return to
work, and so on - some 11m individuals in all. Many of these are people who
are unlikely to own their own homes, as some 70 per cent of the English do.
Their children often cannot afford either to rent in the shrinking private
market or to buy. It is hardly surprising that such an 'underclass' should
throw off a few beggars.
It is not that the Tories are unconcerned: last Friday Sir George Young, the
housing minister, opened a 45-person shelter for ex-residents of cardboard
city, London's mini-shantytown. He was pushing his department's 'rough
sleepers' initiative'. The new shelter, in the financial centre itself, is
run by the St Mungo association as a joint undertaking with the government,
Business in the Community, and Islington council. It is a worthy initiative:
St Mungo sets out to rehabilitate its guests, with the aim of helping them
find jobs and places to rent.
I do not know what better there is to do: a Labour government would spend a
bit more, and I guess a Tory government might further increase VAT to
finance public sector services. Neither party is proposing a return to 1979
tax structures. Yet in Britain, in 1991, there should be no reason to beg.

FT  30 APR 91 / Leading Article: Financing the hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW over the decision by Guy's hospital trust to cut its staff by a
tenth is a typical piece of British political humbug, exacerbated by the
special circumstances of the National Health Service. Mr William Waldegrave,
the health secretary, denies responsibility for the cost-saving measures
which Mr Peter Griffiths, the trust's chief executive, thought necessary,
although he does accept that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte had previously
indicated that only 12 of the 57 self-governing trusts that came into
operation on April 1 were free of financial difficulties. He might have done
better, politically speaking, to try to maintain what his department calls
the 'steady state' throughout the first year of the implementation of the
reforms - that is, no change until the system is bedded down.
At the same time Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, persists in his
charge that the National Health Service is 'underfunded', perhaps to the
tune of some Pounds 4bn, while also laying claim to such financial rectitude
that if he won the election no extra money would be diverted to health until
a combination of economic growth and a freeze on the standard rate of income
tax had made it prudent to spend the fruits of fiscal drag.
Difficult tasks
In purely populist terms, Mr Waldegrave has the more difficult political
task. He has to stand by the April 1 reform, the essence of which is that
the health districts, which purchase care, shall be managed separately from
the hospitals that deliver it. He has been resolute in insisting that the
actions of the independent management of Guy's are Guy's business, but he is
under some pressure from his own backbenchers to respond more pliantly to
the usual pelting from an NHS that has the benefit of 40 years of experience
of extracting money from governments by harassing ministers. He should
continue to resist such blandishments.
The row has come at a particularly awkward moment - just when the
Conservatives thought they had introduced the reforms without fuss, and on
the very weekend chosen by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to stage a
set-piece country seminar on how preventive medicine and other elements of a
health strategy might be put in place. It was not thought possible to
eliminate Labour's poll lead as the party to be trusted with the health
service, but there was some hope that the gap could be narrowed.
NHS guardians
This may now be difficult. Spending on the NHS has increased by 41 per cent
in real terms since 1979, when the present Conservative government first
returned to office. The larger increases have come towards the end of the
period, partly in response to a Labour onslaught in 1987-88 and partly to
ease in the new structure, which was created in response to the opposition's
attack. Against that, the index used by the government to arrive at its
estimate of real extra spending is general and not specific to health, where
costs rise more quickly as a result of advances in medical practice and the
growth in the elderly population. This lies behind Mr Kinnock's
'underfunding'; the humbug arises because both parties are competing on the
claim to be the best steward of the NHS while neither is able to pledge much
higher expenditure.
What Mr Major has stated, however, is that money saved by Guy's and other
cost-cutting trust hospitals will not be snatched back by the Treasury but
retained in the health service. There is an opportunity in this, if
anecdotal evidence of NHS inefficiency is even half right. Labour is against
trusts, but not the purchaser-provider divide; nor can it seriously oppose
the construction of a cost information bank within the service. None of this
constitutes a true market, but talk of putting the market to work inside the
service has been abandoned by the government. The opposition cannot be
expected to let go so easily of this convenient fiction. In the world
outside party politics, the new arrangements hold out a modest prospect that
wasteful practices, some of them imposed by health service unions and
profligate consultants alike, can be excised.

Irish psychiatrist Anthony Clare, better known as the top people's media
shrink, has just indulged in a bout of navel gazing at Ireland's Management
Institute.
The good news, he said, is that the Irish are charming, hospitable,
talkative, imaginative, gregarious and generous. The bad news is that they
are not only feckless and fatalistic, having an inferiority complex and
being terrible begrudgers - they're obsessional with it.

The promotion of two more women to high places - Catherine Bell as head of
competition policy at the Department of Trade and Industry, and Jane Drabble
as assistant managing director of BBC Network Television - adds momentum to
the belief that organisational 'glass ceilings' have been cracked if not
removed. Certainly, employers are helping it along by making a PR song and
dance about appointing female executives.
The reality, however, is different. A survey by the National Economic
Development Office shows that, while around 25 per cent of junior managers
are women, they hold less than 2 per cent of senior management jobs.
Moreover, in the private sector especially, there's little sign that the
balance is changing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris bourse, tired of seeing trading of French shares migrate to the
London market, is to mount a counter-offensive towards the end of this year.
In a UK 'road show', it will tell investors that dealing on the Paris stock
market offers a better deal than using the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ
International.
For this 'battle of the bourses', the Parisians are hoping for further
support from new research being done by Marco Pagano of the University of
Naples and Ailsa Roell of the London School of Economics.
The two have already lent credence to the Paris cause. Last year they
reported a spread between buying and selling prices for French shares in
London of 1.52 per cent, against 0.41 per cent in Paris. They also did much
to puncture London's claim to run a more liquid market for big bargains,
saying the Paris bourse could absorb large deals just as easily.
Roell is quick to point out that the new study of market differences is not
sponsored by the French. But, she adds, Paris has been eager to ply the
researchers with data.

Don't whisper it too loudly, but Britain's famous Triumph motorcycyle seems
to be staging a comeback. What is more, although it is hard to remember how
many attempts there have been at restarting the great British motorcycle
industry, the latest low-key effort seems to have a better chance of
success.
John Bloor, a secretive Midlands businessman who has made his fortune in
construction, has just started selling the new 1,200cc four-cylinder Triumph
Trophy from his purpose-built factory in Leicestershire. Costing close to
Pounds 7,000 a time, the 150mph machine is aimed at snatching back a
fraction of a market dominated by the Japanese. The aim is to produce 15,000
a year and, while that might not sound a lot, BMW produces only 30,000 a
year.
The initial word from Britain's bikers is good. Graham Sanderson, deputy
editor of Motor Cycle News, said: 'It is quite astonishing, better than we
dreamed.' Whereas the rebirth of America's Harley Davidson was helped by
import controls and US legislation, Sanderson thinks the Triumph should be
able to stand against the competition on its own.
Obviously long-term reliability has to be proven, and the group has only 35
dealers. Bloor is not a motorcycle man, and his autocratic management style
has led to some staff turnover. Nevertheless, it sounds the sort of place
where venture capitalists should be leaving their cards.

Meanwhile, back at the Bank of England, there have been some surprising

subsidiary boards of industrial companies to learn what life at the sharp

Tim Sweeney, deputy head of banking supervision, already sits on the board
of Trafalgar House subsidiary John Brown, and yesterday Alastair Clark, the
head of financial markets and institutions, was given a seat on the board of
Vickers' Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
Officially, it's all part of a new policy to broaden the experience of some
senior Bank officials by providing them with insights into corporate

But, be that as it may, the question everyone wants answered is will Clark

<TEXT>
It sounds as if Rodney Galpin, the ex-Bank of England gamekeeper now running
Standard Chartered, has been doing a bit of poaching from his old
establishment.
Tony Nicolle, Hong Kong's 55-year old commissioner for banking since 1987,
is being tipped to take a senior job in the colony at the Standard Chartered
Bank later this year. He gives up his commissioner's job in five weeks and
will presumably need a sanitising period before he can join Galpin's team.
After all, his head will be full of the colony's banking secrets - including
the hidden reserves of the august Hongkong Bank and smaller fry.
Nicolle went to Hong Kong on a three-year secondment from the Bank of
England where he had worked for nearly 30 years, ending his time drafting
the 1987 Banking Act.
At the Old Lady he was close to Galpin, then executive director of banking
supervision, who was sanitised for a mere three months when he left to
became Standard Chartered's chairman in 1988.
So there's the link - and the precedent. Maybe Nicolle will spend some time
in London and elsewhere studying Standard Chartered's problems, which would
surely blur anyone's memory of old forbidden secrets.

<TEXT>
Ask any of the thousands of officials of the California Public Utilities
Commission in San Francisco who calls the shots in the pricing and supply of
gas, and you will get one answer: 'We do'. Unfortunately, when Mr James
McKinnon was appointed director-general of the UK's Office of Gas Supply
(Ofgas), nearly five years ago, nobody in British Gas seems to have listened
to the fact-finding missions which went west to discover how regulation
actually works. The corporation and much of the City preferred to believe
the government's line that in Britain, the relationship between monopoly and
officials would be entirely different.
Instead of detailed interference, with cohorts of lawyers enquiring into a
public utility's business, the British system, it was said, would represent
a 'light rein', and Mr McKinnon, it was quietly hinted, was a semi-retired
accountant (then aged 56) who would give no trouble.
This proved to be as profound a misreading of Mr McKinnon's tough Glaswegian
character as it was of the Gas Act (1986). Perhaps the lorry driver's son
who climbed the accountancy ranks to become finance director of the Imperial
Group might then have seemed a spent force. He was unceremoniously pushed
out of Imperial as part of the 'old guard' when Hanson took it over and
might well have retired with his pay-off.
Sir Peter Walker, then energy secretary, seems to have taken this view when
he suggested, as Mr McKinnon recalls, that Ofgas would be a nice
two-day-a-week job in a little office with a staff of fewer than 30.
So it might have proved except that British Gas decided on his first visit
to its South Bank headquarters to teach Mr McKinnon a lesson. When he
enquired how such a fine building was financed, he was told to mind his own
business.
And he did. He bombarded the corporation with requests, and then demands for
information, and then threats. He proved unexpectedly successful at PR,
largely by telling the media most of what he was up to, US style. By threats
of the High Court, a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and
subtler hints of public interest and political pressure, he has carried
through a succession of campaigns, of which the latest on the pricing of
domestic gas is the most important. The score, says one insider, is: British
Gas nil, Mr McKinnon five. He would not put it quite that way, but offers no
better image.
Mr McKinnon once said that if both sides are bawling out the referee, he has
probably got it about right. Now despite criticism that he has become an
interfering US-style busybody, he says: 'I have no idea of hanging up my
boots'. Nor, it seems, is it in his nature to refrain from using them if the
game gets rough.

FT  30 APR 91 / Leading Article: G7 under US pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY CAN a great power have come to an important international meeting
with arguments as feeble as those advanced by the US at the meeting of the
finance ministers and central bankers of the group of seven industrial
countries in Washington, over the weekend. But the arguments were not merely
indefensible; they were dangerous. Those who recalled the row between
Germany and the US that preceded the stock market crash of October 1987 must
have shuddered, especially since an exceptionally strong stock market
preceded that meeting, too.
The US was wrong to argue that a huge demand for capital was about to hit
the world economy; it was wrong to argue that strong growth in the
industrial countries was needed to meet that demand; it was wrong to argue
that looser monetary policy in Germany and Japan would lower the important
real rates of interest; it was wrong to argue that the G7 should shift its
aims from achieving non-inflationary growth to achieving growth with low
inflation; and it exaggerated both the risk of a global 'credit crunch' and
the threat of a global recession.
What the Soviet Union and eastern Europe need is irrelevant; what matters is
their demand. Neither the Soviet Union nor any of the countries of eastern
Europe is now able to borrow large sums on a commercial basis. Nor are the
demands from Kuwait likely to be as big in the near term as had been earlier
supposed.
Moreover, if such a demand were to materialise, borrowers would need low
long-term real rates of interest. Low rates of interest would be better
secured by low growth and slack resources in industrial countries than by
their opposite.
Unconvincing argument
Interest rates on long-term credit are determined by the availability of
savings and inflationary expectations. Artificially low real rates of
interest on short-term money would reduce savings and increase expected
inflation, precisely the opposite of what is needed.
Equally unconvincing is the US case for a shift in the aims of the G7. When
the G7 sought non-inflationary growth, it delivered growth with modest
inflation. What could one expect if its aim were to be growth with low
inflation? Growth with high inflation, is the obvious answer.
Finally, the IMF forecasts no deep recession, but rather economic growth in
the industrial countries at 2.8 per cent next year, up from 1.3 per cent
this year. Nor is the 'credit crunch' a global problem, but largely an
American one. It is the result of an almost unbelievable series of failures
in financial legislation and regulation, about which the US is going to do
virtually nothing, it now appears.
Mismanagement
US arguments are not merely unpersuasive; they are cheeky. The US has
received resource transfers from the rest of the world worth some Dollars
670bn in 1990 prices over the past nine years and enjoyed current account
deficits totalling around Dollars 1 trillion. How can it argue that other G7
countries must adjust to borrowing needs of eastern European countries that
will be negligible by comparison?
It is no less outrageous for the US to complain about high global real rates
of interest when it has done everything it can to persuade Germany and Japan
to eliminate the savings surpluses of the 1980s. It makes little sense to
complain about a global 'credit crunch' when it is most evident in the
mismanaged financial system of the US. To the extent that it exists
elsewhere, this is often because of the past willingness of other countries,
notably Japan, to accommodate the US desire for lax monetary policies.
In the end, no great harm was done by the G7. Nobody can object to calls for
'monetary and fiscal policies which provide the basis for lower real
interest rates and a sustained global economic recovery with price
stability'.
Nevertheless, US policy-makers must accept two points: first, that the
solutions they seek are virtually all to be found at home; second, that the
principal aim of the rest of the G7 is not to secure the re-election of the
president, however many specious arguments may be put up for the purpose.

FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Pinocchio - Theatre Rotonde, Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How precisely children's fiction reflects national stereotypes: Babar the
gentilhomme of Gallic chivalry, Toad and Water Rat dilettantist English
land-owning types, Pinocchio, as this ingenious adaptation of Collodi's
story by the Teatro Ragazzi di Verona shows, every stick and splinter the
spoilt Italian son.
Nothing pinpoints such differences more delightfully than the Brussels
'Festival International Jeunes Publics' (to May 13), a festival of
children's theatre which brings together drama, dance and mime for children
from theatres across Europe, America and North Africa. In Pinocchio, Gianni
Franceschini has managed to create that box office winner, a children's play
with enough adult interest for every parent to want to escort his offspring.
Add half an hour to official starting times while excess audience is
squeezed into aisles and staircases, and expect a riot at the end when it
heaves as one on to the stage to mob the unfortunate puppet.
Franceschini reworks the tale of the boy marionette who comes to life in the
hands of his master as lighthearted human comedy with a touch of Punch and
Judy. Gianni Volpe's set, a workshop platform backed by a mesh of cupboards,
alcoves and windows, opens like a magic box to reveal countless
theatres-within-theatres where Geppetto and the shrieking Pinocchio play out
their drama of manipulation, each fancying himself as director of the show.
This is simple, resourceful and never-endingly inventive theatre of the sort
for which this children's touring group is well known. A blackout, a pole
and a candle and you have the wild wood. For the Theatre of Mr Fire-Eater, a
shelf is bathed in fluorescent crimson to become a mini-stage with its own
purple curtain and neon signs. Waves of turquoise lights and ripples from
triangles and tambourines suggest the sea when a trapdoor beneath the stage
flies up to release a crowd of dainty marionettes from inside the belly of
the whale. At other times, Pinocchio and his audience strut to rock'n'roll
and swing along with a fairground barrel organ.
This Pinocchio has everything: fantasy, slapstick, a sturdy story, an
emotional game in which the spirit rises and falls like the yo-yo of the
marionette strings. Geppetto, largely absent from Collodi's adventures, is
the star of the show. Franceschini plays him in a great patched overcoat
which doubles as a disguise when he dons the occasional part of the Fox or
Cat. A beret turns him into a schoolchild taunting the puppet, a bowler hat
and he is the circus performer who lets Pinocchio break a leg before
throwing him into the sea.
On stage continuously, he is at once contortionist, conjuror and
ventriloquist, but he is at his best as the soft-centered Father spattering
pleas and philosophy ('La vie est la parole') by turns. Eyes deep-sunken,
nose a little long and crooked like Pinocchio's, expression quizzical and
imploring, body hunched, he is the archetypal old man, flesh visibly
crinkling up and limbs turning wooden through the stresses of his picaresque
doings even as his puppet turns from wood to flesh.

FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Giselle - Opera Garnier, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One hundred and fifty years ago this summer, Giselle was created on the
stage of the old Paris Opera in the rue Le Peletier. To celebrate this
anniversary, the Opera Ballet acquired a new production of Giselle last
week. I wish I could say that the enterprise is a fitting tribute from the
direct heirs of the first performers to this marvel of Romantic art, but -
alas - modishness has struck its usual blow, and the staging is fatally
flawed.
We are faced with a schizophrenic presentation. Patrice Bart and Genia
Polyakov have revived a decently traditional text. Patrick Dupond, director
of the ballet troupe, has decided that a spurious 'relevance' can be found
for a new generation of interpreters by ignoring the essential local colour
of the old ballet - that romantic fascination with the mysterious, the
quaint, which in this case is the charm of mediaeval Thuringia at vintage
time - and providing austere decoration by the Breton painter Loc Le
Groumellec.
There results an absolute disjunction between authentic choreography which
has in-built dramatic references to location and occupation - from
vintagers, a game-keeper, a hunt, to a mysterious lake in which Hilarion
must drown - and Le Groumellec's decors. There are monochrome back-drops of
Brittany (a bleak moor for Giselle's village; a looming, misty assemblage of
menhirs and megaliths for the nocturnal forest) which exist without benefit
of wings, with a windowless, doorless block as Giselle's cottage, and a
skeletal igloo in which Albrecht lodges.
Distinguished though these might prove on canvas, they serve merely to deny
the dance action, which looks lost and frigid on the Opera stage. Matters
are made even worse by costuming from Myriam Teissier and Le Groumellec. The
villagers are in dull, utility outfits, though Berthe has a nice line in
dark blue beach pyjamas beneath her apron; the Courland hunting party is on
its way to a particularly lurid drag ball. Vivid colour, insane shapes,
frenetic confections in velvet - one poor fellow wears a hat like a roof, a
triple-caped jerkin, and gaiters boasting a myriad silver buttons - reduce
the action to hysteria.
The wilful inconsistency between text and surroundings brings about a
complete breakdown of Giselle as a theatrical experience. Dupond's belief is
that the ballet's significance is increased when casts can relate to fresh
decorative or emotional ideas - a thesis proposed in Mats Ek's hateful but
consistent Swedish Giselle, whose second act was located in a mad-house.
This is to ignore the fact that with an old ballet, tradition and continuing
thought about the identity of roles and of the text itself will - as we see
with Giselle's 150 uninterrupted years in Russia - guarantee interpretative
vitality. Giselle has the best history of any classic at the Opera this
century, from the 1924 staging for Spessivtseva, to the two beautiful
post-war versions by Lifar, with superb decoration by Benois and Carzou,
illuminated by such great interpreters as Chauvire, Darsonval, Vyrubova.
(And it is significant that Mme Chauvire has dissociated herself from this
present production.)
It would be some compensation to report that, despite everything else, the
Opera casts triumph. But there is nothing to sustain the identity of the
ballet when it is so cursorily exposed and so isolated upon the stage, and
the dancers, like the drama, appear lost. There is also little refinement to
the production. Certain vital moments are ignored or skimped: since the
interior of Albrecht's cottage is open for all to see, the hiding of his
sword is futile, while the crucial fact of Giselle urging Albrecht to the
shelter of the cross on her grave in Act 2 is never made clear.
What can be, in a production as sensitive as that at the Kirov, a work of
rare beauty which encourages the highest ideals from its interpreters, here
becomes a frosty exercise in technique and ill-justified emoting.
I saw two casts. Monique Loudieres danced with her customary skill, but her
dramatic talents need the support (and the restraints) of a sounder staging
to be seen at their best. Her Albrecht was Patrick Dupond, whom I found less
than convincing. Florence Clerc made something exquisite of the second act
with Charles Jude, since both artists boast a clarity of technique and
style, and an emotional precision, that summoned up the spirit of the real
Giselle. The supporting dancers were, of course, excellent - the corps of
wilis very fine indeed - but the staging places them all at a disadvantage.

FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Surface images - Victor Pasmore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking today at the safe and inoffensive work of Victor Pasmore, which has
come to the Serpentine Gallery from the Center for International
Contemporary Art in New York (Kensington Gardens W2, until May 27), one
finds oneself hard put to remember quite how controversial a figure he once
was. Admittedly his notoriety hardly extended beyond the interest of the
British public for contemporary art, but within that little world, the stir
he made around 1950 by his abandonning of figuration in favour of
abstraction, was considerable. The word was passed: 'Pasmore's gone
abstract', and to those very British patrons, would-be and active alike, who
rather like the idea of contemporary involvement but also know quite well
what they like, it was a real and desperate betrayal.
It was of course nothing of the kind for, as any fairly chosen retrospective
must show, that shift to abstraction was a natural and gradual development,
clearly prefigured in the earlier work, most especially in the Hammersmith
landscapes of 1947 and 1948. The flat schematic swirls and eddies of the
later abstracted sea are already there, in the branches of the trees in the
gardens, even the bolster that supports the model's back. Professor Norbert
Lynton was curator of this exhibition and his choice, necessarily
constrained by the size of the gallery, is as fair and comprehensive as
could be.
But here we come to the central problem of Pasmore and his work. If his
reputation as a major figure of the post-war British avant garde is now
questionable, it has undoubtedly stuck and rather to his advantage. For with
that frisson of betrayal there came also a whiff of that danger and
excitement by which the nervous educated British sense that an intellectual
is come among them, like a fox in the chicken-run. While Pasmore's shift to
abstraction was decidedly worrying, the thought that it was at least founded
in some principle and system, won it a grudging and, as it has proved, a
lasting respect.
He must know what he is doing, so ran the argument, for why else should
someone who could paint nude and landscape, lamplight and twilight, so
seductively, suddenly give it all up?
His subsequent career as a teacher throughout the 1950s, latterly at the
School of Fine Art at what is now Newcastle University, would only confirm
his standing. The art educational principles of basic form and basic design,
which he developed in those years with his fellow theorists, notably Richard
Hamilton, Harry Thubron and Tom Hudson, haunt us still.
The trouble with Basic Form and Basic Design, which cause Pasmore and his
friends argued so persuasively, is that it embraces the heresy that anyone
can be an artist, if only they submit to the system, finish the project,
jump through the hoop. Nothing so tiresome as studying the model through
long hours in the life-room, learning to draw: to be an artist you need only
think like an artist. The effective destruction of our art schools by
casting aside the old system, with its essentially technical preoccupations
in favour of the new, which Pasmore and others, in all sincerity of purpose,
achieved in the 1960s, has been already long apparent.
The sad fact is that the idea of being an artist is infinitely seductive.
And Pasmore, that early reputation notwithstanding, has never enjoyed a
natural facility as painter or draughtsman. At the Euston Road School just
before the war he learnt the uses of seriousness and application, but in his
paintings of that time, tone, form and space alike are fuzzy, unclear and
unresolved, the colour little more than the conventional Euston green. And
we look again at the famous nudes, with their pert turn of hip and head and
provocative smear of lipstick, to find the drawing awkward, weak and unsure,
the figure uncoordinate and misunderstood, a leg unrelated and unmeasured, a
clumsy hand that cannot reach the knee it rests on.
So to the landscapes, to trees reduced to a spidery formula, shrouded in
mist that hides the sheer difficulty of setting objects together in a
coherent pictorial world. His solution to his difficulty was simple, direct
and as we now see, necessary. By 'going abstract' he simply accepted that
for him image, form and space were to be simplified, flattened, schematised,
brought to the surface: that was all he could manage, all he could do. And
so he has continued, more or less, these 40 years.

overrated

<TEXT>
Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the European Community research commissioner, is
close to concluding a new directive on satellite TV.
The directive has the support of the European electronics industry and
broadcasters. It also has the backing of Lord Chapple.
Frank Chapple was the redoubtable general secretary of the UK's electrical
and electronics union. Now, ennobled, he is president of Britain's
television manufacturers' association. Earlier this month he endorsed
Pandolfi's efforts to create a single European satellite broadcasting
standard, based on the Mac system.
His backing for Mac was not altogether surprising. Mac, touted as the
European route to high definition television, is a British invention. Far
more surprising is that Britain has a television manufacturers' association.
The last significant British-owned television maker, Ferguson, was acquired
by Thomson of France in 1987.
So who does the British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers'
Association (Brema) represent? Ferguson is still a member, as is the UK
branch of Philips of the Netherlands. But of Brema's 15 members, 10 are
Japanese. Japanese television manufacturers have been busily building
factories in the UK since 1974.
The worrying question for the champions of Mac, such as Thomson and Philips,
is why Japanese companies are backing the system. Mac was to be a home-grown
European answer to Japan's high definition Muse system, ensuring that
companies such as Thomson and Philips remained among the leaders in
international consumer electronics.
A 1986 EC directive required all satellite broadcasters to use the European
system. They would begin with either D-Mac in Britain or with D2-Mac in the
rest of Europe. D-Mac and D2-Mac are not high definition systems, but they
do provide better images than those currently seen on European screens. The
next step would be for broadcasters to move on to HD-Mac, Europe's own high
definition system, giving local companies an advantage over Japanese
competitors.
The directive expires at the end of the year and the Commission hopes to
present a new one to telecommunications ministers on June 3. The accord will
result in all satellite broadcasters using D2-Mac.
So why are Japanese companies supporting a system devised to exclude them?
Anyone who talks to Japanese electronics executives soon learns the answer.
They would have liked the Europeans to adopt Muse. But failing that, the
Japanese say they do not really mind what standard the Europeans choose for
high definition television, provided they have one. Whatever the
broadcasting system is, they say, they will manufacture the equipment to
receive it.
The UK-based Japanese set makers have proved themselves formidable exporters
to the rest of Europe. Sony, which has a factory in South Wales, has won
three Queen's Awards for Export. So successful have the British-based
Japanese companies' exports been that the UK last year had a Pounds 271m
trade surplus in television sets.
The D2-Mac patent is held by European companies and organisations. They
could make life difficult for Japanese companies which request manufacturing
licences. The Japanese say they will fight any attempt to deny them access
to the European high definition industry. It is unlikely that they can be
excluded forever.
If D2-Mac does become widely accepted in Europe, Thomson and Philips will
have won one battle. The war, however, will not have started. Its weapons
will not be directives or government subsidies, but design, price and
reliability - weapons that Lord Chapple's troops have learned to wield with
devastating effect.

FT  30 APR 91 / Technology: The script with double meaning - The struggle to
devise a computer standard to cover the world's languages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine that your word processor had all the writing scripts of the world at
its beck and call. Your invoices to Moscow would be rattled off in Cyrillic
characters, your orders to Tokyo would sport beautiful strings of Kanji, and
even your personal letters to Paris would have the proper accents.
Unfortunately for linguists, today's computers are not up to the task; an
Indian computer cannot handle Hebrew any more than a Greek one can master
hieroglyphics. Even an American computer is liable to charge a British
customer in dollars when it really means pounds - the same coding represents
both currencies.
For many years now, official standards bodies have agreed that there should
be an international system enabling all computers to handle the entire range
of graphic characters in use around the world, even if the keyboard was used
to access only a small proportion of the characters. Computer suppliers
would like this because it could offer them inroads into foreign markets.
Until now, such a global system has seemed out of reach. This summer,
however, sees the emergence of not one, but two, solutions to the problem.
Either system on its own could provide the necessary lead, but if the world
ends up with both of them the computer industry could continue in a state of
linguistic chaos well into the next century.
One of the systems is the work of the International Standards Organisation.
Draft international standard 10646 is the culmination of seven years' work
by ISO in encoding all the graphic characters of the world. It comes of age
in June when 22 countries will finish voting on whether to convert it into
an actual standard.
But just as 10646 has started its final lap, a rival has run on to the
track. Some of the same companies that have worked on 10646 have
simultaneously been taking part in another project to develop a simpler
alternative which they believe is more commercially acceptable. This system,
called Unicode, has already been sent out for evaluation to some 500
computer companies.
With the code due to be published in loose-leaf form next month and as a
book later in the year, it could soon build up commercial momentum.
ISO is therefore in a quandary. If its own standard goes ahead and wins
approval, the world may end up with two standards. On the other hand, if
10646 fails to win approval, then by the time it comes round in revised form
for another vote, Unicode may be far enough out in front to make 10646 seem
meaningless.
In an extraordinary move just two weeks ago, the ISO committee that
developed 10646 recommended a negative vote in the forthcoming international
ballot. Significantly about half of the committee members responsible for
the decision were also members of the Unicode consortium. The committee's
advice, which will form the basis of the US vote, seems to express a
determination not to permit the existence of two standards.
However 21 other countries are also voting in June, and many are likely to
vote yes. Japan is one of these, because 10646 contains the official
Japanese system for classifying characters, unlike Unicode which unifed
similar characters from different languages such as Japanese, Chinese and
Korean.
An impressive array of companies has been involved in developing both 10646
and Unicode. 10646 is the work of a committee comprising representatives
from many of the world's leading computer companies including IBM, Xerox,
Unisys, Apple, Digital Equipment, AT&amp;T, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.
Unicode, meanwhile, sprang from a consortium of 22 US companies, again
including IBM, Digital, Apple, Microsoft and Xerox. The Unicode companies,
restless with the long wait for 10646, started work on their code about two
and a half years ago.
With the two systems on collision course, both camps are now under intense
pressure to compromise, so that the codes could perhaps be merged. At the
moment this is seen as almost impossible - technically and practically - yet
circumstances are already dictating the need for an extraordinary effort.
One of Unicode's strongest advocates is Mike Kernaghan, vice-president of
the Unicode consortium. He is critical of the ISO code because he believes
ISO is not responding fast enough to customer demand. 'If you look at 10646
from an engineering viewpoint, it would be difficult to build a system
around it. We're looking at intelligent people who worked on the code but
unfortunately it looks like a camel designed by a committee.' He believes
10646 is so unwieldy that it could never be implemented in full. Instead,
sub-sets of the code would be used in different countries.
Unicode, on the other hand, could realistically spread around the world, he
says. With enough commercial support it could even become an international
standard retrospectively, like the current American standard, Ascii.
But such optimism may be misplaced. Unicode has a 'snowball's chance in
hell' of becoming an international standard according to one adherent of
10646.
The 10646 committee would be unlikely to agree openly with this sentiment
because it seeks Unicode's co-operation and does not want to be
inflammatory. Yet its members suggest ISO would probably find it
unacceptable to dismiss seven years' hard graft on the code. Its work has
been based on a set of firmly held principles - technical and cultural - and
at the moment it cannot see its way to giving them up.
But Jerry Anderson, IBM's representative on the 10646 committee, confirms
that the overriding concern must be to avoid having two world standards.
Recently, he and other 10646 representatives met informally in Paris to
discuss tentatively how the two codes might be merged. They hoped, said
Anderson, to find a way to make some 'significant concessions and
modifications' that would improve the standard and move it closer to
Unicode.
'At worst we wanted to accommodate some of the requirements to at least make
interworking (between the two codes) easier, and at best to induce a similar
flexibility on Unicode's side.'
Since that meeting, the 10646 committee has shifted on at least one of the
basic technical principles on which it and Unicode differ. Certain codings
which were previously reserved for 'control' instructions will be made
available for holding graphic characters, as is the case with Unicode.
Unicode claims it has made a compromise as well. This involves acceptance of
a Canadian idea for a way of merging the two codes by grafting Unicode on to
the framework of 10646. The ISO code's framework is so much bigger than
Unicode's that it could swallow Unicode in its entirety and still have room
to be itself.
This idea, floated by Isai Scheinberg of IBM Toronto, could feasibly unite
the two codes. 'If they did that we would go along with it,' says Kernaghan
of Unicode. But the 10646 committee is having a hard time with the idea.
Unicode would have to be recoded for the 10646 framework and, for this, ISO
would have to relinquish some of the principles, or restrictions, that are
fundamental to 10646.
Pressure is on to resolve these problems quickly. Each of 22 countries must
vote for or against 10646 by June. To pass, the code needs the approval of
15 countries and less than six must oppose it. At the moment the vote could
go either way.
Unicode
It holds each character as a 16-bit chunk - a series of ones and zeroes 16
units long. There are about 65,000 ways of arranging the ones and zeroes and
this means 65,000 characters can be represented using the code - many times
more than with present 8-bit codes such as Ascii.
It has condensed or unified Chinese, Japanese and Korean symbols into a core
of characters from which all the Asian languages can be generated. Two
thirds of Unicode's 27,000 listed characters are Asian.
It ignores existing conventions for the coding of 'control' characters such
as 'carriage return'.
It uses 'floating' accents which can be applied to any letter.
10646
It goes beyond Unicode's 16-bit structure to encode data in chunks as big as
32 bits wide. This means that 10646 can potentially store up to 1.3bn
characters - far more than it would ever need to.
Each Asian language is coded independently after the Japanese blocked an
early proposal to unify similar 'ideographs' - ancient Chinese characters.
It is more concerned than Unicode about compatibility with existing
computers. It avoids codes already used by computers for 'control'
instructions. This cuts the available space for graphic characters to 1.3bn
from about 4bn.
It has separate codes to represent letters in accented and unaccented forms.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Postal workers to be balloted on
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING and main-tenance workers in the postal service are to be
balloted next week on national industrial action after the dismissal of two
engineers in Liverpool for going home early.
Up to 10,000 employees of Royal Mail Engineering and Construction (Romec),
Royal Mail and Motor Transport divisions may be involved if the action goes
ahead.
The dispute started last October when two engineers in Liverpool completed a
job early. The National Communications Union says there was no other work
available and the men went home with the permission of their manager. The
NCU said the men were dismissed when a more senior manager found out.
Mr Phil Holt, NCU Merseyside branch secretary, said that the practice of
'job and finish' was endemic. Only a minority of places did not operate the
system, he said.
Romec said yesterday that it regarded industrial action as unnecessary and
that the logical course for the union was to take the matter to an
industrial tribunal. It added that all the agreed internal disciplinary
procedures had been followed.
Royal Mail said it would 'do its utmost to minimise the effect on
customers'.
Postal services on Merseyside have already been disrupted by the dispute,
with members of the Union of Communication Workers, the main postal workers'
union, supporting local action.
The UCW was yesterday attempting to get an injunction against the action
lifted in the High Court.
The ballot of NCU members comes as a ballot for industrial action by the UCW
of 14,500 Post Office counter and clerical employees gets under way. The UCW
has rejected a 6.8 per cent pay offer.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): London Tube strikes closer after union
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGERS on London Underground face the likelihood of 24-hour strikes
after workers voted by a margin of nearly two to one in favour of action
over job losses.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport workers' union, said
one-day strikes were the strongest possibility among options for taking
action, although he hoped for positive discussions with London Underground
before action was taken.
Mr Knapp was planning talks with the TSSA white-collar union, whose members
have also voted for strikes, to decide together on what form of action to
take.
It is thought that Wednesday and Thursday of next week are among the most
likely days for the first strike. But the possibility of mediation to settle
the dispute was opened up yesterday when London Underground said it would
welcome 'some outside third party assistance if necessary to enable the
union to talk to us.'
London Underground has rejected internal railway arbitration machinery, but
yesterday's statement could mean it would agree to talks involving the
conciliation service Acas.
The threat of strikes on the Tube coincides with the possibility of similar
action by British Rail workers, who are balloting on industrial action in
protest against a 7 per cent pay offer.
In the London Underground ballot, 3,760 voted for striking with 1,945
against. About 60 per cent of those eligible to vote did so.
London Underground said the result, with 40 per cent not taking part,
suggested many workers did not have their hearts in what it said would be
pointless strikes. There would be no compulsory redundancies and job losses
would be achieved through natural wastage, it said.
After the cutting of 1,005 jobs was complete, the organisation would still
employ 21,500, against 19,600 two years ago.
Mr Knapp criticised London Underground's revival of attempts to introduce
flexible working practices which it modified two years ago because of a
strike campaign.
He said it was difficult to estimate what its real plans for job losses
were. London Underground said the job losses comprised 50 among station
managers; 120 foremen; 80 leading railmen; 300 booking clerks; 80 train
operators; 200 guards; 70 engineers; 20 cleaners; and 85 in administration.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Boycott threat to university exams
recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSOCIATION of Uni-versity Teachers (AUT) has backed away from
industrial action in pursuit of this year's pay claim.
Results of the ballot of university lecturers, declared yesterday, showed
only a small majority in favour of industrial action, making an examination
boycott now unlikely. On a low turnout - 42 per cent - a majority of only
1,310 favoured boycotting the marking of university exams. The total poll
was less than 13,000.
'University staff are grossly underpaid,' said Ms Diana Warwick, AUT general
secretary. 'Our claim for a 16 per cent increase was, and is, fair and
moderate, but in seeking to achieve our aim our members wish to act
reasonably and professionally.'
University employers last week imposed an interim settlement of 5 per cent
outside the normal negotiating machinery. No further meetings with the union
have been arranged.
The AUT claim for 16 per cent was part of a three-year strategy to make up
for a long-term shortfall in lecturers' salaries.
The AUT executive decided yesterday to seek an urgent meeting with Mr
Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, to discuss extending to lecturers the
pay review body already promised to school teachers.
Ms Warwick kept open the possibility of industrial action should 'all
avenues' of resolving the pay dispute prove unsuccessful. The issue will be
debated at the union's conference next month.
The AUT will concentrate instead on pressing the case for a new method of
salary determination for academic staff.

EQUAL opportunities person-nel, who have the task of implementing policies
on race, sex and disability within organisations, are among the most
stressed of all occupational groups, according to a survey published today.
Above-average levels of physical ill health were found in 90 per cent of
equal opportunities managers and their staff, and nearly 75 per cent showed
above-average levels of mental ill health, the study by occupational
psychologists found.
More than 30 per cent of EO workers saw no career development if they stayed
in the field and nearly 23 per cent indicated that they wanted to leave
their present employers.
Pearn Kandola Downs, the group of psychologists that carried out the survey,
found the greatest sources of stress were lack of clarity about job function
and interpersonal relations, particularly in dealing with people who may
feel threatened by EO policies.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition refuses to back
independent pay review body - Teachers' Pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders were accused of being in fear of the biggest teachers' union
(NUT) in the Commons last night when they refused to back the establishment
of an independent review body for teachers' pay.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, repeatedly clashed with ministers
and Conservative backbenchers when he claimed that there could be no
guarantee that the review body would be genuinely independent.
The government secured a majority of 110 (310-200) to defeat a Labour
'reasoned amendment' seeking to deny a second reading to the School
Teachers' Pay and Conditions (No. 2) Bill because it gave 'unacceptable
powers' to the education secretary to give directions to the review body.
The Bill was then given an unopposed second reading.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, contended that a 'silent
majority' of the NUT agreed with the other five teaching unions in favouring
the establishment of a pay review body for teachers.
He reaffirmed that in the event of industrial action being threatened or
taken the government would not activate the teachers' pay review body.
Mr Clarke forecast that when the new body became operative, teachers would
move to the same position as the Royal College of Nursing and regard strike
action as 'extinct'.
He gave an assurance that ministerial powers would not be used to give the
pay review body a financial remit, although it would be possible for it to
be asked to have regard to 'affordability'.
Mr Clarke insisted that the establishment of the review body would lift the
professional status of teachers, and acknowledged the need to improve the
position of the successful classroom teacher who was not interested in
moving to a non-teaching post.
Mr Straw condemned the way in which the Government had 'demeaned' teachers
over the past 12 years, and quoted comments by Conservative party members
admitting that there was a crisis of confidence in the profession.
To Labour cheers he said ministers regarded the state education service as
one for 'other peoples' children and not their own'.
Challenged about the attitude of Labour MPs to the proposed review body, he
said 'We are in favour of the practice of review bodies where they are
agreed between the parties'.
Labour MPs, he emphasised, were 'very sceptical indeed' about whether the
proposals in the Bill would ensure the independence of the review body.
Mr Straw dismissed Conservative allegations that Labour MPs had always
supported strikes by public sector workers as a 'complete calumny'. He said:
'I defer to nobody in my view that, so far as possible, industrial action
should be avoided inside schools'.
Sir Norman Fowler (C Sutton Coldfield) contended that Mr Straw's speech
amounted to saying 'if the NUT agrees with the review body so will we - if
not we won't'.
Closing the debate, Mr Tim Eggar, education minister, accused a minority of
the NUT of being absolutely determined that teachers should be able to take
industrial action 'at the drop of a hat'.
Mr Clarke apologised for describing readers of the Daily Mirror as 'morons.
Mr Derek Fatchett, from Labour's front bench, said Mr Clarke's attack on the
newspaper's readers cast doubt on his ability to behave rationally.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories braced for West Midlands
losses - The battles for local authorities in the Black Country and beyond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES are on the defensive in the West Midlands as campaigning for
the local elections enters its final few days.
Labour is confident enough to expect greater control of its urban heartlands
and gains in rural Conservative bastions.
More than 1,220 seats are being contested in 42 district authorities
throughout Gloucestershire, Hereford and Worcester, Shropshire,
Staffordshire, Warwickshire and the metropolitan districts of the West
Midlands. The whole of the council is up for election in 18 authorities.
In the remainder, including the six authorities of the Birmingham-Black
Country conurbation and Coventry, one third of the council seats is being
contested.
In these 42 authorities, Labour has control in 15 authorities and the
Conservatives in seven. Independents predominate in five - Cotswold,
Leominster, Oswestry, North Shropshire and South Shropshire - and the
Liberal Democrats in one, Hereford. There are 14 authorities where no party
has overall control. Labour has control over roughly two thirds of the
regional population.
Political analysts will examine any shifts in this pattern of control for
the general election implications. The West Midlands is one of the regions
where Labour has to pick up more seats to have any hope of winning the
general election. But shifts either way will be difficult to assess.
Labour has consistently polled more heavily in the local elections of the
region than in the parliamentary elections. In Worcester, for example,
Labour gained local authority control 11 years ago, but has not held the
parliamentary seat since the Second World War.
Local elections are often used for protest votes against the party in power
at national level: the region's 1987 local election results suggested a
Labour gain of about seven seats at parliamentary level. But no such gain
was made at the general election five weeks after the local polls.
Throughout the region, the Conservatives gained 41 local authority seats in
1987. These seats are up for election on May 2.
The Conservative object will be simply to hold on, but analysis of the
possibilities, council by council, suggests that more than 45 seats could be
lost, nearly half of them in the Birmingham-Black Country area.
The most striking loss is likely to be in Birmingham, controled by Labour
for the past seven years, where estimates of Conservative decline range from
seven to 14 seats. Sir Richard Knowles, the Labour leader, said: 'Odds on we
shall win seven seats, possibly 10.' Councillor Reg Hales, the minority
Conservative leader, countered: 'We will do better than many expect.'
But the authority of most symbolic significance is probably Solihull, the
last metropolitan authority controled by the Conservatives.
The Conservative MP of this prosperous suburb has a majority of 21,786.
However, the Conservatives may not be able to fend off a strong challenge. A
probable loss of two of the 10 Conservative seats under contest could put
the Conservatives into a minority on the council without giving Labour a
clear majority.
One of the few councils where the Conservatives have a chance of winning
control is Wychavon in Hereford and Worcester.
That is due to a substantial local campaigning effort and dents to the Tory
whip.
However, the role of Independents in the region, particularly important in
Gloucestershire and Shropshire, has become a difficulty for the Tories.
Where Independents do not control a council, they tend to support the
Tories. But their numbers have dwindled as local politics have become more
polarised between the larger parties.
This year the polarisation, the local political argument, swirls round the
two pillars of the poll tax and the provision of local services.
Conservatives in the West Midlands were dismayed at the speed with which
Labour muddied the impact of the Government's promised reduction for 1991-92
of a Pounds 140 reduction.
They have been perturbed at the spectacle of Conservative authorities
arguing with the national Government about finance - Warwickshire County
Council on its poll tax capping and Solihull on its standard spending
assessment, for example. Lack of unity is damaging.
Here then is a source of weakness for the Conservatives. The announcement of
the council tax has made little difference. It is too remote to restore the
damage caused by the disarray.
'The Government is not helping us locally,' said Mr Hales. Hence the
campaigning stress on local interpretation of the national Conservative line
that Labour councils are wasteful and inefficient. As an example, Mr Hales
argued that the Birmingham City Council takes part in enterprising
initiatives, like the building of the International Convention Centre, but
gets wrong the basic issues like housing, care of the elderly, street
cleanliness and so on.
When the polls close on May 2, it is not likely that many West Midlands
authorities will be under different control.
There are the possible changes in Solihull and Wychavon. But Labour is
entertaining hopes of extending its power outside the Birmingham-Black
Country conurbation and urban centres like Redditch, The Wrekin, Tamworth,
Nuneaton &amp; Bedworth, and Potteries towns into rural Wyre Forest and the
mixed area of East Staffordshire.
In Wyre Forest, where 14 of the the council's 42 seats are part of the
election, and where no party now has overall control, Labour has 16 seats
against 10 Conservatives, 13 Liberal Democrats and three Independents. All
of the 46 seats in East Staffordshire are being contested: Labour and
Conservative both hold 22, and the balance is held by the Liberal Democrats.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Extra funds for Kurdish refugees -
Overseas Aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN extra Pounds 20m of government money to help the Kurdish refugees was
announced yesterday by Mr John Major, Alison Smith writes.
The prime minister told Mrs Ann Clwyd, the shadow overseas development
minister, that the funds would be used to continue the airbridge operation,
provide urgently needed supplies and help finance the UK's role in Operation
Haven, to set up safe areas in Iraq.
The government has given a total of Pounds 62m to the relief effort since
the beginning of April, including Pounds 10m announced last week as a
contribution to the Kurdish Refugee Appeal.
The new money is also intended to allow the Overseas Development
Administration to keep up its planned activities, including provision of
help for famine relief in Africa.
Mrs Clwyd welcomed the extra funds to help the Kurds, the first time since
1979 that the government had increased the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) budget for an emergency.
She said, however, that the additional amount would not meet the full cost
of the relief effort. The ODA had already spent Pounds 20m on supplies and
was spending Pounds 1.5m per week to the ministry of defence and commercial
airlines to fly the goods to the region.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plan for change in 'macho'
management - City Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would seek to change Britain's management culture to
make company boards more accountable to employees and curb directors' pay
rises, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the party's City spokesman said last night, Ralph
Atkins writes.
Company directors have become like 'medieval barons', willingly reducing
their accountability, Ms Mowlam said. Britain was far more restrictive that
other European Community countries.
'The macho management culture of the 1980s, characterised by toughness and
autocratic attitudes, is all too common. It manifests itself in the relative
loss of power by employees and the generally inadequate response to training
and R&amp;D'
She used a speech to the London Bullion Markets Association to attack recent
large pay rises for directors. Few boards would consider taking a pay cut to
reflect declining returns to shareholders.
Directors pay rises have outstripped those of other employees for at least
the last five years and were often 'disproportionate' to the actual benefits
which shareholders received, Ms Mowlam said. 'Few shareholders bothered to
question such handsome rewards.'
Ms Mowlam said cuts in the top rate of income tax to 40p were intended to
improve incentives. 'However many directors took it upon themselves to cream
off even more of the profits with record pay awards in 1989, the first year
of the lower tax rates. This was a blatant abuse of the original intention.'

FT  30 APR 91 / Propeller designs for successor to QE2 under test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SWEDISH subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering group, is testing
propeller designs for a possible Cunard ocean liner that may become the
successor to the 23-year-old QE2.
Cunard Lines, owned by Trafalgar House, the UK conglomerate, yesterday
described as 'entirely speculative' a newspaper report of a top-secret
project, codenamed Q5, to design a liner to replace the QE2.
It is known that KaMeWa, of Sweden, part of Vickers' marine engineering
division, is studying propeller designs for a model of a Cunard liner.
KaMeWa, acquired by Vickers in 1986, has one of the world's largest
facilities for research into propulsion technology.
Yesterday Trafalgar House said it was always looking at a variety of
possible ways forward for Cunard, but otherwise had no comment on the
report. The company said it would not speak about its fleet plans until the
appropriate time.
If the project were to go ahead, UK shipyards would face strong competition
for the order from continental European yards that have specialised in
cruise ships. It is understood that the liner would not be bigger than the
QE2, in order that it could pass through the Panama Canal.
The report, in the Sunday Express, quoted an estimate by industry experts
that a new liner would cost Cunard Pounds 400m.
Trafalgar House described the report as longer on imagination than hard
fact. Industry sources are quoted saying the ship would become the Princess
Diana - or, depending on how long the project takes, the Queen Diana.
KaMeWa is the world's biggest manufacturer of controllable-pitch propellers.
On this kind of propeller, the angle at which the blades rotate can be
altered, changing the speed or direction of the ship, whereas conventional
propellers are turned by a shaft of varying speed.

FT  30 APR 91 / Labour intends to scrap A-levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A-LEVEL examinations would be abolished under plans by the Labour party to
overhaul educational qualifications for students aged 16 to 19 in England
and Wales, the party announced yesterday.
Labour would create a single post-16 qualification for both academic and
vocational studies, to be called the Advanced Certificate for Education and
Training (ACET).
The aim is that the ACET should eventually subsume A-levels, Business and
Technician Education Council (Btec) exams, and many other vocational
qualifications.
The ACET is a modular-based concept. Under Labour's plan, students would
have to complete some five 'modules' to qualify.
Modules either academic or vocational in their broad scope would be
available with a range of 'core skills' common to both.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said in launching the proposals:
'It is now a national imperative that we end the present jungle of over 200
qualifications and replace it with a single coherent framework of 16-19
qualifications combining the academic and the vocational.'
No timetable for full introduction of the ACET has been set by Labour. For
an interim period, however, a five-subject A-level would be introduced.
'This will be welcomed by colleges and universities, and will entail no
reduction in standards', Mr Straw insisted.
Labour's scheme would comprise:
The ACET qualification for pupils over the age of 16.
A new qualifications board to ratify modular courses to be offered as part
of the ACET. It would replace the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications and the Schools Examination and Assessment Council.
A system of transferable credits that trainees would be able to devote
towards an ACET.
An obligation on employers of people aged 16 to 19 to provide approved
training or day release.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, described the proposals as 'a
long overdue departure from the present system, which has divided education
and training in both standards and status.'
The government has yet to announce its plans for the future of post-16
qualifications, but ministers are unlikely to favour significant changes to
the A-level.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, immediately condemned Labour's plans
as a threat to standards. 'He proposes that everyone should get more
A-levels by making them easier to get . . . There are more sensible ways of
broadening education for 16-to-19-year-olds which we will be publishing
shortly.'
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, accused Labour
of adopting his party's proposals.

FT  30 APR 91 / University financing is criticised as outdated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITIES came under attack yesterday from a former member of Mrs
Thatcher's policy unit.
Professor Sir Douglas Hague, chairman of the Economic and Social Science
Research Council, criticised the financing of universities and their
structure and culture as outdated in a study published by the Institute of
Economic Affairs.
He says in the report: 'Universities will have to be like businesses and
learn to pay twice as much to half as many people.'
Attacking excessive specialisation among academics, Sir Douglas says:
'Buttressed in their academic bunker . . . they presume greater mastery of
limited fields, perhaps never recalling the old saw about knowing everything
about nothing.'
He recommends changes in the system including abolishing national university
pay scales, a shift from grants to fees, and an increase in the number of
institutions able to award degrees.

FT  30 APR 91 / Unit trust accounting rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTING and disclosure rules for unit trusts were published yesterday by
the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro). The rules, in the
form of a statement of recommended practice, have the backing of the
regulatory body and so are binding on unit trusts.
They are based on current best practice in the industry and should make
little difference to most unit trusts, Imro said.
Among the more important rules is a tighter definition of when expenses can
be treated as capital rather than revenue items. The regulations are
intended to standardise reporting across the industry, which will make
comparison between unit trusts easier.

<TEXT>
MR Peter Brooke, Nor-thern Ireland secretary, opens talks on the political
future of the province today, with all parties pledging to do their utmost
to reach an historic agreement.
Speaking in Belfast yesterday, Mr Brooke said he had been impressed by the
way all sides were approaching the dialogue.
He said: 'It is a good thing for constitutional politicians and the two
governments to have agreed a basis to sit down and talk. But I hope we can .
. .use the opportunity to make successful agreements on a wide range of
issues.'
Today he will open bilateral talks with Northern Ireland's main
constitutional party leaders, starting with the nationalist Social
Democratic Labour party and moving on to the moderate Alliance party this
afternoon.
The four constitutional parties involved have been preparing their position
papers for the talks, which start with the internal government of the
province. Dublin will join in the talks when they broaden to cover relations
between Ulster and the Irish republic, and between London and Dublin.
Today's meetings are expected to concentrate on the agendas for plenary
sessions due to get under way next week.

FT  30 APR 91 / Sun Alliance drops bid to buy ECGD insurance offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK insurance company, has withdrawn from the bidding for
the short-term credit insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department.
The decision leaves only three of the original six potential bidders still
in contention.
Sun Alliance, long conspicuous for its lack of aggression as a bidder, said
prospective net premium income, estimated at Pounds 22m, did not justify the
resources required to integrate ECGD into its other operations.
The company was also concerned that the reinsurance arrangements being
negotiated by the government with the private sector might lack 'robustness'
in the longer term.
It had decided therefore that the acquisition of the business would not fit
in with either its domestic activities or its expansion plans for Europe.
Its decision to withdraw will come as a further blow to the government,
which has been struggling to push the sale through against strong opposition
from the export industry. Eagle Star and Cobac, the Belgian credit insurance
company, have already withdrawn.
Bids for the business must be submitted by noon today. Trade Indemnity, the
UK company that dominates the domestic market for credit insurance; NCM of
the Netherlands; and Assicurazioni Generali of Italy are expected to bid.
Insurance market specialists said the chances of the Italian company's
likely bid being successful have improved recently. Although it lacks the
direct experience of credit insurance of the other two contenders, it has a
strong balance sheet and the overall size of its operations give it much
influence in the vital reinsurance market.
Trade Indemnity lost Pounds 29m last year as the UK recession brought a
series of claims on bankrupt companies. Brokers said it would need to
persuade its reluctant shareholders - mostly other insurance and reinsurance
companies - to subscribe to a rights issue to create the resources to bid
for ECGD. The company declined to comment yesterday.
NCM, which also acts as the official export credit insurer for the Dutch
government, is profitable at present, with net profits for 1990 up 18 per
cent to Fl 33.6m (Pounds 10m). It said last week it believed it had a good
chance of winning the contest.

FT  30 APR 91 / Spitfire bids fail to reach for the sky: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPITFIRE aircraft that saw active service in the Second World War was
unsold at a Christie's auction yesterday. Bidding for the Mark IX aircraft,
which shot down two enemy aircraft on one day in May 1944 over Italy,
reached Pounds 720,000.
The finely restored aircraft was built in 1943, and is one of only a score
or so of surviving Spitfires likely to appear on the market.
The aircraft was regarded as superbly restored and repainted. It was flown
frequently last year during the Battle of Britain 50th anniversary
celebrations - hence its pre-sale estimate of Pounds 750,000-Pounds 850,000.
This estimate was well above the record Pounds 680,000 paid privately for a
Spitfire. It is possible there will be a private sale after the auction.
Christie's sale at the Science Museum at Wroughton, near Swindon, offered
historic aircraft, engines and aviation memorabilia. Only two of the 13
aircraft on offer found buyers.
One was a T31 powered glider, which sold for Pounds 1,650, and the other was
a Dewoitine D514LP, a French prototype fighter of 1938, which made Pounds
55,000, well below its estimate although prototypes usually find their way
into museums and rarely come up for sale.
A full-sized replica of a de Havilland DH88 Comet, which was made last year
in Australia for a TV film, and which can taxi but not fly, failed to sell
at the auction but was later sold privately for Pounds 16,500.
The collection of airship memorabilia acquired by Heinrich Kubis, who was
chief steward in the Graf Zeppelin and who survived the destruction of the
Hindenburg in 1937, sold for Pounds 35,508, three times Christie's estimate.
The highest price in the group was the Pounds 5,500 paid by the London
dealers J. Franks for the Graf Zeppelin logbook.
On Sunday Sotheby's sold motorcycles and brought in almost Pounds 400,000,
but with 30 per cent unsold. A 1927 Brough Superior 680cc solo motorcycle
made the top price of Pounds 18,700.

during an alleged plot to export nuclear detonating devices to Iraq.
Mr Daniel Supnick posed as Mr Dan Saunders, export manager of CSI, the US

He said yesterday that with the authorisation of British Customs and Excise
he put a miniature tape recorder under his clothes before going to London's
Cavendish Hotel for an 8am meeting in September 1989.
Mr Ali Daghir, aged 49, a managing director, of Esher, Surrey, Ms Jeanine
Speckman, aged 41, of Addlestone, Surrey, and Mr Toufic Amyuni, aged 37, of
London, have all denied conspiring to attempt illegally to export 40
electrical capacitors between September 1 1988 and March 29 last year.
The trial was adjourned until today.

FT  30 APR 91 / Docklands body to cut 40% of staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Docklands Development Corporation, the government-funded
regeneration body, yesterday announced plans to shed 40 per cent of its
staff over the next two years.
The corporation, which has 456 staff, expects to make half the cuts by the
end of next March.
High staff turnover and short-term contracts will limit numbers of
compulsory redundancies needed. The corporation said no decision had been
made on where the redundancies might fall.
The decision follows a long review of the corporation's role and staffing
needs.
The review, which was approved 10 days ago, called for a new management
structure. It involves the appointment of several assistant chief executives
and senior managers to focus on specific tasks and the pooling of the rest
of the staff into a 'task-orientated resource group'.
The recession in the property market, which was earlier and more severe in
the Docklands than virtually any other part of the country, has created
financial difficulties for the corporation.
Heavy spending on transport schemes meant that in the year ended March 31
1990, expenditure of Pounds 279m exceeded income by Pounds 4.2m. At the year
end, it had a cash balance of more than Pounds 3m and reserves in excess of
Pounds 115m.
The corporation said that the commissioning of the staffing review pre-dated
the arrival of Mr Eric Sorensen, a civil servant from the Department of the
Environment, who became chief executive two months ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH court action to determine liability for Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000)
damage allegedly caused when a runaway tractor hit a US Air Force aircraft
began yesterday.
The Trackair tractor collided with the left wing of the stationary TR1
spyplane at RAF Alconbury, Cambridgeshire, in December 1987.
Two companies face the US government in the five-day hearing to determine
liability. The court will decide whether the owner or the user of the
tractor should pay the bill.
ARC Construction of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, the user, and HS Isis Hire, of
Redditch, Hereford and Worcester, the owner, both deny negligence.
Mr Charles Falconer, QC, told Mr Justice Hobhouse that ARC was using the
tractor for asphalt work at the airfield. Its driver left the vehicle
without its handbrake on and with no chocks in front of its wheels.
The tractor moved off without the driver, who chased after it trying in vain
to clamber into the cab. The aircraft's pilot could only release its brakes
to reduce the impact.
The hearing continues.

FT  30 APR 91 / Voluntary bodies face crisis vote over Pounds 29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINUED existence of many London voluntary organisations rests on a
meeting of one of the capital's borough councils tonight.
After months of wrangling between the political parties, the London Boroughs
Grants Committee, which allocates London-wide voluntary-sector support,
reached agreement on its 1991-92 budget earlier this month when two
Conservative-controlled boroughs - Ealing and Enfield - voted with Labour
and Liberal Democrat councils to support a Pounds 29m voluntary-sector
funding programme.
Ealing has since told the grants organisation that its finance committee
lacked the full council's authority to support the budget. The council will
tonight decide whether to uphold or reverse the decision.
A decision by Ealing to withdraw its agreement to the Pounds 29m budget
would aggravate an already severe crisis in the voluntary sector. It would
lead to further delays in the distribution of grants to voluntary
organisations, and possibly to High Court action.
Voluntary organisations throughout Britain are facing financial difficulties
because of cuts in local-authority support and loss of other public funding.
Many in London are living on borrowed time - and in some cases borrowed
money - as they await the allocations. Any further delay would cause many to
close.
The threat to London's voluntary sector is embarrassing for the government,
which wants voluntary organisations to take over welfare and other
responsibilities from public authorities. Ministers are believed to be
urging their fellow Conservatives at Ealing to endorse the Pounds 29m
budget.
The London Boroughs Grants Committee was set up after the abolition of the
Greater London Council in 1986 to distribute public support to voluntary
organisations serving more than one borough.
Its budget has declined in real terms over the six years of its life because
it has to be agreed by two thirds of the boroughs.
Differences are largely party-political but also reflect tensions between
relatively deprived inner-city boroughs and more prosperous outer ones over
how much voluntary activity is necessary.
The committee says in its annual review, published yesterday, that
demographic changes and government policies such as the contracting-out of
public services were going to increase pressures on voluntary organisations.

FT  30 APR 91 / Mercury urges Oftel to reduce network tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY COMMUNICATIONS is urging Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, to
reduce charges it will have to pay for using the network of its larger
rival, British Telecom.
Mercury has joined others in the industry, such as cable television
companies and British Rail Telecommunications, in criticising Oftel's
proposals on how the interconnection charges between networks should be
calculated.
The industry says Oftel has been too generous to BT, creating the danger
that the government's policy for increasing competition in the
telecommunications sector, announced in last month's white paper, may be
thwarted.
Speculation is widespread in the City and in the industry that Sir Bryan
Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, has shifted his position in BT's favour
in recent months as the result of pressure from the government in the run-up
to its sale of a second tranche of BT shares.
Mr Peter van Kuylenberg, Mercury's chief executive, said Sir Bryan's
arguments were now '180 degrees out of phase' with what they had been.
Sir Bryan has refused to comment on the dispute over interconnection
charges, but he is likely to issue a statement in about two weeks in an
attempt to clarify his policy.
Mercury, which has been remaining quiet publicly in the hope of increasing
its leverage, believes there is still everything to play for. 'The whole
matter is very much in the process of consultation,' Mr van Kuylenberg said.
The main point of contention is Oftel's suggestion that rivals should
contribute to BT's 'access deficit' whenever they use the company's network.
The idea is that BT makes a loss from providing people with a phone line
which it subsidises from higher call charges and that its competitors should
be required to make a similar subsidy.
Mr van Kuylenberg said that Mercury was already paying a fair share of those
costs under its existing interconnecting arrangements. He also argued that
the method Oftel was proposing to use to calculate the deficit was too
generous to BT.

CITY OF London police have arrested Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the chairman
and joint managing director of Wallace Smith Trust, a small London banking
and finance group.
Mr Smith was last night being held in custody at Bishopsgate police station
in the City, and no charges had been made. Earlier in the day the operations
of Wallace Smith Trust and all its associated UK companies had been
suspended.
In a brief announcement, the company said the Bank of England and the City
of London police fraud squad were conducting investigations. It had no
further comment.
Wallace Smith Trust was founded by Mr Smith, a Canadian national. The
company is owned by a trust representing his family, which has extensive
financial interests in Edmonton, Alberta.
The bank specialised in dealing in the money market and in corporate
finance. It did not take deposits from the public.
Its latest accounts show that it had assets of Pounds 370m, most of which
consisted of money-market instruments. Its share capital and reserves
amounted to Pounds 13.2m. In the year to April 30 1990 it made a profit of
Pounds 175,000, down from Pounds 1.5m the year before. An associated
company, Wallace Smith Trust Group, made a loss of Pounds 1m in the same
period.
Wallace Smith Trust's other directors are Mr Michael Hamilton, joint
managing director, and Mr JM Bradley.

was alleged in the High Court yesterday. The letter was drafted by one of
the insurance market's agencies to a group of Names (members).
The allegation was made during the second day of the civil case brought
against the Corporation of Lloyd's by 33 Names who backed Oakeley Vaughan
Underwriting Agency's syndicates between 1980 and 1982.
In the case Ashmore v the Corporation of Lloyd's,the Names allege that
Lloyd's failed to supervise the agency properly and that its negligence was
responsible for some Pounds 5m of underwriting losses suffered by them.
More than 250 Names originally backed four syndicates managed by Oakeley
Vaughan. Their total losses exceed Pounds 30m.
Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford, QC, acting for 24 of the Names, said that
Lloyd's failed to tell Names about the results of a 1981 inquiry into the
agency. The internal inquiry began in February 1981 and examined allegations
that Oakeley Vaughan syndicates were overwriting.
When a syndicate overwrites, it writes more insurance than permitted
according to Lloyd's regulations. Overwriting means that the insurance
liabilities of Names are increased.
A letter dated March 6 1981 was sent by Oakeley Vaughan to the Names on its
syndicates. It said that the allegations were of a 'technical' nature. The
letter had been previously approved by Lloyd's. The words 'in a market the
size of Lloyd's such inquiries are not unusual' had been added.
Those statements were misleading, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said. In its
defence,Lloyd's says the Names were guilty of contributory negligence in not
being aware, through press coverage, of what was happening at Oakeley
Vaughan.
Mr Lyndon-Stanford said: 'If Lloyds' attitude is that Names should inform
themselves from newspapers and not with information from Lloyd's,it is not a
very good reflection on Lloyds' attitude to its Names.'
The allegations were made in evidence presented by Mr Lyndon-Stanford,
covering developments at Oakeley Vaughan between February and May 1981.
Earlier, Mr Justice Gatehouse allowed Mr Lyndon-Stanford to present evidence
concerning alleged inadequate monitoring of premium income by
Lloyd's,although that is not specifically stated in the writ.
The hearing, expected to last three months, continues today.

<TEXT>
THE Peruvian financial system is to be shaken up in favour of market forces
after the first big change in the country's banking law for 60 years.
The new law, promulgated last week by President Alberto Fujimori, lets
financial institutions to set their own interest rates and reopens the
country to foreign banks. It also lets public sector companies become
clients of private banks.
This has been well received in general by local banks, finance institutions
and insurance companies.
In an attempt to curb the parallel or informal banks which have mushroomed
in Peru over the past few years, the law gives banks, finance and insurance
houses three months to constitute themselves as limited companies or
co-operatives.
Institutions will have, however, two years to meet the minimum capital
requirements under the new regulations.
The new law curbs the power of the Central Reserve Bank. It will no longer
fix interest rates. They will be determined by the market, with the BCR
setting a top limit.

FT  30 APR 91 / Japan sees new SDRs easing liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday provided the first details of its proposal to enhance global
financial resources through an issue of Special Drawing Rights, the reserve
asset created and managed by the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japanese finance minister, told the IMF's
policy-making Interim Committee that he would like to see a selective SDR
allocation to help countries in the Third World, and central and eastern
Europe, suffering from temporary liquidity problems.
He said any new SDRs should be given to countries implementing economic
reform programmes, and be linked to the acceptance of strict economic
conditions in those recipient countries.
In this way, the Japanese minister went some way towards deflecting
criticism of his proposals from countries such as the US and Germany, which
have always considered that a new allocation of SRDs would be unnecessary
and potentially inflationary.
Mr Hashimoto's proposal won some support from Mr Pierre Be're'govoy, French
finance minister, yesterday.
He said that an issue of 30bn SDRs (Dollars 40bn), on top of the existing
21.4bn SDRs held by IMF member countries, would increase world reserve
assets by only about 5 per cent and therefore would not be inflationary.
Earlier, however, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the German Bundesbank,
said he was thoroughly opposed to any new SDR allocation.
He said that such a move would amount to a falsification of the character of
the SDR, which had been created originally to offset a shortage of
liquidity. At present, there was no shortage of liquidity in the world, Mr
Pohl added.

FT  30 APR 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Gradualism 'no answer for E
Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRADUALISM is no answer to the problems of central and eastern European
countries, where structural reforms should proceed as rapidly as possible on
a broad front, the Group of 10 finance ministers and central bank governors
agreed yesterday.
The G10 leading industrial nations, meeting in Washington during the
IMF/World Bank gathering, broadly endorsed the thrust of a report (Issues
Raised by the Transition in Central and Eastern Europe) prepared by Mr
Lamberto Dini, director-general of the Bank of Italy, and chairman of the
group's deputies.
'Gradualism is no good because it is likely to require too many resources,
which are scarce,' Mr Dini said yesterday. But differences remain about the
scale of financial contributions by industrial countries, and about how such
assistance should be co-ordinated.
The report stresses that primary responsibility for helping these economies
with formulating macro-economic stabilisation policies should remain with
the IMF, and for structural reforms rest with the World Bank.
At present, much of the co-ordination of assistance beyond conditional loans
provided by the IMF and Bank is handled by the G24 industrial countries and
the EC.
The ministers concluded yesterday that the structure and composition of the
G10 made it especially qualified to monitor the degree of official financing
in the transition process, assess adequacy of economic strategies and make
policy recommendations on issues relevant for the activity of banks and
financial markets. But the G10 does not intend to play a direct role in aid
co-ordination.
Some European countries fear they may have to bear too much of the burden of
this help. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, said yesterday that
EC members of the G7 believed there should be proper burden-sharing with the
12 EC members accounting for 50 per cent of the overall support for these
countries.
Other European countries not in the EC should contribute 15 per cent, with
35 per cent coming from the rest of the world, notably the US, Japan, Canada
and Australia. The issue has arisen in part because the US said it will give
just Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.8m) to a Dollars 1bn balance of payments
stabilisation fund for Czechoslovakia.
The G10 report, which does not cover the Soviet Union, stresses the
importance of establishing full private property rights and introducing a
market-based price system in central and eastern European countries.
These countries needed to expose themselves to international competition,
and industrial countries needed to open their markets to imports from
eastern Europe.

FT  30 APR 91 / More help offered to Third World cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has agreed to change its policies towards urban development,
in the light of the rapid growth of Third World cities, bank officials said
yesterday.
The bank has been trying to address urban problems mainly through lending
for housing and other narrowly-based projects.
The new approach, taking account of the expectation that by 2000 half the
population in the Third World will live in cities, will attempt to make
urban development an important component of its overall development
strategy.
It will aim to encourage the improvement of urban productivity and reduce
the impediments to growth.
The focus would include attempts to lighten the regulatory restrictions on
growth of private businesses, to tackle the weakness in many local
governments and to address weak financial systems.
A new emphasis would be tackling urban poverty. The bank would also focus on
arresting and reversing the environmental deterioration which accompanied
rapid urban growth.
Peter Norman reports: Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, yesterday
suggested a World Bank 'fund, facility or subsidiary' to back long-term
Middle East development after the Gulf war.
He told the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee
that the new facility should be supported by or co-ordinated with the IMF.
Mr Pierre Be're'govoy, French finance minister, said yesterday he saw no
need for a new lending institution for the Middle East. Instead, the
industrialised nations should co-operate closely to help the region and the
Maghreb of North Africa, also badly hit by the effects of the Gulf war.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Trade News: Trade-distorting rules 'still holding
Indonesia back'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSIVE trade policy reforms since the mid-1980s have made Indonesia more
competitive on world markets, but a range of trade-distorting measures
remain in force, with the most difficult areas still to be tackled.
This is the broad conclusion of Gatt's first review of Indonesian trade
policy, as part of its series of country reports. It shows the extent of the
challenge facing a typical developing country opting for trade reform, but
urges it to persist, as trade is the key to its economic growth.
Indonesia began a series of trade reforms after the debt shock and the oil
price fall of the mid-1980s. Successive trade reforms since then have
reduced impediments to structural change.
But Gatt suggests the changes have been too gradual and selective,
concentrating on manufacturing activities with the least resistance to
reform. Competitive pressures led to reform being reversed in some areas.
Some industries such as steel, clothing and transportation remain sheltered
from international competition. 'A more uniform assistance structure would
reduce distortions, induce more efficient allocation of resources and help
combat inflation by making the economy more flexible.'
Many policy instruments criticised by Gatt are common to the developing
world, including import licensing and surcharges, local content
requirements, countertrade obligations and increasing curbs on exports of
unprocessed primary materials.
Indonesia's trade suffers from substantial 'tariff escalation', where
tariffs on consumer goods are on average over double those applied to
capital and intermediate goods. Import surcharges of up to 40 per cent
accentuate this problem, so that consumer goods account for less than 5 per
cent of total imports.
Gatt notes 'bound' or fixed tariff rates apply to under 10 per cent of
import items. Sometimes the bound tariff level is exceeded by imposition of
an import surcharge. But Indonesia pledges a large rise in tariff bindings,
especially on textiles in the context of the Uruguay Round.
Import surcharges to protect domestic industries from fluctuating world
prices are common, but are 'largely informal, lack public scrutiny, and have
no legal procedures available to grieved parties,' it says.
Indonesia is considering limiting all import surcharges to one year and has
announced plans to scrap about 75 per cent of them this September.
Meanwhile, Gatt says the close relations between the government and licensed
importers create uncertainty for suppliers and 'promote a system that may be
vulnerable to manipulation'.
State-trading enterprises dominate several designated strategic
manufacturing industries, such as shipbuilding, steel, aerospace, cement,
fertilisers and aluminium. Certain of these sectors are subject to local
content requirements, with rules on government procurement requiring foreign
suppliers to offer counter-purchase arrangements.
Gatt questions the curbs on Indonesia's exports of natural-resource-based
products such as logs, raw hides and cement. These depress domestic prices
by an estimated 20 per cent for logs bought by local plywood producers, and
have a similar effect to a subsidy, it adds.
'Whether Indonesia benefits in the long term from such policies depends on
its ability to develop export-competitive processing industries not
dependent on continued support through depressed input prices.'

FT  30 APR 91 / UN says Kurds heading home in their thousands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS at The UN and Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations said yesterday that Kurdish refugees who fled Iraq were
returning home at the rate of almost 20,000 a day but a lack of cash could
affect its ability to respond.
It also said it would look at the costs and logistics of taking over camps
in safe havens set up in northern Iraq by US, British, French and other
western troops.
'We were very impressed with the significant number of people who were
returning in the Sulaimaniya and Irbil regions (in northern Iraq),' Mr Bernd
Bernander, co-ordinator of a UN relief operation in Iraq, said in Baghdad.
There were indications last night that the numbers of returning Kurds were
growing after Kurdish guerrilla leaders lifted a roadblock barring their way
down the mountains from Turkey. This followed a meeting between the
guerrillas, or peshmerga, and allied military commanders who urged that
civilians should not be hindered from returning to the town of Zakho, where
a protected refugee camp has been set up.
Kurdish leaders had denied that they have a policy of preventing refugees
from leaving the mountains on the Turkish border and going to Zakho, but
acknowledged that they were still concerned about the presence of some 50
Iraqi policemen in the area.
At the United Nations last night Iraq's ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said
his government was likely to disapprove of a British proposal for a UN
police force to replace the allied troops in northern Iraq. Speaking as
Britain asked fellow members of the Security Council to back the plan, he
said that such action would be 'naked intervention'. He said a recent
agreement between Baghdad and the Kurds made the presence of foreign troops
irrelevant. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that returning Kurds
need not fear reprisal.
Britain hoped to obtain broad Security Council agreement for its plan
without the need for a formal resolution, diplomats said.
Following discussions with representatives of the US and France, which
support the initiative, Sir David Hannay, the UK ambassador to the UN,
planned to broaden the consultations to include the Soviet Union and China.
President Turgut Ozal of Turkey said it was essential for the allies to
remain in northern Iraq to give confidence to the returning Kurds.
'If the allied powers do not maintain their presence in northern Iraq, the
Iraqi Kurds will start running again as soon as they see an Iraqi soldier,'
he told the Iranian news agency.

SOUTH Africa is to raise R2bn (Pounds 455.6m) by reducing strategic
stockpiles of oil built up as a result of the international oil embargo, and
will spend the money on development programmes including projects aimed at
ending township violence, President F W de Klerk said yesterday.
However, officials said some R1bn of the total did not represent new
funding, as it had already been allocated in the 1991-92 budget announced
last month. The balance of up to R1bn might not be available for some years.
Mr de Klerk said the government must first finance energy projects to which
it was already committed, apparently including the R8bn Mossgas oil-from-gas
project, and noted that normalisation of relations with the international
community was a prerequisite for the release of further funds.
The R1bn available during the current budget year would be used to fund
projects that would further social stability, he said, noting that township
violence had hurt business confidence and put off investors.

The decision, ending years of conflict, came after a UN search for the best

the proposals, Morocco would cut its troop deployment by two thirds, to

FT  30 APR 91 / Angola struggles for a fresh start: The move to peace is
fraught with difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCRAWLED on the rusty corrugated iron walls on one of Luanda's many squalid
shanty homes is a slogan which for most people sums up the political dilemma
facing Angolans: 'MPLA Robs, Unita Kills.'
Yesterday's announcement by Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rightist rebel
Unita movement that a peace deal has been worked out with the leftist MPLA
government will be greeted with joy by the long-suffering civilians of
Angola. But it will not reduce the discontent with the two main political
forces which have shaped the country's bitter history since independence
from Portugal in 1975: the Soviet and Cuban backed MPLA which has ruled the
country with an ideological iron fist and the US backed Unita rebels, who
have waged a ruthless 16 year civil war against the government.
The peace deal, which will be initialled in Lisbon today, offers the first
real prospects for realising Angola's tremendous economic potential in oil,
diamonds and agriculture and for rehabilitating the devastated
infrastructure. But the transition to peace and democracy in what could be
one of Africa's richest countries is fraught with risk.
Sixteen years of corrupt and oppressive one party rule, inefficient central
planning and a war which has been waged indiscriminately against civilians
has cast a shadow over the credibility of both the MPLA and Unita.
'Most people in Angola want a fresh start with a third political force which
is neither the MPLA nor Unita,' said Mr Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, president
of the recently formed Angolan Civic Association. 'We want people whose
hands are not stained with blood, death and destruction and whose pockets
are not full with state money.'
The fact that such statements are now possible marks the rapid pace of
political reform since last year, when it was almost inconceivable that the
MPLA would relinquish its monopoly of political power.
Last week the MPLA Congress met to abandon Marxist-Leninism and prepare
itself for the country's first multi-party elections. But reforming Angola's
distorted economy and implementing austerity measures while campaigning for
elections in 1992 will be a trying task for the MPLA.
Social unrest and strikes are likely as public sector workers make demands
for their long-suppressed economic grievances to be addressed with the end
of the war.
Many Angolans, including some senior MPLA officials, also privately fear a
return to the anarchic violence and internecine conflict which raged through
Luanda in 1975.
Demobilisation will be difficult. Keeping the ceasefire during a process of
disarmament and integration of the estimated 150,000 government troops and
40,000 rebels into one national army will be a Herculean effort.
Opposition figures say both sides are already hiding caches of arms in
preparation for a renewal of military conflict if things go wrong.
International supervision and aid by the US and Soviet Union will help to
reduce tensions but that may not be enough.
There are serious question marks over how genuine the commitment of many
MPLA hardliners is to democracy, under which they may be forced to share or
surrender political power and the economic privileges which go with it. Few
in the MPLA believe they have any chance of winning elections.
When asked how he would sell the MPLA in an election Mr Joao Miranda,
vice-minister of information and a progressive in the party, appeared
confused.
After hesitating, he said their main electoral appeal would be that 'in
spite of foreign invasion by South Africa and the war against Unita the
Angolan nation did not disappear. It has survived because of the MPLA.'
Such an appeal is unlikely to win many votes when the huge debit side of
MPLA rule is considered. Much more likely the MPLA's chances of winning any
seats in a democratically elected parliament and in managing a peaceful
transition will depend on whether they can deliver a higher standard of
living.
So far, however, long-overdue economic reforms proposed by a new team of
technocratic ministers, including price, trade and exchange rate
liberalisation, has been obstructed by MPLA stalwarts.
Unita's chances of political success are generally rated higher than the
MPLA's but, but while there have been atrocities committed by both sides
many Angolans blame the rebels for the worst excesses of war.
Unita could also threaten national reconciliation by raising the spectre of
tribalism which has plagued Angola since Portuguese colonial rule. Ethnicity
remains a source of division and Unita has been successful in building a
movement out of the Ovimbundu people, the largest single group in Angola.
Mr Andrade, the leading opposition figure to emerge so far, says that unless
the government brings together the diverse political forces and associations
into a civic forum with real deliberative powers, like in Czechoslovakia
last year, the transition will degenerate into political conflict.
'Without a national consensus and a shared sense of responsibility for the
transition a collapse into anarchy and conflict is inevitable,' he said.
Whether the government or Unita would accept power sharing in the run up to
elections remains questionable. But clearly the measures taken so far are
merely the first steps in a difficult process of change which could easily
degenerate into killing and robbing.

THE FIRST formal Taiwanese delegation to visit the Chinese mainland in four
decades has arrived in Peking following Taiwan's National Assembly vote on
April 22 to end 43 years of emergency rule and abrogate wartime provisions
enacted in 1948 to deal with the 'suppression of the communist rebellion'.
The 14-member Taiwanese delegation, representing the recently formed Taipei
Straits Exchange Foundation, yesterday met officials from the Office of
Taiwan Affairs under China's State Council.
China has responded to the vote by Taiwanese MPs by ending propaganda
broadcasts by the People's Liberation Army to Taiwanese troops stationed on
the islands lying between Taiwan and China's Fujian province.
The way is now open for talks between Taiwan and China on direct trade and,
perhaps, on reunification. Bilateral trade has expanded rapidly but until
now it is officially supposed to have been routed through Hong Kong.
Tang Shubei, deputy director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, told the
visitors that China adhered to the one-China principle that Taiwan was an
inalienable part of China's territory.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET share of Hong Kong domestic banking loans provided by the Bank of
China and its 12 sister banks declined last year for the second year in
succession after China's Tiananmen Square crisis when there was a sudden
withdrawal of deposits.
This is believed to reflect a realisation by the Bank of China group that it
is politically vulnerable to local protests in Hong Kong and should
therefore adopt a conservative lending approach.
Its share of loans for use in Hong Kong fell from 14 per cent in 1989 to 13
per cent, compared with 16 per cent in 1988, although the total amount of
loans rose from HKDollars 88bn (Pounds 6.62bn) in 1989 to HKDollars 102bn
last year.
Total deposits with the banks also rose sharply from HKDollars 196bn in 1989
to HKDollars 254bn last year, according to the annual report of Hong Kong's
banking commissioner published yesterday. This indicates that the strength
of feeling that caused people to withdraw their money in June 1989 has
evaporated.
The number of banks registered in Hong Kong rose to 168 last year, up from
165 in 1989. Restricted banking licences, introduced in February last year,
were issued to 13 overseas banks.

AN INQUIRY into alleged corruption in Western Australia claimed its first
political victim yesterday when Mr Brian Burke, a leading figure in the
governing Australian Labor Party, resigned as ambassador to Ireland and the
Vatican.
Mr Burke, a former Labor premier of Western Australia, is a central figure
in the inquiry into the so-called 'WA Inc' affair concerning relations
between the state government and local entrepreneurs such as Mr Laurie
Connell and Mr Alan Bond. He is expected to begin giving evidence today to
the inquiry, which is being carried out by a royal commission appointed by
Western Australia's minority Labor government.
Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister, said Mr Burke's decision to resign
'was entirely his own, and not the subject of any request or direction by
the government'. However, the resignation followed Senator Evans' admission
that Mr Burke's position was under review because of concern over public
interest in Ireland and Italy in the royal commission proceedings.
Mr Burke's resignation represents a significant political victory for the
conservative opposition parties, which have campaigned for his dismissal
since the royal commission was appointed in November. Dr John Hewson, leader
of the Liberals, the main opposition party, said Mr Burke's resignation was
a recognition that he could not continue as ambassador while he remains 'the
subject of serious allegations'.
The royal commission is investigating business deals over a decade between
Labor governments led by Mr Burke and Mr Peter Dowding, and Liberal
administrations led by Sir Charles Court and Mr Ray O'Connor.
The most serious allegations, involving relationships between politicians
and leading businessmen, relate to Mr Burke's premiership between 1983 and
1988. Witnesses have given evidence that business leaders were pressed to
contribute to the campaign expenses of the Labor Party, and that secret bank
accounts and cash reserves were maintained by party leaders.
Mr Burke has repeatedly denied any impropriety. 'Not only have I been
responsible for no illegality or impropriety, I am confident the royal
commission will in the final analysis find that none of my actions even
approach impropriety,' he said.

FT  30 APR 91 / Miners expected to yield to Yeltsin

<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian leader, is expected to persuade coalminers in
the Kuzbas today to end their strike, which is already showing signs of
faltering.
Beginning a visit last night to the most militant coalfield, he told the
miners that the agreement he and other republican leaders had signed with
President Mikhail Gorbachev last week had conceded many of their political
demands.
He claimed that his call in March for Mr Gorbachev to resign had succeeded
in pulling the latter away from his alliance with hardliners. 'The President
just had to be cooled off,' the independent news agency Interfax quoted him
as telling strike leaders.
He said that the 'special regime' in mines and other strategic industries
which the agreement had proposed was designed to create favourable
conditions for increasing productivity. He stressed, however, that a
decision to end the strike was in the miners' hands.
Mr Yeltsin, with Mr Yuri Skokov, the Russian deputy prime minister, gave the
miners' leaders details of how the pits could be transferred from Soviet to
Russian jurisdiction.
Back in Moscow, his supporters took to the streets to collect the 100,000
signatures necessary for his presidency. A demonstration supporting him in
central Moscow last night attracted about 30,000 people, a small number
compared with other such rallies in recent months.
This reflected both the bad weather, and, more importantly, the deflation of
the radical movement after Mr Yeltsin's signing of the statement with Mr
Gorbachev and eight other republican leaders committing him to end strikes
and support the government's anti-crisis plan.
The congress of the Social Democratic Party, which begins today in
Leningrad, is expected to follow the Democratic Russia movement's initiative
at the weekend in endorsing Mr Yeltsin's candidacy. However, deputies to the
Russian parliament said yesterday they were seeking ways to restrain him
from acting impulsively in the future.
Two other names are now being mooted among deputies as possible contenders
for the Russian presidency on June 12. These are Mr Vadim Bakatin, the
former interior minister and now a member of Mr Gorbachev's presidential
council, who achieved a reputation as a liberal; and Mr Anatoly Sobchak,
Leningrad's popular and high-profile mayor.
Neither, however, has been approached formally and it is thought unlikely at
the moment that either could be persuaded to attempt to stop Mr Yeltsin's
bandwagon.

FT  30 APR 91 / Sweden tires of paying for social democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN IS one of the few countries that still seems to take May Day
seriously. But tomorrow, as the red flags unfurl, thousands take to the
streets and the faithful sing the Internationale, many Social Democrats must
wonder whether the party that has dominated Sweden for nearly 60 years is
not in terminal decline.
For Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, in particular, tomorrow promises
to be a bitter day. As he tries to rally the troops less than five months
before the general election, support for his Social Democrat party has
fallen to a record low of 28.7 per cent, according to a recent poll.
Among voters under the age of 30, the party has a mere 17.5 per cent
support, only two points more than the three-month-old maverick right-wing
New Democracy party. Even among blue-collar trade unionists, fewer than 40
per cent back the Social Democrats. And in the big cities the party faces
annihilation.
The collapse of support has come fast. Only three years ago 43.2 per cent
voted for them at the polls.
The party's troubles are not based on political indecisiveness or lack of
firm action. The Social Democrats have not fallen apart or drifted on to the
rocks. Indeed, the under-estimated premier, who took over after Mr Olof
Palme's assassination in February 1986, has shown patience and finesse in
establishing cross-party agreements that have taken Sweden in a more
liberalising, free market direction.
On issue after issue Mr Carlsson has been able to break through the policy
impasse. After years of talk, the tax reform was implemented, shifting the
burden from incomes on to goods and services. An earlier commitment to start
phasing out the country's nuclear reactors from 1995 threatened to devastate
industry, but Mr Carlsson achieved a compromise whereby nuclear power will
not go until a credible alternative exists.
Two other lingering issues have been resolved. Terrestrial commercial
television is coming to Sweden at last, and the much-debated road and rail
bridge is to be built over the waters of the Oresund linking Sweden with
Denmark.
Moreover, Mr Carlsson's government intends, after surprisingly little
argument, to apply for Swedish membership of the European Community this
summer.
Yet none of this has made any difference to the poll ratings. Perhaps some
voters reason that if Sweden is becoming more liberal they might as well
vote for the most liberal-oriented parties. Others are upset by what they
see as the abandonment of cherished Social Democratic commitments to social
justice and equality.
The party has also lost its reputation for competent economic management.
The so-called Third Way economic strategy of the 1980s, between the free
market and the Soviet-style command economy, has failed, with raging wage
inflation, sluggish productivity, balance of payments deficits, worsening
competitiveness, rising unemployment and stagnant living standards.
The recently published memoirs of the former finance minister, Mr Kjell-Olof
Feldt, point to another important reason for the decline of the Social
Democrats. Interest groups such as the powerful LO blue-collar union
movement have exercised too great an influence over the party, demanding
more resources for the huge welfare state, which Sweden could not afford.
Mr Carlsson can draw comfort from one thought: no coherent political
alternative exists to the Social Democrats, who remain the largest party.
The opposition is split seven ways. After the elections, Sweden may well
have a non-Socialist coalition government, but one that is not strong enough
to take the necessary tough economic decisions.

POLAND'S base interest rate will be cut tomorrow to 59 per cent from 72 per
cent. It was increased from 55 per cent in January as part of the
government's tight-money policy to combat annual inflation of 250 per cent
at the end of 1990.
The government is now expecting 55 per cent inflation this year against an
earlier forecast of 36 per cent.
The privatisation minister, Mr Janusz Lewandowski, said yesterday that the
country's next public share offer would open around May 20 with the sale of
the Swarzedz furniture factory near Poznan. Five per cent of the shares are
to be given to three former owners of workshops taken over after the war to
set up the factory.
The ministry is also expected to sign an agreement at the same time selling
51 per cent of the Polkolor television works to Thomson of France for
Dollars 35m.

FT  30 APR 91 / Finland has second thoughts on EC entry
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<TEXT>
FINLAND IS reassessing whether to apply to join the European Community, amid
signs of a collapse in the negotiations between the EC and European Free
Trade Association on the creation of a European Economic Area (EEA).
The outgoing foreign minister, Mr Pertti Paasio, a Social Democrat, said at
the weekend that Finland ought to be ready to seek EC membership. His party,
which is now the country's main opposition following last month's general
election, has not yet taken a view but is expected to line up behind the
call for a Finnish application.
The new coalition government between the Centre party and the Conservatives
is being more cautious. But in its programme, announced at the weekend, it
uses a form of words which suggests it is also ready to drop the old
resistance to the idea of Finnish membership of the EC.
It said the government would 'strive for a solution which in the best
possible way protects our national interests.'
Mr Ekso Aho, the new Centre party prime minister, said yesterday the
government still hoped for a successful outcome to the EC-Efta talks. But,
with Switzerland threatening to walk out and apply for EC membership
alongside Sweden and Austria, Finland may change its mind.

FT  30 APR 91 / Dollar hits high against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday hit its highest levels against the D-Mark in Europe for
16 months, amid signs that the world's leading nations are happy to see the
currency continue its recent rise.
Although the currency slipped in New York on profit-taking, European foreign
exchange dealers had been encouraged to buy the dollar because the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations failed to mention its persistent strength
in their final statement after a weekend meeting in Washington.
While the US failed in its short-term goal of persuading Germany to cut its
interest rates, the discussions among the finance ministers and central bank
governors of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada are
expected to lead to lower interest rates in coming months.
US officials have pressed for easier borrowing conditions worldwide, as part
of an effort to spur economic growth.
Although the dollar closed below the day's highs, it kept up the momentum
which has seen it jump by 22 per cent against the D-Mark since hitting an
all-time trading low against the Germany currency in mid-February.
The dollar's rise has been due to increasing optimism about the outlook for
the US economy, while the D-Mark has been affected by worries about the
economic cost of German re-unification.
The German currency's recent weakness has worried the Bundesbank, which
wants a strong D-Mark to constrain inflationary pressures.
Last night, the dollar closed in London at DM1.769, up more than 1 pfennig
on Friday's close. At the start of trading in Frankfurt, it was quoted at
DM1.786, its highest opening there since December, 1989. Later in New York,
it eased to close at Dollars 1.7512.
On the lack of reference to the dollar in the G7 communique, Mr Jim O'Neill,
head of financial markets research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London,
said: 'It seems that, outside Germany, no one is worried by the low D-Mark.'

FT  30 APR 91 / Economy to recover soon says Lamont: Chancellor predicts
significant strengthening of UK position as inflation falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday that economic recovery in
Britain was 'round the corner'.
The UK was making 'excellent progress' in cutting inflation, Mr Lamont told
journalists just after addressing the policy-making interim committee of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington.
'I think we are going to get inflation down to a level not so far removed
from the strongest countries in Europe within a very short period of time,'
he said. It would result in a very significant strengthening of the UK
position.
Mr Lamont said he could not be precise about the timing of the recovery,
although he thought it would be around the end of the second quarter. In the
UK, as elsewhere, lower inflation and lower interest rates would be powerful
forces for recovery. The 'key lesson of the late 1980s' was that firm
control over inflation was a condition for sustained growth.
He repeated the government's position that it would cut interest rates when
reduced inflation created the flexibility for such action.
He dismissed as 'imaginative' a Sunday newspaper report that interest rates
would be cut again next month. 'I have made no commitment on cutting rates,'
he said.
The chancellor's upbeat assessment of Britain's economic prospects came only
days before Thursday's local elections and after a period in which economic
news has been almost universally bad.
He said that in the coming months the official statistics - particularly
those for lagging indicators such as employment and investment - would
continue providing evidence of past weakness in the economy.
But he stressed the importance of distinguishing such backward looking
indicators from forward looking signs that were now emerging. These, he
said, had begun to show a marked improvement in consumer and business
confidence.
Mr Lamont admitted that unemployment would continue to rise during this
year, although the extent would depend on the level of wage settlements and
on the effectiveness of the government's labour market reforms. He said that
such reforms could have made the labour market more flexible and there were
indications that wage increases might be moderating.
The chancellor's comments follow the optimism expressed recently by Mr John
Major about an economic recovery on the horizon - although even some
Conservative MPs at Westminster are not yet convinced.
The steep rises in unemployment are increasingly dominating clashes between
the main parties at Westminster, with the government's handling of the
economy high on the political agenda.
Last night, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said:
'Far from turning the corner, all the evidence is that unemployment will
rise fast during spring and the summer, that manufacturing investment will
fall by 17 per cent this year and our industrial capacity is now being
eroded in the run up to 1992.'
Mr Lamont, addressing the IMF committee on trade issues, said that removing
barriers had a vital part to play in giving the world a non-inflationary
boost. A resumption of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks was 'vital' and it was 'particularly important' that
there should be less protection of agriculture in the European Community and
elsewhere.
He also called on the world's industrialised nations to apply existing rules
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and to operate
export credit schemes on an unsubsidised basis.
The provision of export credit that could not be fully repaid had involved a
large sacrifice by taxpayers in creditor countries, the chancellor said. It
constituted a form of government interference in free trade that was
damaging to growth and efficiency in developed and developing countries
alike.
Mr Lamont said the UK would charge higher premiums for taking on risk and be
more cautious about extending guarantees. He hoped other countries would do
the same.

FT  30 APR 91 / G7 divided by debt relief issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to find agreement among the Group of Seven industrialised countries
at their Washington meeting over the limiting of official debt forgiveness
have failed.
As a result, the customary reference to the international debt strategy was
absent from Sunday's G7 communique.
Debate on the issue followed agreement by the Paris Club of creditor
governments to write off at least 50 per cent of Poland's official debts. A
similar deal is expected to be agreed for Egypt.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, said yesterday that he had
'categorically refused' to agree to a proposed statement on international
debt. The statement would have attempted to 'ring fence' the Polish and
Egyptian debts settlements.
Forgiveness of government-to-government debt had previously only been
available to the poorest countries, mainly in Africa. Poland and Egypt are
both defined as lower middle-income debtors.
Mr Beregovoy agreed that there should be no generalised debt forgiveness,
but said that there were other lower middle-income countries - particularly
those African countries aiming for more democracy - which might deserve such
treatment on a case-by-case basis.
French officials are thought to have four countries particularly in mind:
Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Senegal and Gabon.
Governments of some industrialised countries, in particular Japan, fear that
debt forgiveness for Poland might create an awkward precedent.
Japanese officials have said that states obtaining debt relief from Japan
will find it hard to get new loans from their government.
The US, which has pressed for debt relief for both Poland and Egypt, has
distinguished the two as deserving cases by pointing out that they are
burdened by the highest level of official debt per capita of any of the
developing countries.
The issue of further official debt forgiveness is unlikely to go away.
Britain and others are pressing for deeper and more sustained alleviation
for the poorest countries, mainly in Africa.
The so-called Trinidad Terms suggested last autumn by Mr John Major, the
prime minister and former chancellor, would relieve up to two-thirds of the
debts of the poorest countries.
This proposal is expected to be backed by a meeting today of the Development
Committee, the joint group of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
which is concerned with development issues.
The UK government would like to have agreement on the Trinidad Terms to
announce in time for the London economic summit in July.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (15): Services open up an undesirable
world - Communications: doubts about controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING has struck home as vividly to some people in Singapore as
theoften-told tale of traders who sold US dollars immediately after watching
on Cable News Network the faces of Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State and
Mr TariqAziz, Iraq's then foreign minister, after failure to resolve the
Gulf crisis. Singapore bankers and businessmen, on the other hand, bought US
dollars and were left 'holding the baby', as one observer put it.
The difference in reactions was that the sellers could see and size up
instantly what was happening based on real time information.
The difference from hearing of the event minutes later on the radio could
mean millions of dollars lost.
This fact was noted by those promoting Singapore as a leading foreign
exchange and financial futures centre, one whose traders require up-to-date
news.
The fast pace of technology is forcing Asian governments to re-think their
control over whatis seen by their populace. Most are wary of the unsettling
effect of undesirable western influences portrayed on entertainment
programmes and films.
However, control is becoming increasingly moot when technology can make
receivers small enough to fit into a suitcase.
In deciding to open up to more instant and global communications, Singapore
acknowledges that rapid advances in broadcast technology will force the
examination of its policies on trans-boundary broadcasting and cable
television.
The republic boasts many world firsts in introducing the latest in
telecommunications but has lagged in the areas of privately-installed
satellite dishes, cable and global television. By contrast, satellite dishes
are operating in Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines.
The acting minister for information and the arts (Mita) Mr George Yeosaid:
'One day it may not be possible for the government to regulate but, for as
long as it is possible . . . let's have some controls in place.'
The t rade-off was that, for the controls to work, there had to be more
choices for the public. Hence, the scheme to introduce two or three more
ultra high frequencytelevision channels within a year, later moving on to
microwave and cable.
Many will be pay channels charged on a subscription basis to meet the needs
ofspecific segments of the community. An arrangement may be negotiated with
the BBC's World Service TV.
Mita's reckoning of 10 to 15 years before regulations against household
satellite dishes become impractical is too long, argued outspoken government
MP, Mr Lim Boon Heng.
He believes that global television must come soon because 'if we aim to be a
global city. Is it to be soon or in 10 to 15 years' time?'
In response to repeated lobbying by the financial community for access to
CNN and other foreign news stations, the government will be issuing
temporary licences of SDollars 1,000 to financial institutions and
government bodies to operate satellite television receive-only dishes to get
live newsbroadcasts.
All institutions, except hotels and households, can now applyfor annual
satellite dish licences from May 1. However, the strait-laced thinking
persists in the barring of households in case 'one day, someone were to put
up a pornographic channel and all Singaporeans are able to receive it. Is it
good or not good for us?' Mr Yeo explained.
However, it is not good enough to just get on-line real time
market-sensitive information, there has to be an accompanying liberalisation
of censorship of news and entertainment programmes.
The long awaited film classification system begins on July 1 with a
restricted category barring viewers under 18 years old and X-rated films
that are banned. Censorship rules for publications and performances will be
reviewed.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, prime minister, set up Mita to help inform, educate and
entertain as part of Singapore's goal; to make the republic a hub city of
the world; and to build an economically dynamic, socially-cohesive, and
culturally-vibrant society.
He wants to pay more attention to public and media relations to better
explain public policies at home and abroad. This and the relaxation of
censorship acknowledges the growing sophistication of a people who travelled
widely and often enough to know what the West offers.
As for the communications infrastructure, the business-like nation has
strived to make it easy for multinationals to do business in Singapore.
'We have no natural resources. To make a living, we have to find a market
for our goods and services. They have to beof quality and at competitive
prices. To do that, we need a good communicationsinfrastructure. Whether you
are a manufacturer, trader or forex dealer, you need good communication
links to compete worldwide,' said Mr Tan Guong Ching, permanent secretary at
the communications ministry.
Singapore has invested heavily in its communications infrastructure and
stressed excellent service. To maintain its advances in communications, it
is building a third air terminal, reclaiming land for a fourth terminal and
third runway; building a new container portat Pulau Brani; and participating
in an Asean all-optical fibre cable network.
Singapore was the first to offer nationwide Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) where a Group 4 fax machines sends messages five times faster
at costs lowered by as much as 80 per cent. Telephone rates are constantly
being lowered, by as much as 40 per cent to some countries; Singapore has
the highest ratio of IDD calls, the most advanced photo-videotex service,
the largest number ofpagers and cellular phones per capita.
When floated next year, Singapore Telecom will be the largest local company,
with a market capitalisation of SDollars 10bn. It grew to become highly
profitable by offering the latest innovations, competitive rates, and good
services. Like Singapore Airlines, it has learnt that instead of shutting
out the world, it can offer its services anywhere, and be a world beater.

Tourism: in a good position to play the role of an usher
</HEADLINE>

SINGAPORE is facing the challenges posed by some of its neighbours in the
tourism industry in an unusual way.
It has developed a two-pronged response to the challenge of regional and
global tourism. It aims to consolidate and further strengthen its own
tourism product while playing its part to market the broader attractions of
its Asean neighbours. The authorities believe this to be in the interests of
the region.
The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board's (STPB) stance is that the true
tourism competition comes not from its neighbours but from other regions of
the world, particularly well-established tourist destinations such as the
Caribbean or the Mediterranean.
The mood of Asean being currently co-operative, the answer comes as no
surprise. The concept of marketing the region as an alternative to the
Caribbean or the Mediterranean has merit.
The appeal of Asean as a region is much greater than any single country. And
yet, diversity is available in a compact geographical area where tourism
infrastructure and ease of air access have improved immensely over the past
five years.
So the city-state does not apply the traditional definition of competition
to its neighbours. Instead, co-operation in developing the region's tourism
potential is at the core of the STPB's tourism strategy - part of its
marketing effort is to assist visitors to Singapore to explore the
attractions of neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia to further vary their
experiences.
Together with its Asean neighbours, the republic is promoting the region's
multifarious attractions through several Visit Asean Year 1992 campaigns.
Economic co-operation is evident in the Growth Triangle where multinationals
in Singapore unwilling to upgrade and automate in the light of higher wages
are steered to Johor, Malaysia, and the Riau islands of Indonesia, whichhave
lower land and labour costs.
Singapore benefits by offering its marketing, management and financial
expertise. The idea of multilateral co-operation was mooted on the basis
that Singapore prospers with, rather than at the expense of, its neighbours.
The republic is in an excellent position to play usher. Last year, visitors
to Malaysia doubled from 3.7m in 1989 to 7m arrivals, of which 65 per cent
came through Singapore.
The republic enjoyed a 20 per cent increase in earnings in 1990 to SDollars
7.6bn or 6 per cent of its gross domestic product. Though he disagrees with
the Caribbean comparison, Johor's chief minister, Mr Tan Sri Muhyiddin
expects more tourism for the Growth Triangle. He is assuming the opening up
of a market in cash-rich vistors from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea on the
back of their strong economies. Based on this assumption, thetriangle
partners are forecasting 22.5m visitors yielding some Dollars 22bn in 1992.
The Asean Tourism Information Centre's preliminary 1990 report on the
industry concluded that the region will continue to be its own best tourism
market as the importance of intra-Asean travel grows and the regional
economies strengthen.
In 1989, the five Asean countries, excluding Brunei, earned Dollars 10.2bn
in tourism with 36.8 per cent of the 16.4m arrivals being intra-Asean
travel. Asean nations experienced 15-30 per cent growth in arrivals in 1990,
which recordedmore than 17m visitors.
Singapore was not spared the sharp worldwide drop in tourist arrivals during
the Gulf War.
Hotel occupancy rates sank as low as 30 per cent before recovering back to
the 70 per cent levels. Special discounts are being offered for the next few
months to attract local and foreign custom.
Even the finance minister, during his budget speech in March, gave some help
to the hotels, restaurants and tourist-related shops adversely affected by
the Gulf War's secondary effects. He reduced the tourism excess rate from
4to 3 per cent for a year to tide them over their difficulties. The STPB
expectsthe industry to pick up soon while others forecast recovery around
the year-end.
Meanwhile, Singapore continues to invest in developing its own tourism
infrastructure and attractions. The Dollars 578m tourism development plan
nearing fruition sees a new generation of tourism attractions coming
onstream.
The heritage attractions include some of the island's oldest buildings
restored to their former glory, such as Raffles Hotel of Somerset Maugham
fame and Alkaff Mansion, a grand getaway house on a hill formerly owned by a
pioneer.
The conservation efforts, which also include Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar,
have played a prominent role as part of urban redevelopment plan in the late
1980s and 1990, the tourism industry having been instrumental in preserving
important parts of Singapore's heritage.
New theme parks such as Haw Par Villa's combination of high-tech heaven and
Chinese-style hell, and the Underwater World at Sentosa, widen fun options.
At the infrastructural level, new resort hotels on Sentosa island diversify
the range of accommodations available in the Lion City. The completion of
the Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre at Suntec City,
a project sponsored by the Who's Who of Hong Kong's business moguls, adds to
the industry's capabilities and underscore Singapore's position as Asia's
leading convention city.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (11): Civil work increases thrust -
Aerospace: mixed forecasts for 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 50 of the world's leading aerospace groups can be found in
Singapore.
Companies such as France's Aerospatiale are competing alongside GE Aviation
Services, Sunstrand, and United Technologies for a piece of the Asia-Pacific
action, a market expected to provide the most business in the next 20 years.
The industry in Singapore is projected to hit the SDollars 2bn mark by 1995
after expanding20 per cent to SDollars 1.2bn last year. However, there are
mixed forecasts for 1991.
The Economic Development Board, which garners investments for Singapore,
attributed the 1990 performance (which does not include military production)
of the aerospace industry to the continued strong performance in commercial
and civilian production, and to support services. However, it added that
competition from aerospace industries in the region, such as Aerospatiale's
planned regionalaircraft-servicing centre in Thailand, is expected to slow
growth this year.
Aerospatiale's policy to increase co-operation wherever local authorities
agree has led to, or the consideration of, ventures in Singapore, Malaysia,
and north-east Asia. The European consortium sees opportunities in the
Asia-Pacific region from the expected continuation of the strong Asean
economic growth, and the smaller decreases in Asian military spending in
contrast to the West. Its focus, following industry trends, will be more
towards civilian work.
The French-based Airbus Industrie forecasts that in the next 20 years, there
will be ademand for more than 10,000 aircraft. It says it will get a minimum
30 per centmarket share; and that Asia-Pacific airlines will become the main
customers, placing orders for 6 out of every 10 planes as greater traffic
flows into the region help it to register the high growth rates. Airbus
should know - its new orders are entirely from Asia from clients such as
Cathay Pacific and Malaysian Airlines.
It adds that, for the first time in history, Asia-Pacific airlines,not
European or US carriers, will have enough clout to become the main thrust
for a completely new commercial aircraft type, more likely to be wide-bodied
and capable of carrying 600-800 passengers for long hauls.
Such forecasts could not have come at a better time for Singapore, which
aspires to become a leading component centre for multinationals, a service
support centre for American and European aerospace and aircraft-related
companies and a leading manufacturing and business centre for
aviation-related activities.
Less than 15 companies are certified by the Federal Aviation Authority to
carry out third party Section 41 modifications. Two are from Singapore
Airlines and Singapore Aerospace (SAe). Such work, one of the
fastest-growing activities as more stringent safety requirements are set, is
on the area from a jet's nose to the edge of the tubularsection.
SAe has a competitive advantage over most rivals with its quality work (90
per cent of its 2,000 staff are skilled) and fast turnaround time of31 days
to carry out Section 41 repairs against Hong Kong-based Haeco's 36 days. The
lack of hangars large enough to accommodate 747s prevents SAe accepting more
orders. This is a problem that will be resolved by next year when a double
bay hangar is completed. Turnover has risen 17 per cent above its projected
SDollars 200mfor last year, lifting operating profit 33 per cent higher than
1989 to SDollars 18.6m.
SAe agrees with an ICAO forecast that passenger traffic and cargo will rise
in the Asia-Pacific region to outstrip Europe.
Singapore is too small a country to design, manufacture and sell its own
aircraft but it does development work on prototypes. Using its skills honed
over the past 15 years, it has a 16 per cent stake in a SDollars 305m
tripartite venture to build and market a light five-seater helicopter for
the Asia-Pacific region called the P120L.
Its partners are Aerospatiale (54 per cent) and the China National
Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (Catic), with 30 per cent. New
composite materials will be used for the body of the plane, seen as a
successor to the Gazelleand Lama and complementing the Ecureuil.
The P120L prototype will be ready in 1996, with 1,500 to 1,800 units being
produced over 10 years. SAe is involved in the conceptual phase, the making
of the prototype, producing certain parts, and marketing, while production
will be carried out in China, which is expected to be one of the biggest
markets with a shopping list for 200 helicopters.
SAe has long had a joint venture with Aerospatiale in Samaero, which is
responsible for its helicopters flying in Asia.
The company will continue its thrust into the commercial wide-bodied
aircraft maintenance market with its new facility in Alabama, US, and joint
ventures in the UK and Ireland.
Defence-related work, mostly from its mainstay, the republic's air force,
will stillbe important, but SAe's increasing commercial activities
(comprising 30 per cent of the business) is expected to fuel growth. Its
customers include the US forces, Kuwait Airways and the Nigerian Air Force.
Sembawang, another state-controlled company, is looking at aviation as the
next core business to diversify from its main shipbuilding and repairing
business so as not to have its earningscycle dictated by the fortunes of
primarily one industry.
Sembawang is in a joint venture with Catic, using its marketing and sales
capability to sell Chinese aircraft in the Asia-Pacific. Catic produces a
competitive aircraft - the Y12, which was certified by the British Civil
Aviation Authority. Sembawang's other aviation joint ventures are in
Sembawang Hainan Airline Tour and Aviation Services, and Harbin Aircraft
Manufacturing.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (12): Airport lounge with designs on the
future - Airtropolis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS Airtropolisan ambitious name for an airport? The much-lauded Singapore
Changi International airport, which has become a tourist spot, calls for
something special.
Changi International has been named the world's best airport so many times
that, in the month before the second terminal or T2 started operations last
November, more than 100,000 people paid to tour the SDollars 650m wonder.
'The word Airtropolis, with a futuristic feel, is one that connotes a very
special and exciting place where things happen,' explained Mr Lim Hock San,
director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.
The two terminals offer the traveller so many services and facilities that a
mini-city has emerged.
It is design, innovation, and state-of-the-art technology providing speed,
efficiency and service to cater to the traveller's every need.
Its aim is to allowpassengers to clear immigration, collect their baggage
and pass through customsin 20 minutes.
Those in transit can use the Changi Skytrain, the first high speed automated
passenger transit system outside the US, which connects the two terminals
and offers 100 shops, 75 dayrooms, 20 restaurants, business centre, and
medical centre.
T2 has improved on its predecessor's attractions - from fitness centre, the
first in an Asia-Pacific airport, to a multi-purpose hall, valet parking and
air-conditioned taxi stand.
The secret of Airtropolis is that it was designed with the family in mind.
Bored youngsters can use the playroom or Science Discovery Corner while
mothers relax at the beauty salon and fathers at the lounge.
Business executives can hold conferences or even meet local clients without
leaving the terminal.
The main complaint about T2 is its size - it is too large, necessitating
some walking. However, more space was incorporated into its design. Although
it handles the same number of passengers, T2 has 30 per cent more space,
some luggage retrieval belts are longer to accommodate baggage from future
larger aircraft - its gatehold rooms hold 500, not 300 passengers.
The ambience exudes the feeling of space with high ceilings terraced to
filter daylight, and glass abounding where possible. Light, warm colours,
omnipresent tropical plants and waterfalls banish the sterile,cold look of
many airports.
T1 was designed to comfortably cope with 10mpassengers with Asia-Pacific's
largest passenger handling capacity. It is host to 52 airlines flying to 111
cities in 53 countries.
In 1990 there was a 10.5 per cent growth in passengers to 15.6m. passenger
handling capacity increased to 24m with the opening of T2, to 36m with T3 by
the turn of the century and to 50m with T4.
Changi is not resting on its laurels. T1 will undergo a SDollars 121m
upgrading to match T2 and cope with a forecast 20m passengers in 1995.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (10): Heavy dependence on export markets
 -Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE'S exports rose 9.3 per cent last year to SDollars 95.2bn. At this
level they were nearly half as much again as gross national product,
underlining the country's heavy dependence on itsforeign trade.
Just under half this total constituted non-oil domestic exports which rose
by 8.5 per cent compared with 10 per cent in 1989.
Consu mer electronics sales grew more slowly, partly due to the relocation
of production to cheaper centres in the region, but sales of computer disk
drives rose by 31 per cent to SDollars 7.2bn.
Domestic exports of oil grew 30 per cent to SDollars 17.1bn as a result of
rising prices and increased volumes passing through local refineries
following the onset of the Gulf crisis.
Re-exports of traditionalcommodities including rubber, copper and plywood
fell sharply although there was an increase in re-exports of non-traditional
goods such as colour television sets and integrated circuits which suggests
that Singapore remains a trade conduit for production relocated elsewhere in
the region.
Main export markets last year were the US, European Community, Malaysia and
Japan with the US taking the largest share at SDollars 20.2bn.
Officials at Singapore's Trade DevelopmentBoard say the country's heavy
dependence on exports means it attaches considerable importance to the
successful completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateraltrade
negotiations.
According to Mr David Chin, TDB Director, Singapore's concerns are
threefold. It wants to improve access for its products on foreignmarkets,
foster liberalisation of service industries which now account for
three-quarters of its economic growth, and strengthen the rules of the
system which provides opportunities for foreigners to harass Singapore
industry with the launch of trade-diverting anti-dumping and countervailing
duty actions.
In spite of the record exports, Singapore's overall trade deficit still rose
SDollars 4.9bn to SDollars 14.6bn in 1990. A strong performance on the
invisibles account left the current account balance of payments in surplus
by SDollars 4.3bn (compared with SDollars 5.0bn in1989).
Published foreign exchange reserves, generally thought to be an
understatement of the government's true holdings, rose by SDollars 9.9bn to
SDollars 48.5bn.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (9): Shortage of labour poses problems
for the planners - Industrial development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE technocrats who run Singapore tend to wince at the merest suggestion
that theirs is a planned economy. But they do admit to worrying intensely
about the future.
When Singapore became independent in 1965, per capita gross national product
was just Dollars 600. The government had to become involved in building up
industry simply to create jobs in what had hitherto been largely a trading
economy.
The government is still heavily involved, when per capita GNP has risen to
Dollars 12,000, the second highest in Asia after Japan. Singapore's
industrialand commercial development is inspired by planners, who manage to
exude simultaneously a belief in the magic of the market and in what Mr
Richard Hu, finance minister, calls 'pointing the economy' in the right
direction.
The direction chosen for the 1990's involves a rapid move away from labour
intensive manufacturing into high-technology industry. Equally important is
the provision of world-class telecommunications, financial and transport
services so that the country can remain a beach-head for multinational
companies operating in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aim is to respond to what is increasingly seen as Singapore's
over-riding problem - a shortage of labour which helped push average monthly
earnings up by 9.4 per cent last year. This is a rate which, if
sustained,could rapidly erode Singapore's competitive edge.
The government is reluctant to offset the labour shortage by stepping up
permits for low-paid foreign workers. Instead its approach has four main
strands which dominate its thinking on future economic development. These
are:
The transfer of labour intensive manufacturing abroad, a process which is
being encouraged both through tax breaks and the official promotion by
Singapore of duty free industrial facilities in the neighbouring Indonesian
island of Batam.
The development of up-market niche industries, for example in
bio-technology.
The development of the service sector to make Singapore even more attractive
as a regional headquartersfor multinationals. Here the emphasis is not only
on infrastructure but also ona secure and professional regulatory
environment.
A push to maximise the use of high-technology in raising productivity and
improving the infrastructure. This involves forcing both educational
standards and research and development. It is an important ingredient in the
marketing of Singapore as a services centre. With more than 13,500 km of
optical fibres installed in a country about the size of the Isle of Wight,
Singapore is one of the most densely wired cities in the world.
Western leaders, used to trotting out an endless litany of apologies for the
level of unemployment in their countries, would probably give theirback
teeth for Singapore's problems.
Yet, the labour shortage is a real constraint. Success in dealing with it
while preserving real growth in living standards is by no means assured.
On paper the proposed tripartite collaboration known as the 'golden
triangle' makes a lot of sense. It is designed to spread labour-intensive
manufacturing into the bordering Malaysian state of Johorand Indonesia's
Batam Island while still permitting the use of Singaporean infrastructure in
the form of its port and telecommunications.
However, wagesare already rising in Johor and, apart from a rudimentary road
system, Batam has almost no infrastructure of its own.
Sumitomo Electric Industries is producing wire harnesses for Toyota cars
there, and Thomson Consumer Electronics is making parts for television sets
and video recorders, but by Singapore standards they are very low-tech
operations.
It remains to be seen when and whether Batamindo, the Singapore/Indonesian
venture promoting the main industrial park on the island will reach the
critical mass needed to tempt a broad range of multinational investors and
make a real dent in Singapore's labour shortage.
Even though the manufacturing sector accounts for barely a quarter of
Singapore's annual economic growth (compared with a share of 40 per cent for
financial and business services) Singaporean officials say the economy needs
a domestic manufacturing base.
Yet domestic manufacturing remains heavily biased towards electronics.
Though growing rapidly, the newer products such as pharmaceuticals which
Singapore is now pushing, still constitute only a tiny part of industrial
output.
Moreover, Singapore is heavily dependent on overseas capital.
Foreign inflows accounted for 89 per cent of last year's total of SDollars
2.5bnmanufacturing investment last year, and of that, the US accounted for
SDollars 1.1bn.
There is a growing awareness that Singapore needs to offset this dependency
by persuading its own indigenous companies to develop closer economic ties
within the region.
With its current account balance of payments surplus, Singapore can readily
afford to become a sizeable foreign investor in its own right, but with much
of its surplus cash effectively controlled by the government, there are
formidable obstacles in the way.
Not only does Singapore have totread carefully to avoid offending its less
affluent neighbours. The direct andindirect involvement of the government in
much of domestic industry makes expansion abroad harder.
Ideally the government should now stand back and let business get on with
it. Senior ministers and officials say it intends to do so increasingly, but
this will be a delicate task as, taken to its logical conclusion, it would
involve a considerable dilution of power in Singapore's fundamentally
authoritarian society.
The methodical way in which the government has programmed and regulated the
economy has discouraged local entrepreneurs and made for a business
community that appears strangely risk averse. Unlike Hong Kong,Singapore
cannot boast the buccaneering spirit of a Shanghainese emigre community. Its
home-grown tycoons are few and far between.
The strongest enterprise culture resides in the foreign multinationals and,
paradoxically, in the government, and that is not necessarily about to
change.
'If you want to set up a Dollars 2 company and turn a fast buck, you proably
want to set up in Hong Kong rather than here,' says Mr Lee Hsien Loong,
trade and industry minister.
Government companies, he adds, 'give their competitors quite a run for their
money.' The country's future success will depend in no small measure on the
ability of its civil servants and planners to continue their astonishing
record for picking and promoting winners.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (8): The gloom lifts but a sense of
fragility remains - The government is signalling economic optimism; Peter
Montagnon assesses the mood and looks at trade and industry (below)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE country's economy is proving considerably more resilient than expected
at the start of the year.
With confidence ebbing as hostilities loomed in the Gulf, the general
opinion among stockbrokers as recently as January was that Singapore could
be heading for a recession as deep and painful as that of 1985.
The government had lowered its sights to a forecast of between 3 and 6 per
cent growth in 1991, well down on the 8.3 per cent recorded last year and a
sharp break with cracking pace of the late 1980s.
Now, as early indications come in of a buoyant start, the gloom is lifting,
although there remains an acute sense of vulnerability to outside factors
and worry aboutthe impact of Singapore's pressing labour shortage.
'We haven't revisedour forecast, but we are confident that we'll make the
top end, probably a little bit more,' says Mr Lee Hsien Loong, trade and
industry minister.
Singa pore could sustain a growth rate of about 6 per cent without
overheating, he adds. Productivity is growing at about 4 per cent and it
would require an increaseof only some 2 per cent in the workforce.
Confirmation that the year gotoff to a better than expected start came in
late March with the release of trade figures for January showing a record
volume of imports and exports amounting to SDollars 20bn in that month
alone.
A particularly strong regional component tothis trade suggested that Asian
economic confidence had been less affected by the Gulf hostilities than many
assumed.
By then, however, the government had also signalled a degree of economic
sanguinity with its refusal to be panicked into reflationary action in this
year's budget.
Though Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, announced a 15.4 per cent rise to
SDollars 15.8bn for government spending in the coming fiscal year, he still
allowed for an overall surplus of SDollars 3.5bn (compared with SDollars
5.3bn an expected in 1990-91).
To the chagrin of executives he also announced a 1 percentage point increase
in employers' contributions to the mandatory Central Provident Fund,
bringing the rate to 17.5 per cent from July this year.
Admittedly the increase was partially offset by an 0.5 point reduction to
22.5 per cent in the rate paid by employees and is in linewith long-term
plans to stabilise the contributions paid by both sides at 20 per cent of
salary.
Yet the readiness to increase employers' costs suggested that the government
was not particularly worried about weakness in the local economy.
In fact inflation is, if anything, a greater concern than maintaining
economic growth. The consumer price index rose by 4 per cent in the year to
February, the highest rate recorded since 1984 and well up on the 3.4 per
centrecorded for 1990 as a whole.
'Our key problem is manpower,' says Mr Hu. In spite of the addition of a
further 60,000 people to a workforce of some 1.3m last year, labour is short
and wages are rising inexorably. A real 6.4 per cent increase in 1990, the
gain outstripped productivity growth of 3.4 per cent.
As a result unit labour costs grew and Singapore's competitive edge eroded
compared with the other newly industrialising economies in the region such
as Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.
The decline in relative manufacturingcompetitiveness has not yet reached the
extreme which helped spark the 1985 recession, but Mr Hu says the government
will be watching the pace of wage increases particularly closely for signs
of overheating.
If this does emerge, hebelieves the most sensible response would be to take
more steps to encourage Singaporean companies to shift their low-technology,
labour intensive manufacturing activities offshore.
Such a policy is medium term in its impact and most brokers believe the
authorities' immediate reaction would be to engineer a classic Singaporean
squeeze, involving higher interest rates and a rising currency.
Three month-interbank rates were allowed to rise sharply as the economy
surged ahead in the early part of last year. They peaked at 8.1 per cent in
May before slipping back to close the year at 4.9 per cent. By late March
they were still hovering slightly below this level.
Some brokers believe that a revival of confidence following the coalition
victory in the Gulf, might prompt a return to higher money market rates with
bank best lending rates, currently averaging 7.69 per cent, rising in
tandem. Such a course would, however, require the authorities to exercise
careful management, as the economy is still widely seen as vulnerable.
By far the biggest contribution to Singapore's economic growth last year
came from the financial and business services sector. Thanks partly to a
strong stock market for the first eight months, this grew by 15 per
centcompared with 9.5 per cent for manufacturing and more modest growth in
tourism,construction and transport.
One pointer towards a further slowdown in growth this year is that the
financial sector is unlikely to repeat last year's performance.
Though the stock market has recovered from its summer slump, it is unlikely
to see a repeat of last year's record SDollars 3.5bn in new issues in 1991.
Bankers say lower stock market volume is also helping keep loan demand at
local banks relatively weak.
If that means the financial services sector cannot repeat erformance, then
manufacturing's main problem is that an 'overdependence on the US,'
according to Mr Kevin Scully, head of Research at Schroder Securities.
US direct investment in Singapore amounted to SDollars 1.1bn last year,or 42
per cent of total inflows.
A special feature in the latest 1990 Economic Survey of Singapore, published
by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, shows that the share of direct
exports by manufacturing companies going to the US doubled to 41 per cent
between 1980 and 1988.
Mr Scully says the dependency is even concentrated in one single product -
computer disk drives, Singapore's largest single export item.
The local economy thus remains highly vulnerable to developments in the US,
whose own economic outlook is still murky even though the recession there
has turned out milder than many expected.
For a ll these reasons, no one expects Singapore to return to the high
growth days ofthe late 1980s.
With a bit of luck and good management, Singapore may just manage a
soft-landing towards a sustainable growth rate of about 6 per cent, but
there is still the prospect of some pretty heavy squalls along the way.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (7): A revolution in the wings - Simex:
faces tough choice over financial futures trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMEX, the little financial futures exchange has weathered obstacles and
dire predictions of failure to survive six tough years. However, 1991may
prove to be its watershed year.
For the first time since the heady days of exponential growth, the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange last year failed to improve on annual
volume. For the last time, it will have to choose - to join Globex, a force
that may change financial futures trading, or risk being left out of the
revolution.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was Simex's partner in pioneering the
world's first mutual offset trading system. As the first step to 24-hour
trading, it allows a trade opened on one exchange to be closed on the other
and be treated as a single transaction. It aids CME to have its products
traded in the Asian time zone and elsewhere, and allowsSimex to tap into the
CME's large liquidity.
All this may change if Simex chooses not to join Globex, the screen-based
electronic dealing system co-founded by CME and Reuters which matches
futures orders around the world, around theclock. It furthers the CME's aim
to deliver its products in the Asian time zonegeographically and during the
proper time of day and is expected to operate outside the CME's trading
hours.
Any money manager or trader with a telephone line can use the system to
transact futures contracts in currencies at any time. Globex's 24-hour
global reach, with quotes on an estimated 250,000 screens worldwide, and
swift execution of trades, may make the CME-Simex mutual-offset moot.
'Once Globex goes into operation, you may not need the mutual offset
system,' says Mr John Gelderman, CME chairman. If Simex opts to join Globex,
CME still has a problem juggling its membership in both systems.
Simex is sanguine about Globex. 'With technology, the whole trading system
may be different - there could be a mix of automated trading and open outcry
(where buyers and sellers trade in person with shouting and hand signals). I
don't think you could launch a new contract with automated trading,' says Mr
Francis Yeo, its chairman.
Of the four contracts under mutual-offset, the CME says the
Eurodollarinterest contract has worked well, but not currency futures
contracts in yen, D-Marks, and sterling. Mutual offset trades have dropped
to 10,000 contracts a day, some 25 per cent of Simex's overall volume,
against 35 per cent in earlier years.
Meanwhile, Simex has other worries such as trading volume falling for the
first time since futures trading started in 1984. The 5.72m contracts
recorded in 1990 was 8.8 per cent lower than 1989's 6.37m contracts, a
victim of lower price volatility in the first half-year.
'The falling volume was a global phenomenon,' notes Mr Yeo, who points to a
9.1 per cent jump in the first quarter of 1991 of 1.4m contracts against
1.3m in 1990.
The lift in trading was due to extended trading hours from the end of
January after the Gulf War bombing began. This move was made to capture the
European business, one of Simex's targets, and it appears to have succeeded.
An extra 30 to 70 minutes of trading between January 28 and March 2 raised
trading volume by one-third, Theincrease came from contracts in Eurodollar
and Euroyen interest rates and High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO), which account
for some 87 per cent of Simex's volume.
Europe interests Simex because the market still has a lot of scope to be
tapped and it will be the cause of more financial products with European
demand. The exchange introduced a 3-month interest rate futures Euromark
contract, its second in D-Mark, and identical to the one offered by the
London International Financial Futures Exchange.
On the plus side for Simex are an increase in its global share in trading
volume. 'Its Eurodollar dollar futures accounts for 8.8 per cent of the
world volume against 2.9 per cent in 1985,' says Mr Yeo.
The exchange will introduce contracts to diversify and to compensate for its
less popular products. Currency contracts did not become Simex core products
because of a very efficient cash market; the moribund gold contract stayed
that way as the loco-London market was very efficient and quite entrenched;
the Dubaicrude contract did not take off due to fear of volatility and
because liquidityhad not been fully developed, particularly as it was the
first cash-settled energy contract in Asia Pacific.
New contracts to augment its successful High Sulphur Fuel Oil contract are
most likely in gas oil and Brent crude. In the pipeline are long-term
interest rate contracts, 10-year bonds, US Treasury bonds. In the
longer-term, an Asean stock market index futures contract.
The local stockmarket index is a non-starter until all outstanding matters
have been resolved. The main challenge to Simex will be the application of
technology to futures trading which will change trading globally.
Globally, most exchanges are successful in domestic contracts but in
Singapore's case, Simex had to take a quantum leap because the domestic
market was small.
However, it has the advantage of being an international financial centre, an
Asian-dollar base, and the CME link-up.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (6): Indicators that point all ways -
Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK

THE pent-up demand caused byfears during the Gulf War crisis erupted, in the
case of The Waterside condominium project, with 100 eager homebuyers and
speculators camping overnight outsidethe sales office.
Within nine hours, the more fortunate of the 400 people who turned up to buy
the 168 apartments, had snapped up 93 per cent of the units worth up to
SDollars 1.1m.
Within days, some were being advertised at a 32 per cent mark-up. However,
that scenario was not repeated for the office, retail, hotel and factory
sectors. Only the supply of quality warehouse space has been tight in the
past few years due to a lack of development.
Office rents rose 35 per cent in the first 9 months of 1990, stabilised, and
then fell; retail rents along the main Orchard Road shopping belt dived
during the Gulf crisis before levelling off and pulling upwards and no one
is building hotels.
In spite of The Waterside's success, property experts generally agree on
several trends: rental periods will be of longer duration; rents and prices
for all sectors are going down; and buildings are going to be decentralised.
Several crucial factors impact the property sector: the supply coming
onstream, the projected slowdown in the economy, government plans to make
landed property more affordable to Singaporeans while influencing market
prices through land sales.
The Japanese are enlarging their impact on the property scene, while there
is theHong Kong factor to consider.
Residences will be more affordable when the government eases planning
guidelines to make landed properties more affordableto Singaporeans by
allowing smaller semi-detached houses to be built, new type terrace houses
closer to the road, and bigger built-in areas for bungalows.
Meanwhile, property consultants Jones Lang Wootton forecasts 4,115
apartmentsand condominiums being marketed this year, and 4,853 more over the
next two.
Forseeing a substantial increase in the supply of office space, landlords
have been offering six-year leases instead of the traditional three years.
This appeals to tenants, particularly multinational corporations used to
longer-term agreements to help fix rentals and increases.
The office sector reached historical levels in rentals, values per sq foot
and yields in 1990, notes RichardEllis, property consultants.
However, the Gulf War uncertainties and weakening economies of Singapore's
trading partners caused rents to stabilise and capital values to drop about
10 per cent.
Rents of SDollars 12 per sq ft have dipped to SDollars 8, leading landlords
to offer perks such as four-month rent holidays towoo tenants. There will
also be more diversification in the quality, price and location of office
space, predicts Richard Ellis, adding that the stock of private quality
office space will almost double by 1994. There should be 12m sq ft available
by 1995.
This is welcome news to Singapore. In January 1990, it was the 10th most
costly city to be located in, in terms of commercial rents, points out Mr
Christopher Fossick, a Richard Ellis director.
Halfway through1990, Singapore had risen to 6th place just behind Tokyo,
London's West End, and Hong Kong, making it more expensive than Milan,
Toronto and Los Angeles.
There were only three large commercial buildings opened in 1991, with 3.5msq
ft of office space available in 1991. There is also a long list of
properties on sale.
The listed property companies mostly met analysts' forecasts of their rental
and development income but some lost money on equities trading. To ease
their debt burden incurred on acquiring properties, large companies such as
City Development, DBS Land and Wing Tai Holdings are expected to make cash
calls.
In spite of record tourist numbers to Singapore, retailers once too eager to
jump on board the brand name bandwagon are faced with falling sales
andincreasing operating costs.
They had been banking on the purchasing power of Japanese tourists but, with
the removal of commodity taxes on retail goods in Japan, including branded
items, Japanese tourists are less keen to buy brand name items overseas,
especially with a weaker yen.
Richard Ellis sees another trend emerging: regional shopping centres. As
more women join the workforce, household incomes have more than doubled
while leisure time has decreased.
Regional shopping centres were established to meet the changing shopping
needs of the increasingly cash-rich but busy consumers.
Decentralisation hasalso spread to other properties. Retail outlets can be
found outside Orchard Road at Scotts or Beach Road; residential projects are
being built outside the choice locations; offices are relocating in the
Alexandra corridor and business parks; even the central bank is overseeing
the development of a 30-hectare hi-tech park for the financial sector at
Tampines.
The tenants will be those not dealing directly with the public and could
include the stock exchange financial regulatory bodies and back-room
services of banks.
Singapore wants tobe a regional base for large financial houses such as
Chemical Bank. 'Like theUK and US, these parks allow multi-functions under
one roof with operations such as research and development and light
manufacturing,' says Mr Fossick.
The added allure is a back-up power supply to ensure uninterrupted trading
in case of a power failure.
The Japanese are concentrating only on what they consider prime properties.
Having invested more than SDollars 1bn of real estate or 22 per cent of
total investments in 1989, their share shrank to 17 per cent or SDollars
446m in an overall smaller market in 1990.
Hong Kong-based buyers accountedfor SDollars 354.2m or 13 per cent of
overall investments in 1989 and SDollars 208m or 4 per cent last year.
Some 200,000 - 300,000 sq ft of property was taken up bycompanies relocating
from Hong Kong in 1990.
They are taking up more space, more in line with what they would have taken
up in the colony. There is no sense of panic in the republic as many people
believe that rents and capital values will eventually reach reasonable
values in the medium-term.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (5): In search of global status -
Banking sector: a period of turbulence is expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THANKS largely to a strong stock market in the early part of last year,
Singapore's financial services industry put in a spectacular performance in
1990, with a growth rate of 22 per cent making it the mainstay of the
overall economy.
That performance is unlikely to be repeated in 1991, at least by thebanking
sector. The economy is growing more slowly; domestic loan demand is less
robust; and the interest margins of domestic banks are narrowing as more
surplus deposits are directed towards the interbank market.
All these factors are likely to depress the profits of domestic banks this
year, but continuing strong activity in the foreign exchange market and
buoyant regional loan activity means the financial sector should still be
underpinned by a solid contribution from the offshore Asia currency banking
market.
According to Mr Lee Ek Tieng, managing director of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, the growth rate posted by the financial services sector will
still be in double digits. As far as the domestic banks are concerned, it is
a forecast which masks a period of turbulence going beyond the merely
cyclical.
It is generally admitted that Singapore's local market of 2.7m consumers is
over banked with 23 full foreign banks, 14 restricted ones and 13 local
banks. Bankers and stockbrokers say the authorities have begun to push the
idea of rationalising the domestic banks with a view to creating
institutions large enough to acquire international status.
Singapore banks need to follow their manufacturing clients who are investing
overseas, says Mr Richard Hu, finance minister. 'If they want to
consolidate, we'll be happy. Size is an advantage, clearly.'
'We are over banked,' adds Mr Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank.
'Even local banks have to go outside Singapore.' UOB, which is Singapore's
second largest bank, opened a joint-venture bank in Indonesia last year. Mr
Wee says it would like to expand into Thailand and Taiwan. The details of
the banking consolidation are still a matter of speculation, but the common
belief in the financial community is that theso-called 'big four' will
eventually be reduced from four to no more than three.
One much-discussed possibility might be for the government-owned DBS Bank to
absorb Overseas Union Bank, currently the smallest of the four. But the
situation was complicated last year by the acquisition of Asia Commercial
Bank by Keppel, the state-linked group whose activities range from finance
to ship repair. Keppel's entry into the market and its desire for more
acquisitions has introduced a fifth player into the equation.
The debate has also focused attention on the protection afforded local
banks. US bankers, in particular, complain of unequal treatment, which they
say is at variance with Singapore's claim tobe an enthusiastic free-trader
of services as well as goods.
Though foreign banks, such as Citibank, Hongkong Bank and Standard
Chartered, account for 61 per cent of domestic banking assets, they face
limits both on the number of branches and automatic teller machines. This
has restricted their access to the retail deposit market and forced them to
fund themselves on the more expensive interbank market. They say they have
also been hampered by their inability to join the debit cards fund transfer
network.
Foreign bankers say they expect Singapore to remain under pressure to end
this discrimination in the talks on liberalising trade in services in the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now that they
need to expand abroad, domestic banks have discovered that protection has
come at a price. They have neither the size nor the skills and efficiency to
compete easily in the global market place.
The government last year raised the permitted foreign stake in local banks
to 40 per cent from 20 per cent, a level which has since been reached only
at OCBC Bank, which ranks number three of the big four. Now it sees no need
for further liberalisation.
One of the MAS's main concerns is to ensure sound banking in Singapore's
small market. The domestic banks are required to be highly capitalised by
international standards; the MAS is proud of its record as a regulator and
vets would-be newcomers closely.
As a result the domestic industry has been first insulated from and then
dwarfed by the large international players to whom Singapore plays host. In
keeping with its wider policy of trying to be a service centre for
multinationals, Singapore sees itself as primarily a provider
ofinfrastructure and related services to international banks rather than a
playerin its own right.
Much to the satisfaction of the MAS, activity in the offshore banking market
has continued to grow apace. Average daily turnover in foreign exchange last
year was nearly Dollars 80bn, up 30 per cent on the 1989 level. Offshore
banking assets rose 16 per cent to Dollars 390bn, and fund management
business isgrowing as the region becomes more wealthy.
According to government figures, offshore loans to non-bank customers grew
at a record 45 per cent, reflecting the rapid growth of the regional
economy. Assets channelled into the interbank market grew much more slowly,
at a rate of just 4.5 per cent.
The interbank slowdown was marked in the second half of the year as both
Japanese and US banks reined in their international business. However, there
are as yet no signsthat this is spilling over into regional lending to
non-banks which remains buoyant.
Insurance is an example of a domestic industry whose initial development was
impeded by conditions on the local market.
The reason in this case was the stranglehold of the Central Provident Fund
over the local savings market. Private sector economists say this hampered
the development of the life insurance industry in Singapore. The affluence
of recent years has changed this andlife insurance business begun to grow
rapidly, helping the private sector to develop new savings industry skills.
The MAS, which moved last year to subject insurance brokers to stricter
regulations and capped their commissions, is keeping a strict regulatory eye
on the industry.
The aim is to foster a sound reputation which will help attract large
players to base their regional business in Singapore. The authorities have
long sought to compliment the services offered by international banks with
an offshore insurance market. A series of taxbreaks is available on both
reinsurance and captive insurance business.
Offshore reinsurance premiums last year grew by 26 per cent to a total
premium income of some SDollars 392m, but captive insurance business
declined by some 2.6 per cent. Today there are still only some 44 captive
insurance companies active in Singapore, way short of the critical mass
needed for this particular sector.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (2): Quiet grumbles among the partners -
Politics: critics argue the nation has a stage-managed parliamentary
democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICS, Singaporean style, is,most of the time, a well organised
gentlemanly affair, based upon consensus anda tried and tested partnership
between government, private sector and unions where meritocracy usually
triumphs.
Critics argue that Singapore is a stable, stage-managed parliamentary
democracy. Although elections are held at least once every five years, and
there are more than 20 registered political parties, the near total
dominance of the ruling People's Action Party and its cadre of carefully
screened and selected MPs provides little room for real opposition.
It is, say its critics, effectively a one-party state and likely to remain
so unless the next elections, due by the end of 1993, provide an unexpected
upset.
With a growing economy, full employment and relatively harmonious race
relations there is little open evidence of discontent, although opposition
figuresclaim there is much quiet grumbling - quiet because of 'fear of
speaking out openly against the PAP.' One or two Singaporeans voice concern
about 'excessive controls, rules and regulations' and the Singaporean
government's paternalistic attitude towards its citizens, but for the most
part criticism is muted.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister last November
in a clockwork-like transition which epitomises Singaporean political
efficiency. He knows the next elections and his government's and the
economy's performance ahead of them, will be a crucial test for him and the
PAP.
'My primary focus in the next two years is domestic politics. I want to win
the next elections as prime minister. If I don't get that right, the rest
doesn't follow,' he says.
'I can only do so by showing Singaporeans that I have made a difference to
their lives, I've made their lives better.'
Only at the ballot box will it be possible to gauge how successful his
promised new style of more open, consultative and 'gentler' government has
been.
Mr Goh knows he faces some formidable challenges. Although his transitional
team has been in place since the mid-1980s, he has inherited a party and
political structure still largely controlled by Mr Lee Kuan Yew who, aside
from being senior minister inside the Goh cabinet, remains secretary-general
of the PAP. This is a party formed and molded by an older generation of
leaders steeped in the battles of the 1950s and1960s against colonialism and
the threat of communism.
Even today, with communism in retreat throughout the region, PAP leaders
still paint a picture ofa precariously vulnerable Singapore, a Singapore
which is 'fighting for survival and trying to be a nation'.
In the early days, Mr Goh likens Singapore to 'refugees on a small sampan',
which needed 'a strong captain'. Now he says Singapore is 'more like perhaps
a trawler or a hovercraft going at high speed. There's more room for the
people to move around on board. At the same time, the boat can capsize if
you don't control their movements because if there are fights on board, the
boat can still capsize.'
There is evidence that Mr Goh's second generation team is indeed cautiously
accepting the inevitability of limited change. While rejecting the term
liberalisation he has beguna gradual movement towards decentralisation and
greater individual decision-making - provided basic core Singaporean values,
recently laid out in a five-pointset of 'shared values', are still adhered
too.
Among recent actions hehas instituted town councils, chaired by local MPs
who are empowered to run Singapore's numerous housing estates. This is a
small step in power devolution, perhaps equally importantly it forces MPs
with little or no feel for the grassroots, to talk with, rather than down to
their constituents.
While Mr Goh saysSingapore is emphatically not heading towards the creation
of a western-style welfare state, he says 'we are looking for schemes which
can add to this compassionate side of a competitive society.'
There is a new emphasis on the arts, film censorship rules are also being
eased, albeit cautiously, and it is likely that Singaporeans will be allowed
greater access to the foreign media including television. The Goh team has,
say western diplomats, actively encouraged more lively parliamentary debates
and even constructive criticism.
Such moves are largely dismissed by the Government's critics such as Mr
Chiam See Tong, amember of the Singapore Democratic Party and the one
elected opposition member of parliament, who allege that parliamentary
debates still resemble boring orchestrated puppet shows.
He argues the changes made so far are cosmetic rather than real.
Mr Goh and his new team recognise that most Singaporeans are increasingly
well educated and travel and they cannot be totally insulated from outside,
often western, influences. He also appears to have taken on board that
Singapore, chronically short of labour, cannot afford to lose those mostly
well-qualified academics, professionals and others who vote with their feet
each year and leave Singapore for new lives in Australia, Canada and
elsewhere.
As a recent Singapore Straits Times investigation showed, few are inclinedto
return in the current political atmosphere. More fundamental political and
social changes may therefore eventually be necessary. Singapore is however
unlikely to become a western-style open democracy.
Other factors mitigate against any rapid change. As the prime minister
acknowledges, the PAP, as a mass party is relatively small.
Nevertheless, in the last general elections in 1988 almost 40 per cent of
the electorate did not vote for the PAP. Prime Minister Goh and others
accept this was a protest vote to some extent by people who were unhappy
with some of the governments more contentious decisions.
Although the swing against the PAP in the last elections was much smaller
than the 12.6 per cent swing against the party in the 1984 elections, PAP
leaders, including Mr Goh recognise the slide in the popular vote must be
halted. If the PAP's popular vote were to drop below 55 per cent Mr Goh
admits the Singaporean politics could become unstable.
The 1988 general election produced one single elected opposition MP in the
81-seat parliament, and two co-opted non-constituency members, both from the
Workers' Party, Dr Lee Siew-Choh and thesince disqualified Mr J B
Jeyaretnam.
There is no real opposition in parliament. Mr Chiam, who has increased his
share of the popular vote in each election he has contested, naturally
expresses disappointment over his party's past electoral performances. In
the next general elections he is hoping, probably against all odds, for
'between five and 10 seats'.
That he says would give the opposition in parliament 'a viable base.' Like
Dr Lee Siew-Choh he is a fierce critic of PAP tactics at election time.
'The opposition is not really given a fighting chance. In Singapore, anyone
who comes out and opposes the PAP openly faces the use of all of the
government apparatus against them,' he says. Every aspect of private life
'is put under the microscope.' That, he claims, makes it very difficult to
find good opposition candidates.
Such charges are denied by the PAP leadership which argues instead that the
opposition parties lack any real viable alternative programmes.
'We don't think there will be a big role, (for an opposition party)' says Mr
Goh, 'The fact they want to be outside, they want to question the
government, that's all right. That is their role. We allow it. We are not
trying to eliminate them entirely.'
Some believe a more vigorous opposition may one day emerge within the PAP.
Suggestions of a potential split are played down by Mr Goh and other
PAPstalwarts.
Even opposition MP Mr Chiam See Tong concedes, there is unlikely to be a PAP
split while Mr Lee Kuan Yew, still seen even by his most ardent critics as
the 'father of the nation' is 'on the scene.'
Mr Lee Kuan Yew retains a powerful political voice - a voice that could be
enhanced should he decide to stand for the newly created post of elected
president, something he has only ruled out for the first elections.
Asked whether the former prime minister is still pulling the real power
strings Mr Goh replies: 'No he is an influential figure. To say that he
pulls the strings would be unfair to him, would be unfair to me and to my
colleagues. But to say he is an influential figure in the team, I would not
deny it.'
He is also more than willing to tackle the potentially equally thorny
question of his succession. He makes no secret of his desire to step aside
after 10 years, and that Mr BG Lee Hsien Loong, the former prime minister's
son and now first deputy prime minister is one obvious successor.
'We are already looking for them (the new team now) I am trying to prepare a
team that can take Singapore into the next century.'

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (3): A series of overlapping
relationships - Foreign policy: pragmatism born out of vulnerability to
changes in world economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the small multi-racialisland state of Singapore, foreign policy has
inevitably been primarily determined by domestic economic and national
security considerations - its life blood is trade and it is wedged between
the Moslem-dominated countries of Malaysia andIndonesia.
'We must make a living,' says Mr George Yeo, senior minister of state for
foreign affairs, 'and then we must look after our security so that we can
continue to make a living. I think our entire foreign policy turns on these
two modalities. The smaller you are the more acutely you feel these two
modalities.'
Singapore's low key, pragmatic foreign policy stance, like many other
important decisions, stems not only from the fact that in global terms
Singapore's voice is still just a whisper in spite of the country's obvious
wealth, but also from the widely held view among Singaporean's that they are
fragileand vulnerable in both economic and strategic terms.
'Singapore's total trade is about three times the size of its gross national
product, whichmeans we are very vulnerable to changes in world trade and
world economic growth and we are particularly linked to the state of the US
economy,' says Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister.
'Fragile in the sense that we are three different communities located on a
very small island. So long as the economy is growing, there is plenty for
everybody, I don't think people will fight over smallthings. But if the pie
is shrinking, that will be the real test whether we are cohesive, solid or
whether we are fragile,' he says.
The prime minister has made it clear that his priorities over the next two
years are domestic rather than foreign and that in the foreign policy arena
in particular he will lean heavily on the advice of former prime minister Mr
Lee Kuan Yew.
Singapore's former prime minister is the architect of much of the country's
foreign policy, and while there may now be small changes they are unlikely
to be radical. It was Mr Lee who maintained close links with both Taiwan and
China which eventually led to Singapore normalising relations with Peking
last year - but typically only after Indonesia had moved first.
It was Mr Lee who, in spite of the receding communist threat in Indochina,
insisted that Singapore should stand fast behind the sanctions against
Vietnam until there is a comprehensive UN peace settlement in Cambodia and
it was the former prime minister who, in whatsome have described as a
parting gift delivered a water supply agreement with Malaysia late last
year.
Mr Lee, a veteran analyst of superpower influencein the region, also foresaw
the danger of a power vacuum in the region should the US, described by Mr
Yeo as the most benign superpower be forced, for domesticbudgetary reasons,
to withdraw from the region.
In November Singapore, to the chagrin of Malaysia in particular, signed an
agreement with the US to allow greater American use of Singapore's military
facilities, and in spite of serious misgivings about any Japanese military
build up, has encouraged Tokyo to 'help strengthen the (US) pillar and not
to build an alternative.'
In fact, Singapore's foreign policy is based upon a series of overlapping
relationships - 'the more beams, rafters and columns the safer our space,'
says Mr Yeo. 'We are very loath to remove any one of them because they are
old and crumbly, we leave them there.'
As a small country Singapore is a fierce advocate of the upholding of
international law, particularly by the UN. It sent a small contingent to the
Namibia peace keeping force and a medical team to the Gulf. More
particularly it is simultaneously a member of the Five Powers Defense
Arrangement along with Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. It is an
increasingly active participant in the Association of South East Asian
Nations (Asean) whose summit it will host, probably early next year.
The agenda, according to Prime Minister Goh, is likely to focus on Asean's
political future now that tensions in the region, particularly Indochina,
are easing.
However, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, first deputy prime minister and Mr Lee Kuan
Yew's son notes:'One of the reasons Asean has been successful is that we do
not try and cohabitate closely together, we are friends and we have
generally the same views on issues that affect us . . . we work on areas
where we can agree and where we see eye to eye, where there are
disagreements or differences we just put those aside for a moment.'
Singapore has supported the fledgling Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum and, some suspect as much for political as economic reasons,
Malaysia's proposal for an East Asian Economic Group.
Perhaps most significantly and in spite of some criticism that Singapore's
foreign policy is still too reactive, it is gradually and very cautiously
beginning to parlay its economic power into political influence, at least
within the region.
Although Singapore generally resists giving aid, preferring instead to
provide technical assistance and training, the so called growth triangle
concept, embracing Singapore, Malaysia's southern state of Johor and
Indonesia's Riau islands is, with Singaporean determination, becoming a
reality.
'Singapore is like the power house,' says Prime Minister Goh, 'and they are
trying to plug into this power house in order to attract investments to
Batam and Johor.'
Aside from eventually providing a separate source of water for Singapore,
the growth triangle concept will almost certainly bring about closer
economic and political co-operation between the three nations.
So far, Singapore has signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia,
although Johor is said to be keen to do the same. As Mr Lee Hsien Loong
says, 'eventually there will probably be a trilateral piece of paper but
there is no great hurry.'
In spite of occasional hiccups, relations between Singapore and its
immediate neighbours 'have neverbeen as good as they are now,' says Mr Yeo.
Singapore exists and prospers by being of use to others. Today there is
considerably more economic co-operation and more joint defence exercises
between Singapore and its neighbours, in spite of some lingering suspicions.
However, that does not mean that Singapore is about to let its guard down.
Singapore, with its efficient and powerful, albeit small, military machine,
has been likened to a brightly coloured poison prawn while Mr Goh has
described the country as being like a porcupine. Neither is to be trifled
with.
Either way the intention is to deter aggression through a combination of
plugging the island state into as many multilateral agreements as possible
(a small fish is safer swimming in a shoal), careful diplomacy,and as a last
resort, by maintaining a well equipped and trained defence force.
'We must be prepared to explore multiple approaches for regional security
which will accommodate big and small regional countries in a constructive
framework that will minimise conflict and encourage dialogue, confidence and
co-operation,' Mr Wong, the foreign minister said in a recent Parliamentary
debate.
The long term security of the region, he said, was 'best served by havingan
engagement of all powers, large and small, if necessary in overlapping and
multiple security and political frameworks.'

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (4): Efficiency gives akeen edge -
Shipping: port prospers from its strategic location
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE Hong Kong, Singapore is blessed with a deep water harbour as its only
significant natural resource. Unlike the British crown colony, however, it
cannot rely on the business of a large immediate neighbour such as China to
help ensure that its port facilities thrive.
Singapore has thus been thrown back on its regional connections and
strategic location on the main shipping routes between Europe, Japan and the
rest of the Asia-Pacific region to develop a port which generates half its
business offshore and claims to be a world cargo hub.
Singapore is not only the world's busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage
handled, it also last year pipped Hong Kong at the post to become the
world's largest container port. Containers handled rose 20 per cent to 5.22m
20 ft equivalent units (TEUs) compared with 5.1m in Hong Kong. The story of
the port is typical of Singapore's approach to economic development, right
down to a present serious struggle with capacity limits. It owes its success
to a classic local combination of government-mandated enterpreneurialism and
investment in high technology that has brought about a keen edge in
efficiency and productivity.
Though a public board responsible to the government, the Port of Singapore
Authority (PSA), is expected to do without subsidies and pay its share of
taxin the form of a 10 per cent levy on turnover and a further 20 per cent
on operating profit. It is expected to finance its capital investment
internally.
Thus it has been forced into an intensely commercial approach. The PSA
marketsitself actively around the world and prides itself on customer
service. According to Mr Goon Kok Loon, deputy executive director, important
selling points include predictability of berth availability and speed of
turn round. Mr Goon says the average containership can now be turned round
in 10 hours.
The port isnot only an integral part of Singapore's concept of itself as a
regional transport and communications hub. It helps underpin other local
service industries such as banking and brings in a wide range of ancillary
business.
Thus demand for warehouse space has risen through Singapore's position as a
designated delivery point for contracts written on the London Metals
Exchange. It has become an accepted handover centre for ships which are sold
in the second-hand market, and this has helped the ship surveying business,
Mr Goon says.
Singapore enjoys a significant niche in ship repair and maintenance. In
spite of high localwages, this sector has been buoyed up by the high level
of its technology, which means repairs can be done quickly even to
sophisticated modern tankers.
It has thus managed to stay cost-effective in comparison with rival centres
such as Korea, and now, according to brokers Smith New Court, is looking to
an increase in business maintaining tankers built in the active years of the
early 1970s and which are coming up for special survey and repair.
By contrast Singaporeans play a less dominant role as shipowners. Though it
is home to Neptune Orient Lines, which has a modern fleet and an aggressive
expansion policy, the country boasts few entrepreneurs willing to take on
the risks of large fleet ownership. Its shipping fleet ranks only 13th in
the world.
The government hastaken steps to correct this by extending local tax
benefits to ships registeredoutside Singapore. Industry executives say part
of the aim was to encourage ship owners to transfer business to Singapore
from Hong Kong and to help ship-management business, which is seen as an
important ancillary service.
'Singapore has become a new option as a base for operations,' says Mr Chung
Chee Kit, executive director of Steamers Maritime. However, there has been
no immediate rush to set up shop in Singapore and other executives say they
are still uncertainabout the impact of the move.
Back at the port, Mr Goon is unphased by Singapore's well-documented labour
shortage. The large increase in volume in the last 20 years has compelled
the port to move in the direction of computerised automation. Computers now
decide where containers should be stacked and in what order they should be
loaded and unloaded.
This in turn has allowed the portto shed some 3,000 workers over the last
decade, leaving a total of 7,115 workers last year. Most of those that
remain are expected to be computer-literate even if their job is simply
driving a crane. All are expected to undergo at least six days training a
year.
To cope with what has become a serious shortage of capacity, the PSA is
investing some SDollars 1.1bn in a new container terminal. The first berth
should be ready by 1992 and, when the terminal is finished in 1996, the
port's container handling capacity will have doubled to 10m TEUs.
So confident is Mr Goon of continued productivity growth, that he says this
large expansion will be accompanied by only a slight increase in the labour
force. It may not be possible to improve much on the speed of turnround.
With a net surplus last year of some SDollars 459m last year and over
SDollars 2bn invested in fixed deposits in the bank, the money needed to pay
for this investment is also scarcely aproblem. Indeed, if anything, eyebrows
are more frequently raised at the way inwhich the PSA, like other utilities
in Singapore and in spite of its heavy investment programme, has accumulated
large cash reserves. The disposition of this surplus may turn out to be a
much bigger headache than growing the business.

FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (1): Preparing for the next lap -
Singapore's success as an entrepot trading nation has given it a standard of
living that is second only to Japan in Asia. However, many sections of the
island republic'smulti-racial society are seeking changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ONE of the hottest selling itemsin Singapore's book shops this year is a
hardback called The Next Lap. For justSDollars 9 the government-sponsored
book offers Singaporeans a glimpse of the future that Singapore's government
and intellectual elite has mapped out for them into the next century.
The book's title and content are significant. Last year saw the tiny island
republic celebrate its first 25 years as a sovereign independent nation.
Then at the end of November Singapore witnessed its first change ofprime
minister in 31 years as Mr Lee Kuan Yew stepped aside for a second
generation of groomed leaders led by Mr Goh Chok Tong.
Prime Minister Goh and his team have inherited responsibility for a
multi-racial country of just under 2.7m mainly ethnic Chinese people whose
success, as a entrepot trading nation, has given them a standard of living,
measured by a Dollars 12,000 per capita gross national product, second only
to Japan in Asia and ahead of many European nations. However, they are
increasingly demanding change.
Singapore, and its leaders including Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who remains a powerful
figure as senior minister and secretary-general of the ruling People's
Action Party, can be proud of most of what has been achieved. Even though,
as government critics suggest, it has been at the cost of creatingan
antiseptic and dull society which leaves little room for individual
creativity or imagination and no room for real political opposition - as
those who havedared stick their heads above the political parapet have
discovered.
Even some of the PAP's younger backbenchers such as outspoken Mr Davinder
Singh, a lawyer who probably speaks for many who are dissatisfied with the
style of government, complain in parliament that 'government runs virtually
everyaspect of our lives.'
Singapore is a meritocracy run by a hand-picked, well-paid elite who feel
that the rights of the individual must be subservient to the perceived
greater good of the community. Singaporean-style parliamentary democracy has
been tailored to this end.
Such concerns have their roots in Singapore's relatively recent birth as a
nation. After surviving the trauma of Japanese occupation, Singapore won
independence from Britain only tobe thrown out of the newly-created
Malaysian federation a few years later. Since then, Singapore's older
generation of leaders have mostly succeeded in channeling this sense of
isolation and vulnerability into a powerful driving force for economic
advancement. This is in spite of the substantial number of part-time,
elderly and other poorly paid hourly workers who have not fairly shared in
Singapore's economic rise.
Nevertheless, a panoramic view of the city reveals a bustling port, the
busiest in the world, skyscraper office blocks rivalling those in Tokyo, New
York or London, and smart, clean, streets and highways. There are hefty
fines for littering, smoking in public places, jay-walking and many other
misdemeanors. The mass transit underground system is almost as good, and
much less crowded than Tokyo's, Changi airport, with its new second
terminal,is a symbol of national pride and efficiency.
These achievements, particularly in the field of telecommunications and
information technology, have a longer-term aim. Singapore sees itself as the
Switzerland of Asia, a communications, business and economic hub for the
region.
The list of multinational companies with manufacturing facilities and/or
regional headquarters in Singapore proves the policy has worked. As big
neighbours such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand get on the fast track of
development, and Indochina opens up, there will be competitors but, as Prime
Minister Goh says: 'We believe we have many years of head start.'
Singapore's economy, in spite of a few hiccups, including the recession of
the mid-1980s, has thrived. Last year exports roseby almost 10 per cent to a
record SDollars 95.2m - almost half as much again as the country's GNP,
while its foreign exchange reserves, believed to be understated, grew by
SDollars 9.9bn to SDollars 48.5bn.
This year, the government is forecasting GNP growth of between 3 and 6 per
cent, down from 8.3 per cent last year. Based on an impressive first quarter
performance, growth is likely to be at the top end ofthis range or above.
This worries the country's cautious economic planners who are always alert
to the risk of overheating and who believe the maximum sustainable
non-inflationary annual growth rate is about 6 per cent.
Singapore isshort of land, but an even more critical constraint is labour.
Government planners reckon that the country could accommodate 4m people and
has set a target birth rate of 50,000 a year, but in spite of an active
campaign to encourage a higher fertility rate, birth rates are failing to
match the population replacement rate. There are political constraints on
expanding the substantial percentage of imported labour.
To offset these weaknesses the government is encouraginglabour intensive
manufacturing industry to move offshore, particularly to its lower wage cost
'growth triangle' partners, Indonesia's Riau islands, and Malaysia's Johor
state.
However, Singapore recognises that it must maintain a cost competitive
manufacturing base, even if the service sector, and financial services in
particular, continue to account for a growing proportion of GNP. Therefore
it is attempting to move local manufacturing further up the capital
intensive technology ladder identifying and promoting niche high technology
industriessuch as bio-technology.
Continued economic success is important for political reasons. As Prime
Minister Goh says: 'So long as the economy is growing, there is plenty for
everybody, I don't think people will fight over small things. But if the pie
is shrinking, that will be the real test of whether we are cohesive, solid
or whether we are fragile.'
Singapore's new prime minister accepts that gradual changes, to make
Singapore a more gentle, gracious, compassionate and entrepreneurial society
with less government intervention and more privatisation are necessary.
In spite of some immediate changes,there is still some scepticism among some
Singaporeans that Mr Goh will, or can, deliver on all his promises. Critics
point out that many of the most restrictive laws, including the internal
security act, are still on the statute books, and likely to remain so for
some time.
This is probably because while Singapore's new leaders accept that some
changes are inevitable they worry about speed and direction. While it is
said the people trust the government more than their stockbrokers it is
apparent that the government does not believe Singaporeans are mature enough
to make all their own decisions - for example on how they spend or save
their money.
Rapid change in Singapore is therefore unlikely. The government is trying to
foster a Singaporean identity, defined in terms of shared or common values -
most of which would have been readily accepted in the Victorian West - while
emphasising the importance of preserving ethnic roots, be they Chinese,
Malay or Indian.
Perhaps the greatest dilemma Mr Goh's team faces is how to pace the next
lap. If Singapore's rules and regulations are eased too quickly the
government risks losing some central controls. If change is too slow, or
fails to materialise, the expectations Mr Goh has built up among Singapore's
younger citizens in particular, could result in another setback in popular
support for the PAP at the ballot box in general elections due by the end of
1993. The wrong pace might risk Singapore slipping in the economic
sweepstakes of the fastest growing region in the world.

FT  30 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Firm advance as new account opens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON STOCKS had a firm start yesterday to a long three-week account which
is likely to be dominated by the results of Thursday's UK local government
elections. However, trading was thinand much of the improvement was the
result of technical and currency factors.
The performance of the dollar, after the weekend's G7 meeting in Washington,
dominated early trading. The Tokyo stock market was closed for a national
holiday. The dollar's initial strength led to a hesitant start to London
equity trading and the FT-SE 100 index opened slightly lower.
Traders had taken theview, however, that uncertainty ahead of the polls
would hit shares harder. A modest 2.6-point fall in the Footsie led them to
cover their bear positions in the futures market.
As the premium on the Footsie future increased, the dollar steadied and
sterling rose against the D-Mark. The market recovered its nerve, taking
account of weekend opinion polls, which seemed to indicate that the
Conservative party might be able to avoid electoral humiliation on Thursday.
Equity strategists underlined at least the short-term significance of such a
possibility. 'The poll is pivotal for the market,' said Mr John Reynolds of
County NatWest. If this happened, sterling would strengthen and there would
be morescope for interest rate cuts.
The cash futures market seemed to respond to similar thoughts, taking its
view of three-month interest rates from a cut of 1/2 per cent to one of  3/4
per cent. Gilts were more equivocal, with shorts barely changed and medium
and long-dated issues slightly lower.
Mr Paul Waltonat James Capel said there was a case for the government to cut
rates before thenext set of UK inflation figures, due on May 17th. The
headline rate of inflation for the year to April is likely to show a sharp
fall to little more than 6 per cent; this would underpin confidence and
minimise the effect of any rate reduction on sterling. Mr Walton said that
some in the market felt a cut before Thursday's polls was a possibility,
although most traders thought this unlikely.
The net effect of short covering in the futures and talk of interest rate
reductions and the opinion polls was to push the Footsie index to 0.1 points
short of regaining the 2,500 mark. An erratic opening from Wall Street
pulled the index back briefly before it edged higher once again to close at
2498.6, up 26.9 points on the day.
Trading volume was low by the standards of the last few weeks at 366.1m
shares. This backed up strategists' views that there would be little
concerted buying or selling by institutions before Thursday.
Individual share price movements yesterday were few, although
internationally quoted shares showed good rises almost across the board as
the dollar rose. In the absence of any further large rights issues, most
other big capitalisation stocks firmed in line with the market.
Talk of more job losses at Marks and Spencer were confirmed, as were some of
the more pessimistic forecasts on how strict are to be the controls on
British Gas pricing by the UK government regulatory body, Ofgas.
Bid activity was limited to a tender offer for 18 1/2 per cent of retail
chain Etam from South African group Oceana, and a Pounds 3.2m offer for 35
per cent of football club Tottenham Hotspur led by Mr Terry Venables, the
team manager. Shares in Tottenham have been suspended since October 1990.

FT  30 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GENTLE squeeze began to develop in derivative markets yesterday as a rally
in German bond futures and anadvance in US equities pulled London shares up
from the lows of last week.
The June FT-SE 100 index contract opened firmly, which encouraged
arbitrageurs to sell futures and buy shares, which in turn dragged the share
market higher.
However, this caused only a temporary halt to the futures market's advance.
Equity marketmakers continued to buy FT-SE futures, which encouraged
privateinvestors into the market.
June FT-SE closed at 2,519, up 28 points on the day. June's premium to the
spot index finished at 22 points, against fair value of around 15. Dealers
said June's premium to fair value indicated that the futures market saw
short-term gains on the stock market.
Traded options were boosted by busy dealing in the Euro FT-SE 100 index,
which saw 1,000 contractschange hands in each of the December 2,225, 2,325
and 2,425 puts. Among FT-SE options, a securities house sold 1,000 December
2,700 calls.
Among the stock options, buying of British Telecom August 360 calls and May
360 puts boosted turnover. British Gas June 240 puts were busy, while
Pilkington August 200 calls were also sought.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Finland leads falls on political
concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMENTS by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, that the
current level of inflation did not justify further cuts in interest rates
set thetone for equities last week.
The World Index, according to the FT-Actuaries series, declined 1.3 per cent
in local currency terms, dragged lower by a 1.4 per cent fall in the US and
a 1.7 per cent drop in Japan. The Tokyo fall was accentuated by shrinking
volume before the Golden Week holidays, starting yesterday.
The worst performer of the week was Finland. The bourse dropped by 5.3 per
cent in local currency terms in daily volume of less than FM20m (Dollars
4.9m) onuncertainty about the economic policy of the new centre-right
government, whichwas formed last Friday.
Mr Peter Bradshaw of Swiss Bank Corporation in London says the market came
under heavy selling pressure on Thursday, when volumeexpanded to FM50.1m as
investors took up their options, which expired that day,and immediately sold
the underlying stock. Union Bank of Finland was also reported to have been a
heavy seller, via Unitas, the brokers, of restricted shares in itself and
Kymmene, the forest products group.
However, Mr Bradshaw believes that the new government's adherence to the
previous administration's economic policy, as well as promising to lower
interest rates, should help the stock market. The government aims to keep
the Finnish markka strong, avoid currency devaluation, cut interest rates
and reduce the current account deficit.
Mr Bradshaw also believes the stock market is emerging from its 18-month
trough. Investors have discounted the collapse in Finnish trade with the
Soviet Union and are now looking forward to 1992 when the fortunes of
Finnish companies are set to recover.
Australia provided the week's biggest rise, of 1.8 per cent inlocal currency
terms, on prospects of further decreases in wages growth and inflation into
1992.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia and South
Korea rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING INTEREST lifted the Australian and South Korean markets yesterday,
but investors were in arush to take profits in Taiwan. Most other markets
were mixed and without direction, partly owing to the closure of Tokyo for
the first of its Golden Week holidays; it will also shut this Friday and
Monday next week.
AUSTRALIA advanced on buying by US and domestic investors, encouraged by
expectations of lower inflation and interest rates. The All Ordinaries index
moved ahead 20.4 to 1,558.3 in turnover of ADollars 259m, similar to
Thursday's level but below Friday's ADollars 712m,which was boosted by
options-related trading.
There was active buying ofBHP, which rose 40 cents to ADollars 12.70, and
CRA, the mining group, up 55 cents at ADollars 13.80.
Bundaberg Sugar, the subject of a ADollars 4.10 a share bid from Tate and
Lyle, fell 11 cents to ADollars 3.85 after saying that Macquarie Bank had
valued thecompany at between ADollars 4.54 and ADollars 5.16 a share.
SEOUL enjoyed its third successive session of strength, with the composite
index climbing 5.89 to 644.60. Trading was active with Won171bn worth of
shares exchanged, up from Saturday's Won112bn. Rumours of a possible summit
between the North-South Korean leaders encouraged investors.
TAIWAN fell sharply in the most active day's trading since last June, as
profit-taking weakened financial and textile shares. The weighted index lost
260.25 or 4.3 per cent to 5,728.00 in turnover of TDollars 106bn, up from
Saturday's TDollars 59bn.
MANILA consolidated before the talks on US militarybases in the Philippines.
The composite index retreated 14.62 to 1,033.56 as turnover increased to 91m
pesos from 86m.
HONG KONG recouped most of its early losses to close little changed. The
Hang Seng index was finally off 1.08 at 3,624.72 after turnover of HKDollars
1.02bn, down from HKDollars 1.47bn. SINGAPORE was also mixed, the Straits
Times Industrial index ending 0.23 up at 1,558.64.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Activity slows in run-up to
May Day break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES weremostly easier yesterday as activity slowed before the May Day
holiday. Paris rose, but trading was thin, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS achieved a 1.3 per cent rise, but turnover was light, easing from
Friday's FFr2bn to about FFr1.3bn - with much of that accounted for by
futures and options-related trading before the expiry of contracts today.
One dealer said that investors seemed to be running out of solid reasons to
buy. The CAC 40 index rose 22.68 to 1,797.35, ending below its day's high of
1,801.62.
Michelin picked up anotherFFr2.80 to FFr94.40, with 653,300 shares changing
hands; the stock continued tobenefit from Friday's brokers' comments.
Elsewhere in the motor sector, Peugeotgained FFr12 to FFr571 on 138,550
shares.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez addedFFr10 to FFr578. The group has said it will
increase its stake in Alfred McAlpine, the UK construction company, to 12
per cent from 6 per cent.
Axa Midigained FFr23 to FFr1,076. The insurer, which announced a rise in net
profits inline with expectations on Friday, is one of the few blue chips
still looking fairly cheap, said a dealer.
FRANKFURT ended lower after early buying failed to attract follow-through
orders. Institutional activity was minimal and dealers expected trading to
remain quiet this week.
Early on, the DAX index hit a day and year's high of 1,638.20, before
closing 3.53 lower at 1,620.28, the day's low. The FAZ index, calculated at
midsession, rose 4.32 to 690.28, a 1991 high. Volume fell to DM5.9bn from
DM6.8bn.
Dealers were comforted that the recent strength in the German market had not
triggered widespread profit-taking, and were cautiously optimistic that the
DAX could break through 1,640 in the next month.
They noted that London brokers were increasing their weightings for the
German market, which had lagged behind other European bourses, and that
corporate results were coming in at the higher end of expectations.
Remarks by a German finance ministry official that rates could fall later
this year lifted the banking sector. Deutsche ended DM2.50 up at DM649.50,
Dresdner roseDM4 to DM374 and Commerzbank put on DM3.80 to DM262.50.
Among second-liners, Henkel preference shares rose DM6 to DM591 against the
market, although dealers could not pinpoint reasons for the rise.
MILAN fell as political andeconomic concerns kept investors away. Volume
remained thin, estimated at around Friday's L111bn, after last Thursday's
Liberation Day holiday and before this Wednesday's May Day break. The MIB
general index fell 16 or 1.4 per cent to 1,120; the Comit index was not
available.
Among the industrials, Fiat fell L60 to L5,185.
Shares linked to the Mondadori group bucked the trend on hopes of an early
end to the battle for the publisher. L'Espresso jumped to L21,000from
L19,600. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, eased L45 to L2,550at
the official close but rebounded to L2,620 after hours. Olivetti, which
plunged last week on its 1990 results, fell L85 to L3,620 but then recovered
to L3,700.
STOCKHOLM fell for the fourth day. The Affarsvarlden General index dropped
9.3 to 1,051.9 in meagre volume of SKr187m, down from SKr222m. The bourse
will close from midday today until Thursday.
Ericsson accounted for SKr32m of the turnover, as its free Bs fell SKr3 to
SKr195.
OSLO was lifted byFriday's cut in the Central Bank's key interest rate. The
all-share index rose 5.20 to 481.56 in low turnover of NKr214m.
MADRID recouped part of its early loss, but turnover was thin at about
Pta10bn after Friday's Pta11.8bn. The general index closed 0.36 down at
276.47, after finishing pit trading at 275.76. Iberduero, which said that it
would raise its 1990 dividend by 9.3 per cent, rose Pta5 to Pta709.
ZURICH marked time, with the Credit Suisse index down 0.3 at 550.8.
Chemicals were mostly higher: Sandoz registered shares rose SFr50 to
SFr11,550, but its bearers fell SFr50 to SFr11,800. The group forecast a
good year in spite of lower first quarter sales.
AMSTERDAM rose initially on the stronger dollar but closed mixed before the
national holiday today. The CBS tendency index ended 0.1 down at 95.5.
ATHENS fell 3 per cent, the generalindex losing 35.62 to 1,153.37.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: South African industrials enjoy a
record run - Economic optimism and the easing of sanctions triggered the
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP rise in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Industrial Index
this year reminds local investment managers of the London adage, 'sell in
May and go away'. The index has risen 25.8 per cent from 2,829 on January 16
to a record high of 3,559 on Friday. It slipped to 3,535 yesterday.
Industrial stocks, on an average price/earnings (p/e) ratio of 11.3 and an
earnings yield of 8.8, are not expensive compared with some overseas shares,
but they are high by South Africanstandards.
Fund managers agree that the index, if not overvalued, is at least fully
valued. They may not yet be thinking of selling, but they will certainly be
doing less buying, as value is becoming increasingly difficult to find. Mr
Roy McAlpine of Liberty Life comments: 'Already we have seen heavier growth
from January 1 in the financial and industrial (sectors) than even the most
optimistic commentator would have forecast.'
Lending support to the view that the market is due for a breather is the
fact that the recent rise in the industrial index has been a rerating -
there has been no commensurate rise in earnings or dividends - to which
there must be an upward limit.
The outlook for corporate profits suggests that the market is looking two
years ahead rather than one. Mr Niall Brown of stockbrokers Simpson Mckie
says it forecasts 5 to 6 per cent nominal growth in the profits of
industrial companies in the next six to 12 months, compared with inflation
of 13 to 14 per cent.
What, then, hasmoved the index? First, expectations of much improved
earnings growth from nextyear onwards. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors,
a financial services group,notes: 'In the new South Africa one can imagine
that the industrial companies are the ones that potentially can benefit.'
Consumer-oriented companies,such as Wooltru, Edgars, Pick N Pay and South
African Breweries, which are wellplaced to capitalise upon growth in the
urban black market, are all on p/e ratios of close to 20.
A second reason is positive economic sentiment. The recession has bottomed
out much earlier than the previous two, meaning that earnings have not been
that badly hit. Mr Lee says it was mostly an inventory and investment
recession. Consumer spending has stayed fairly buoyant throughout, and
company balance sheets are in much better shape.
While businessmen remain cautiously optimistic about political developments,
there is a more definite feeling that things can only improve on the
economic front. Interest rates were lowered in March and, although no
further cuts are expected in the short term, the trend is downwards. The
gradual easing of trade and financial sanctions has also improved sentiment.
The buoyant performance of world markets has also helped the JSE Industrial
Index, which traditionally tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The index has benefited from two important features of the JSE: the poor
liquidity in the industrial sector and the weight of institutional funds.
Exchange control has long created a hothouse effect on the JSE, with
institutions being forced to chase a limited number of marketable stocks.
This has recently been compounded by other factors, including the decline in
interestin mining shares as the gold industry's fortunes have waned, which
has resultedin an increased focus on industrial stocks. The gold index fell
from the year'shigh of 1,367 in mid-January to a low of 971 on February 25,
a drop of 29 per cent. It has since rallied, and closed at 1,026 yesterday.
Also relevant have been the fall in disinvestment, an absence of big rights
issues and no majorprivatisations. These factors, combined with bearish
market sentiment, drove institutional liquidity to high levels at the end of
1990.
The return of these funds into equities over the past few months has been a
significant factor in driving the market upward, as fund managers rushed to
ensure that they did notmiss out on the market's strong rise.

FT  30 APR 91 / Money Markets: An optimistic tone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT STERLING futures rose on Liffe and wholesaleinterest rates eased in
London as optimism increased about another cut in UK bank base rates.
This view was not encouraged by the Bank of England however. The central
bank took out the full underlying credit shortage on the money market, but
not until late in the day, tending to keep the short end tight.
Traders on Liffe pointed out that before yesterday's move June short
sterling was discounting no more than a cut of 1/2 point in base rates over
the next six week's. But a weak UK economy and speculation about an early
general election point towards the possibility of more. Thursday's local
government elections are expected to provide important guidance on the
timing of a general election.
June short sterling opened firmer at 88.66. This was also the day's low,
with the contract moving outside its recent tight range, to touch a peak of
88.76 before closing 88.75 against 88.62 previously.
Three-month interbank eased to 11 13/16 -11 from 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent,
with 12-month money quoted at 11 11/32 -11 5/16 against11 7/16 -11 5/16 per
cent.
The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of
Pounds 700m, but revised this to Pounds 650m at noon and back to Pounds
700min the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 767m was provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought only Pounds 85m bills outright, by way
of Pounds 21m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 64m bank
bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon another Pounds 317m bills were purchased, via Pounds 242m
bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 75m bank bills in band 2
at 11 13/16 per cent. Late help of around Pounds 365m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,401m, with bank balances below target
absorbing Pounds 135m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds
265m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 570m.
In Frankfurt call money was steady at 8.95 per cent, waiting for the result
of this week's securities repurchase agreement tender by the Bundesbank. A
two-tranche tender has been set, with 34-day money available at an unchanged
fixed rate of 8.60 per cent and 62-day funds on offer at variable bid rates.

FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York markets decide today
on future facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK'S five commodities exchanges are to decide today whether they will
movetogether to a new, larger trading floor or go separate ways.
The choicesare to remain together in New York at a new site or separate,
with the New YorkMercantile Exchange (Nymex), the largest exchange, moving
across the Hudson River to New Jersey.
Proposals for both locations were presented several months ago and the New
York siting was overwhelmingly favoured. But the Nymex, theprosperous energy
exchange and the third largest US exchange after the two Chicago markets,
chose to re-examine the possibility of a New Jersey proposal beforefinally
making a commitment to New York.
The reasons for Nymex backing away from the joint move are unclear. Many
speculate, however, that at bottom itis because of poor relations between Mr
Lou Guttman, the chairman of Nymex, andMr Martin Greenberg, the chairman of
the New York Commodities Exchange (Comex).
Long-running merger talks between the two exchanges were once again scuttled
at the beginning of the year.
The New York exchanges are due to sign a letter of intent today with New
York on the deal, and Nymex's board was scheduled to decide the issue at a
special meeting that began yesterday and was expected to perhaps last
through the night into today.
The New York proposalis for a Dollars 260m project, of which New York City
would provide Dollars 145m, with Dollars 100m of that in cash. Besides Nymex
and Comex, which is principally a metals market, the other three exchanges
involved in the deal are the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchanges, the New York
Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange.
The relocation decision is expected to have a big impact not only on the
exchanges themselves, but on the futures commissions merchants (FCMs) who do
their business there.
The FCMs do not want to have to divide their staffs and duplicate their
costs in two facilities. The Futures Industry Association (FIA), which
represents the FCMs, says it strongly supports a unified relocation in the
city of New York.
It also would like to see the consolidation of clearingand processing to
increase cost savings for the FCMs.
The FIA, which represents 80 per cent of all futures and options activity on
US exchanges, is a powerful voice for the Nymex to ignore.
Should Nymex decide against its membership's wishes - the vote was 80 per
cent in favour of staying in New York - some believe there could be a revolt
by referendum to overturn the decision.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: The price of money in the
real world - How finance directors make thechoice between debt and equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debt or equity - how does the finance director of a large company decide how
to raise money?
One consideration is the cost of financing.
According to business school theory based on workby the Nobel Prize winners
Professor Franco Modigliani and Professor Merton Miller, the cost of
financing is similar whether with debt or equity. In other words, it should
not matter to company finance directors whether they choose one or the
other.
In practice, however, corporate financiers argue that the costs of equity
and debt are not the same and that a variety of factors apart from cost
estimates can influence how a company raises money.
The cost of debt is easy to measure - it is the interest rate paid by a
company on its bank loanor bond. If a company decides today to issue a
20-year bond it will have to payabout 2 percentage points over the yield on
a similar-dated gilt, so the cost would be about 12 per cent.
However, unlike the cost of debt, which is fixed at the date of issue, the
cost of equity varies. If the cost of equity is thedividend yield, the
current cost of raising equity is about 5 per cent, which is cheaper than
the cost of debt.
But because investing in equity is riskier, investors usually require a
higher return from equity. So, while a company could choose to minimise the
cost of equity by keeping the dividend low, such a strategy would prove
unpopular with shareholders who want their investments to outpace inflation
and expect dividends to increase: hence one would expect the cost of raising
equity to increase over time.
Tax treatment can also affect the cost of financing. With debt, interest
payments are tax - deductible. With equity, advance corporation tax paid by
a company on dividends may be offset against the corporate tax liability,
although companies with a high proportion of overseas earnings are at a
disadvantage as they cannot receive the full tax relief.
However, even though the result is to reduce the cost of debt, most company
directors and corporate financiers deny that the tax consideration is
important enough to influence a financing decision.
If theory suggests that the cost of debt and equity are the same, why have
so many UK companies announced rights issues in recent weeks? Professor
Elroy Dimson of the London Business Schoolpoints out that other factors
influence a company's decision to use one form offinancing over another.
a clear sign that many companies feel overburdened with debt and want to
strengthen their balance sheets. Companies such as Tesco, the food retailer,
and Redland, the building materials group, recently raised money through
rights issues as neither company wished to increase its level ofgearing.
Added to this, institutions have been flush with cash and hungry for
equities in which to invest - and the surge in the UK stock market,
coinciding with the results season, has provided a good opportunity for
companies to issue shares.
Redland raised Pounds 280m through its rights issue to fund acquisitions in
those countries suffering from recession.
'The key issue faced by any finance director is whether to fund the company
with debt or equity, and thatdepends on the risk profile, in other words the
gearing and interest cover,' said Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland finance
director.
Gearing is the ratio ofdebt to equity, while interest cover is the number of
times the fixed-interest payments made by a company to service its loan
capital are exceeded by earnings. Redland prefers its gearing to be below 40
per cent - and it is now 34 per cent. The optimum level of gearing is
subjective.
Institutional shareholders - who typically in the UK have quite a high
proportion of their investments placed in equity rather than in bonds - are
often uncomfortable with gearing of more than 50 per cent.
Mr David Morgan, investment director at M&amp;G, warns that investors must pay
close attention to gearing levels particularly if the company concerned is
in a cyclical business.
Different funding strategies are not mutually exclusive, but can be dictated
by the options available, according to Mr Tony Rice, finance director at
British Aerospace.
For example, a company may prefer to use a UK rights issue to fund a UK
acquisition, but if it wants to make an overseas acquisition, it may match
currencies and use a foreign currency bond.
BAe recently raised Pounds 150m of 18-year sterling bonds, but this does not
preclude it from making a rights issue later on, says Mr Rice. The cost of
the bond issue - of 12 per cent before tax, or 7.8 per cent after tax - is
'tolerable,' he says, and the inverse yield curve means that long-dated
paper is cheaper than short-dated paper.
However, the fact that the government and utilities companies may be
borrowing at the long end of the market convinced Mr Rice that 'it was
better to move sooner rather than later' incase demand from institutions for
long-dated corporate paper dried up.
For every director who can cite the corporate finance theory learned at
business school, there are half a dozen who eschew the theory and cite their
own reasons for preferring one form of financing over another.
In the words of one corporate financier: 'Even if raising money through
equity were more expensive it does not mean you don't do it - we live in the
real world and in the real world companies are judged by their shareholders
and by the people who lend them money, not by their economic models.'

FT  30 APR 91 / International Bonds: Slow business wipes out swap
opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS in both thesecondary and primary markets was subdued yesterday.
Eurodollar bond prices lagged price gains in a firmer US Treasury market,
causing spreads to widen a little.
Consequently, the swap opportunities which prompted a spate of short-dated
issuance last week have now disappeared.
Nevertheless, Credit Local,the French financial institution, was able to add
a further Dollars 150m to its Dollars 200m three-year deal launched last
Tuesday. A Credit Local official said the proceedsfrom the extra Dollars
150m, swapped into floating-rate dollars, would be used to refinance an
outstanding issue of medium-term notes.
After a slow start last week, the spread on the Credit Local deal expanded
from a launch level of 47 basis points to more than 50 basis points over the
comparable Treasury. The wider spread brought in buyers and the deal then
sold quickly, benefiting from its top credit rating, and from being launched
ahead of three other short-dated deals brought last week. The new tranche
was launched at a 52 basis point spread.
In the lira market, a unit of Volkswagen raised L150bn of four-year bonds,
via Banca Commerciale Italiana. The bonds are expected to be placed mainly
with German investors, both institutional and retail. Although Volkswagen is
unrated, it is considered a top credit by German investors in particular.
The deal was quoted at 100.3,  1/8 point with full fees of 1 5/8 points. The
proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate dollars.
Few new issues are expected to be launched this week, with Japan shut for
Golden Week and most of Europe closing down on Wednesday for May Day.
Staatsbank, the former East German central bank, raised a further DM4bn in
equal two- and five-year tranches. The notes pay interest at the three-month
Frankfurt interbank offered rate. The lead manager is Bayerische
Vereinsbank, with an international syndicate.
Both tranches were quoted within full fees.

VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle group, announced yesterday that it intended to
stop trading on the Finnish Stock Exchange because of the sharp risein the
costs of listing in Helsinki, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The company pointed out that Finland's bourse required an annual fee of
SKr225,000 (Dollars 37,000).
This makes it by far the most expensive foreign exchange among the 15
exchanges throughout the 10 countries where the Volvo share is listed.
Volvo added that by contrast the London Stock Exchange required an annual
fee of SKr46,000.
The company added that in London more than 11m Volvo shares were traded last
year, compared with 200,000 shares in Helsinki.
'The cost is not in sensible proportion to the volume of trading,' pointed
out Mr Hans Renstrom, company spokesman.

CANADA'S longest post-war recession and a drastic decline in advertising
continue to take a heavy toll on the country's two largest newspaper
publishing groups.
Southam, with 17 dailies, suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 13.4m
(USDollars 11.5m), or 23 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 14.7m,
or 26 cents, a year earlier,on revenues of CDollars 412m, against CDollars
432m. There is speculation of further staff cuts and possibly asset sales.
The group includes Commercial Printing and a large bookstore chain.
Torstar publishes Canada's largest daily, the Toronto Star, and operates
Harlequin Books. It earned CDollars 6.1m, or 16 cents a share, down from
CDollars 20.9m, or 54 cents. Revenues were CDollars 212m against CDollars
229m.
Torstar owns 23 per cent of Southam's common shares and Southam 30 per cent
of Torstar's non-voting stock.

<TEXT>
THE ARGENTINE subsidiary of Firestone, the Japanese-owned tyre company, has
threatened to close down if the government forces a demand for an estimated
USDollars 60m-Dollars 100m in back taxes.
Several other subsidiaries of multinational companies also face heavy
taxdemands. Among them is British American Tobacco and Perkins.
However, Firestone, headed by Mr Manuel Balbis, who is also president of
Argentina's American Chamber of Commerce, has taken the most aggressive
stance towards the DGI, Argentina's tax department. He said: 'Our net worth
is about Dollars 22m. There is no way we can pay the kind of money they are
asking for.'
The dispute began in 1985, when companies bought and sold government tax
rebates on an apparently legal secondary market. The companies now being
pressed for payment paid their taxes with rebates bought from Koner-Salgado,
an Argentine conglomerate.
A DGI investigation in 1985 found evidence of fraud in Koner-Salgado's tax
rebates. It subsequently rejected payments made with its certificates.
However, Mr Balbis claims the DGI's findings were not made public until
1988, when Firestone ceased buying from Koner-Salgado.
The case has come to a head after a final deadline for payment expired last
week. The Supreme Court ruled that companies must pay first before
negotiating with the DGI.
Growinginterest in Argentina by foreign investors could be undermined unless
a satisfactory compromise can be found.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said: 'We are prepared to discuss
(anything) within the law and we are doing that.' He added, however, that
'it is not within the powers of the DGI not to collect (taxes) that the law
requires it to collect.'
However, a diplomat monitoring the case said the government would try to put
off the problem until its finances were in better shape.

Lower nickel deliveries, down from 17.7m to 14.9m lbs, as the company was
recovering from a boiler explosionwhich cut output, and higher production
costs were only partly offset by higherrealised nickel prices.
PT Inco, 58 per cent owned by Inco of Canada, realised Dollars 3.02 a lb for

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Press Holdings (SPH) succeeded in lifting both profits and
turnover in the first half, resisting the downward trend set by many
publishing and newspaper groups worldwide.
Group turnover for the half-year to February of SDollars 274.5m (USDollars
157.2m) was 8.5 per cent higher, while group pre-tax profits jumped 30 per
centto SDollars 110.4m from SDollars 85m.
The improvement came on the back of higher advertising revenue in the first
quarter, rationalisation of group operations and cost containment, and lower
depreciation charges.
Although investment income of SDollars 9.4m was pegged at the February 1990
level, provisions for a reduction inthe value of investments of SDollars
1.1m last time turned into a writeback of SDollars 3.2m this half-year. This
was due to higher market values.
A writeback of similar provisions for long-term investments boosted
extraordinary profits by SDollars 5.4m. This was part of a SDollars 12.8m
provision made for SPH's 5 per cent stake in The South China Morning Post
acquired from Mr Rupert Murdoch.
The move helped offset further losses incurred by an associated company,
amounting to SDollars 2.6m.
Group attributable profits were consequently lifted 43.4 per cent, from
SDollars 57.2m to SDollars 82.1m in February, while earnings per share rose
from 23.3 to 31.2 cents.
The directors forecast that, with the end of the Gulf war, operating results
for the second half year are expected to remain satisfactory.
The g roup's performance was in line with the forecasts of analysts, who
expect advertising revenue to increase as the local economy picks up.
An interim dividend of 8 cents per share was declared.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Axe falls on N American forestry
 -A big shake-up looms in the battered industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The harsh bite of recession, plus far-reaching changes in the market for
wood products, are creating the need for a big shake-up in the North
American forestry industry.
A spate of acquisitions, mergers, financialrestructurings, mill closures,
and product-mix adjustments are among the likelyoutcomes as US and Canadian
companies, some of them heavily burdened with debt,ponder their response to
the unexpectedly severe turbulence.
In a typical comment, Mr Amit Wadhwaney of MJ Whitman &amp; Co, a New York
securities firm, said: 'You've seen some excesses and you're going to see
some unwinding.'
Few sectors other than real estate have been battered harder than the
forestryindustry over the past year. Its biggest customers - the publishing
and construction industries, for instance - are themselves among the most
tightly-squeezed victims of the business slowdown.
With the sole exception of Kimberly-Clark, the tissue maker which is as much
a consumer products company as a forestry one, the industry leaders suffered
steep declines in first-quarter earnings. Several are deep in the red (see
table).
The Dollars 7m loss posted by Georgia-Pacific, the biggest producer, would
have been Dollars 50m were it not for the sale of containerboard and
corrugated packaging businesses.
Mr Gary Palmero, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, estimates that the shares of
forestry companies are nowat their biggest discount to book value - over 50
per cent on average  - in more than 30 years.
No improvement is likely in Sigler, chairman of Connecticut-based Champion
International, sums up the industry's mood with: 'The second quarter looks
tough, and beyond that it's too soon to tell.'
The recession has snaked through the forestry industry like a line of
falling dominoes, hitting one product after another. Newsprint was the
first, followed by lumber, pulp and, most recently, uncoated white papers.
The slump in white papers largelyexplains Boise Cascade's slide to a Dollars
16.9m first-quarter loss.
The outlook for coated papers is also clouded by over-capacity. Offshore
markets, one of the first quarter's few bright spots, will be threatened if
the US dollar sustains its recent advance.
Wilting demand is pushing down prices for most products. According to the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the US consumed 6.2per cent less
newsprint in the first two months of this year than during the same period
in 1990. A 5.5 per cent price hike which was supposed to take effect on
January 1 has been quietly abandoned. Discounts are the order of the day.
Equally worrying for the industry is growing spare capacity, caused partly
bythe recession but also by the start-up of pulp and paper mills conceived
duringthe heady days of the late 1980s. Mr Palmero estimates, for instance,
that US newsprint capacity will grow by almost 5 per cent this year and
another 2.6 per cent in 1992.
Meanwhile, the cost of building new mills, modernising old ones, and of
acquisitions has swollen the industry's debt. Georgia-Pacific's long-term
debt more than doubled to Dollars 5.2bn last year following its purchase of
GreatNorthern Nekoosa.
Stone Container of Chicago, which is widely regarded as one of the weakest
companies in the US industry, has Dollars 396m in debt maturing this year,
and another Dollars 471m in 1992.
An example of the highly-leveraged new projects is the Ponderay newsprint
mill in Washington state, jointly owned by Canadian Pacific Forest Products
and various US publishing companies. More than two thirds of the mill's
Dollars 352m cost was financed by debt. Cash flow from the project is
earmarked for debt repayment until a target debt-to-equity ratio is reached.
Although the industry's fortunes are bound to improve when the economy picks
up, producers also face wrenching structural changes.
Trees onceregarded as little more than weeds are increasingly being used in
timber products, pulp, and some grades of paper. Producers of high-quality
timber from the north-west US and western Canada, battling to remain
competitive, are moving as fast as possible away from 'commodity' grades to
value-added building materials and manufactured paper products.
Environmental pressures are also forcingchanges. The growing use of recycled
paper is eroding demand for virgin timber. Stricter forest conservation
rules threaten to shrink the amount of timber available for cutting, while
pushing up transport and logging costs.
Some companies have started to face reality. Weyerhaeuser has sold assets
worth Dollars 400m inthe past two years, including a hardwood factory and a
beauty aids centre. Abitibi-Price, the biggest Canadian newsprint producer,
will soon shut down one of its mills.
Analysts are dividing the industry's players into the strong and the weak.
The latter group, which includes Stone, Boise Cascade and most of the
Canadian companies, are likely to undergo the most radical surgery during
the looming shake-up.

The share sale raised some 250bn zlotys. The company plans to spend 115bn
zlotys this year on purchases of state sector food processing plants, a
metal works and on property and retail trade investments. Mr Dariusz
Przywieczerski, the managing director, said he was 'confident' about this

Mr Wieslaw Panter, themanaging director at the Krosno glass works has
resigned after trading in the company's shares were suspended during last
weeks's session on Warsaw's new stock exchange. The suspension came when the
number of potential sellers exceeded buyers by over 5 to 1 and the company's
share price was fixed at 54,000 zlotys or 10 per cent below the previous
week's price to await the next session taking place today.
Business Centres of the US has set up a joint venture with the Warsaw

sale contract
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S attorney general has advised the government not to sell the Israel
Discount Bank group back to its original owner, Mr Raphael Recanati, because
of charges against him for his role in a share price scandal.
The IDB groupwas the first Israeli bank put up for sale by the government,
which hopes to divest itself of its majority shareholding in the country's
four leading commercial banks.
The government acquired control of the banks in 1983, when it bailed them
out of a share crisis that threatened to topple the banking system. The
Recanati family submitted the only bid for IDB.
The attorney general's recommendation is likely to to slow down the bank
sale process in Israel. The treasury had hoped to finance at least part of
the heavy costs of absorbing an influx of Soviet immigrants this year by
selling off its assets. It had assumed that at least two big banks would be
sold by the end of the year.
In a legalopinion addressed to the finance minister and the central bank
governor, the attorney general, Mr Joseph Harish, stressed that 'essential
public needs' justified breaking a contract signed by the government and the
Recanati family over the sale of IDB.
The opinion noted that the charges pending against Mr Recanati were
especially severe since they 'related specifically to the areas of banking
and securities which, by nature, are based on special relations of trust
with the public.'
Mr Harish's legal opinion endorsed the view of Bank of Israel governor Mr
Michael Bruno, who several months ago urged the government to suspend
negotiations with the Recanati family until the court had ruled on the case.
A ministerial economics committee, headed by finance minister Yitzhak Modai,
then rejected the governor's recommendation, on the grounds that it would
mean violating the contract signed with Mr Recanati.
In his legal opinion, Mr Harish said that although the Recanati family had
previously owned the bank, it still needed a permit from the Bank of Israel
to purchase the bank. The attorney general recommended that the central bank
not grant him this permit.

<TEXT>
LTV, the third largest US steel group, yesterday reported a first-quarter
net loss of Dollars 46.3m, which it blamed on a slump in demand for cars and
household appliances.
LTV, which has been operating under the protection of the US bankruptcy
courts since 1986, is the latest in a succession of US steel manufacturers
to report first-quarter losses stemming from the North American economic
downturn.
The net loss, on sales of Dollars 1.43bn, compared with income of Dollars
44.2m on sales of Dollars 1.49bn last time. The loss per share was 46 cents,
against earnings last year of 32 cents.
LTV's steel operations reported a first-quarter operating loss of Dollars
48.8m, before restructuring charges, against operating income of Dollars
41.1m in the first quarter of 1990.
Shipments declined by 356,000 tons, due to lower demand for cold-rolled
sheets, hot-rolled sheets and galvanised products.
In February the group reached a preliminary agreement on settlement of
along-running pensions liability battle. The deal should eventually pave the
wayfor it to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.
LTV said yesterday it intended to file a preliminary plan of reorganisation
by May 6. It stressed that negotiations on many key issues would be needed
before its creditors could agree ona package.

AXA, the French insurance group, has reported a 23 per cent rise in net
profits last yearto FFr3.35bn (Dollars 560m)
The group, including the former Compagnie du Midi but not the Normandy
mutual companies which are its ultimate owners, said insurance premium
income rose by 8 per cent to FFr39.4bn, with gross revenue from banking and
financial services rising 25 per cent to FFr7.1bn.
Direct earnings from Axa's insurance activity dropped, while the group
benefited from capital gains on the sales of some of the substantial
industrial stakes held by the former Midi, including Brasseries et Glacieres
Internationales, the African brewing group, and Garonor, the huge road
transport deport north of Paris.
Mr Claude Bebear, Axa's chairman, is still looking at a number of possible
acquisitions in the US insurance market after the collapse last year of his

NOVO Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company specialising in insulin
production and diabetic care, plans a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 223m) rights issue.
At the annual general meeting on April 24, the board won agreement to
increase share capital by up to a total of nominal DKr160m in one or more
stages, distributed proportionally between A and B shares. The ceiling on
increases in share capital in connection with acquisitions was raised from
nominal DKr60m to DKr100m.
The company said group sales for 1990 rose by 10 per cent to DKr8bn while
pre-tax earnings grew by 8 per cent to DKr1.1bn. Insulin sales grew 19 per
cent and the company reported significant market share gains in key areas
such as the US and Japan.
Results for the first quarter of this year, which are due in mid-May, are
forecast to follow this favourable trend and based on this the company has
opted for a pre-emptive rights issue.
In the short term it expects investment needs to be substantial.

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA, Norway's second biggest bank, yesterday unveiled a
first-quarter net loss of NKr279m (Dollars 40.9m),compared with a net profit
of NKr260m in the same period last year.
The s etback stemmed mainly from lower net interest income, which fell to
NKr724m from NKr853m, and higher loan loss provisions which more than
doubled to NKr610m from NKr267m in the first quarter of 1990.
Group operating profit, before credit losses, fell to NKr351m in the quarter
from NKr546m.
Mr Sverre Walter Rostoft, president, admitted the result is weak but said
that the bank had started 1991 better than it had ended 1990.
One bright spot was an increase in non-interest income which rose NKr496m
from NKr468m last year, mainly due to an increase to NKr108m in gains on
foreign exchange trading from NKr68m last year. Profits on securities
trading rose slightly to NKr110m from NKr107m.
Costs rose to NKr887m in the quarter from NKr790m last year mainly due to
restructuring. The bank forecast that expenses in 1991 will be lower than in
1990 when they reached NKr3.9bn.
Mr Rostoft said the bank's old headquarters is for sale which could produce
a profit of up to NKr400m.

FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Looking for something to build
on: Lafarge Coppee seeks to cement its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching the economy for signs of an upturn can be hard enough at any time,
but with weather fluctuations and the Gulf crisis disturbing the signals,
the task becomes even more unsettling.
'I would love to have a clear model to hang on to,' says Mr Bertrand
Collomb, chairman of Lafarge Coppee,the largest French cement and
construction materials group.
For 1990, the impact was clear enough. The recession in North America,
especially in Canada,made a dent in Lafarge's earnings. Lafarge Corporation,
the group's US offshoot, suffered an 8 per cent drop in operating profits,
with net profits stable at FFr2.19bn (Dollars 360m) thanks to higher
exceptional gains and a lower tax charge.
Europe, on the other hand - especially Lafarge's domestic market in France -
showed only a slight downturn. In Spain, Lafarge's Asland subsidiary,
acquiredin 1989, continued to produce strong profits despite a flattening of
the cementmarket and an increase in competition from imports.
Mr Collomb does not expect much of a pick-up in business in North America
before the end of the year, although he notes significant regional
variations: Florida, he says, is now a disastrous market for cement, as bad
as Ontario was last year, whereas the GreatLakes have resisted the recession
better and Texas is now recovering.
More disconcerting, however, were Lafarge's difficulties in two other
markets which are expanding rapidly: plasterboard and bio-technologies.
In plasterboard, where the group ranks second in Europe with a 25 per cent
market share sinceit teamed up last year with Redland of the UK,
overcapacity has led to price-cutting wars. Operating profits in this sector
halved last year to FFr136m.
'It is clear prices are at levels where no-one earns any money, but we
consider that we are among the most competitive,' he says.
Over the longer term, Lafarge expects the plasterboard market to show annual
growth of 5 per cent. For the immediate future, Mr Collomb draws
encouragement from a recent price riseintroduced in the UK by BPB, the
market leader, but still expects 1991 to be a difficult year.
Lafarge's bio-technologies division, meanwhile, sank backto an operating
loss of FFr59m last year, after profits of FFr212m in 1989. Buffeted by the
decline in the dollar, the lysine business, making animal feedstuffs, saw
prices plunge by 30 per cent, although Mr Collomb says demand is still
strong for products like monosodium glutamate, and the seeds division showed
a slight improvement.
This division is the one which financial analysts have always had the most
difficulty in reconciling with Lafarge's core businesses in the construction
materials sector, but Mr Collomb appears ready to persevere withthis
diversification.
Seeds, however, are one sector where Lafarge is rethinking its position. Mr
Collomb plans to continue developing its vegetable and flower seed sector,
but he is now seeking a partner in the cereal seeds business to enable the
group to take better advantage of the research it has put in.
For 1991, Mr Collomb denies adopting a defensive posture, although he admits
to a prudent approach. He plans to continue exploiting the reserves of
profitability in the companies Lafarge has acquired over the last two years
 -which he says are already making a positive contribution to earnings after
financing costs - by bringing productivity up to the group's normal levels,
and to maintain industrial investments.
The overall investment budget will be restricted to what Lafarge can cover
with its own cashflow, or around FFr5bn, but the acquisitions budget will be
reined in after the FFr12bn spending spree of the last two years - although
there could still be room for acquisitions up to around FFr2.5bn, perhaps in
Lafarge's developing paints and special building materials division.
'We are not expecting a miraculous economic upturn, but we are not going
into hibernation,' Mr Collomb says.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: TR High Income joins the rights issue
bandwagon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TR HIGH Income Trust yesterday became the latest investment trustto join the
rights issue bandwagon with a Pounds 9.1m offer.
The issue is thefirst rights offer ever made by a trust managed by Touche
Remnant. The High Income Trust, which was launched in November 1989, was
specifically targeted at private investors, who currently own about 75 per
cent of the equity.
The attraction of income-bearing shares, particularly allied to the tax
advantages of a Personal Equity Plan, means that the trust has regularly
been able to trade ata premium to net assets.
There are two classes of shares in the trust, ordinary and subscription. The
latter can be converted into ordinary shares at 100p and are also entitled
to a dividend of 1.5p.
Shareholders are being offered one new ordinary share for every two ordinary
and/or subscription shares they currently hold and one new subscription
share for every 10 ordinary and/or subscription shares they own. The issue
is being underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing.
The ordinary shares are offered at 100p and the subscription shares at 27p
each, compared with an estimated net asset value per ordinary share of 101p.
Directors said they intend to pay further interim dividends of 1.4pfor July
31, October 31 and January 31 1992. The ordinary shares closed 4p lower at
106p and the subscription shares fell 2p to 30p.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: AB Electronic sells Page offshoots to
reduce gearing
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AB ELECTRONIC Products, the Welsh electronic components manufacturer, has
sold its aerospace and defence subsidiaries, Page Engineering (Holdings) and
Page Aerospace, to reduce gearing and concentrate on its core business.
Both Page companies, based at Sunbury-on-Thames, have been bought for Pounds
6.25m by a consortium led by Lloyds Development Capital which includes the
existing management.
Earlier this month AB passed its interim dividend after announcing a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 2.02m for the six months to December, compared with profits
of Pounds 5.35m last time. It also said group debt had increased to Pounds
39m, representing 90 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Page, which employs about 260 people, made pre-taxprofits of Pounds 1.7m in
the year to June 30 1990 on turnover of Pounds 12.1m. Pro-formanet assets at
that date were Pounds 6.35m.
Sir Peter Phillips, AB chairman, said: 'Page's markets have little overlap
with the rest of the group. The board believed that the business should be
sold and the proceeds redeployed to assist the redevelopment of AB's core
business.'
Mr Peter Brooks, investment director of Lloyds Development Capital, said:
'Despite the current risks in the aerospace sector, we believe, in the long
term, Page offers an attractive investment. It has prudent sales forecasts,
positive cash flow, solid forward order books and a strong experienced
management team.'

<TEXT>
TWO MORE directorshave resigned from the board of Next, the fashion
retailing group which recently sold its Grattan mail order business to stave
off financial ruin.
Mr Brian Marber, a non-executive director who runs his own foreign exchange
consultancy, resigned because of his 'other business commitments'.
However, no explanation was provided for the resignation of Mr John Roberts,
the director listed in the company's annual report as being responsible for
retail and property services.
A short statement from the company said Mr Roberts would remainwith the
company for two years in an advisory capacity.
The departures follow the resignation of Mr Peter Lomas, finance director,
earlier this month. Mr Lomas is to become Grattan's finance and computer
services director.
Following their departure the Next board will be left with two executive
directors and four non-executive directors.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: PPP to launchlife subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE PATIENTS Plan, the second largest UK medical insurer behind Bupa, is
planning to launch a life insurancecompany, PPP Lifetime, in 1992, in a bid
to increase its share of the market for private medical insurance and
long-term care.
Six million people - about 12 per cent of the population  - are currently
covered by private health careschemes. With 885,000 subscribers (or
policyholders) PPP provides cover for 1.8m people.
The high cost of medical insurance premiums is one of the factors holding up
the market's growth. The fact that subscribers must pay higher premiums as
they get older has been a particular disincentive.
PPP's life subsidiary will offer schemes designed to confront this
difficulty by funding theincreased cost of future premiums, smoothing the
cost of medical insurance overan individual's life.
Mr Roy Forman, chief executive of PPP, also hopes to offer means of funding
possibly expensive long-term residential and nursing care in later life.
PPP announced the new development when reporting that its premium income had
grown by 19 per cent during 1990 to reach Pounds 355m, yielding a surplus of
Pounds 16m, 63 per cent more than in 1989. The underwriting surplus amounted
to Pounds 5.8m. Operating expenses rose by only 4 per cent per subscriber.
Although reserves were hit by the fall in equity markets, they remained at
Pounds 173m, a drop of 4 per cent, allowing the solvency margin to remain
strong at 52 per cent.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark weathers high street slump with
rise to Pounds 31.5m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C&amp;J CLARK, the largest shoe manufacturer in the UK and one of the country's
six largest private companies, weathered the high street retailing slump to
post a rise in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 31.52m compared with a
previous Pounds 30.32m.
The higher profits, which came on an increase in turnover to Pounds
605.79m(Pounds 599.93m), was attributed by the company to a retail-led
marketing strategy it has recently adopted.
Profits from the core footwear manufacturing and retailing businesses,
including Clarks Shoes, K Shoes and Ravel, improved by over 50 per cent.
The company had previously tended to separate manufacturing and retail
activities. However, three years ago it started to let retailing
considerations take the lead, which resulted in more interesting shoes in
the shops and prices that were more in line with what customers were willing
to pay, it said.
Replacing the former shop names of new shops with the Clark's namehad
improved business significantly and the group's new shops in the UK were
strong contributors to profits.
The group was less fortunate in its US operations, where the strong dollar
made it difficult to export there.
Exports comprise 10 to 15 per cent of overall sales. It also has quite a
substantial amount of dollar-denominated capital tied up in the US business
which becomes negative when converted into sterling, it said.
Property profits also made alower contribution of Pounds 8m last year
compared with Pounds 13m in 1989.
The buy-in of its shares cost the group Pounds 40m last year, which pushed
up borrowings 'but not to an uncomfortable extent,' the group said.
Earnings per share were maintained at 23.8p.

<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceutical, scientific equipment and horticulture group, has
bought the horticultural business of DSM, the Dutch chemical company, for
Pounds 10m cash.
The business, DSM Agro Specialties, includes a variety of marketing and
production units in the Netherlands and Belgium. Combined sales are believed
to about Pounds 10m ayear withoperating profits of Pounds 1m a year.
The acquisition will increasethe size of Fisons Horticulture, the smallest
of the group's three divisions, by about 10 per cent and will take it into
new geographical territory.
At present it operates mainly in the UK and North America. Apart from a
small operation in France, it has not been represented in continental
Europe.
The deal represents something of a change of heart by Fisons, which used to
have a 50 per cent stake in Asef, part of DSM Agro Specialties. Fisons sold
out to DSM in December 1988.
Asef is the leader in the Dutch amateur gardening market. DSM Agro
Specialties includes other professional and amateur horticulture businesses
and a liquid fertiliser plant at Geleen in the Netherlands.

Year-end gearing amounted to 80 per cent. The directors' objective is to
reduce borrowings via internal cash flow and continuing sales ofnon-core

<TEXT>
MOSS BROS Group, the menswear retailer and hirer, saw pre-tax profit for the
12 months to January 26 fall by 42 per cent to Pounds 2.39m after a sharp
reversal in interest income and property profits.
The comparative figure of Pounds 4.09m for the year to January 27 1990 had
been helped by an exceptional profit of Pounds 810,000 on the sale of a
central Londonproperty.
A Pounds 5m tax payment on a 1988 property sale - of a Covent Garden site
which netted Pounds 21m - halved interest received during the year to Pounds
768,000 (Pounds 1.49m).
Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said those two factors accounted for
about Pounds 1.5m of the Pounds 1.7m fall in pre-tax profit. Operating
profit declined by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.89m).
Turnover advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 54.76m (Pounds 51.11m). The
company opened a net five stores, bringing the total to 98 covering 150,000
(140,000) sq ft.
Mr Gee said a further 10,000 sq ft of planned expansion was shelved until
conditions improved.
He claimed the company's share of the men's suit market had risen from 5 to
5.5 per cent as 1,500 menswear shops had closed during the year.
Most of the expansion had come from the Suit Co shops, in the mainstream
division, where sales rose by just over 19 per cent to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds
18.6m).
The more up-market Savoy Taylors Guild chain - the classic division  - grew
to about Pounds 17m (Pounds 16.1m).
Mr Gee said it had been affected by what Austin Reed described last week as
the white-collar recession in the south-east of England.
Cecil Gee, the fashion division and the only one of the three chains not to
include a suit hire service, inched ahead to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13.5m).
Costs had, however, been hit by rent reviews where Mr Gee said the Next
expansion of the late 1980s had pushed up the 'rental evidence'.
Another adverse factor was the uniform business rate, where increases had
often been 30 per cent.
Payroll costs had been controlled, partly because they were sales and profit
related. 'Staff will accept a reduction in numbers more readily if they are
paid on commission,'he said.
Net cash held on January 26 amounted to Pounds 9m (Pounds 14m). Capital
spending had fallen to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 5m) and would be down again this
year.
Earnings per share fell to 9.43p, compared with 16.35p including property
profit and 13.11p without it.
The final dividend is held at 3.5p to give an unchanged total of 5p.
The Moss and Gee families hold 49 per cent of the equity.

THE RESILIENCE of its corporate clothing business helped Wensum, the
clothing company, report a 17 per centrise, from Pounds 635,000 to Pounds
746,000, in annual pre-tax profits.
The improvement for the year to January 26 1991 came on turnover of Pounds
8.86m (Pounds 7.55m) which included a 33 per cent sales increase in its
corporate wear division.
This side of the business was not subject to the same degree of slowdown
seen on the retail side, said Mr Andrew Hughes, chairman.
Operating profit in thecorporate clothing business was up to Pounds 472,000
(Pounds 311,000). Although deemed satisfactory, results for the clothing
side were not as buoyant. Turnover was up by 9 per cent to Pounds 5.33m and
operating profit by 7 per cent to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 458,000).
Gearing was reduced from 36 per cent to 13 per cent.
Earningsper share rose 13 per cent to 6.62p (5.85p) and a final dividend of
2.35p is recommended, making a total of 3.5p. The company was floated in
July 1989.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Warringtons shares suspended pending
finance statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Warringtons were suspended at 17 1/2 p yesterday morning pending
clarification of the commercial property company's financial position.
Alfred McAlpine,the construction group which last week announced a 1-for-2
rights issue and which owns 37 per cent of Warringtons' ordinary shares,
immediately said that it had made full provision against the investment in
its 1990 accounts.
Warringtons' announcement comes some two months after it had first revealed
it was attempting to refinance its business. Executives at the company were
not available for comment yesterday.
In February's statement, Warringtons said the marked decline in the UK
property market together with high interest rates had had aconsiderable
effect both on the capital value of its developments and its ability to
dispose of them.
In its 1990 accounts, McAlpine made a Pounds 20m below-the-line provision
against its investment in the company. The shares were obtained when it
injected its property activities into Warringtons in June 1988. Laterit also
acquired Pounds 9.5m worth of preference shares in the company.
Warringtons has not reported results since June last year, when it announced
a 26 percent rise, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.3m, in pre-tax profits for
the half year to March 31.
The shares, down from 66p in April last year, hit a low of 7p on the
statement two months ago.
The company expanded rapidly into property development and away from
contracting after new management led by Mr Graeme Jackson, chairman and
chief executive, took over early in 1987.
As at September1989, before it expanded further partly by acquiring more
properties from McAlpine, net assets per share stood at 100p. Shareholders'
funds then totalled Pounds 28m. The company had Pounds 26.13m worth of
secured short-term bank loans and overdrafts, and some Pounds 8m-worth of
long-term bank and mortgage loans. Midland is its principal banker.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Bundaberg Sugar attacks value of Tate &amp;
Lyle bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS OF Bundaberg Sugar, Australia's third largest raw sugar producer,
claimed yesterday that Tate &amp; Lyle's hostile takeover bid was pitched at
least 44 Australian cents a share too low.
In the defence document, they said Bundaberg's shares had been valued by
Macquarie Bank at between ADollars 4.54 and ADollars 5.16, valuing the
company at between ADollars 354m (Pounds 165m) and ADollars 402m.
Tate's offer - recently-increased from ADollars 3.70 to ADollars 4.10 per
share - values Bundaberg at ADollars 321m.
Macquarie said it was inappropriate to value a commodity stock like
Bundaberg on the basis of a weak point in the commodity price cycle, and
claimed Tate had undervalued the strategic advantage it would gain from
Bundaberg's milling and refining capacity.
The bank's report concluded that the implied value beingoffered for
Bundaberg's core milling and refining businesses was less than the prices
paid in comparable international acquisitions in the sweeteners industry,and
in Australian agricultural and food industry takeovers.
In particular, Macquarie said the offer was not in line with prices paid by
CSR, the Australian sugar and building materials group, for Pioneer Sugar in
1987, and by Tate &amp;Lyle for Redpath and Amstar in the US.
Mr Roy Diecke, Bundaberg chairman, said shareholders should reject Tate's
offer because it undervalued the company and was an opportunistic attempt to
take advantage of the weakness of the world sugar market.
He said Tate had not given shareholders 'the whole story' in its offer
document, and claimed Tate had quoted sugar prices selectively to play down
Bundaberg's performance over the last decade.
'The profitability of the company will follow the sugar price cycle, but the
company has progressed through difficult times in the past,' Mr Diecke said.
Mr Geoff Mitchell, managing director, said Bundaberg had outperformed the
Consumer Prices Index and the index of Australia's 50 most traded shares
since its formation in 1972. Mr Paul Keating, the federal treasurer (finance
minister) signed an order yesterday giving the Foreign Investment Review
Board another 90 days to decide whether to approve Tate's bid if it is
accepted by shareholders.
The bid hasprompted strong local opposition in Queensland, where Bundaberg
is based, but neither the federal government nor the board have given any
indication of their likely response.
Bundaberg's shares closed at ADollars 3.85 on the Australian Stock Exchange
yesterday. The shares were ADollars 3.52 immediately before Tate launched
its bid.

FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boosting the spirits of a shaken giant:
Measures being taken to rebuild confidence in the Pounds 4bn Allied-Lyons
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the UK drinks and food group, has discovered that six months
can be a long time in business as well as in politics.
Last October, brewing industry analysts were hailing the emergence of a more
active management style and the prospect of accelerating growth from the
group's array of spirit brands, pub property, and food.
That view was apparently confirmed with the announcement in January that Sir
Derrick Holden-Brown, chairman, and Mr Richard Martin, chief executive,
would retire next year to make way for a new management team headed by Mr
Michael Jackaman, vice-chairman and head of the group's spirits division.
Then lastmonth came the confidence-shattering blow of a Pounds 150m loss on
foreign exchange dealings.
Mr Clifford Hatch, the finance director, took responsibility for the weak
management controls that the loss implied, and resigned: and it now seems
likely that both Sir Derrick, doyen of the brewing industry, and Mr Martin
will soon follow.
Allied aims to sort out its top management problems within the next two
weeks.
If any further stimulus to rapid action is necessary, it comes from the
renewed rumblings of a threatened takeover bid.
Ofthe possible predators, only Hanson would appear to have the current
resources to make a bid for a group of Allied's size.
Its market capitalisation is Pounds 4bn; but brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd
estimate that the company's assets areworth Pounds 11 per share - or more
than twice as much - on the open market.
Against those assets, BZW calculates that the effects of the management
problems should be short-term and minimal while the long-term potential of
the group remains considerable.
The Pounds 150m foreign exchange loss is expected to reduce pre-tax profits
for the year ended February 28 1991 by 15 per cent to Pounds 478m. Group
debt - nearly Pounds 2bn at the half-year end last September - will be
reduced by less than forecast. Gearing, which had been expected to come down
from 80 per cent to 60 per cent is likely to remain about 70 per cent.
That may impose some constraints this year, but most analysts are predicting
a strong resumption of growth, with pre-tax profits in 1991-92 rising to
Pounds 690m.
Allied has suffered to some extent from the market's focus on its
traditional brewingoperations rather than its emergence during the past five
years as one of the world's leading spirits companies.
It was a Pounds 1.8bn bid from Elders, now Fosters Brewing, that triggered
Allied's acquisition in 1986 of the Canadian spirits business, Hiram Walker,
and put it on the international map.
The groupthen consolidated its position with the Pounds 545m purchase of
Whitbread's spirits operations in late 1989.
More than half the group's profits now come fromits spirits divisions - 'and
this is the major attraction of Allied's shares,' says Mr John Wakely,
analyst at Shearson Lehman.
It has taken time to bed down the acquisitions but management is now tightly
focused on markets, distribution - including a joint venture with Suntory,
the Japanese drinks giant - and realising brand potential as consumers
worldwide drink less but drink better.
Ballantine's, its top-selling Scotch whisky, has achieved rapid growthin
Europe and Japan and makes an estimated profit of Pounds 82m a year.
Courvoisier last year recorded a bigger sales growth than any other cognac.
Kahlua, one of the world's best-selling liqueurs, contributes some Pounds
75m a year in profits; Canadian Club is the third-largest Canadian whisky
brand; Beefeater, the fourth-ranked gin brand.
'The international brands are as good as those of Guinness,' says Mr Wakely.
'And eventually, Allied is going to make as much of them as Guinness does. I
believe they will be contributing 60 per cent of the group's profits by the
mid-1990s.'
Within the UK, however, it is still Allied's brewing business that seems to
command more attention.
The group is widely regarded - by Mr Peter Lilley, secretary for industry,
among others - as having been slow to react to the changes being forced upon
the industry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Uncertainty persists about its intention to remain in both brewing and pub
retailing.
It has held abortive talks with Whitbread about a merger of their brewing
interests. Rumours are rifeabout its interest in acquiring both breweries
and pubs from Brent Walker. It has tried to buy the European rights to the
Castlemaine lager that it brews underlicence in the UK.
The government's beer orders will force it to free 2,400 of its pubs from
tied beer supplies if it remains in brewing in November 1992. So far, it has
sold just over 500 and leased another 300. It plans to lease most of the
remainder, but its disposal programme is running behind that of Bass,for
instance.
On the other hand, Allied has improved its beer market share to about 15 per
cent through a supply agreement with Greenall Whitley; and itdoes have a
strong portfolio of brands, including Tetley's, the UK's best-selling ale.
Its pub assets may not yet be fully utilised but there is generalagreement
that the regionally-managed estate includes many well-sited pubs whose
potential is being developed with a shift towards food and premium drinks.
Brewing and pub retailing contributes about 30 per cent of Allied's profits.
The J Lyons food business, which contributes 17 per cent of group profits,
has tended to be dismissed because of its focus on mature markets such as
tea.
But the operations were subjected to an intensive strategic review in 1989
and have been reorganised under Mr Tony Hales, now one of the front-runners
for the post of chief executive. Allied disposed of its UK cereals and US
frozenfood businesses, and has focused on four sectors: franchising,
beverages, bakery and ingredients.
Its franchising activities include Baskin Robbins, theworld's leading ice
cream store operation, and Dunkin' Donuts, the US doughnut chain which it
acquired 18 months ago for Pounds 196m.
Tea provides 75 per cent of the profits of the beverages sector. Tetley is a
Pounds 100m grocery brand in the UK, which makes it bigger than Kelloggs
corn flakes or Heinz baked beans. Market share is increasing following the
introduction of round tea bags in mid-1989.
Here, as in its other operations, there is evidence that Allied was
developing, if sometimes slowly, a sound sense of direction and purpose
before theunexpected shock of the foreign exchange losses.
If management can recover its poise, the potential remains to be unlocked
and the progress of recent years resumed.

<TEXT>
UK investment trusts spent years wondering how to narrow the discount
between their share prices and net asset values. Now, with paper in fashion
and someof the more specialised niche trusts commanding premiums, a growing
band of managers is rushing to the market with rights issues. Yesterday's
Pounds 9.1m cash call by TR High Income Trust might seem a touch
opportunistic, designed to improve the management company's own bottom line.
It can be defended, though, as a reasonably attractive way for individuals
who have taken out personal equity plans withTouche to step up their
investment. Even so, such issues should not become a habit.

<TEXT>
While the Department of Trade and Industry is worrying whether stockbrokers'
analysts should lunch with the companies they cover - it seems to be
concerned that they might learn too much - a much more important issue for
London's financial markets is in limbo. Taurus, the paperless share
settlement system which isvital if London is to remain the centre of
Europe's securities industry, has already been delayed. Now the hold-up is
lengthening because the DTI cannot decidewhether to regulate Taurus itself,
delegate the job to London's existing regulatory organisations, or leave it
to the Stock Exchange which will operate the system.
The neatest solution would be to leave the job to the Exchange, reporting to
the DTI. Regulation is quite messy enough in London already. It is to be
hoped that the DTI can tell a lunch from a landmine.

FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Granada Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though Derek Lewis's days in charge of Granada may be numbered.
The shares have underperformed by more than 50 per cent sincethe beginning
of 1989 and institutional shareholders appear to be baying for blood. Mr
Lewis cannot be blamed for all the recent errors - but he is rightly held
accountable for the costly diversification into computer services. Even if
the basic thinking cannot be faulted, management feuding between the
division's component parts should have been stopped sooner.
The most important question, though, is when the long-rumoured rights issue
will finally materialise. Granada is highly geared - more than 80 per cent
on the basis of the last published report and accounts - and capital
spending, though down, is likely to be around Pounds 200m in the current
year. Still, the group can relieve the pressure through disposals, with
bingo likely to be first on the block.
Delaying an issue till the end of the year to take advantage of hoped-for
signs of economic recovery, a clearer outlook for BSkyB and a renewed TV
franchise might seem attractive. Against that, there is currently a proven
appetite for paper - at least with Mr Lewis out of the way - and some may
feel it prudent to strengthen the balance sheet ahead of the forthcoming TV
bid. The Independent Television Commission, which will award the franchise,
is clearly minded to give Granada another term - as long as its overall
corporate health can be demonstrated.

FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, British Gas has accepted a much harsher pricing regime
than the market was expecting. Yet the shares barely moved, so perhaps the
Ofgas review was in the price after all. That probably under-estimates the
company's efforts yesterday to limit the damage. In admitting the scale of
available efficiency gains, British Gas gives a hint why it was so keen to
avoid referring the proposals to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Accepting the Ofgas formulae on domestic pricing and cost pass-through may
have been a risk; but presumably it seemed a lesser one than exposing the
company's remaining layers of post-privatisation fat to the official
scalpel.
The question is whether the review leaves British Gas less able to deliver
real earnings and dividend growth. Even allowing for the gas industry's
heady expansion, the company's medium-term rate of annual earnings growth
may have halved to around 5 per cent. Anything more will largely depend on
the success of the cost-cutting programme. As for dividend prospects, the
water and electricity sectors look far more stable.
British Gasshares have steadily under-performed the market this year; in
relative terms, they are not far off where they were three years ago. The
prospective yield of 6.7 per cent is justified until the company proves the
case for a better rating - assuming, of course, that the regulator does not
further tighten his grip.

FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Paying the bill for German unity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,498.2 (+26.9)
The G7 wrangle has been billed as a battle between German monetary rectitude
and US profligacy - with virtue winning on points. Judging by the arguments
with which the fiveGerman economic institutes yesterday attacked the case
for higher interest rates, German rectitude is not what it used to be. High
inflation by itself would help slow economic growth, they said, and a
further tightening of monetary policy was therefore unnecessary.
When economists with feebler currencies put such arguments, the German
economic establishment met them with a horse-laugh. No more. With wage
settlements running at 6 to 7 per cent, and likely year-end inflation around
5 per cent, the historic German trade-off between rising prices andeconomic
growth seems to have shifted.
Germany's original partners in the narrow band of the ERM mostly have
relative inflation targets, not absolute ones. The Netherlands perhaps
apart, they are as happy at 4 1/2 per cent inflation as at 3 per cent, so
long as Germany is at 5. The German voter's preference for paying the unity
bill in higher prices rather than higher taxes gives the ERM a dragging
anchor at the expense of higher European inflation and, in time, lower bond
prices.
Part of this is doubtless already in the price; the next movein German bond
yields could even be downwards. But if Germany really is developing a higher
tolerance for inflation, such a drop might not last. UK investors wondering
if convergence with German inflation levels means a long term shift into
bonds and out of equities still have much to ponder.

Sir, In his exposition of a policy for economic development Mr Katz's
inclusion of Hong Kong among countries that exert a degree ofcontrol over
their economies is misleading.
In fact, Hong Kong is an example of a different policy for economic
development. Specifically, the Hong Kong government provides neither
protection from import competition, nor export incentives, tax or other
financial help; nor are key prices adjusted through tax rebates, tariffs,
duties and subsidies.
It is not for us to take sides as to which is the better policy for whatever
circumstances others find themselves in, but our policy has served us
remarkably well.

   From Dr BOB MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stanley Katz made a number of interesting points in his article ('East
Europe should learn from Asia', April 24) about the problems inherent in
eastern Europe's adopting the 'liberal' free market approach to entry into
the world economy. Proposing the state-interventionist or 'corporatist'
strategy of Japan and the newly-industrialised countries (NICs), Katz's
solution certainly appears viable in the light of the NICs' experience from
the 1950s to 1980s.
However, two points are worth making. First, although there are signs that
Czechoslovakia and Hungary are beginningto adopt a 'corporatist' approach
(in contrast to Poland's liberal free market policies), because of a
short-sighted economic focus, it is doubtful whether the OECD states and
international banking institutions would offer political or economic support
to countries adopting a long-term export substituting strategy (a core
element in the success of NICs). The debt problem in eastern Europe in
particular would need to be radically reduced for this approach to get off
the ground; but witness the current political row over the 50 per cent
write-off of Polish debt to western governments.
This raises the second point in that any strategy adopted in eastern Europe,
as Katz rightly concludes, will need public support. However, the social
problems of the NICs have often been played down in the west (even in Japan
last year this was manifested in urban unrest in Osaka). In particular, the
often appalling conditions of female industrial workers in NICs demonstrates
the social price paid for 'success' in the world economy.
These problems may well be repeated in eastern Europe unless greater forms
of political and industrial democracy are developed, whereby the populations
achieve a genuine involvement in changes in their societies. This is not
utopianism,but a political necessity. It is in the interest of neither east
nor west to see social unrest pushing countries such as Poland into
authoritarian solutions inrelation to free market reforms.

FT  30 APR 91 / Letter: Pensions - the unacceptable wait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYN DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Brian MacMahon, chairman of the National Association of Pension
Funds, tells us that rather than having a compulsory equalisation of pension
benefits for men and women it would be better '. . .made on a voluntary and
planned basis within an acceptable timescale'. (Letters, April 26). What he
is mainly against is compulsory retrospection, which he says is '. . .both
impractical and expensive'.
He does not explain why retrospection is impractical, and I suspect that his
use of the word, except in relation to a limited number of schemes which
have kept inadequate records, is simply rhetorical.
What is more understandable is the pensions industry's opposition on the
grounds of cost. But even here most of the figures I have seen quoted so far
for the overall cost have been unreasonably high and in some cases absurd.
They seem to have been put forward more as part of a propagandawar than as a
serious actuarial assessment.
Pension costs are notoriously difficult to pin down. But the impact of the
additional costs of equalisation will be much lower than often suggested,
for the following reasons:
a significant number of schemes have already equalised benefits (see the
NAPF's own survey);
many of the schemes which have not equalised benefits in theory have done so
in practice, for example allowing men to retire early on unreduced benefits;
for many schemes, lowering the retirement age for men means significant
savings on the cost of death benefits and ill-health pensions;
costs canbe spread over a long period and do not all have to be met
'up-front'.
Mr MacMahon showed no understanding of unequal benefits now clearly being
against the law of the land. He seems to be aligning himself with the
protesters against the poll-tax who campaigned under the slogan 'can't pay -
won't pay']
When the NAPF say that there should not be any element of compulsory
retrospection, it means that it will take 40 years or more before all
discrimination in pension schemes is eliminated. This is clearly
unacceptable. We can only hope that a more constructive response is
forthcoming from the pensions industry.

Sir, Your editorial ('Steel: crisis, what crisis?' April 22) raises some
interesting questions abouthow Britain obtains fair competition while

Sir, What welcome relief toread your leader 'Changing the constitution'
(April 26). Electoral reform andespecially fixed term parliaments are vital.
There was however one majoromission - the removal of the Monarch's
constitutional powers. There continuesto be an anomaly in that the fair
society we strive to create is one based on advancement through merit and
yet at the same time the head of state is a hereditary position. Which
political party will grasp this thorny issue?

FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Ravel, Strauss and Haydn - Weekend music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The events of the London Symphony Orchestra's 'Childhood' series are being
spread rather thinly. Too thinly, perhaps, for its theme - 'three centuries
of music inspired by the experience of childhood' - fully to register as a
coherent artistic statement. But in a single concert performance, that of
the second of Ravel's two one-act operas, the enterprise must surely have
found its surest point of focus; for under Michael TilsonThomas L'Enfant et
les sortileges came up miraculously fresh.
Even without benefit of stage props or movement, its ability to evoke all
the exhilarations, caprices, fears and tender affections of childhood seemed
on Sunday more acute and more precious than ever. The reason is that Tilson
Thomas does not place knowing quotation marks around the subordinate
episodes, comic or fantastic as may be, that form the opera's stages of
dramatic development. He understands that in the performance of this work,
simplicity of statement becomes a mark of high sophistication; he encouraged
the orchestra (and the LS Chorus, on trim-voiced form) to deliver themselves
with airy precision. The myriad colours and sound-inventions were touched in
with absolute firmness and clarity.
Some of the singers - Robert Tear as Teapot and Alfreda Hodgson as Chinese
Cup were themost obvious examples - were tempted to show the audience just
how much jolly good fun they were being, and having; but in the orchestra,
at least, the faces were kept, in the best way, entirely straight. This
directness was a quality shared by Frederica von Stade, whose Child was not
just beautifully sung, in excellent French; it was acted, by means of
touches of vocal colour and expressive nuances in the singer's platform
demeanour, in a way that showed that all the singer's imaginative resources
had been profoundly engaged.
Other membersof the large cast who struck the right note included David
Wilson-Johnson and Anne Howells as a pair of cats at once outrageously funny
and strictly stylish, Constance Hauman as the Fire, and Helen Field (though
lacking ideal purity of tone) as a poignantly vivid Princess.
As prelude to this small, perfect masterpiece, there was a rather peculiar
account of one of Benjamin Britten's comparative artistic failures: the 1969
Children's Crusade, dry in musical invention and second-hand (at least by
Britten standards) in dramatic purpose. The Finchley Children's Music Group
came out with full tone and authoritative attack, the various percussion and
keyboard players likewise; but the attempt at staging seemed unconscionably
arty, as well as painfully slow to get going.
'Mature' Strauss is a grab-bag, for all the famous tone-poems are 'early'.
He was already 40 when he composed the Symphonia Domestica, his penultimate
big-orchestra work; next year came the triumph of Salome - and then another
43 years' worth of operas, songs and little more but trumpery 'occasional'
pieces. Only at the age of 70 did he return to honest symphonic composition,
on a modest scale (the Oboe Concerto, the Metamorphosen); and music-lovers
have a deeper affection for the Four Last Songs, which he wrote at the age
of 84. Cheryl Studer sang those to a full house at the Royal Festival Hall
on Sunday, with Zubin Mehta and the London Philharmonic.
Mehta's programme was completed by two chunks of 'mature' orchestral music:
Strauss's ultimate symphonic poem, the 1915 Alpine Symphony, and the
'Symphonic Fragment' that the conductor Clemens Krauss cobbled together from
what Strauss had expected to be his last operatic score, Die Liebe der
Danae. (He got carried away later and wrote Capriccio.) That was a useless
exercise: nine minutes of Fragment, or rather fragments, neither convey the
ripe, heartfelt variety of this neglected opera nor make good
symphonicsense. Though Die Liebe der Danae is a forbiddingly expensive
proposition, it is high time that some company summoned up the courage, and
the cash, to do it justice.
In the Four Last Songs Miss Studer was a joy. She is another of those young
American singers who make smug European pretensions to special understanding
seem absurd. Not only was she the first soprano I've heard in the concert
hall who could project every phrase through Strauss's orchestral tapestry
(with Mehta's faithful care), but she fastened unerringly upon the sense of
each song. In the low register her timbre lacks character yet, but in every
crucial passage her tone was lustrous, her phrasing exquisite.
The Alpine Symphony, or more exactly 'An Alpine Symphony' - it isn't clear
whether Strauss meant that it was a Symphony which happened to have an
Alpine scenario, or expected it to be just one cliff-hanger among many - is
at any rate a monster; but also great fun, if heard at suitably rare
intervals. It is film-music for a documentary with aspirations; it goes on
for a long time, deploys enormous forces with sovereign ingenuity, is
pictorially dazzling and symphonically quite inert.
Mehta shaped its episodes with so professional a hand as to keep one's ears
pinned back, and the LPO played up splendidly. (The horns ran into some bad
luck, but earlier the solo-horn postlude of the song 'September' far
outweighed those lapses.) He stretched the central 'Vision' hard to extract
every expressive drop, and still more the Ausklang epilogue: I remembered a
late Barbirolli performance that milked the end of Ein Heldenleben in just
such a way, moving my father to tears.
This time, no tears were prompted: the post-climb peroration was
rhetorically imposing, but nothing more. That might have been Mehta's fault
 -but more likely, the music had nothing more to offer. Strauss knew
wellenough when a vein was exhausted, and in the Alpine Symphony the vital
pulse runs out.
Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony may have set a new speed record in Haydn's
'Nelson' Mass on Friday at the Festival Hall, but it was a tonic to hear.
There were no signs of complaint from the players, despite the violins being
revved up to escape-velocity in the Allegros; nor from the BBC Symphony
Chorus, who were startlingly good, even virtuoso. Their chorus-master
Stephen Jackson has brought this non-professional group to new heights. The
sopranos were intrepid and unanimous, the collective diction bright, the
balance of parts beautifully transparent.
In the heroic solo soprano role Rita Cullis made a slightly anxious start,
but from the Gloria onward she was strong and lucid. With far less to do,
the other soloists all made their marks: the mezzo Susan Bickleywith lovely
tone in the later movements, the tenor Kim Begley in ringing style,David
Wilson-Johnson soberly moving in the Qui tollis. Amidst this whole exuberant
reading, the famous irruption of warning trumpets made no great shock; more
typical was the playful, dancing close, which Davis plainly relished.
Soprano and bass lent their wordless voices to the slow movement of
Nielsen's Symphony no. 3, the 'Sinfonia espansiva', which Davis addressed
with lively purpose. Clean formal lines, precise attention to Nielsen's
original colour-contrasts,terrific energy: the Allegretto and Finale,
indeed, were enthusiastic to the point of violence. I preferred Davis's
cooler exposition of the earlier movements,which brought out Nielsen's
quirky symphonic thinking to secure effect. But thetotal impression was
friendly, and the symphony certainly gained by the sharp silhouette Davis
gave it.
The concert had begun with Sibelius's Swan of Tuonela. While the cor anglais
proceeded with its doleful song, Davis lavished subtleties upon the
orchestral accompaniment, which became too greedy for one's attention. In
this 'river of the dead' there were too many restless currents forthe serene
magic of the piece to establish its spell. In its way this was nevertheless
an expert performance, and a neat introduction to the tougher Nielsen work.
It was the Haydn, though, that would go on ringing happily in the mind's
ear.

first television interview granted to British television in all the (nearly)
10 years he has been in office. He talks to David Walter about

FT  30 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Why Welsh farmers are
saying 'cheese' - Rural enterprise: Adding value at source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 80 acres of Welsh hill pasture which drop steeply away from Tony and Pam
Craske's hill-top cottage above Pontypool could, in return for a lot of hard
work, produce an annual income of Pounds 5,000.
But the Craskes have rejected sheep as a means of boosting Tony Craske's
retirement pension, opting instead to produce a variety of goats' and cows'
milk cheeses in the farm buildings alongside their home.
Abergavenny Fine Foods now combines cheese-making with a distribution
business used by other farmers to bring their cheese to market. In the space
of nine years the Craskes have created acompany which employs eight people
and has annual sales of nearly Pounds 500,000. 'None of the other farms
around here employs anyone outside the farmer's family,' says Tony Craske.
Although the Craskes are not of farming stock - theycame to Pant-Ysgawn Farm
after Tony retired from a management career with ICI - they illustrate an
important shift taking place in the farming sector.
Pressure on agricultural incomes is concentrating the minds of those who run
farm-based businesses on attempts to add more value to products at source,
instead of shipping the raw materials to distant food processing plants
which cream off the larger share of profits.
Tony and Pam Craske came into the business of making cheese when they wanted
to use up surplus milk from the small herd of goats they had bought to meet
their own needs. They made their first sales in nearby Abergavenny market
but began supplying Sainsbury's and other large supermarket chains as the
result of a cheese promotion campaign run by the Welsh Development Agency
(WDA).
It soon became apparent that the Craskes had insufficient space in their
farm buildings both to keep goats and to make the cheese so the goat-keeping
was subcontracted out to a farmer in west Wales. The milk is now frozen on
that farm and brought to Pant-Ysgawn once a week for processing.
The help which the Craskes received from the WDA came under a programme
known as the Welsh Food Initiative, established in 1986 to help food
producers diversify and add value. This programme has in turn become part of
the recently createdWelsh Food Promotions campaign set up to market local
produce.
Foodstuffs might appear a relatively simple product group compared with say,
high technology electronics, but the growing complexity of hygiene
legislation means that a high degree of sophistication is required, says Tim
Lacy- Halbot, food development executive for the WDA and Gwent County
Council.
One of the main problems facing the rural food producer is that of scale.
Few farmers are in a position to produce enough to be able to afford to
market their product professionally or to create a business of any
worthwhile size.
In an attempt to overcomethis problem Tony Craske is involved in a
WDA-backed initiative to process and market a cow's milk cheese called St
David's. The idea is for selected farmers to supply 'blanks' of raw cheese
to a central processing plant where they will be matured, packed and
distributed.
At present one local farmer is providing the raw cheese for processing at
Pant-Ysgawn but this operation will be moved to a larger unit in Abergavenny
within a few weeks and more farmers are being lined up to supply the cheese
'blanks'. Craske hopes to sell Pounds 130,000 worth of St David's in the
first year, rising to Pounds 500,000 within three years.
Asimilar leap in scale has been made by David Morgan (right), founder of the
Welsh Venison Centre at Bwlch near Brecon. Morgan began rearing deer six
years ago for sale as breeding stock and three years ago moved into
producing his own venison.
Limited to just 20 acres on his father's 229-acre farm, he soon found that
demand for venison had outstripped his own ability to supply. Morgan still
rears his own deer and he hopes to double the acreage available but he buys
inthree-quarters of his requirements from other breeders. The rest of the
farm acreage is taken up by sheep, pigs and daffodils.
He sees great potential for venison, a low fat meat which has been growing
in popularity. Deer are more efficient at converting grass into meat than
cattle and the gross profit margin per acre from deer is nearly twice as
high.
At present breeding and selling deer accounts for about half of the Welsh
Venison Centre's Pounds 200,000 annual turnover but venison is due to
increase its 30 per cent share. The remainder of sales are accounted for by
the manufacture and installation of fences, gates andother equipment needed
for handling deer.
But Morgan is motivated not just by a desire to increase the revenues of the
farm, which must support his father, his brother and himself. Equally
important are a wish to escape from what hesees as the farmer's weak
position in the commercial hierarchy and a desire fora more varied life than
on an ordinary farm.
'I hated going to market and grovelling to buyers who couldn't jump over a
fence,' he says. Handling the marketing of his venison takes him to hotels
and restaurants in a 30 mile radiusfrom his farm and, more recently, to
Birmingham.
Buying in deer for slaughter from other farmers has allowed Morgan to expand
his business to the pointwhere he employs a local butcher on a part-time
basis. He is now hoping to takeon a full-time butcher as well as someone to
do the metal fabrication work for the deer- handling equipment.
Growth at Abergavenny Fine Foods and the Welsh Venison Centre has been
steady rather than spectacular. Tynant Spring Water,in contrast, has
mushroomed in size over the past two years and is forecasting further
spectacular growth. There could be few more graphic examples of how clever
marketing has turned a low-value commodity into a premium product.
Geoff and Gwenllian Lockwood decided to diversify their business activities
in 1984by bottling for sale the water which bubbled out of a spring by their
hillside cottage some 12 miles from Lampeter. Initially the water was put
into plastic bottles and sold locally.
The growth in the public's demand for bottled water convinced the Lockwoods
that they could build a bigger business so they teamed up with two local
investors, one of whom had a background in the hotel and catering industry.
He persuaded them that there was an unmet demand for an upmarketbottled
water. 'We felt there was a gap in the market for a fine looking bottle to
sit on the table alongside a bottle of wine,' says Gwenllian Lockwood.
The Lockwoods dropped the clear plastic bottle they had been using in
favourof a specially designed glass bottle in brilliant blue. Production was
moved from the hillside down to a small industrial estate in Lampeter in
1989 and sales took off. Lockwood refuses to discuss turnover but expects to
be able to sell the company's entire 8m capacity of the bottling line this
year.
But tougher food legislation is having an impact on Tynant. The Lockwoods
expect European legislation will require all waters to be bottled at source
 -Tynant is broughtby tanker to Lampeter  - so they are planning to shift
the bottling plant back to the spring.
When the new bottling plant is open Tynant will double itspresent workforce
to 60 with a further increase to more than 80 expected shortly after. A
preliminary meeting with the local planning authority was favourable so they
are hopeful of getting planning permission.
Tony Craske has been less successful in his attempts to expand. He has been
unable to gain permissionto expand the buildings on his land because he is
in the Brecon Beacons National Park. 'If I wanted to keep pigs I could put
the building up but I can't get permission for cheese-making,' he says.
The result is that his business will shortly be moving to Abergavenny into
one of a cluster of units specially built to house food companies. The rules
which have been drawn up to protect the rural landscape sometimes run
counter to attempts to breathe new economic life into the country.

FT  30 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): New funds launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three new UK venture capital funds have been launched despite forecasts that
the scale of venture investment will fall by around a quarter over the next
two years. All three funds have been set up by established venture capital
groups. One is targeted at the small business in inner city areas while the
other two are intended to finance larger, development capital stage deals.
The three funds are:
A Pounds 20m Inner City Fund established by 3i, the largest UK venture
capital group, to back start-ups and established small companies in city
centres throughout the UK. Finances for the new fund will come from 3i's own
resources. 3i's first Inner City Fund, set up in February 1988, hasprovided
a total of Pounds 15m to inner city companies.
The aim of both fundsis to invest small amounts of equity - usually of
between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 50,000 - in inner city businesses
identified by the government-funded City Action Teams or Task Forces, whose
brief is to revitalise enterprise and employment.
A Pounds 21.5m fund created by Granville &amp; Co, a private investment bank.
The ThirdGranville Modern Management Trust fund will finance management
buy-outs and buy-ins, debt restructurings and acquisitions. Granville's
first fund, launched in 1985, has fully invested Pounds 10m, while a second
fund, created in 1988, has invested 70 per cent of its Pounds 21m.
A planned Pounds 140m European Acquisition CapitalFund launched by Enskilda
Ventures, part of the Scandinavian banking group. Thefund managers have
raised the first Pounds 30m towards the fund which will complement
Enskilda's existing Scandinavian Acquisition Capital Fund.
Venture capital in the UK faces a difficult few years, according to a survey
carried out forthe British Venture Capital Association last year. The scale
of investment by the industry is expected to fall by 20-30 per cent over the
next two years from the 1989 level of Pounds 1.65bn. The institutions which
provide finance to the venturecapitalists are demanding better performance
from funds they back.

Small businesses spend an average of Pounds 9,000 a year on external
financial advice, of which 64 per cent goes to accountants' fees, according
to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick. The accountants questioned 150 companies
with turnover of up to Pounds 5m and based in the south-east.
The bank manager is the most popular source of advice on raising finance and
is used by 58 per cent of companies, compared with 46 per cent which consult
accountants. However, 95 per cent of firms polled turn to their accountant
when seeking advice on corporation tax and accounts preparation.

A programme to inject the techniquesfor teaching enterprise issues into
schools in Hungary has received a further Pounds 32,000 of finance from the
UK government's Know How Fund. The extra money will allow Durham University
Business School (DUBS), which has been responsible for the programme, to
evaluate progress and to revise its manual of enterprise teaching practice.
The Hungarian ministry of works plans to extend the project to 250 schools
from the present eight.

Evidence of the extent to which recession has hit the liquidity of small
businesses appears in the level of savings theyhave at their bank or
building society. Net savings by small businesses have remained static at
around Pounds 27bn since October 1990 compared with average monthly
increases of Pounds 350m in the earlier part of the year, according to a
survey by National Westminster Bank.
The picture varies according to sector with service companies having more
surplus funds available than manufacturing and construction companies.
Savings of retail businesses are very low.
Businesses inthe south-east have more funds on deposit than those elsewhere
in the country while liquidity also improves as businesses increase in size.
Twenty five per cent of firms with one or two employees have surplus funds
on deposit. Of businesses with five to nine employees 34 per cent have
surplus cash while nearly 40 per cent of those employing 10-49 people have
business savings.
*****
A do-it-yourself kit to help small firms cut the cost of crime is to be
devised by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Crime Concern, a
government-backed consultancy. Fraud, theft, 'shrinkage' and arson cost
small businesses an estimated Pounds 3bn a year.
The crime audit pack - a series of self-study units to enable the small
business owner to carry out an assessment of exposure to the risk of crime -
is to be drawn up and tested over the next few months. Crime Concern will
compile the pack on the basis of discussions with owner managers of
retailing and construction firms in London, manufacturing companies in
Liverpool andhotels in Brighton.
The businesses chosen will receive surveys of their physical security, their
financial and stock control systems and management and employee attitudes.

FT  30 APR 91 / FT Law Report: Rent review issue can be re-litigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARNOLD AND OTHERS v NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK PLC House of Lords (Lord Keith
of Kinkel, Lord Griffiths, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, Lord Jauncey of
Tullichettle and Lord Lowry):
April 25 1991
A LESSEE is not barred from seeking judicial construction, for the second
time, of a rent review clause, if there are special circumstances justifying
re-litigation ofthe issue, in that there has been a change in the law since
the earlier proceedings and the decision, which was plainly wrong, leads to
injustice.
The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendant
landlord, National Westminster Bank plc, from a Court of Appeal decision on
a preliminary issue, that the plaintiff lessees, Mr Michael John Arnold and
others, were not barred from re-litigating the construction of a rent review
clause.
LORD KEI TH said that National Westminster was the landlord of premises in
Fetter Lane let to a firm of chartered accountants. The lease was for 32
years, expiring June24 2008.
It provided for an initial yearly rent of Pounds 800,000 subject to review
on June 24 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2004.
The rent from each review was whichever was the greater of the preceding
rent and the 'fair market rent' at review date.
The 'fair market rent' was defined as meaning 'suchamount as shall represent
a yearly rent at which the demised premises might reasonably be expected to
be let at the relevant review date in the open market .  . '
When the first review date came up in 1983 it was referred to an arbitrator.
There was a dispute as to whether, under the definition of 'fair market
rent', the rent for the hypothetical lease for the residue of the unexpired
term was to be fixed on the basis (a) that it contained the same rent review
provisions as the actual lease, or (b) that it contained no review
provisions.
The arbitrator decided that the hypothetical lease should be treated as
containing the rent review provisions, and fixed the rent at Pounds 1m per
annum. In case hewas wrong, he determined that if the hypothetical lease
contained no rent review provision, the rent would be Pounds 0.2m.
The landlord appealed. Mr Justice Walton held that the arbitrator was wrong
and that the hypothetical lease should be treated as not containing any
provision for rent review, so that the rent payable was Pounds 1.2m.
He refused leave to appeal, and refused to certify a question of law of
general public importance to be considered by the Court of Appeal. The
lessees then sought to appeal against the refusal to grant a certificate,
but the Court of Appeal held it had no jurisdiction to entertain such an
appeal.
In the subsequent case of British Gas v Universities Superannuation Scheme
(1986) 1 WLR 398 Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, vice-chancellor, had to
consider a somewhat similar rent review clause.
He said the correct approach was that, in the absence of clear words
requiring the rent review provisions to be disregarded, and in the absence
of special circumstances, the rent review clause should be construed to give
effect to its underlying commercial purpose by requiring future rent reviews
to be taken into account.
That approach had been approved by the Court of Appeal (see Equity and Law
Life Assurance (1987) 1 EGLR124; Basingstoke and Deane BC (1988) 1 WLR 348).
There were therefore powerful grounds for the view that Mr Justice Walton
wrongly construed the rent review clause.
In 1988 the lessees sought to reopen the question of construction. They
brought an action for rectification of the lease, and for a declaration as
to the true construction of the clause. National Westminster applied to
strike out the construction claim, on the ground that the lessees were
barred by issue estoppel from re-litigating the point.
The matter came before the vice-chancellor. He took the view that special
circumstances could prevent an issueestoppel from arising; that such special
circumstances included the situation where relevant new material, not
available at the time of the first decision, hadsince come to light; and
that such new material might include not only the discovery of new facts,
but also a change in the law.
He said 'the question is whether, given subsequent change in the law
indicating that the earlier decision was wrong, the injustice of holding the
plaintiff in the second action bound by the erroneous decision in law in the
first action, outweighs the hardship to the other party in having to
relitigate the matter, and the public interest in the finality of legal
proceedings'.
He had no doubt that justice did require the matter to be re-litigated.
The relevant factors were: (i) there was a continuing contractual
relationship of landlord and tenant which would regulate four further rent
reviews; (ii) unlike the ordinary case of prior decision by a judge, Mr
Justice Walton's decision was not subject to appeal because of the
peculiarities of procedure applicable to appeals from arbitrators; (iii) the
decision whether or not to permit an appeal was the decision of Mr Justice
Waltonhimself; (iv) subsequent decisions such as Equity and Law Life made it
stronglyarguable that Mr Justice Walton's decision was wrong.
The Court of Appeal affirmed his judgment on substantially the same grounds.
National Westminster now appealed.
There was a distinction between cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel.
Cause of action estoppel arose where the cause of actionin later proceedings
was identical to that in earlier proceedings between the same parties
involving the same subject matter. In such a case the bar was absolute in
relation to all points decided, unless fraud or collusion was alleged.
Issue estoppel might arise where an issue forming a necessary ingredient in
acause of action had been decided and, in subsequent proceedings between the
same parties on a different cause of action, one party sought to re-open
that issue.
In Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100, a case of cause of action estoppel,
vice-chancellor Wigram, in a statement which had been held to be applicable
also to issue estoppel (see Brisbane (1979) AC 411,425), observed that there
might be 'special circumstances' where estoppel did not operate.
The present case was concerned with the nature of such special
circumstances.
There appeared to be no decided case where issue estoppel had been held not
to apply by reason that in later proceedings a party had brought forward
further relevant material which he could not by reasonable diligence have
adduced in the earlier proceedings. There was however, an impressive array
of dicta of high authority in favour of that possibility.
The House should affirm that there might be special circumstances where
further material became available which could not by reasonable diligence
have been adduced in earlier proceedings.
The question was whether the further relevant material was confined to fact,
or included change in the law.
There was no right of appeal against Mr Justice Walton's judgment because he
refused to grant a certificate that the case included a question of law of
general public importance. There could be little doubt that he was wrong in
that refusal, as was shown in the large volume of litigation on construction
of rent review clauses and decisions in that field.
Anyone not possessed of a strictly legalistic turn of mind would think it
most unjust that a tenant should be faced with a succession of rent reviews
over 20 years, all proceeding on a construction of his lease which was
highly unfavourable to him and was generally regarded as onerous.
Estoppel per rem judicatum (by previousjudicial decision), whether cause of
action estoppel or issue estoppel, was essentially concerned with preventing
abuse of process.
In the present case abuse of process would be favoured rather than prevented
by refusing the lessees permission to reopen the disputed issue.
The vice-chancellor was right when he said that a change in the law
subsequent to the first decision was capableof bringing the case within the
exception to issue estoppel.
Special circumstances required the lessees to be able to re-open the
question of construction decided against them by Mr Justice Walton, his
decision being plainly wrong.
The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed.
For National Westminster: Terence Cullen QC and Hazel Williamson QC
(Stephenson Harwood).
For the lessees: James Munby QC and Jonathan Gaunt QC (Freshfields).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An increase in science and technology teaching at all levels of the
education system is essential if Britain is to flourish economically,
according to a report* published yesterday by the Advisory Council on
Science and Technology (Acost).
In spite of past efforts to improve the image of science and technology in
schools, the study reports that many young people give up studying science
as soon as they can.
Acost, which advises the UK government on its education and science policy,
has come up with seven proposals whichit believes could help improve
Britain's economic growth: The number of qualified science and technology
teachers should be increased, if necessary by paying them more than their
counterparts in other subjects.
Education from the age of 16 upwards should be broadened to encourage
scientific subjects to be incorporated in arts or social science courses.
Degree courses should be mademore useful to students and relevant to
employment.
An optional fourth year of study should be introduced for scientists or
engineers who want to go intoresearch
There should be more opportunities for mature students to return to studying
science and technology subjects.
New learning technologies, such as inter-active video systems, should be
used in higher education to help make lecturers more productive and so
expand the number of students taught.
Employment practices should be improved to provide career development which
is on a par with those in other professions.
On the last point Andrew Bain, chairman of the working group that
investigated the employment of scientists in industry and business, said
that in terms of pay the worst employer for experienced scientists is the
government. *Science and Technology: Education and Employment, HMSO

FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Work changes agreed at Lever Brothers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS ATLever Brothers, the detergents subsidiary of Unilever, have agreed
in principleto changes in working practices after being told that they would
not receive anannual pay rise until they did.
Shop stewards representing 1,750 workers at Lever Brothers' two plants at
Port Sunlight, Merseyside, and Warrington, Cheshire, recommended broad
acceptance of the changes in return for an immediate 8 per cent pay rise
backdated to January.
The broad-ranging changes, known as Horizon 2000, include new shift
patterns, the calculation of working hours over a year, a single pay
structure for blue and white-collar workers, and performance appraisal for
manual workers.
After delays in agreeing the package, the company told workers last month
that they would not backdate any annual pay settlement if it was not
approved by April.
It also indicated that it would consider implementing the measures later
than June.
The company told workers that if there was industrial action it would
withdraw guarantees of no compulsory redundancy and alter early-retirement
policies. It said itneeded changes to combat a serious decline in sales
during the recession. Mr Steve Thomas, chairman of shop stewards at Port
Sunlight, said the stewards recommended acceptance of the offer as the only
sensible option.
The company has offered a 12 per cent rise once details are agreed. A
further 8 per cent will be paid next January, and performance increments -
which it estimates might add another 10 per cent to wages  - in January
1993.
The changes in shift-working arrangements, with a move towards
multi-skilling and more teamworking, are intended to make the measures
self-financing. The company is also offering a new training scheme and
harmonised pay and conditions.
Mr Peter Wright, personnel manager for the plants, said he expected to be
told today that the unions had accepted both the principle of joint
negotiations covering the sites and the main principles of the working
practices changes.
Unions had originally been pressing for a one-year pay deal which would not
be tied to acceptance of Horizon 2000. The company insisted that it would
not pay any rise beforesuch an agreement and would not backdate it if there
were delays.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Five women among new 'working
peers' - House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIST of 'working peers' announced today breaks with tradition by
containing a majority of opposition peers, and including equal numbers of
Labour and Tory nomineesfor the first time since 1979.
Five women are among the eleven life peers making up Mr John Major's first
list of peers expected to make 'regular and distinctive' contributions to
the work of the House of Lords.
Coming justone year after Mrs Thatcher's last list, Mr Major's move marks a
change of attitude from his predecessor. She often resisted pressure for new
peers to take part in the daily work of the Lords, and last year's list was
the first since 1987.
Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, the Labour leader in the Lords, described Mrs
Thatcher as 'unreceptive', and expressed his appreciation of Mr Major's
'imaginative' response.
He called for annual appointments of working peers, and said it would be
reasonable for there to be more Labour than Tory nominees in the next few
years, to make up for the increasing imbalance in the parties' respective
numbers since 1979.
Labour's new baronesses are Miss Ann Mallalieu, a recorder, and Miss
Jennifer Hilton, formerly a commander in the Metropolitan police.
The party's new barons are Professor Maghnad Desai, professor of economics
at the London School of Economics, Mr Clive Hollick, the managing director
of MAI plc, and Mr Frank Judd, the director of Oxfam, who was a minister in
the 1974-79 Labour government.
The Tory baronesses are Mrs Jean Denton, the deputy chairman of the Black
Country Development Corporation, and Miss Detta O'Cathain, managing director
of the Barbican centre.
Tory barons are Mr John Mackay, the former MP and junior Scottish office
minister, Professor Andrew Renfrew, professor of Archaeology and Master of
Jesus College, Cambridge, andMr Mark Schreiber, a farmer and Westminster
lobby correspondent.
Miss Sally Hamwee, a Richmond borough councillor, has been nominated by the
Liberal Democrats.
Lord Waddington, the former Home Secretary now leader of the House of Lords,
is believed to favour appointing former Commons ministers to strengthen the
government frontbench, and Mr Mackay's elevation may mark the first step of
this approach.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Parties play down optimism over
projected gains - Local council elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN political parties are entering the finalstages of the local
election campaigns deliberately playing down forecasts about the number of
seats they will manage to win in Thursday's contest.
Party strategists appear anxious to avoid building expections too high, so
as to leave scope for claiming on Thursday that the results were better than
expected.
Instead, the Labour and Conservative parties are focusing on the main issues
of the campaign, specifically the health service, the new 'council tax' and
the economy.
The government came under further attack yesterday after it indicated that
the seven bands of properties under the new system of local government
taxation could be changed - perhaps to take account of regional variations
in house prices.
Officials insisted, however, that the government's 'strongly preferred
option' was not to increase the number of bands.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The dispute over
banding goes straight to the heart of the government's problems. . . The new
tax cannot both be fair and exempt well-off Conservative voters from large
bills.'
The Conservatives hold their final campaign press conference today.
The part y chairman, Mr Chris Patten, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, are expected to pin blame for the high level of local
tax bills squarely on high-spending local authorities.
Labour will concentrate on the government's handling of the economy.
The Conservatives are not making public forecasts about Thursday's results,
but privately officials point out that the party is defending a number of
seats it won in 1987, when the party was doing well nationally.
Instead, Tory strategists prefer to make comparisons with last year's local
elections when Labour was regularly far ahead in opinion polls.
They also emphasise how well they believe Labour has to do if it is to have
achance of winning the next general election.
Labour is anxious, however,to distance itself from forecasts at the weekend
that it was poised to gain 600seats. One official said that a gain of
between 250 and 300 seats 'would suit us fine'.
Similarly, for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Archie Kirkwood, campaign manager,
said a 'neutral' result for his party would be a 'cause for celebration'.
'Looked at clinically and against our amazing successes in 1987, I think it
is a very tall order to consider what progress can be made in this
situation,' he said.
'I would not be surprised if we lost seats,' he said.
However, he said his campaigners were confident that this was a pessimistic
scenario. 'In the areas where we have done the work we will get the
rewards,' he said.

FT  30 APR 91 / Nigel Judah: former Reuters executive - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGEL JUDAH, who died on April 26, aged 60, was responsible for Reuters'
finances during the news agency's spectacular growth over the past three
decades.
He was born in Calcutta, where his father was a jute merchant. The family
moved to the UK in 1934. Mr Judah went to Charterhouse, the English public
school, and spent a year at Lausanne University.
He joined Reuters as an accountant in 1955. When he became secretaryand
chief accountant in 1960 at the early age of 29, Reuters' revenues were
Pounds 2.4m, and it was making a loss of Pounds 18,000.
When he handed over his financial responsibilities in 1990, revenues were
nearly Pounds 1.4bn and company profits Pounds 320m. His resignation as
company secretary, and retirement, took effect at Reuters' annual meeting
one day before he died.
One of Mr Judah's early contributions to Reuters' success was to negotiate
in 1967 with Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, the first bank loan of the
post-war news agency - its miserable profits record and its then
unattractive balance sheet notwithstanding.
That enabled Reuters to expand into computerised financial information, in
whichit quickly established a dominant position. Mr Judah's signal
achievement during the past 10 years, since becoming finance director in
1981, was to direct the administration of the 1984 flotation of Reuters -
the first initial public offering to take place simultaneously in London and
New York.
Mr Judah enjoyed opera as much as he enjoyed his fine collection of modern
English paintings. His death robs the business community of a
public-spirited man of cultivated tastes and distinctive style.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A US CUSTOMS undercover agent explained at the Old Bailey yesterday how he
secretly tape-recorded a meeting between British-based executives and Iraqis
during an alleged plot to export nuclear detonating devices to Iraq.
Mr Daniel Supnick posed as Mr Dan Saunders, export manager of CSI, the US
manufacturer that made electrical capacitors allegedly wanted by the Iraqis.
He said yesterday that with the authorisation of British Customs and Excise
he put a miniature tape recorder under his clothes before going to London's
Cavendish Hotel for an 8am meeting in September 1989.
It was allegedly attended by two Iraqi engineers, the president of CSI and
two business executives, Mr Ali Daghir and Ms Jeanine Speckman.
The meeting, which lasted 2 1/2 hours, was 'to find out more about the sort
of capacitors they were seeking', Mr Supnick told the jury.
Mr Daghir, aged 49, a managing director, of Esher, Surrey, and Ms Speckman,
aged 41, of Addlestone, Surrey, together with Mr Toufic Amyuni, aged 37, of
London, have all denied conspiring to attempt illegally to export 40
electrical capacitors between September 1 1988 and March 29 lastyear.
All three were executives of Euromac Company, based at Thames Ditton,
Surrey.
Mr Supnick said he learned from the US State Department for Munitions
Control that the devices were considered to be munitions and a licence to
export them from the US to Iraq would have been rejected.
The trial was adjourned until today.

FT  30 APR 91 / Parkfield to go into voluntary liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATION of Parkfield Group, the entertainments and engineering
group that collapsed last year with liabilities of more than Pounds 300m, is
to be ended and the company put into creditors' voluntary liquidation.
In the High Court yesterday the administrators - three partners in Cork
Gully - applied to discharge the administration order, made by the court
last July.
Their counsel, Mr Robin Dicker, said they would be putting Pounds 2.64m  -
the maximum claimed by outstanding preferential creditors of the company -
into a trust account. Any balance left would be remitted to the company.
A resolution for winding-up would be put to a members' meeting next Tuesday.
It was envisaged that the administrators would become the company's
liquidators, Mr Dicker said.
Deputy judge John Weeks, QC, said that discharge of the administration order
would be conditional upon the winding-up resolution being passed. The
administrators would be released 21 days after they had filed their final
accounts, on condition that there was no objection from any creditor or
third party before then.
After yesterday's hearing, the administrators' lawyers said the purpose of
the administration, a more advantageous realisation of Parkfield's assets
thanwould have been possible in a compulsory liquidation, had been achieved.
Most of the parts of the business capable of being sold had been sold and
most of the assets realised. The sooner a liquidation began, the sooner
there could be a distribution to creditors.

<TEXT>
US SPENDING on personal consumption rose modestly in March, for the second
month in succession, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
Separate figures showed a small increase in the sales of new houses -
another sign that the US housing market is recovering slowly.
After allowing for inflation, personal consumption rose 0.5 per cent in
March over February. This followed a 0.8 per cent increase in February and a
fall of 1 per cent in January.
The increase partly reflected lower personal saving in recent months. Real
personal incomes rose only 0.2 per cent last month, having fallen 0.8 per
cent in January and remained flat in February.
The small increase in incomes and spending is contrasted with continuing
falls in production and employment. For the first quarter as a whole, real
gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent.
Sales of new houses rose 1 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 490,000. This followed an 18.5 per cent jump in sales in
February over January. The market, however, remains relatively weak.

THE EC is to consider allowing the European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance
projects in Latin America, one of the few regions to which the Community's
development bank does not lend.
This was the main result of a weekend meeting in Luxembourg of the foreign
ministers of the 12 and the Rio Group of the 11 main Latin American
countries.
The European Commission is expected to put the issue to foreign and finance
ministers of EC member states next month. It was agreed, meanwhile, that
work would start on evaluating specific candidate projects, probably inriver
transport and electricity transmission.
The EIB only carried out 5 per cent of its Ecu13.4bn (Pounds 9.25bn) lending
outside the EC last year but it is the largest supranational borrower on
international capital markets.
Debt-be set Latin American countries would welcome not only the project
finance but theEIB's seal of approval, a senior South American diplomat
said.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S government economics team and much of its cabinet is in Washington
as part ofan offensive to reopen channels with the international financial
community.
Ms Zelia Cardoso, economy minister, is to begin talks today with the
International Monetary Fund in the hope of negotiating a Dollars 2bn
stand-by facility.
Aletter of intent signed with the IMF last September was torn up after
Brazil had failed to meet targets such as a 6 per cent monthly inflation
rate by December, and because of perceived foot-dragging on reaching
agreement with creditor banks over more than Dollars 8bn in arrears.
Terms were agreed with the banks this month, allowing Brazil to reopen
negotiations with the fund. However, continuing economic instability in
Brazil makes a new accord unlikely in the near future, as Ms Cardoso admits.
This time, the Brazilian team will refuse to commit itself to specific
targets for inflation, having learnt its lesson last time. Inflation is
between 7 and 9 per cent a month, but most prices and wages are frozenand
controls are on all sectors.
While Ms Cardoso is with the IMF, Mr Ibrahim Eris, central bank governor, is
meeting Mr David Mulford, US Treasury Under-secretary, and commercial bank
heads to discuss opening negotiations on the stock of Brazil's Dollars 63bn
commercial bank debt.
John Barham reports from Buenos Aires: Uruguay, South America's only
offshore banking centre, has introduced new banking guidelines to discourage
money laundering. The central bank has issued the recommendations to
Uruguay's 240 banks, banking houses and exchange houses, in response to US
concern that Montevideo might be providing a haven for drug money.

THE US is considering making a significant foreign policy reversal after
agreeing yesterday to study a plan that could prevent mining in the
Antarctic indefinitely.
The US appeared to soften its opposition to a total ban after Spain and
Norway presented a last-minute compromise to a consultative conference
ofAntarctic Treaty members in Madrid.
The new draft protocol centres on agreeing a 50-year mining moratorium which
could be lifted by agreement of a 75 per cent majority of the treaty's
consultative members, whose numbers are likely to have increased by then
from the present 26 countries.
That, crucially to US sensitivities, would break the treaty's 30-year
tradition of decision-making by consensus. But, in order to satisfy
Australia and France, which support an eternal mining ban, the draft
protocol also says all current 26 consultative members would have to be
included in the 75 per cent.
As thingsstand now, that would give any one of the countries opposed to
mining - by farthe majority in Madrid  - a veto on lifting the moratorium.
But Mr Curtis Bohlen, the chief US delegate, insisted that, if accepted by
all delegations, Washington might accept it 'because it is clearly not a
permanent ban. It does not foreclose the option of a future generation
deciding for itself, which is what we have wanted.'
Mr Bohlen, said the proposals represented 'a major step' by all 26 countries
involved in the consultative process. He said he had passed the draft on to
Washington for study, implying that he had seen sufficient signsof movement
from Australia to prompt a shift in the US position. 'We were at atotal
deadlock on Friday,' Mr Bohlen said.
Mr John McCarthy, head of the Australian delegation, which came to Madrid
last week determined to defend an eternal ban on mining, said after hearing
the proposals: 'I think one can now look forward to the conclusion of (an)
agreement before the end of the year with a lot more optimism."
The delegation from the UK, which supports the US position, was not
commenting on the new proposals, but is also expected to take them back to
London for consultation.
The Madrid meeting is the second session of a consultative conference begun
last year in Chile and Mr Bohlen said a third session could be called
quickly, perhaps in June, to ratify a new agreement.
The US, however, appears to have won an important concession of its own as
the draft protocol suggests that a key environmental protection committee
being established under the treaty not be given decision-making powers.
Washington and London had feared that the committee would become quickly
politicised.
The draft protocol to the treaty says the committee should act only in an
advisory capacity to the consultative members, who would have the final
sayon any environmental matters.
Apart from mining, the draft protocol says decisions in future could be
taken by a simple majority.
This is seen as a further concession to US frustration at the treaty's
consensus tradition.

FT  30 APR 91 / Paving the way for lower interest rates - all in good time:
The weekend meeting where the Group of Seven nations papered over the cracks
between them

THE WEEKEND meeting of representatives of the Group ofSeven leading
industrialised countries established the principle that policy co-ordination
need not involve various countries pursuing the same policies at thesame
time.
While the US failed in its short-term goal of getting Germany to cut its
interest rates, the discussions among the finance ministers and central bank
governors of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada
should pave the way for lower interest rates in the months ahead.
The communique followed a time-honoured ritual of papering over the cracks
among the seven sufficiently to enable each participant to claim that its
views had in the endprevailed.
The German delegation could point, in support of its refusal to cut rates,
to that part of the final statement in which the G7 underlined its 'common
objective of sustained growth with price stability'.
The communique also 'emphasised the importance of monetary and fiscal
policies which provide the basis for lower real interest rates and a
sustained global economic recovery with price stability.'
The G7 finance ministers, it added, 'believed that such a medium-term
strategy was the best way of reducing potential risks and uncertainties in
the current outlook.'
The US, which has underlined its fears of a global recession in recent
weeks, could draw comfort from a recognition in the communique that there
was a persistence of high real interest ratesand a slowing of economic
activity in countries which until recently had been experiencing strong
expansion.
The G7 bridged the gap between its members by agreeing 'to monitor the
situation closely and to take actions as needed within the co-ordination
process, with a view to achieving a sound recovery and a growing world
economy.'
The US will hope that such words will exert some pressure on Germany not to
tighten monetary policy to combat what it sees as burgeoning inflationary
pressures.
Yesterday, Mr David Mulford, US Treasury Under-secretary for international
monetary affairs, said he thought Germany would hesitate to raise rates
after the meeting.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, said Germany told the meeting
that it might cut its rates this year.
Further remarks from him suggested that the G7 had adopted a strategy,
outlined last week by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic
Outlook, to cut rates as the financial markets allow. He said that world
bond marketsat the long end were giving clear signals to cut rates.
'It is up to the monetary authorities not to disappoint the markets.' The G7
participants 'reaffirmed their commitment to co-operate closely on exchange
markets' but otherwise did nothing to halt the current strength of the
dollar.
There were signs after the meeting that some ministers and central bankers
thought the dollar may be nearing a peak.
Mr Beregovoy said that political factors, rather than economic fundamentals,
were keeping the dollar strong.
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, said on Sunday that he
thought the German economy was a 'bit oversold' by financial markets and
that this situation would correct itself.
'It is not all doom and gloom in Germany,' he said.

import curbs

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S industry minister yesterday called on theEuropean Commission to
back EC car-makers' proposals for continuing controls onJapanese car sales
in Europe.
Today, all 17 Commissioners will discuss the vexed question of Japanese car
imports for the first time since October, with the aim of informing EC
governments of their proposals by the middle of next month and restarting
negotiations with the Japanese.
'I hope the Commission will agree on a proposal not much different from what
the European car producershave put forward,' said Mr Roger Fauroux, the
French minister.
The European industry seems to have moved closer to the Commission's line on
Japanese car imports recently, principally because Mr Jacques Calvet, the
hardline chairmanof Peugeot, has distanced the group from fellow-producers.
Last month, ACEA, the new industry lobby group, which excludes the French
car manufacturer, called for continuing controls until the end 1999, saying
the Japanese share of the market should not exceed 15 per cent until then.
The Commission would now like to end months of squabbling between EC member
states and manufacturers on the timetable, terms and conditions for opening
up the European market to Japanese car imports, but the potential for
disagreement is still great.
Today' s meeting will consider again outline principles for opening the EC
market which were first put forward at the beginning of last year. They
include the ending of national restrictions on Japanese imports by the
beginning of 1993, Japanese monitoring of its own car exports to the EC for
a transitional period to end in 1998, according to first Commission plans,
and improved access to the Japanese market.
Commission officials stressed that only imports would be monitored and not
'transplants' - Japanese cars assembled in Europe  - which they estimate
could grow from 250,000 a year at present to perhaps 1.2m by the end of
1998.
The absolute level of imports is expected to rise to a similar level before
the EC market is completely open, but commissioners will also consider how
far the level of imports should be adjusted if market conditions change.

MR John Georges, chairman and chief executive officer of International
Paper, the world's biggest paper company, yesterday urged Japan to open its
paper trade to foreign competition, to help develop international trade and
allay the mounting frustrationof the US Congress.
'The paper and wood products industry is one of those areas where Japanese
industry has to open up. Consumers will benefit from theremoval of
barriers,' he said.
Addressing a conference on the world pulp and paper industry organised by
the Financial Times and the European Paper Institute, Mr Georges said the
world paper industry was suffering from a cyclical downturn and general
slowdown in the global economy. But 'when I look to 1993 and beyond, I am
very bullish about the industry's future.'
The Polish Ministry of Ownership Transformation has appointed Hambros Bank
to advise it on the restructuring and privatisation of the country's pulp
and paper industry. Hambros will help draw up a sector-wide strategy for
developing Poland's 40 paper companies.

FT  30 APR 91 / World Trade News: Mixed credits dispute muddles UK trade
outlook - Industry says some export contracts are endangered by official
indifference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH capital goods exporters, already alarmed by what they see as
government's efforts to undermine the Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD), are facing a new worry which has widened the gulf between them and a
once supportive government.
The Pounds 97m allocated to mixed credits - export credits sweetened by aid
 -in 1991/2 has been fully committed less than a month into the government's
financial year. As a result the Overseas Development Administration has
closed the window for new deals till April 1992.
Top executives of companies such as GEC,NEI, Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar
House have fulminated privately about the cover restrictions and premium
increases imposed by the ECGD. Now they point to thenews on mixed credits as
confirmation of their worst fears about the government's indifference to
their fate.
Without the mixed credit facility - commonly known by the initials ATP,
which stand for 'aid and trade provision' - they say they will be unable to
sign up new orders in important markets such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
India and Thailand where such financing is regarded asnormal.
To save deals now in the pipeline for these markets, they must try and delay
signing the contract, which makes pricing difficult at a time of high
inflation at home. Or they must arrange expensive bridging finance for their
customer, or transfer the procurement abroad to a country which is not so
stingyabout its aid budget.
Government officials are at pains to point out that the closure of the ATP
window for the remainder of the financial year does notconstitute a change
of policy. It has happened simply because the UK's recent remarkable run of
success in winning orders with ATP money.
Foremost amongthese is the Pounds 400m order recently won by Cementation
International and BalfourBeatty to build a hydro-electric power station in
the Malaysian state of Kelantan.
But there have been other deals - for rural communications,
railwaysignalling and track rehabilitation in Indonesia, for the Ankara
metro and truck supplies to Zimbabwe - which have swelled the total.
There is, however, little doubt that the lack of much official sympathy for
the exporters' plightreflects the fact that large parts of the government
have always viewed ATP with scepticism.
Though it was originally conceived as a political device to justify an
increase in the overall aid budget, the Overseas Development Administration
harbours worries about the real developmental value of money spent in this
way.
The Treasury is concerned that ATP constitutes another unjustified subsidy
to exporters on top of those they already receive through payment of claims
by ECGD and routine interest subsidies on export credits.
ATP credits account for some 15 per cent of the ECGD book, officials argue,
and the facility adds to the concentration of its business in a limited
number of markets.
Exporters say that one reason why there has been a bunching of ATP deals in
the current year is that some contracts were delayed last year, particularly
in Indonesia, because of uncertainty over the availability of ECGD cover.
Now ECGD cover is available, but suddenly there is no aid money.
A look at the figures suggests this smacks a little too much of conspiracy.
The ATP budget was underspent last year, but only by Pounds 4.5m out of a
total of Pounds 98m. This suggests that it would have been difficult to fund
some of this year's projects had they gone ahead earlier.
Part of the problem relates to the funding of concessional loans. The
government built up a large volume of lasting commitments in the first
threeyears of its concessional loan programme which ended in March. The
result is that part of the ATP budget is automatically taken up with
subsidies on loans agreed some years ago.
From this financial year, the system of accounting for such loans is being
changed. The government will pay lending banks a sum equivalent to its total
grant commitment during the drawdown period of the loan rather than making a
series of 'pay-as-you-go' subsidies each year until the loan matures. The
banks must then devise a technique to spread thesubsidy through the life of
the loan.
Though the details are still undernegotiation between the banks and the
City, this will mean that fewer concessional loans can be agreed in future,
though it will also obviate the problem of a ballooning ATP budget as more
commitments are added to the books.
The simple answer would be to increase the ATP budget. But Mrs Lynda
Chalker, the aid minister, told parliament yesterday that additional
resources were not available for the ATP in the current year.
Britain has supported efforts in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development to reach a new internationalagreement limiting the use of
mixed credits. With these talks about to climax it would look odd for the
government to raise its ATP budget.
In fact, government officials say, they regard the OECD discussions as the
best way of dealing with the problem.
Envisaged in the OECD is a tough agreement that willseverely limit mixed
credits for otherwise commercially viable projects as wellas those to richer
countries and for large projects.
This is little comfort for exporters who say they do not believe the
agreement will be enforceable.
Japan will continue to offer large amounts of 'untied' mixed credits which
will end up supporting its own exports, they say. Only Britain will end
upplaying by the new rules.
In the old days, said one executive, the Department of Trade and Industry
would have lobbied hard for an increase in the ATP budget.
But Mr Peter Lilley, the secretary of state, is said to be economically dry
and unsympathetic. 'We haven't had a positive secretary of state in a very
long time.'

ALLIED military commanders yesterday urged Kurdish guerrillas not to hinder
civilians who wish to return to the town of Zhako where a protected refugee
camp has been set up.
Maj-Gen Jay Garner of the US army hosted a meeting at his Zakho headquarters
with a dozen peshmerga (Kurdish guerrilla) leaders. British, French and
Dutch officers also attended.
'Weasked them to come in and discuss the return of their people,' said
Maj-Gen Garner. 'A peshmerga checkpoint was refusing to let people return.'
Kurdish leaders deny that they have a policy of preventing refugees from
leaving the mountains on the Turkish border and going to Zakho, but they
acknowledge that they are still concerned about the presence of some 50
Iraqi policemen in the area.
President Turgut Ozal of Turkey said it was essential for the allies
toremain in northern Iraq to give confidence to the returning Kurds.
'If the allied powers do not maintain their presence in northern Iraq, the
Iraqi Kurds will start running again as soon as they see an Iraqi soldier,'
he told the Iranian news agency.
Mr Erik Suy, the special United Nations envoy, said it would be difficult to
reach agreement on a British proposal for a UN police force to replace the
allied troops in northern Iraq. 'It is a very beautiful idea,' he said. 'But
if the United Nations has to provide sufficient security, they have to be
better armed than a policeman. It will be very difficult to get agreement,
since we need a decision of the Security Council, and I don't know if there
is enough consensus there.'
Britain, however, hopes to obtain broad Security Council agreement for its
plan without the need for a formal resolution, diplomats said yesterday.
Following discussions with representatives of the US and France, which
support the initiative, Sir David Hannay, the UK ambassador to the UN,
planned to broaden the consultations last night to include the Soviet Union
and China.
Both of these permanent members are traditionally wary about UN intrusion
into a state's domestic affairs. China takes over thecouncil presidency
tomorrow under the monthly rotation system.
There areprecedents for deploying UN civilian police in trouble spots
without the prior adoption of a Security Council resolution, according to UN
authorities. They cited Cyprus and Namibia.
British officials said it was envisaged that Iraq should pay for the
proposed UN police force in the north out of its future oil revenues.
A Kuwaiti soldier stops an Iraqi at the Abdali refugee camp on the border
with Iraq from boarding a bus on the journey to Iran. Iran will take 2,000
such refugees and many were left behind.

IN ITS MOST harshly-worded attacksince the end of the Gulf war, Egypt
yesterday accused Israel of blocking Middle East peace efforts.
The policy of building settlements in occupied territories was 'aimed at
trying to abort  .. efforts to promote a peace settlement', said an Egyptian
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
Separately, Mr Boutros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, said
Israel was creating obstacles over the composition of the Palestinian
delegation to a peace conference proposed by Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state.
The double-barrelled criticism reflected growing concern in Cairo that the
government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir isnot serious about achieving a compromise
on the Palestinian issue, viewed by Egypt as the key to future regional
stability.
The Foreign Ministry statement said that Egypt regarded Israel's recent
settlement activity 'with much repulsion'.
Hinting that a halt to settlement would draw a favourable Arab response, Mr
Ghali said that confidence-building measures 'must be reciprocal'.

FT  30 APR 91 / Australian docks employers reject Hawke wages deal
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS of early agreement on Australian docks reform receded yesterday
after employers declined to accept a wagesdeal drawn up between the trade
unions and Mr Bob Hawke, the Labor prime minister, Kevin Brown writes.
The deal was rejected by Conaust, the largest stevedoring company, a
subsidiary of P&amp;O, and strongly criticised by the Association of Waterfront
Employers of Labour.
The deal followed intervention by MrHawke to defuse a moratorium on reform
announced by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in protest
against a 2.5 per cent wages award by the Industrial Relations Commission.
The award conflicted with an earlier wages agreement between the ACTU and
the government, known as the Accord, under which workers in most industries
were to receive ADollars 12 (Pounds 5.40) per week from May 16, together
withfurther productivity-backed payments to be negotiated at company level.
The commission's refusal to approve the award places the Accord in jeopardy,
and could lead to changes in industrial relations law if the government
decides to by-passthe court.
The docks employers' association said it was concernedabout the legal
implications of accepting the deal given that it was negotiatedoutside
Australia's centralised wage-fixing system.
The association isexpected to decide today to seek further talks with the
government on how the deal would affect employers' legal protection from
strikes called without the approval of the courts.
A special ACTU conference will decide tomorrow whether to back a campaign of
industrial action for full payment of the Accord acrossall industries.

FT  30 APR 91 / Dirty tricks cast shadow over the Indian election: The
phenomenon of 'booth capturing' is on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KK SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the most populous democracy in theworld prepares to hold national
elections for the 10th time since independence in 1947, the question of
whether they will be free and fair is being raised withconsiderable unease
because of the atmosphere of violence.
India's Election Commission, an autonomous constitutional body that has the
responsibility for conducting the mammoth poll - the country has an
electorate of 510m - arguesthat democracy has been an overwhelming success.
'The Indian voter watches silently until the last day and then acts
decisively. After all, he has frequently changed governments through the
ballot box,' says a senior Election Commission official.
Yet he concedes that the last two decades have witnessed, with alarming
frequency, the rigging of elections in some constituencies and the practice
is spreading.
The phenomenon of what is known as 'booth capturing' began 20 years ago in
Bihar and has spread to other states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in the
north and, more recently, to Andhra Pradesh in the south. In the 1989
parliamentary elections, the commission officially recorded 1,599cases of
'booth capturing' and took remedial measures, including ordering a new poll.
But officials concede that there could be hundreds, even thousands, of cases
that will go undetected. In all fairness, though, there have been no
complaints of rigging from many states (including, curiously, the
insurgency-affected state of Punjab where 'booth capturing' is unknown).
'Booth capturing' actually means massive stuffing of ballot boxes and is
officially categorised as being either 'silent' (when false ballot papers
are literally stuffed in the boxes with the connivance of the supervisory
staff) or 'violent'. The latter involves actual intimidation of voters and
polling staff, often at gunpoint.
There are many other dirty tricks, particularly during campaigns. Candidates
frequently hire thugs for the purpose of disrupting meetings of rivals, or
to battle against thugs owing allegiance to others.
In some stateslike Bihar, there are highly skilled and highly priced gangs
who are experts in'booth capturing' and illegal practices. In the southern
state of Karnataka, such gangs distribute lorryloads of arrack liquor on
polling day.
Despitean elaborate code of conduct framed by the commission, such 'corrupt
practices' are growing. Thus, organising an election is no easy task. The
commission hasno field staff of its own and depends entirely on the central
and state governments to provide 3.5m workers to man the 600,000 polling
booths.
The commission does not think that the coming elections will be unduly
violent, but the Home Ministry thinks otherwise because of the heightened
communal tension. It hasdrawn up a list of about 80 'hyper-sensitive'
constituencies which are prone to communal violence, part of nearly 300
constituencies categorised as 'sensitive'.
Polling is to be held on three days spread over a week (May 20, 23 and 26)
because security personnel have to be re-deployed for the elections. In
addition to nearly 1.5m state police and home guards, the central government
will provide 640 companies of troops, numbering about 1,000 each.
These are far less than are needed, but large numbers of paramilitary forces
arealready committed to fighting insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab and
cannot be spared for election duties. Hence the fears of increased violence
 -the death toll of 179 in the last elections in 1989 could be exceeded.
There are many more problems, most of them perennial. In such a diverse
country, the weather is always a factor. In some Himalayan constituencies,
polling will be held only when snow melts later in the summer. Demarcating
constituencies is a massive pre-election exercise made more difficult
because 25 per cent are reserved for lower castes.
Much of the electorate is illiterate and cannot read the namesof candidates
on ballot papers. The commission provides all the nine national parties and
38 state parties with permanent symbols (for instance, the Congress symbol
is an open hand).
This does not always simplify matters asmany constituencies have scores of
candidates. In 1989, Belgaum, in Karnataka, had a record 301 candidates and
the ballot paper was more than a metre in length. The cost of the national
election in 1989 was Rs1.1bn (Pounds 30m) and is expected to be at least 25
per cent more this time. This does not include the money spenton campaigning
or funding dirty tricks.
The official limit for electionexpenses is Rs150,000 for each candidate, but
this is invariably exceeded many times over by parties and candidates.
The commission describes the elaborateexercise, including the violence and
the corrupt practices, as 'a part of the pangs of democracy'.

FT  30 APR 91 / Prague cuts taxes to boost output
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA is lowering company turnover taxes and relaxing credit
controls in a supply-side attempt to stimulate flagging industrial
production.
Output fell nearly 12 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared
with the same period of 1990. The largest decline was in the building
industry where output fell 35 per cent.
From May 1 the highest rate of turnover tax will drop from 32 to 29per cent.
The middle band falls from 22 to 20 per cent and the lowest from 12 to 11
per cent.
The government will also loosen bank lending restrictions to help stimulate
investment, according to Mr Ivan Svitek, an advisor to Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
finance minister, who advocates radical economic reforms.
An IMF team in Prague has told the Finance Ministry that it regards economic
indicators other than output favourably.
The balance of payments deficit of Dollars 250m in the first three months
was considerably better than anticipated. The deficit fell to only Dollars
29m in March. A current account deficit of Dollars 2.5bn had been expected
for the entire year. The government has responded to the lower deficit
byreducing a surcharge on imports from 20 per cent to 18 per cent, also
starting tomorrow. Further reductions will follow and the surcharge,
strongly criticised abroad, will be eliminated shortly.
Inflation, which soared to 37 per cent in the first quarter because of a
sharp cut in subsidies and resulting higher prices in January, eased to 4.7
per cent in March, when food prices dropped 2per cent as a result of greater
competition. The inflation rate is expected to be even lower this month but
will rise again in May when subsidies are removed on domestic electricity
and heating, Mr Svitek said.
Subsidies on rents,which typically cover half the amount paid, are to be
removed this summer.

FT  30 APR 91 / Brussels given electronics task: Divided EC ministers
commission probe into troubled sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC INDUSTRY ministers yesterday papered over their main differences on
remedies for European electronics by asking theCommission to organise an
urgent high-level investigation of the troubled sector.
Ministers agreed that Brussels should, after consulting companies and
governments, produce concrete proposals 'as rapidly as possible' to target
EC-funded research more effectively, as France has demanded. But they also
undertook to maintain competition in the sector, as Britain urged, and not
to favour bigEC companies to the detriment of smaller or non-EC ones, as
Ireland and other countries on Europe's periphery feared.
Yesterday's council debate clearlyreflected concerns by Britain and some
smaller countries that, in the wake of asupposedly secret meeting in France
10 days ago, certain commissioners were cooking up a package of financial
aid/trade protection for the big French, Dutch, German and Italian
electronics companies. Thus, the Commission was asked yesterday to widen its
dialogue with industry.
Mr Roger Fauroux, industry minister of France, which is pushing most
insistently for EC action to ward off the Japanese challenge, stressed that
keeping Europe in the electronics race was vital for civil and military
reasons.
'The electronic fireworks seen during the Gulf war would not have been
possible had all the chips been in Japanese hands,' he said. Referring to
current Brussels scrutiny of his plans to aid state-controlled Bull and
Thomson, he said that it would be 'very odd if one were to claim EC support
for companies, and deny governments the means to help companies'.
Ministers agreed that plans such as that discussed by Europe's three big
semi-conductor producers - SGS-Thomson, Siemens and Philips - to merge
theirresearch were for the companies to decide. But if they did so decide,
Mr Fauroux said, he did not expect the Commission 'would brandish the
lightning bolts ofEC competition rules to thwart such a merger'.
The pricing of Japanese electronics deserved thorough investigation for
possible dumping, he minister said. Though seeing no case for higher regular
import tariffs, France sided with the Netherlands in wanting to maintain the
14.9 per cent tariff on semi-conductors. Germany was prepared to see only a
modest cut in that tariff and could not agree to Britain's stress on the
interests of European chip users, rather than producers.
This was a response to Lord Hesketh, junior UK industry minister,who sought
to ridicule Commission and French plans for trans-European electronic
networks to benefit computer-makers, saying 'few would regard road
investmentas something to be manipulated to serve the concrete industry.'
Mr Michael Smith, the Irish technology minister, made an even stronger
interventionfor free trade and non-discrimination. It was a vital national
interest for Ireland, whose largely US electronics sector produces a third
of total national exports, that the Community should not penalise non-EC
companies.

FT  30 APR 91 / German union chiefs reject calls for wage restraint
</HEADLINE>

GERMAN trade union leaders reacted angrily yesterday to suggestions that
high wage rises were dampening economic prospects, as engineering workers
prepared for widespread warning strikes today to back a 10 per cent pay
claim.
Germany's five leading economic research institutes, in their latest joint
six-monthly report, said the level of wage settlements, at 6 to 7 per cent,
jeopardised prospects for economic growth in 1992.
The institutes, predicting a fall in this year's growth in west Germany to
2.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent last year, said the latest pay settlements
would only be 'acceptable' if workers accepted much more moderate wage rises
for 1992.
Although the institutes' warning was given predicable backing by Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister, the German Trade Union Federation (DGB)
rejected the report's conclusions. Mr Michael Geuenich, a member of the DGB
board, said companies were still making 'excellent profits' and could
therefore afford the level of settlements.
The verbal flurry came on the eve of warning strikes called today for
about100,000 workers in the engineering and electrical industries, following
breakdown of pay talks with the IG Metall trade union. The strikes are
expected to cause extensive disruption in the car industry, with plants of
Volkswagen, Ford, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche all targeted.
Employers have so far offered a pay rise of 4 per cent for nearly 4m workers
covered by IG Metall. Sporadic strike action is expected to continue next
week unless agreement is reached.
The report from the five institutes also warned about the high level of wage
rises in east Germany, where wage rates are 60 per cent above last year. The
institutes' report drew attention to the worsening of Germany's internal and
external finances caused by unification, forecasting that united Germany
will show a small deficiton current account this year after a current
account surplus of DM77bn (Pounds 25.7bn) for 1990.
The Bundesbank last week criticised high wage rises in the east as holding
back investment there. But Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall chairman,
said lower wage rises would go into the pockets of employers in thewest
rather into rebuilding east Germany.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S prime minister, Mr Petre Roman, yesterday replaced nearly half his
cabinet in anattempt to bring new blood into the government to maintain the
pace of reforms.
'The course of events, both legislative, economic and social, had worn down
some members,' Mr Roman told parliament, adding that greater adaptability to
'fast change' was now needed.
Several of the ministers who were replaced had complained privately about
the difficulty of controlling large, bureaucratic ministries. The reshuffle
is a thus a clear sign that the government is determined to place strong
personalities in those ministries which bear the burdenof the reforms.
The key changes include the transfer of Mr Victor Stanculescu, defence
minister, to the industry ministry, which is responsible for negotiating the
bulk of the partially liberalised prices. Mr Stanculescu was economics
minister in the first two months after the December revolution. He was then
appointed defence minister, specifically to quash the emergence of rival
factions.
The Finance Ministry, led until yesterday by Mr Teodor Stolojan, will be
merged with the Economics Ministry. It will continue to be headed by Mr
EugenDijmarescu, a close associate of Mr Roman, and a key player in
designing the whole reform package.
Mr Roman also stressed the need for opposition forces to 'share the
responsibilities for the transition period'. He appointed three ministers
from outside the ruling National Salvation Front, none of whom, however, is
thought to be representative of the opposition.
The Labour Ministry will be headed by Mr Mihnea Marmeliuc, a member of the
pre-1946 National Liberal party. The Public Works Ministry will be led by Mr
Dinu Patriciu, labour minister in the interim government and a member of the
secessionist youth wing of the National Liberal party. Mr Valeriu Pescaru,
of the Agrarian Party, will take charge of land privatisation within the
Agriculture Ministry.

FT  30 APR 91 / Greece decides to swallow the EC medicine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BOATLOAD of Greek tourists on a trip to the island of Delos recently
looked surprised to be charged for visiting the ruins of Apollo's sanctuary.
But the murmurs of protest were few as they rummaged for thousand-drachma
notes. One woman told her sons, with only a hint of irony: 'You see, now
you're real Europeans.'
Threa tened with a summons from the European Court of Justice for
discriminating against other EC citizens, Greece has dropped its practice of
making only foreignerspay at museums and ancient sites. The change was
diplomatically timed to coincide with Easter, when the first wave of foreign
tourists rolled in.
The conservative government is trying hard to uproot the prevailing image of
Greece asan unco-operative Community partner, dependent on EC hand-outs
because it is unwilling or unable to put its economy in order.
'It's true Greece was remiss about everything from applying for funds to
answering letters. We didn't participate fully. But that's changed. Now we
want to make a real contribution,' says Mr George Papastamkos,
undersecretary for EC affairs.
However, Greece is now being criticised for its reluctance to lift a veto on
Ecu600m (Pounds 414m) in economic aid for Turkey, even after being granted a
special balance of payments loan earlier this year. The veto was imposed in
the early 1980s in protest atthe Turkish military presence in northern
Cyprus.
Foreign Ministry officials in Athens are reluctant to comment on suggestions
that the government may soon agree to the Turkish aid.
But the real test of Greece's future relationship with the Community will be
the progress made on restructuring its economy under the terms of its
Ecu2.2bn loan.
Greece has undertaken to reduce inflation from 22.8 per cent at the end of
last year to 9.5 per cent by 1993 and to cut government borrowing from 13.1
to 1.5 per cent of gross national product. The current account deficit must
be cut from 6 to 3 per cent of GNP.
The three-year stabilisation programme is intended to prepare the drachma
for entry to the exchange rate mechanism by the end of 1993, in time for
Greece to join in the second phase of economic and monetary union.
Other conditions for the loan included an overhaul of the pension system,
sweeping tax reforms and a 10 per cent cut in the civil service payroll.
About one-third of spending goes to cover the public sector wage and
pensions bill.
With another 40 percent earmarked for servicing the public debt, now over
100 per cent of GDP, there is little scope for state investment.
The government intends to use the EC loan to help cover the Greek
contribution to infrastructure projects included in the Community's regional
programme, calculating that increased private capital inflow will cover the
current account shortfall.
'We're on track with most projects, and in some cases the Commission has
gone out of its way to find extra financing,' says Mr Achilles Karamanlis,
minister of public works.
As a result, a long-delayed project to help develop north-western Greece
through construction of a Dollars 400m bridge across the western end of the
Corinth Gulf should go ahead later this year.
Still, Community surveillance of Greece's economic performance will be
strict: the terms of a similar loan in the mid-1980s were largely ignored.
On the basis of first-quarter performance, Greek officials will be able to
report progress on containing inflation - now likely to fall below this
year's target of 17.5 per cent. However, there are problems with reducing
the deficit as public sector corporations are still overspending, while the
government's revenue forecast now looks too ambitious.
Plans to raise at least Dr200bn from privatising 20 debt-plagued companies
run by the state-controlled Industrial Reconstruction Organisation will be
curtailed. Potential buyers have been slow to appear.
Issues of state land bonds, convertible into building plots, were expected
to bring in another Dr150bn. They will be delayed until later this year
because local authorities in several designated areas are raising
objections.
But when it comes to tax evasion, the Finance Ministry is on the warpath. A
new tax inspector has arrived on the islandof Mykonos, opposite Delos, which
attracts about 500,000 tourists every summer and still keeps up its
reputation for riotous nightlife.
'He seems likea tough character,' says a bar owner, shuffling the night's
takings before deciding how much to ring up on the cash register.

FT  30 APR 91 / British Gas accepts tough price controls from Ofgas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS agreed yesterday to tough controls which will keep price rises
for supplies to 17m households well below the rate of inflation for five
years.
The company also agreed to meet new service standards, accepting that it
could be forced to cut prices if it fails to meet targets.
The controls, drawn up by the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), the gas industry
regulator, limit the amount by which prices to domestic customers can rise
in relation to inflation for five years, starting next April. If inflation
is low, consumers could even see a cut in gas prices.
The new regime will put pressure on British Gas to cut costs internally and
could result in a round of job cuts.
The complex price formula means that British Gas can raise prices by 5
percentage points less thanthe annual rate of inflation as opposed to 2
percentage points below inflation under its current formula.
The new price regime also puts a ceiling for the first time on the cost of
North Sea gas price rises that British Gas can passon to consumers. This is
intended to give the company an incentive for negotiating cheaper gas
supplies and for running its own fields as efficiently as possible. Its
supplies could include imports if this is agreed by the government.
It has taken British Gas 10 weeks to decide whether to accept the proposals,
and the company said yesterday the targets will be tough to meet.
'It was not an easy decision,' said Mr Bob Evans, British Gas chairman, 'but
we are confident we can continue to generate a satisfactory rate of return
and profitability.'
The alternative to accepting the proposals would have been an embarrassing
clash with the regulator and an inquiry into the issue by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
For the first time, the new price formula links efficiency targets to public
standards of service in response to consumers' concerns that cost cuts
should not be achieved by reducing the quality of service.
Ofgas will monitor British Gas's response time, for example, to gas leaks,
and if it consistently fails to meet the standards set, it can be referred
to the MMC which could impose further price cuts as a penalty.
In an attempt to encourage energy efficiency, the new formula allows British
Gas to add on the cost of energy saving measures to consumer prices. This
will offset the costof helping consumers to put conservation measures into
place.
Mr James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, called the package a fair
and reasonableone, that will mean 'better value for money with tougher price
controls, guaranteed standards of service and pressure on British Gas to
perform more efficiently than ever before.'

The French were the most notable investors abroad last week, writes Brian
Bollen.
Elf Aquitaine is raising its stake in Spanish oil refiner Cepsa, becoming
the company's second largest shareholder. This is part of the deal which
sees Cepsa buy its smallest domestic competitor, Ertoil, from Elf.
The sale by US defence electronics group Loral of 49 per cent of its
satellite business to Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace, and Italy's Alenia,
concludes an agreement made last October. The transaction, taken together
with their joint purchase of Boeing's Canadian subsidiary, De Havilland,
underlines the determination of Aerospatiale and Alenia to break into the US
and the specialised satellite business.
Contributing to the boom in receiverships, French property group Actimo is
buying Pascal, the Canadian hardware chain. Construction company Lyonnaise
des Eaux-Dumez will see its stake in UK building group Alfred McAlpine
double to 12 per cent as a result of McAlpine's 1-for-2 rights issue.
The realignment of interests in Europe's financial services sector continued
with Dutch insurance group Aegon buying the 99 per cent of Belgian insurer
Precam owned by France's Athena.
Joining the flow of western car makers into eastern Europe is Suzuki of
Japan. Its 40 per cent stake in the joint venture Magyar Suzuki will make it
the first Japanese car manufacturer to assemble cars in the region.
The sale of Pilkington Reinforcements to Nippon Sheet Glass of Japan is part
of the Pilkington group's reorganisation strategy, which involves the
disposal of non-core assets and the elimination of loss-making operations.

FT  29 APR 91 / Race is on to be first with the big picture: High definition
TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the world's consumer electronics manufacturers, nothing is more
important than the race to develop large television screens with sparkling
clear pictures.
For the Japanese, high definition television (HDTV) is an opportunity to
consolidate their lead in consumer electronics. For the Americans, it is a
chance to get back into an industry they have virtually abandoned.
For Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) of France and Philips of the
Netherlands, Europe's largest consumer electronics companies, wide-screen
HDTV is the key to their future viability.
The European Commission is reported to be close to agreement with
industrialists and broadcasters on a common standard for clearer television
pictures. If the accord, making the D2-Mac standard compulsory for all
European satellite broadcasters, is endorsed by Commission
telecommunications ministers on June 3, Thomson and Philips will have won a
substantial political victory.
Whether they can translate their gain into commercial success is more
doubtful. It is one thing to force satellite broadcasters to adhere to a
particular standard. It is another to persuade viewers that it is worth
paying extra for the clearer pictures. British Satellite Broadcasting, which
last year merged with Sky Television to create British Sky Broadcasting,
largely failed to persuade the UK public of the virtues of its D-Mac system,
the British version of D2-Mac.
The D2-Mac standard, Europe's preferred route, could, in any event, soon be
surpassed technologically by research in the US. The US Federal
Communications Commission has chosen six candidates to compete to create a
high definition standard. It is likely that they will opt for an entirely
digital system. The D2-Mac system is partially analogue.
TCE and Philips both desperately need a successful consumer electronics
product. TCE's net losses more than quadrupled last year to FFr680m (Pounds
68m).
Philips, although financially troubled, is in a slightly different position.
The Dutch group, Europe's largest electronics company, last year declared a
record net loss of Fl 4.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Its consumer electronics
division, however, was its only successful performer. Partly boosted by last
year's World Cup, which stimulated sales of television sets and video
cassette recorders, its profits rose 32 per cent to Fl 1.7bn.
Given the weakness of its computer, semiconductor and lighting divisions, it
is essential for Philips that its consumer electronics activities continue
to show that sort of progress.
The company does have a few other products on the cards. Next year it will
launch the digital compact cassette (DCC), a high fidelity tape system.
High definition television, however, remains its most important consumer
electronics project. Both Philips and Thomson have received generous
financial backing from their governments for HDTV research, based on the Mac
system.
A 1986 European Community directive required all satellite broadcasters to
use the Mac system. The thinking behind the directive was that satellite
broadcasters would begin with either D-Mac, to be used in Britain, or with
D2-Mac, the system chosen by the rest of Europe. D-Mac and D2-Mac are not
fully fledged high definition systems, but they do provide clearer pictures
than those currently available in Europe. Eventually, it was hoped that
broadcasters would move on to HD-Mac, Europe's own high definition system.
The directive expires at the end of the year and a new one will take its
place. Thomson and Philips have demanded that the new directive should make
D2-Mac compulsory for all satellite broadcasters. Companies such as British
Sky Broadcasting have so far evaded the directive by broadcasting from
Astra, officially classified as a telecommunications, rather than a
television, satellite. The Commission has been talking to BSkyB about the
possibility of broadcasting simultaneously in D2-Mac and Pal, the
conventional UK television system which it uses at the moment.
Thomson and Philips say that the development of fully digital television in
the US will not affect plans. Such a system, they say, will not be viable
until after the turn of the century.
However, the US system would be suitable for broadcast by satellite, cable
and terrestrial transmission.
Mr Dermot Nolan, a consultant for accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, said in a recent HDTV study that this would mean US manufacturers
would have access to the entire broadcasting marketplace - in contrast to
both the Europeans and the Japanese, who were concentrating on satellite
only.
Mac, Mr Nolan believes, is an isolationist technology designed mainly to
keep out the Japanese. 'Without a radical re-positioning of the European
HDTV strategy, European high definition will not materialise as a successful
proposition and the future will belong to American digital HDTV and Japanese
companies licensing the technology from US vendors,' Mr Nolan argues.
The concentration on satellite broadcasting as the route to HDTV also raises
the problem that most Europeans will continue to receive only ground-based
broadcasts.
By the end of 1990, 1.8m European homes had satellite dishes - only 1.3 per
cent of the total. According to Zenith Media Worldwide, part of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, this figure will grow to about 23m homes by 2000, still only 17 per
cent.
Instead of simply concentrating on D2-Mac, the UK's Department of Trade and
Industry
is arguing for a twin approach: Mac as the preferred standard for satellite
television, but with no compulsion for Pal users such as BSkyB, and the
development of an improved Pal system for use on terrestrial television.
The government has decided to fund a Pal research project under the Eureka
high technology programme, involving the BBC in Britain and ZDF, the German
network. Granada Television of the UK and ARD of Germany might also join.
This research could eventually provide wide-screen, better quality
television for everyone. Philips and Thomson will be hoping that, in the
meantime, they can create a large market for D2-Mac.

FT  29 APR 91 / Granada holders urge shift at top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Granada, the television, leisure and computer
services group, have warned the company that top-level management changes
are needed before a planned Pounds 150m rights issue can go ahead.
In particular, the position of Mr Derek Lewis, the company's chief
executive, is under threat. He was told yesterday that shareholders and the
group's merchant bank, SG Warburg, believe the changes must accompany the
rights issue.
Non-executive directors, such as Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief
executive of Reed International, and Mr Alan Clements, former ICI finance
director, are understood to believe Mr Lewis should go.
Granada is planning the rights issue and substantial disposals - which could
amount to as much as Pounds 200m - to cut its heavy debt. This stood at
Pounds 436m at the end of last year, apart from the off-balance sheet
commitment to British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture.
On Friday, Reed announced that it would not put any more money into BSkyB, a
consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake.
Granada's bingo business, which has been doing well despite the recession,
is a possible candidate to be sold off.
The problems come at the worst time for Granada, which must submit its
financial bid on May 15 to retain its north-west commercial television
licence.
Apart from recession, Granada has been affected by several doubtful
diversifications over the past few years, including moves into electronics
retailing and travel.
The company also invested about Pounds 200m in computer services, which have
not yet produced significant profits. Granada has also committed more than
Pounds 130m to BSkyB.
Group pre-tax profits last year fell from Pounds 164.1m to Pounds 121m and
analysts are expecting something closer to Pounds 80m this year. From a 1989
peak on March 31 of 396p, shares now stand at 195p.
Mr Lewis was closely identified with Granada's involvement in BSkyB and the
move into computer services, although both policies had the backing of the
company's board.
At the moment, it seems unlikely that Mr Lewis will voluntarily resign and
that he will instead fight to defend his position.

FT  29 APR 91 / Allied-Lyons chiefs to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman and chief executive of Allied-Lyons will this week announce
their early retirement, only a month after the UK drinks group announced it
had lost Pounds 150m on foreign exchange dealings.
Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, 68, was due to step down as chairman next year,
along with his chief executive, Mr Richard Martin, 58, but both are now
expected to leave at the group's annual meeting in July.
Sir Derrick will be replaced by Mr Michael Jackaman, 55, currently
vice-chairman. The person expected to take over from Mr Martin is Mr Anthony
Hales, 42, chief executive of Allied-Lyons' food division, J. Lyons.
A report into the foreign exchange losses by the group's auditing firm, KPMG
Peat Marwick McLintock, will be ready shortly. Allied-Lyons is anxious to
clear the air before its annual results are announced on May 14.
The drinks group's treasury department was speculating on the continuing
decline of the dollar, rather than just hedging to protect dollar earnings.
The group was both writing call options on the US currency and selling
dollars short against the dollar in the cash market. It was caught out when
the dollar rose sharply from early February onwards.
Mr Clifford Hatch, 49, resigned as finance director in March, when the
losses were announced. The group said that Mr Hatch, who had been tipped as
a future chief executive, felt he had to go because he was head of the
department responsible for the losses.
However, the Bank of England had expressed concern some months earlier to
Allied-Lyons about its aggressive dealing. Such a high-level warning is
unlikely to have been directed solely at Mr Hatch, which may explain the
early departures of Sir Derrick and Mr Martin.
Allied-Lyons shares closed at 520p on Friday. This was down 29p since the
group announced on March 19 that it would take the foreign exchange loss as
an exceptional provision in its results for the year to March 2.
Last year Allied-Lyons made pre-tax profits of Pounds 565m on turnover of
Pounds 4.7bn.
The drinks group's brands include Tetley bitter, Skol Lager and Teacher's
whisky.
Allied-Lyons had been looking at a plan to merge its brewing operations with
Whitbread, but talks have been suspended.

FT  29 APR 91 / Tootal forecasts 40% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOOTAL Group has issued a profits forecast which it says demonstrates
conclusively that the Pounds 194m hostile bid from textiles rival Coats
Viyella seriously undervalues the company.
Tootal is forecasting a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 32.5m in the year to January 31 1992. It also expects earnings per
share to be about 8p, an increase of 90 per cent, because of a much lower
tax charge than last year.
Mr John Craven, chairman, said: 'Our profit forecast and the specific
projects which will benefit profitability next year are evidence of the
transformation which has taken place in Tootal.'
The stock market now expects Coats, which owns 29.4 per cent of Tootal, to
increase its original cash offer of 65p per share. Tootal shares closed on
Friday 1p up at 77p. Coats shares were 2p higher at 142p.
Most of the improvement in Tootal's results is expected to come from the UK
after action to eliminate losses, reduce overheads and improve cash
management.
Last year's tax charge was pushed up to 44.4 per cent by a large amount of
unrelieved advanced corporation tax. However, Tootal forecasts that tax in
the current year will be only 25.5 per cent.
Mr Craven said: 'Coats' offer woefully undervalues Tootal's prospects,
representing only 7.8 times Tootal's forecast earnings.'
Coats countered the statement by saying the forecast tax charge was
exceptionally low and it did not believe that Tootal could sustain this
level in future years.

FT  29 APR 91 / Economics Notebook: G7 winces as Brady revives a bad memory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS are blessed with short memories.
For how else can one explain the insistence of Mr Nicholas Brady, the US
treasury secretary, that Germany should reduce its interest rates?
The days leading up to yesterday's Washington meeting of officials from the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries have been horribly reminiscent
of events around the time of the 1987 annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.
A similar row then between Germany and the US over high German interest
rates unsettled financial markets and helped pave the way for the October
1987 stock market crash.
However, last week's exchanges between the US Treasury and the German
authorities might not be as threatening as the 1987 row (between Mr James
Baker, Mr Brady's predecessor as Treasury secretary, and Mr Gerhard
Stoltenberg, then German finance minister). Mr Brady, even when he says
unpalatable things, is a model of US old-money courtesy. And despite last
week's 53.21 point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, current stock
market values are not so exaggeratedly high as at that time.
But the US Treasury's high profile campaign for lower rates has unsettled
officials from the other G7 countries who are dismayed at the way in which
Mr Brady has broken the group's unwritten rule of verbal discipline.
To understand Mr Brady's action it is necessary to look at the G7 through a
political prism.
The differences between the US and Germany focus on domestic politics rather
than economic theories. They are a useful reminder that high-flown talk of
international policy co-ordination counts for little when a politician's
survival is at stake.
The politician in question is President George Bush, who does not face
re-election until late next year, but is sufficiently concerned about the US
recession to push hard for growth. It is Mr Brady's job to deliver that
growth for his president.
The approach of yesterday's G7 meeting has, therefore, seen the US
expressing dark fears about global capital needs and high real interest
rates, especially in Europe, while ignoring the advice of institutions such
as the IMF about how best to combat these perils.
Whereas the IMF has urged tough fiscal policies on deficit countries such as
the US to rebuild national savings, Washington has called instead for lower
interest rates.
The political impossibility of the US getting to grips with its budget
deficit or raising taxes to boost national savings explains its use of the
interest rate argument.
Its demands have allowed the US administration to demonstrate that it is
doing something to help recession-hit businesses and families by putting
pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ease policy.
But not only is the policy risky in terms of financial markets, it is also
unlikely to succeed. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, will have
the recent defeat of the German Christian Democrat Party in the Rhineland
Palatinate election firmly in his mind. That defeat was a revolt by an
electorate that is having to pay more taxes for German unification.
Mr Waigel, like Mr Brady, cannot take fiscal action to reduce interest
rates. Behind him stands the powerful figure of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the
Bundesbank president, who is not going to compromise the central bank's
counter-inflation stance. Mr Pohl also rejects the US argument that easier
money would ease a global savings shortage.
Looking further ahead, Mr Pohl will not want to compromise his plan for an
independent European central bank by demonstrating that the Bundesbank can
bend to political pressure.
It remains to be seen whether the differences over interest rates blow over
or whether they upset the financial markets.
But the controversy has brought to mind the ad hoc nature of the G7 and how
difficult it is to co-ordinate policies.
****
Political considerations of a different sort seem to lie behind Japan's
sudden decision to support a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR).
This is the reserve asset issued and managed by the IMF.
An SDR allocation has long been supported by many developing countries and a
few industrialised nations, such as France, to provide financial resources
to the Third World.
But the more powerful IMF members, including the US, the UK and Germany,
have considered such ideas for pumping additional reserve assets into the
global economy as unnecessary.
They argue that there is no shortage of liquidity in the world. Money is
available, although expensive.
To allocate SDRs - a basket currency made up of the US dollar, yen, D-Mark,
sterling and French franc - would do nothing to reduce the cost of
international funds, as they cost interest. Because SDRs are allocated
unconditionally, an issue could damage efforts to ensure that financial
support for Third World countries is linked to economic policy conditions.
So why has Japan stuck its neck out in favour of such a move? One thought is
that the proposal could deflect pressure on Japan to take on more of the
financial burden of creating a new post-Gulf war order.
According to the IMF World Economic Outlook, Japan will be the only G7
country to run a substantial current account surplus this year.
In view of large demands for capital in eastern Europe, the Middle East and
Latin America, Japan could find itself under increasing pressure, from the
US among others, to contribute more financial support to the global economy.
The Japanese plan has also put Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing
director, in something of a pickle.
He has welcomed the move, not least because one of the objectives of the IMF
is to promote the SDR.
But Mr Camdessus would like to see any additional resources targeted on
needy countries rather than distributed to all IMF members.
There are also fears that an SDR allocation could hinder ratification of
last year's agreement to boost IMF resources through a 50 per cent increase
to around Dollars 180bn (Pounds 107bn) in the Fund's quotas or membership
subscriptions.
Ever the diplomat, Mr Camdessus has already indicated how he expects to
resolve this dilemma. He has called for an in-depth study of the SDR.
This could delay Japan's plans and result in a reserve asset that differs
considerably from the present SDR.

FT  29 APR 91 / Dispute may delay Taurus project: City and government
disagree over who should regulate stock market settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE has broken out between the City and the government over who should
regulate Taurus, the automated system which will handle the settlement of
stock market transactions.
The disagreement is threatening further delays to the project, which has
already been deferred from October until next Spring.
The latest dispute centres on whether the Department of Trade and Industry
should oversee the system, or whether it should delegate the job to the
Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulating organisations
(SROs) set up under the Financial Services Act.
Oversight of the many brokers, company registrars, custodians and
institutional investors who 'plug in' to the Taurus system, to protect
investors from fraud and other losses, will be one of the biggest and most
important regulatory jobs in the City.
Mr John Redwood, minister for corporate affairs, is thought to fear that
giving the job to SIB and the SROs would lead to an unwarranted increase in
the bureaucracy which has already built up around the Financial Services
Act.
It would bring company registrars (which maintain share registers on behalf
of companies) and custodians (which maintain shareholdings for institutional
investors) within the remit of the FSA regulators for the first time.
Cutting out the SIB, on the other hand, would mean giving more regulatory
power to London's International Stock Exchange, which is to build and run
Taurus. This would be a significant development for the Exchange, which had
its regulatory functions emasculated by the FSA.
Mr Richard Britton, SIB international director, said: 'The SIB doesn't want
to push itself forward and get into empire building. It's up to the
government to decide. We stand ready, if the DTI decides there is a role for
SIB to play.'
Privately, other City regulators express concern that investors could suffer
if SIB and the SROs were not given the job. With the increasing automation
of share trading and settlement, these two processes are becoming difficult
to separate.
Also, they argue that the running of settlement arrangements should fall
within the scope of investor protection legislation. The FSA regulators say
that they receive many complaints about company registrars, but are unable
to deal with them because they are an issue only between companies and their
shareholders.
Cutting out the SIB would also create extra complexity for brokers, since it
would force them to report to a new regulator for Taurus purposes.
A second dispute has arisen over the creation of a new compensation fund to
cover losses through Taurus. The Stock Exchange, with the encouragement of
the DTI, has suggested cover of up to Pounds 250,000 for private investors.
But the SIB, which oversees a scheme with maximum cover of only Pounds
48,000, is concerned about potential overlap between the two arrangements.
The DTI had been hoping to publish its 150-page regulations for Taurus by
the end April. Because no decision has yet been taken on who should oversee
the system, the regulations are now planned towards the end of May.
At the end of last week, the Stock Exchange hinted at further delays in the
eventual introduction of the system when it said that Taurus, the City's
most important single infrastructure development, will be launched 'in the
first half' of 1992.

FT  29 APR 91 / Kinnock rules out raising taxes to fund health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Kinnock, Labour leader, yesterday ruled out tax increases for health
service improvements and identified with many of the policy goals set by Mr
John Major - showing how Britain's two main political parties have
converged.
Differences between Labour and the government centred largely on 'the
seriousness of the approach,' Mr Kinnock said. He attacked the Conservatives
for wanting both better public services and a cut in income tax to 20p.
'They can't have both,' he said.
Labour would not cut income taxes but would not increase them for the 'vast
majority' of people. He would not add to the already high economic burden on
households. 'There is no economic benefit in it and it could discourage
effort.' Extra spending on the health service would have to come from
economic growth, Mr Kinnock said.
Mr Kinnock conceded that many Conservatives - including the prime minister -
would like a 'free society of opportunity', a clean country, and a
competitive economy. 'The difference is that for us it is not enough to
describe those ends but to commit practical means of doing it.' He wanted
Conservatives judged on their record on the economy, the health service and
the poll tax.
As campaigning for the local elections intensifies ahead of polling on
Thursday, the Conservative and Labour parties are neck and next in opinion
polls.
Mr Major yesterday expressed confidence that the new 'council tax' would
prove long-lasting - betraying hopes within the party that last week's
announcements will help Tory candidates on Thursday.
'We now have a system that will endure, that will be acceptable and that
will enable local government to raise its resources,' the prime minister
said on TV-am.
Mr Kinnock used his television interview on London Weekend to set out his
vision of 'democratic socialism'. It required the state and the community
'to get itself organised' in advancing 'the fulfilment of the individual'.
Labour did not see 'instantaneous push-button answers' to the problems of
many essential services. 'We will not put false prospects before the people
of this country, saying you can have it all at the same time,' Mr Kinnock
said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: 'It is now clear
that there is no significant difference between what Mr Major and Mr Kinnock
intend to offer at the next election.'

FT  29 APR 91 / Yeltsin seeks to persuade miners to end pit strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, will today seek to
persuade miners to end their strikes, after agreeing the basis of a
settlement in talks with their leaders in Moscow at the weekend.
Aides said he would pledge that control of their pits would pass to the
Russian from the Soviet central authorities.
On a visit to the Kuzbas, the main coal basin in the Russion Federation and
the most politically militant area, he is also expected to tell the miners
that he has won for them the right to sell some coal on world markets for
hard currency.
The Russian leader had committed himself to trying to persuade the miners to
go back to work when he signed a statement with President Mikhail Gorbachev
and leaders of eight Soviet republics last Tuesday.
Mr Yeltsin's calculation to agree to call for an end to the strikes in part
proceeds from a sense that they are anyway falling off. All pits in the
Vorkuta area returned to work after the authorities agreed to hand them over
to Russian control, and strike leaders said five pits in the Mezhdurechensk
field had also returned to work as the miners talked of strike fatigue.
Mr Yeltsin won the backing of the Russian Parliament to his agreement with
Mr Gorbachev yesterday, when it voted by 152 to seven for a resolution which
noted 'the importance of the document for the destiny of Russia's peoples'.
Mr Yeltsin will remain in the coalfields until Wednesday - May Day - when
official representatives of Soviet power will take the traditional parade in
Red Square, a feature of which will be a march-past by the official unions.
The contrast between the two events marks the opening round in the Russian
leader's campaign for his election as president of the Russian Republic by
popular vote, to take place on June 12 - the first such election in Russia's
history.
He faces continued criticism from his allies for signing an agreement which,
as well as calling for an end to strikes, commits him to support the Soviet
government's anti-crisis economic programme, and to back an undefined
'special regime' in key industrial and transport sectors.
Deputies have said that they believed this 'special regime' would involve
the firing of workers for absenteeism and other breaches of discipline.

FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: Taxing arguments as seen from Britain's north and
south (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M J PRITCHARD.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder why the government decided to apply bands of taxation
according to value of property. The added burden placed upon those living in
the south-east is self evident and any system related to values will, by
definition, involve the expense of valuation. A far more equitable
refinement of the system would have been to create banding by property type
 -terraced house with two bedrooms, moving up to terraced house with three
bedrooms; semi-detached house with three bedrooms and so on.
The implication seems to be that those in the south-east pay more for their
homes because they can afford to, whereas in reality I wonder whether
expendable income, having been saddled with the high cost of a house, is any
higher than that of the north.
I doubt whether southerners have the greater expendable income - in which
case they are less able to pay the council tax than those occupying similar
properties in the north.

south (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK ANTROBUS.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr. Michael Heseltine claimed in the House of Commons last Tuesday that
his new Council Tax would be related to a local authority's spending - the
only acknowledgement to the principle of accountability in his whole speech.
Unfortunately, his failure to make any changes to the National Non-Domestic
Rate (NNBR) and the Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) method of revenue
support grant distribution makes this claim unlikely.
The NNDR will remain a national tax earmarked for local government. The
decision of the government to increase its revenue support for local
government by raising VAT merely exacerbates the problem that most of a
local authority's income is not under its control. Relatively minor
increases in expenditure will have a major impact on the Council Tax, the
only source of an authority's variable income.
In addition to this gearing effect, there remains the inefficiency of the
SSA on which grant distribution is based. The SSA is objectionable in
principle since it assumes that Whitehall knows better than a local council
what its needs are. The SSA is objectionable in practice because of its
unreliability.
It is unreliable because year to year changes may have a serious impact on a
council's grant entitlement. For example, Salford City Council had to reduce
a standstill budget by Pounds 8m this financial year and still increase its
Poll Tax by Pounds 44 - all because of amendments to its SSA which led to
grant loss.
The SSA is also open to political manipulation. It is incomprehensible to
most in local government why authorities such as Westminster can gain so
much in grant because of the weighting given in the SSAs to the number of
tourists visiting an authority. It is incomprehensible why tourists -
usually a sign of prosperity - should be seen as a burden on the local
taxpayer at all.

FT  29 APR 91 / National champions become laggards: Europe's electronics
industry is in crisis and may not last the decade - Why?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has long been a tenet of European industrial policy that a successful
modern economy depends on a healthy electronics sector. Yet the deepening
crisis among Europe's electronics producers suggests that their biggest
challenge this decade may be to survive at all.
Most European-owned chipmakers made losses last year, as did many computer
companies and Philips of the Netherlands, the biggest electronics group.
Savage cutbacks across the industry have brought almost 100,000 job losses,
while the European Community's annual electronics trade deficit has swelled
to almost Dollars 35bn.
Distress signals are multiplying. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of the French
state-owned Thomson group, is openly urging more trade protection. Earlier
this month, he and other industry leaders sought more EC support at a
'mini-summit' chaired by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission.
The industry has long argued for special treatment on two grounds. One is
that the market for its products is growing fast. The other is that they are
used by so many sectors, from cars to financial services, that failure to
retain a European presence in electronics could jeopardise industrial
competitiveness across a broad front.
Many national governments and the EC have responded sympathetically. In the
name of safeguarding a 'strategic' sector, they have repeatedly supported
indigenous electronics producers with subsidies, preferential procurement
and trade protection.
Yet these remedies have failed to cure deep-seated problems - and may have
prolonged them. Not only have misjudged policies perpetuated bad habits in
the industry, they have often been inconsistent with the larger goal of
disseminating advanced technology throughout the economy.
The first error has been to confuse invention with product innovation. Most
EC funding has focused on expanding research and development, emphasising
collaborative projects intended to boost European companies' technological
firepower.
Some critics say EC subsidies have been too thinly spread to be effective.
More fundamentally, they do not address one of European manufacturers'
biggest traditional weaknesses - a belief that laboratory breakthroughs can
substitute for efficient manufacturing and aggressive marketing.
That is a costly delusion in an industry ruled by short product cycles and
steeply falling prices. Japanese companies have thrived by concentrating
their technical resources on product development and production engineering
and fine-tuning them to the market.
Europe's industry structure has also adapted sluggishly to rapid
technological advance. In the US, the established order is regularly
challenged by home-grown market entrants. The industry shake-up instituted
by innovative newcomers such as Compaq and Sun Microsystems is as
responsible as the recession for the current difficulties of traditional US
computer companies, including IBM.
In Japan, the most potent agent of change is also intense domestic
competition. But there it is chiefly between large vertically-integrated
groups, where the thirst for business drives them constantly to invade each
others' markets.
In Europe, by contrast, lack of a fertile start-up culture has left
slow-moving older companies dominating the indigenous electronics industry.
Direct competition between them is often timid: most European computer
makers still rely heavily on their home markets. European companies have
also often been late into hot new products such as camcorders and scientific
workstations.
Europe's three main chipmakers - Philips, Siemens of Germany and the
Italian-French SGS-Thomson - are being heavily subsidised in their efforts
to catch up in chip technology. They are also discussing pooling research.
But they account for only about 10 per cent of world production - and barely
30 per cent of European sales - and are poorly represented in the
high-volume microprocessor and memory segments.
Indeed, the only electronics equipment sector in which Europe boasts
consistently profitable world leaders is telecommunications, where monopoly
procurement of network equipment in most countries continues to shelter
entrenched suppliers and maintains high margins.
Inadequate home demand is often blamed for industry weaknesses. Though
Europe's spending on information technology has been rising, it is still
lower per head than in the US and Japan. The market is also divided by
differing national standards and fragmented distribution channels, which add
to selling costs.
However, volume of demand is probably less important than its quality. As
computer power grows steadily cheaper, the sophistication and complexity of
the applications to which it is harnessed play a bigger role in expanding
the market. Producers are depending more on customers to set the pace and
direction of the industry.
But large European information systems users are notoriously cautious about
pioneering leading-edge applications: those which do often prefer US
suppliers for their superior expertise. Brussels is now considering plans to
boost demand by persuading national authorities jointly to back a futuristic
Europe-wide electronic information network.
tions. First, whether the large contracts it would generate could legally be
reserved for the European-owned suppliers it is intended to benefit. Second,
whether it would not simply repeat at the EC level European countries'
largely unsuccessful use of public procurement to bolster national champion
suppliers. The result has often been to induce dependence on captive
markets.
Putting the interests of producers ahead of customers has been a consistent
 -and often unsatisfactory - theme of European electronics policies. For
instance, the EC's faltering strategy for high-definition television (HDTV)
has been shaped largely by European equipment makers anxious to keep
Japanese competitors at bay. Only recently has an effort been made to
involve broadcasters, whose commitment is vital to HDTV's success.
Perhaps most dubious of all have been EC attempts to use trade protection to
strengthen indigenous producers. During the 1980s, repeated EC anti-dumping
actions led to price rises of as much as 50 per cent on electronics imports
from computer printers to video recorders.
Since offending exporters have often agreed, under EC pressure, to raise
prices unilaterally, they have reaped windfall profit gains paid for by
European consumers. Yet there is little evidence that threatened European
producers have taken advantage of anti-dumping relief to step up investment
and raise productivity.
In semiconductors, the EC has followed the US by engineering trade
arrangements which require Japanese producers to co-operate in limiting
price reductions at times of glut. That is profoundly ironic, since European
chipmakers have long warned that if they were unable to compete, Japanese
producers would collude to rig the prices and supply of components sold to
European customers.
If that was ever a serious risk, it has been mitigated by the rapid growth
of large Japanese-owned chip plants in the EC. It would hardly be in
Japanese companies' interest to restrict output to local customers after
laying out billions of dollars on production capacity.
Indeed, the recent influx of Japanese and US investments is one of the main
sources of European electronics industry growth. Yet it is also posing new
policy dilemmas, underlined by the outcry over the acquisition of ICL,
Britain's largest computer maker, by Fujitsu of Japan last year.
ICL has since been expelled from the European industry's most influential
lobby group and partially excluded from Jessi, the Dollars 5bn EC-funded
microchip research programme. That response was doubtless intended as a
warning to the Japanese. However, it also poses awkward questions about the
EC's insistence on defining the electronics industry narrowly in terms of a
shrinking number of European-owned suppliers.
Behind the indignant chauvinism lies, nonetheless, a more serious concern:
that if Europe's electronics industry passed entirely into foreign hands,
critical management and technological functions would move overseas. The
industry could be reduced to branch plants making mature products, with
little capacity to innovate.
Yet in this context, corporate ownership is something of a side-issue. For
many companies, including Bull, ICL, Olivetti, Thomson and Siemens already
rely heavily on overseas competitors for products and vital technologies.
The flow is almost all one way - and is growing.
The industry's options appear limited. Trans-European mergers, frequently
touted as a way to strengthen indigenous producers, have often proved tricky
to arrange. In microchips and consumer electronics, such mergers have also
been disappointingly slow to deliver improved scale economies and financial
returns.
Meanwhile, the EC Commission is refusing to bail out troubled companies, and
its competition watchdogs are investigating French state aid to Bull. In any
case, the French government's largesse is bounded by budgetary constraints,
which recently prompted it to relax its opposition to privatisation.
Nor would further trade barriers offer much of a solution. Past EC trade
protection has proved a Maginot Line, easily outflanked by overseas
companies which have set up plants to compete from inside the EC.
Barring a miraculous recovery in their performance, the outlook for many of
Europe's embattled electronics manufacturers is likely to be further
retrenchment and takeovers. The most optimistic prognosis may be that, as
they retreat, innovative home-grown competitors will spring up in their
place.
That is what has happened in the US. However, the US has also long had a
dynamic and demanding home market. The lesson for Europe may be that
indigenous suppliers can only be as vigorous as the customers they serve.

While the next UK general election will have the novelty of a fresh prime
minister going to the country for the first time, one feature of the
electoral landscape will remain in place.
An old rock has resurfaced to confront John Major in the shape of grand
television inquisitor Sir Robin Day.
After going into the relative obscurity of satellite television on retiring
from the BBC, he is to make a political come-back on ITV. And while some
people may think he has reached his sell-by date, they are unlikely to
include Major who's now headed for the traditional grilling before the
cameras.
But then so are Neil Kinnock and Paddy Ashdown, since Day has been signed by
the This Week programme to do its main leadership interviews during the
election run-up, whenever it is called.

FT  29 APR 91 / Observer: Brush-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One consolation for loss of office that Margaret Thatcher might have
expected is Germany's Ludwig Erhard prize, awarded yearly for distinction in
practising or commentating on economic policy.
She has at least once been considered for the award by the Ludwig Erhard
Foundation - which promotes the 'social market' tenets of West Germany's
legendary economics minister. As a serving premier, though, she was
ineligible.
Now the bar of office has gone, but the prize committee has given her the
brush-off. It has ruled her out on the ostensible grounds that she's a
'capitalist' as opposed to a mixer of market economics with social-policy
pragmatism in the German style.
This year's award is going instead to Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl,
who's unpopular with Chancellor Helmut Kohl because of his criticism of
policy towards eastern Germany. So the award is an important vote of
confidence from the country's economics establishment for Pohl's reluctance
to sacrifice the D-Mark through rushing into European monetary union.
When he collects the prize in Bonn on July 2, a speech in his honour will be
made by good friend Fritz Leutwiler, ex-president of the Swiss National
Bank. Given the tensions between the Bundesbank and Kohl, however, it would
be surprising if the chancellor turned up to listen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rudi Perpich, former democratic governor of Minnesota, hopes to extend the
horizons of out-of-work US politicians. He wants to be foreign minister of
Croatia, the second largest Yugoslav republic.
There has never been a case of a former American governor serving in the
cabinet of a foreign government. So Perpich, a Croatian-American who speaks
the local lingo, could make history provided the State Department agrees not
to revoke his US citizenship.
His role would be to introduce Croatia to the world and promote trade and
investment, a job he did rather well in Minnesota. However, Perpich is a
colourful and sometimes unpopular figure. Nicknamed 'Governor Goofy', he
once proposed selling the governor's mansion following criticism of his
lavish lifestyle.
When the state refused his demand for a second official portrait, he had one
painted privately. Then he posted a huge blow-up of it near the state
Capitol, with the message: 'They won't let us in the Capitol, so 'Hi' from
here.'

Meanwhile the absence from the Guinness appeals of Richard Ferguson QC,

The truth is that Saunders had every confidence in Ferguson and wanted him
to lead his legal team on the appeal. Moreover Ferguson was ready to do so.
But Saunders is legally-aided and, although allowed both a QC and a junior
barrister for his trial, was permitted only the junior - the able Antony

FT  29 APR 91 / Observer: Vintage mystery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the City of London awaits the start of the second Guinness trial, an
equally complex drink-related scandal is causing deep concern in the dining
rooms, if not boardrooms, of some of the most influential companies in the
land.
It is the case of the Pounds 1.5m worth of vintage wine seemingly evaporated
from Green's, the once pukka wine vaults where generations of famous City
figures have stored their liquid assets.
After months of silence, last week Southwark police swooped before breakfast
on seven addresses in London and the home counties and arrested two men.
They were later released, and although police took possession of some wine,
they are not saying whether it is necessarily the missing booze.
One of the problems is that it is still not clear how much wine has gone
walkabout. It could be 4,000 cases, or then again 6,000 cases or more. The
records of the 200-year-old firm are in such a mess that no one is sure who
owns what. The police will soon be sending questionnaires to Green's 1,000
or so customers to find out how much wine they thought they had stored at
the vaults.
Green's, which used to keep shop at the Royal Exchange before straitened
circumstances forced it out of the City, has changed hands several times.
Chris Collins, a well- connected Old Etonian and former amateur jockey,
owned it for a brief period, selling it to American Donald Kurtz, who kept
it even more briefly before unloading it on South African Joe Mankowitz in
January 1990. Less than 10 months later, Mankowitz sold the wine-storage
operation, and shortly after that, customers' wines are alleged to have
begun disappearing.
If readers have any clues, Detective Sergeant Simon Janes at Southwark
police station would much appreciate some assistance.

FT  29 APR 91 / Leading Article: Protecting Iraqis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVENTS IN Iraq get steadily harder for the layman, and perhaps even the
specialist, to follow. Reports of the savagery used by President Saddam
Hussein's regime to suppress the March uprisings and to punish the
communities which took part in them continue to pour out. Yet not only does
Mr Saddam himself keep proclaiming his intention to turn over a new leaf and
introduce democracy: the leaders of the Kurdish rebellion themselves appear
to take his statements at face value.
They say they have reached agreement with him 'in principle' on Kurdish
autonomy, and that they regard democracy in Iraq as the best guarantee of
such an agreement. They are even photographed embracing him on both cheeks.
Meanwhile Kurdish refugees on the Turkish border are refusing to leave the
mountains even for the camps being established under US, British and French
military protection; the western allies are extending their protected zone
eastwards along the border; and Britain, supported by its European partners,
is proposing the creation of a UN police force to give the Kurds greater and
longer-term security within their own country.
It is indeed ironic, and at first sight inexplicable, that Kurdish leaders,
who a few weeks ago were pleading in vain for western intervention in the
Iraqi civil war, should now appear more respectful of Iraqi sovereignty than
the western powers.
Western attitude
But their attitude now has to be understood in the light of the western
attitude then. Rightly or wrongly, the west declared its unwillingness to
remove Mr Saddam from power, or even to support those Iraqis who were trying
to do so. More recently, it has been reported that the US Central
Intelligence Agency now believes Mr Saddam capable of staying in power for
some time, perhaps indefinitely.
The Kurdish leaders have taken note of that. They do not and cannot regard
the 'safe haven' being constructed along the Turkish border as a solution to
their people's problems. In the first place, it is not large enough to
contain anything like all the refugees.
Second, it is clear the allies do not intend to stay there indefinitely, and
the Kurds have to ask what will happen after their departure.
Third, if the Kurds do not soon return to their homes further south there is
a real risk that much of their homeland will be repopulated with Arabs and
so become lost to them for ever.
Key question
If Mr Saddam is going to stay in power in Baghdad they need a deal with him,
however repugnant that may be. As for the embraces, they do not imply any
affection. They are simply the Middle Eastern equivalent of a handshake.
But the agreement has still to be negotiated in detail. The key question is
bound to be: what will make it look convincing enough to persuade Kurdish
families, who fled in utter and justified panic a month ago, that they can
now safely return?
Here is where western and Kurdish strategy may converge again, in the shape
of Mr Douglas Hurd's proposed UN police force. The Kurds should latch on to
this in their negotiations with Baghdad, and insist that Iraq itself, as
part of the deal, request the deployment of such a force not merely in the
north but throughout the country.
Iraqis need protection from their own government not only in Kurdistan but
'in many parts of Iraq', as was recognised by the UN Security Council three
weeks ago when it passed Resolution 688; and the Kurds for their part need
to demonstrate their solidarity with the rest of the Iraqi population, to
rebut the inevitable accusations of betrayal from other opposition
spokesmen.
Their instinct is right: democracy throughout Iraq would be their only
long-term security. Mr Saddam now claims to be offering that, but he must
know that without external protection Iraqis will never feel free to vote
against Ba'ath party candidates. A UN police force is essential if genuinely
free elections are to be held; and sanctions should not be lifted until free
elections have taken place.

FT  29 APR 91 / Leading Article: UK aid and the poor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the hallmarks of the Thatcher decade was a grudging attitude towards
development. UK aid spending fell from 0.52 per cent of gross national
product in 1979 to just 0.31 per cent 10 years later.
Not surprisingly, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
picks on this record in its latest review of British aid policy. The
relatively modest cash increases planned for the next few years will lead to
only a slight rise in real spending. Aid could even decline further in
proportion to GNP, the OECD says.
Third World lobby groups have drawn attention to the report in the hope that
Mr John Major will turn out to be more generous than his predecessor and
increase the budget accordingly. This hope looks vain and may be simplistic.
The return to fiscal deficit makes the granting of extra aid unlikely.
Anyway, increasing the budget only makes sense if recipients can usefully
absorb the extra funds and if it does not involve sacrificing the quality of
the aid programme.
Too much of the UK aid budget remains tied to the procurement of British
goods and services. The UK is one of the worst offenders in the industrial
world in this regard. The government has begun to reverse this policy, at
least where the poorest countries are concerned, but the OECD rightly says
it should do more.
Unfortunate blemish
The UK's predilection for tied aid is a blemish on a programme that is
otherwise characterised by an exemplary level of concessionality,
concentration on the poorest countries and professional evaluation of
projects and programmes. Tying aid diminishes its effectiveness. It limits
choice and raises procurement costs. Reduce tying, the argument goes, and
the effectiveness of UK aid could be further enhanced. Yet critics such as
the OECD must accept that a cut in tied aid would make it even harder to
drum up support for an increased aid budget.
Pressure for tying remains strong in industry, which too often sees the aid
budget as being primarily designed to benefit British companies rather than
the poor peoples of the developing world. Indeed, in the general argument
about the level of the aid budget, industry is all too willing to gloss over
the fact that much aid is necessary simply to offset trade protection in the
First World. The UK boasts a relatively open economy, but it is far from
innocent in this respect. If Mr Major were really concerned about
development, he should persuade his EC colleagues to abolish import
restrictions on farm products. The need for aid would certainly diminish as
protection is lifted.
Fallible institutions
The general rule is that the larger the aid budget, the tighter the strings
attached. UK spending is increasingly conditional on the recipient's
following International Monetary Fund and World Bank adjustment programmes.
This should help to ensure that spending is effective, but the principle
should not be followed slavishly. The Bretton Woods institutions are
fallible too.
Another feature of British policy is the new fashion for targeting aid
towards countries seen as offering 'good government'. This is generally
taken to mean a level of democracy sufficient to make government
accountable, minimise corruption and secure basic human rights. This has
some merit. After all it is easier to help well-governed countries. But the
policy is too vague and easily overridden for the sake of other foreign
policy objectives. Under a good government yardstick, countries like Kenya
and Malawi would not deserve to be large recipients of British aid.
Perhaps the best yardstick is the one which opinion polls suggest the public
prefers, namely the degree to which aid actually helps the very poor. This
is a standard which implies a need for good government in the recipient
country without making it into an obsession. The public is right to be
suspicious of the use of aid to further Britain's commercial interests or to
curry diplomatic favour with developing country leaders.

FT  29 APR 91 / Business confidence will recover soon, say LBS forecasters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence will recover significantly in the next few months, and
output soon after, according to a study published today by the Centre for
Economic Forecasting at the London Business School.
Consumer confidence in the UK has recovered markedly since the end of the
Gulf war, the researchers say. Yet producer confidence remains stuck at the
low levels it sank to last autumn, in spite of the end of the war and the
return of oil prices to pre-war levels.
Business confidence should have returned to its pre-war trend by now, the
researchers say. Using statistical techniques that purport to estimate the
trend, they argue that businesses in the UK remain unduly pessimistic.
The latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends
survey, to be published tomorrow, should show a recovery in business
confidence, according to the LBS research.
The LBS estimates that the percentage of respondents expecting output to
fall over the next four months should exceed those expecting it to rise by
only 15 percentage points, compared with 24 percentage points in the March
monthly survey.
Leaked results from the CBI April survey suggest less of a recovery in
business confidence. The percentage-point difference between those
businesses expecting output to fall rather than rise has fallen to a balance
of just eight, according to a report in The Independent on Sunday.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of staff to be shed at the Rolls-Royce aero-engine plant in
Bristol has been increased by 200, and may reach 1,000, it was announced
yesterday.
Union officials have been warned of possible compulsory redundancies in the
company's 8,000-strong workforce if the job cuts are not met through
voluntary redundancies and early retirement.
The unions have blamed the lack of volunteers on poor pay-offs - the maximum
being Pounds 4,000. Rolls-Royce blamed the company's 3,000 job losses in the
UK on the recession worldwide and the effect of the Gulf war on
international air-lines.
In January the company announced job cuts of between 1,200 and 1,500 jobs at
its Derby commercial aero-engine operations. Derby, where most of
Rolls-Royce's commercial engine business is based, employs about 15,000
people.

FT  29 APR 91 / Manufacturing in search of a silver lining: The CBI's
worries over when a recovery in production will take place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE they waving or drowning? The question is being asked of UK
manufacturers, whose capability to mount a sustained recovery from the
recession is coming under scrutiny.
The Confederation of British Industry last week said that parts of
manufacturing industry were in a slump, with order books in many sectors
lower than for 40 years.
In recent weeks, official statistics have shown a slowing in the rate of
growth of exports and a large decline in manufacturing output between
January and February. Publication tomorrow of the latest CBI quarterly
survey will give a more detailed view of manufacturers' prospects.
Even though manufacturing accounts for just over a fifth of total UK output
 -down from a third in the mid 1970s - the sector has a disproportionate
importance for the UK economy. Many other parts of the economy, including
most service sectors, feed off it. Four fifths of UK exports are
factory-made goods.
Since manufacturing production reached an all-time peak last March, it has
fallen by more than 7 per cent. In that period, employment in the sector has
declined by about 170,000 - some 3 per cent of the workforce. The CBI
expects another 300,000 jobs to be lost by the end of 1992. Many
manufacturers are pinning their hopes on an economic upturn around the
summer. The likely path of any recovery is bound up with the changes in UK
manufacturing since the 1980-81 recession, which claimed 2m jobs in the
sector. Since then, according to one argument, companies have become better
managed, more efficient and subject to fewer disruptive labour practices.
Others, however, point to a large projected fall in manufacturing investment
this year. They are also concerned about the disappointing results in recent
years by British businesses in high-tech areas such as electronics and
advanced engineering.
Mr Correlli Barnet, a Cambridge historian who is a specialist on Britain's
industrial decline since the Second World War, says: 'During the 1980s we
have seen a lot of successful site clearance (in manufacturing), but not
enough reconstruction.'
Central to the argument is the CBI's forecast that manufacturing investment
will fall this year by 17 per cent, after a 5 per cent decline in 1990. That
followed several years of high ing for a big reduction in outlays on plant
and machinery in the early 1980s, it leaves levels of investment in UK
manufacturing no higher than they were at the start of the decade.
According to some, that puts Britain at a disadvantage compared with other
countries such as Japan and Germany, where production companies have
steadily increased investment during the 1980s. One point of view is that
companies will need to increase capital spending during the 1990s at a
greater rate than during the past decade.
Against that, Mr Giles Keating, director of economic research at Credit
Suisse First Boston, a Swiss-owned stockbroker, argues that bald figures do
not always give an accurate description of the usefulness of new investment.
'A lot of spending on capital now is more efficient than it was 10 years
ago,' he says.
In bare statistical terms, however, the outlook does not look promising for
British factories in terms of investment. According to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, non-residential fixed capital
formation in Britain - which includes much production-related investment -
will decline by more than 3 per cent this year.
On the positive side, in recent years exporters have reversed the long-term
decline in the proportion of world trade accounted for by UK goods. The
proportion now stands at just over 6 per cent, as against just under that
figure in 1986. Even though manufactured exports have grown at a healthy
rate over the past decade, imports have increased faster. That led Britain
to switch from a surplus on factory-made items of Pounds 3bn in 1980 to a
deficit last year of Pounds 11bn, itself an improvement on the record
deficit in 1989 of Pounds 17bn.
In spite of the recession and what many in industry argue is an overvalued
exchange rate, exports held up well last year and are still growing - albeit
more slowly. In volume terms the underlying level of manufactured exports -
which exclude erratic items such as ships, aircraft and gems - grew by 9 per
cent in 1990. However, if the first quarter of 1991 is compared with the
first quarter of 1990 the comparable rate is only 2 per cent.
Mr Ian Thompson, chief economist at the Engineering Employers Federation,
believes that the export record gives only one side to the story. He says
that a large part of the increase in exports over the past few years is
represented by the assembly or repackaging of imported manufactured goods,
particularly in high-value areas such as advanced electronic equipment.
Although such 're-exporting' of goods bought from other countries is a
factor of all modern industrial economies, Mr Thompson suspects that the
growth of the phenomenon has been stronger in Britain in recent years than
in other nations - although that is difficult to prove with hard data. 'My
contention is that the UK manufacturing sector will not be big enough to
support the kind of expanding economy that we need in the 1990s,' he says.

FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Share schemes found not to alter
attitudes of workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of an employee share ownership scheme in a Midlands factory
had virtually no effect on the attitudes of workers to their employer in its
first year of operation, according to a report, writes Michael Smith.
The study - by Stephen Dunn and Ray Richardson of the London School of
Economics, and Philip Dewe of Massey University - is the latest in a series
of papers debating the worth of companies' providing shares for their
workers at less than the market rate. Some have concluded that companies
with share schemes reap a reward through improved performance; others found
it has no discernible effect.
The report on the unnamed Midlands factory found that there had been no
change in attitudes that could be attributed to the scheme. In some
respects, attitudes towards the employer had deteriorated, although a
dispute over a wage rise may have been largely to blame.
Far fewer employees actually joined the scheme than a survey of initial
interest had indicated. Of 210 employees, 26 had joined the scheme, 57
initially tempted had stayed out and 127 never considered joining.
Among the first and last groups, attitudes toward the employer were broadly
the same in the two surveys. However, among the group that rejected the
scheme after first being tempted, there was more hostility towards the
employer.
'In the event, we concluded that there had been no change in attitudes which
we felt should be attributed to the scheme. If this is correct, it is hard
to see how it could have had any effect on the behaviour of the employees
and any significant advantages to the company,' the report says.
The paper, published in Human Resource Management Journal, says the low
take-up of the scheme indicates its limitations and highlights the dangers.
The authors say membership often becomes the preserve of the relatively
higher-paid, because workers on low incomes are unwilling to make the five
or seven-year commitment necessary to take part fully. The AEU engineering
union has awarded its 159 national officials a pay rise of 10 per cent. The
salaries of Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary, and Mr Bill Jordan,
president, will rise to Pounds 30,250.

FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Most Tecs favour partnership for
Careers Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST TRAINING and Enter-prise Councils are understood to have told the
government that the Careers Service, which provides advice and guidance to
young people, should be administered in partnership arrangements between
Tecs and the local education authorities, which now run them.
A consultation exercise between the Department of Employment, Tecs and local
education authorities ended on Friday. The Labour-dominated Association of
London Authorities has said the exercise was 'rushed and inadequate' and has
rejected the proposed options. It said the service should remain under LEAs'
control with local advisory committees of all interested parties.
The Department of Employment has been considering the future of the service
for some months. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, gave three options
in his consultation document:
Tecs should acquire full responsibility for providing the Careers Service
Education-business partnerships, jointly operated by LEAs and Tecs, should
be responsible
The service should be contracted out through competitive tender.
Mr Howard said the Careers Service, in place since 1974, had done well under
the circumstances in which it had operated. 'Times, however, have changed,'
he said.
A majority of Tecs is understood to prefer partnership arrangements with
LEAs. Some, though, are not sure that existing business-education
partnership arrangements are the right mechanism.
Mr Michael Hanson, chief executive of South Thames Tec, said: 'We favour a
partnership with local education authorities but we are still agnostic over
whether the education and business partnership is the best mechanism.'
Mr Jon Power, chief executive of Sheffield Tec, said he was concerned about
the lack of detail in the consultation exercise. 'My concern about a
partnership arrangement is that it has to be robust enough to safeguard the
service.'

FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Wapping plant may face industrial
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the EETPU electricians' union are likely this week to order a
ballot that might lead to the first significant industrial dispute at News
International's Wapping plant since it was set up five years ago.
The union said that about 300 members in Wapping had requested the
industrial-action ballot at the weekend after the company's announcement of
185 redundancies - about 130 at Wapping and the rest at plants in Glasgow
and near Liverpool.
Union members, who are among 1,500 production workers employed in the UK by
News International, are angry at the company's decision to put production
workers on a five-day week or nine-day fortnight, against the present
four-day week.
News International said yesterday it was increasing salaries by 7 per cent
to compensate for the changes, taking minimum salaries for pressroom workers
to Pounds 27,000.
Mr Bob Shannon, EETPU national officer, said that about 40 Wapping workers
had joined the union at the weekend. The union's main aim was to get the
company to agree to talks. Although it claims membership of about 60 per
cent, it does not enjoy collective bargaining rights.

FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Railways head for second 'summer of
discontent' - A combustible mixture of union grievances may give rise to a
complicated dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SPRING turns to summer, the temperature of discontent is rising again on
the railways. This afternoon, Mr Jimmy Knapp is likely to alarm London
Underground passengers by announcing that his union has voted for 24-hour
strikes on the network.
That is only the start: it decided on Friday to ballot for similar action on
British Rail.
Threats of simultaneous industrial action on both networks are familiar
enough to commuters. The series of one-day strikes in the 'summer of
discontent' in 1989 caused extensive disruption before helping to force
better terms for the unions. There is a danger that passengers will get
caught in the crossfire again this summer.
The echo of 1989 comes from more than a coincidence of disputes on the two
networks. The complications of the argument are as deep as they were last
time, involving changes in working practices as well as pay. The background
is also similar: efforts by managers to force uncomfortable change on
workers amid financial constraints.
The difference between now and two years ago is one of intensity. The
financial difficulties of both BR and London Underground have grown to the
point where the managers of both are heavily squeezed.
Once again, the outcome of a pitched battle will depend heavily on which
side engages the public's sympathy. The 1989 dispute taught rail employers
not to take for granted the fact that commuters blame rail workers for
disruption. Disenchantment with services means passengers are likely to
sympathise with union criticism of managers.
The BR dispute has so far been a simple wrangle about pay. Because of the
board's financial difficulties, it made an initial offer of 6.5 per cent,
improving it a little last week to what it said was its final offer of 7 per
cent. If extended to cover all 120,000 employees, it would add Pounds 133m
to BR's stretched finances.
Mr Knapp talks of the February inflation figure of 8.9 per cent being the
RMT rail union's 'bottom line', although the board says inflation for the
year the settlement covers will probably be about 6 per cent. Mr Paul
Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, says that to offer more would
be 'irresponsible'.
As was the case two years ago, there has been a divided response from
unions. BR has accepted a call from Aslef, the train drivers' union, to take
the dispute to the Railway Staffs National Tribunal, the industry's
arbitration machinery.
However, the RMT has decided to ballot 60,000 members on industrial action
in spite of the arbitration. The RMT distrusts arbitration because it says
BR has failed to honour awards in the past.
The dispute might become more complicated. BR is in the middle of
restructuring working patterns by introducing flexible rostering over seven
days a week, which will bring down high overtime rates. In return it is
offering improvements in basic wage rates: it will put initial proposals for
drivers to Aslef this week.
BR has started new rosters for 6,500 signals and telecommunications staff
against RMT opposition, and that dispute is to be considered separately by
the tribunal arbitration panel. If there is a pay dispute, restructuring may
be tangled in it in the way that changes in bargaining arrangements became
part of the 1989 dispute.
The London Underground dispute has also started over a simple issue: the
right of the corporation to make 1,005 job cuts. Mr Roger Straker, London
Underground's personnel director, says the cuts are no more than prudent use
of staff.
London Underground managers, rather than allowing a long campaign of
selective strikes, have already drawn up plans to suspend workers who take
part in industrial action. That raises the possibility of huge disruption of
the network if the RMT implements action over cuts which it says will lead
to relatively small savings of Pounds 400,000.
Managers are counting on gaining public support for brisk action against the
RMT, but they may face difficulties if the RMT plays successfully on
passenger disenchantment with services and staff cuts.
The most potent element of the job losses would be the removal of 30 workers
employed after the King's Cross fire to ensure that dust trays under
escalators are cleared daily. London Underground says automatic cleaning
equipment makes such work unnecessary, but the employment of such workers
was one of the recommendations of the Fennell inquiry into the disaster.
Beyond the issue of job cuts, London Underground's annual pay talks, which
are traditionally based on BR's settlement, are now due. Its remaining
ambition to achieve some of the work flexibilities that formed part of the
abortive Action Stations plan of two years ago means that wrangles with
unions are unlikely to subside quickly.
The combustible mixture of grievances and pressures is already warming as
the pay settlement date of April 8 recedes without a pay rise in immediate
prospect. It could be settled by a mixture of arbitration and horse-trading
over numbers. But there is a danger that the summer of 1989 may become an
uncomfortably sharp memory.

FT  29 APR 91 / Consumers portrayed as conformist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of impressions to the contrary, Britain's hippies and punks have
moved aside to make way for a nation of conformists who wash their clothes
regularly and take pride in keeping their homes spick-and-span.
According to a new report from Euromonitor, the market research company:
'The 1970s hippies and 1980s punks have given way to the 1990s conformist,
with the mid-1980s spending boom fuelling a youth culture geared towards
smart and sophisticated attire and quality clothes.'
Partly because of food hygiene scares, consumers have placed an increasing
emphasis on cleanliness in the home in recent years and demand for household
cleaning products, such as kitchen cleaners, washing powders, and furniture
polishes has grown strongly.
The overall market for such items grew by 8.7 per cent in 1989 and was
estimated to have expanded by a further 7.1 per cent in 1990, showing few
signs of abating in spite of recession.
Eighty per cent of households in the UK have a washing machine, according to
Euromonitor, and the average family washes clothes five times a week.

FT  29 APR 91 / Institutions' gain seen in buy-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors in management buy-outs have achieved an average
annual rate of return of 54 per cent from buy-outs subsequently sold,
floated on the stock market or placed in receivership, according to a survey
by KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the accountancy firm.
KPMG, which includes only buy-outs valued at Pounds 10m or more in its
statistics, expects that rate to be depressed by the economic recession.
Institutions have so far realised their investments in 93 of the 299 buy-out
deals which have been completed.
The overall rate of return conceals sharp divergences between the different
types of buy-out company.
Businesses bought from the government as part of its privatisation programme
produced an annual return of 116 per cent, while buy-outs which took listed
companies private produced an average annual loss on the investment of 25
per cent.
Listed company buy-outs have proved the most controversial. They have
practically dried up because of the opposition by institutional investors to
deals which were seen as unduly favourable to the sitting management.
'These figures are likely to prove the nail in the coffin (of that view),'
said Mr Chris Beresford, head of buy-outs at KPMG.

FT  29 APR 91 / Fox move to Thames TV aids franchise bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Paul Fox has joined the board of Thames Television just a few days after
retiring from the BBC as managing director of network television.
The arrival of Sir Paul, who is president of the Royal Television Society
and who will attend his first Thames board meeting on Wednesday, is a boost
to the ITV company in its campaign to retain its franchise.
Thames, the largest ITV company, will be challenged for its franchise in
next month's bids by Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications and by a
joint venture linking Mr David Frost, the broadcaster, and Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin group.
Sir Paul, former managing director of Yorkshire Television, also confirmed
yesterday that he would be chairman of Daybreak, an Independent Television
News-led bid to oust TV-am, the breakfast television company.
Apart from ITN, the Daybreak consortium includes Carlton; The Daily
Telegraph; MAI, an advertising group; NBC, the American network company; and
Taylor Woodrow, the construction company.
Sir Paul was critical yesterday of TV-am's Gulf war coverage. He said ITV
had decided to follow TV-am each morning with news from ITN to put right the
deficiencies of the breakfast company.
Later today, another ITV bidder will announce its plans - Television
Northern Ireland (TVNI), which will bid for the franchise held since the
early days of ITV by Ulster Television.
The Duke of Abercorn, the former Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South
Tyrone, is to chair a consortium backed by Thomson Regional Newspapers,
publishers of The Belfast Telegraph newspaper.
The consortium brings together a number of leading Ulster businessmen,
including Mr Roy Bailey, president-designate of the local CBI. TVNI's
programme controller, Mr Alan Wright, was the original producer of the local
magazine programme, Good Evening Ulster, and until recently was head of
programmes at Chrysalis Television.
In what has turned out to be a ferocious battle for the Northern Ireland
licence in spite of the political sensitivities, another bidder, Lagan
Television, has entered the fray.
Lagan is being advised by Mr Bryan Cowgill, the former managing director of
Thames Television. The Lagan consortium, which says it is oversubscribed,
includes boxing promotor Barney Eastwood, and Mr RJ McCartney, QC, a leading
local lawyer.
TVNI and Lagan will argue the need for better-quality local programmes in
Northern Ireland and will express a desire to make a more significant
contribution to the ITV network than Ulster has so far done.
It is unlikely that the Northern Ireland television franchise will go simply
to the highest bidder.
The Independent Television Commission will almost certainly want to weigh
Ulster Television's experience of coping with Northern Ireland's political
troubles against the bidders' promises of more exciting local and network
programming.

FT  29 APR 91 / Tory pledge on BR sale safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said yesterday that
privatisation of British Rail would not proceed without safeguards to
protect unprofitable lines.
The government has yet to say which of various options it will choose for
the break-up of BR's monopoly, but Mr Rifkind said he was considering
opening up use of the existing rail networks to new operators.
'Certainly what we hope to see is either the whole of British Rail or a very
substantial proportion of British Rail in the private sector during the
course of the next parliament,' he said on BBC Television's On the Record
programme.
'We accept that when the railways are privatised it will be necessary for
the government to continue giving financial support to ensure that all
railway services that are socially necessary are able to continue providing
that service,' said Mr Rifkind.
He said operators who wanted to run services on unprofitable routes would be
asked for their assessment of the minimum subsidy they needed.
If BR could provide the service with a subsidy, it would be awarded the
contract, but anyone providing the same service at less cost to the taxpayer
would also be considered, Mr Rifkind said.
He could see no reason, so long as safety standards were met, for other
operators not to be granted access to all BR's track if they wanted to
provide freight or passenger services.
Privatisation of BR, which would be included in the Conservative party
manifesto, will probably happen in the mid 1990s, Mr Rifkind said.

FT  29 APR 91 / British Gas board meets on price ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of British Gas met late yesterday for last-minute consultations
over the new tariff price formula suggested by the company's regulator, the
Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas).
It looks increasingly likely that the company will accept the proposals,
which will impose tough controls on the prices British Gas can charge its
17m domestic gas users for the next five years.
If British Gas rejects the formula, it will have to submit its arguments to
a full investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That would
involve the disclosure of additional information showing exactly where it
makes its profits.
The new formula will set a limit on the inflation-related price rises
British Gas can impose on domestic users. That will be done by increasing
the efficiency factor, which has to be taken off the rate of inflation to
achieve the rate at which gas prices can rise.
By raising the efficiency factor to 3 to 5 percentage points from its
present level of 2 percentage points, Ofgas will force the company to trim
its costs, possibly by cutting jobs.
The regulator is also expected to insist that British Gas does not pass
through the full rise in its North Sea gas costs to users in an attempt to
make the company develop its own gas fields more efficiently.
Mr James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, may also announce today a new
set of service requirements for British Gas to uphold since consumer groups
have urged that efficiency cuts should not affect service standards.
The regulator is putting additional pressure on the company over
negotiations it is holding with two power station ventures on the price of
gas after the company's 35 per cent price rise for new power station gas
purchases in March.
Mr McKinnon would like to see Thames Power and a Mobil/Eastern Electricity
power station venture agree to take gas under the new price schedule, but to
seek and win damages through the civil courts that would reduce the price of
their gas to the pre-increase level.
Other electricity companies are watching the talks closely and are
threatening a round of writs if the two new power stations are given what
they see as preferential treat-ment.

FT  29 APR 91 / Upset at Ribble Valley rattles council Tories: Local
taxation is the main issue in this closely fought region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE north-west, the by-election defeat for the Conservatives in the
formerly safe parliamentary seat of Ribble Valley in Lancashire has added
spice to what was already destined to be a vigorous three-party tussle.
The local authorities are likely to see shifts in power because a third of
the seats are up for re-election and all the seats are to be contested in 11
districts that have had boundary changes. Up for grabs are the metropolitan
borough councils in Greater Manchester and Merseyside and the district
councils in Cheshire, Cumbria and Lancashire.
Crucially, both main parties agree that Labour needs 21 parliamentary gains
from the Conservatives in the north-west at a general election to install Mr
Neil Kinnock, its leader, in Downing Street.
Not surprisingly, both Labour and the Conservatives are massing their
resources for the fight.
Labour has 14 full-time officials and organisers in the region, co-ordinated
from a new headquarters in Warrington, Cheshire, at the hub of the region's
motorway network.
In 1987, the last time most of this year's contested council seats were
fought, Labour did much worse than expected, failing to capture control of
several councils.
Labour then had fewer than half the full-time workers it has now, and most
were diverted by the party's internal war against the Militant Tendency in
Liverpool.
The Conservatives' regional headquarters is in Bury, near Manchester, at the
heart of a clutch of parliamentary marginals, where three Central Office
organisers help to co-ordinate 30 full-time constituency agents.
At election times, Labour gets additional help from full-time trade union
officials. Therefore from an organisational point of view, the two main
parties are probably more evenly balanced in the north-west than ever
before, and Labour is no longer in disarray.
The battleground itself is one of the UK's key economic and political
regions. With about 7m people, it is a third larger than Scotland and
accounts for about a tenth of UK gross domestic product. About 2.5m and 1.4m
people live in the conurbations of Greater Manchester and Merseyside
respectively.
There are 79 parliamentary constituencies, 38 held by Labour, 37 by the
Conservatives and four by the Liberal Democrats. Even some Labour workers
admit privately that the task of winning 21 Tory seats may be too much,
especially because the Conservatives hope to gain Ribble Valley and
Southport on Merseyside from the Liberal Democrats.
Yet the loss of the formerly safe Ribble Valley in a parliamentary
by-election last month on the single issue of the poll tax has rattled the
Conservatives. At least 13 of their Commons seats are marginal.
Senior figures at risk of losing their seats include Mrs Lynda Chalker, the
overseas development minister, at Wallasey, Merseyside, and Mr David
Trippier, the environment minister, at Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire.
Of the 1,170 seats being contested, Labour is defending 471, the
Conservatives 413 and the Liberal Democrats 116, with 75 Independents and 11
old-style Liberals in Pendle.
Generally, towns and cities already in Labour hands are expected to stay so.
Conservative apprehension will centre on the hung councils of Wirral and
Sefton - both on Merseyside - Chester, Cheshire's Vale Royal, Blackpool and
Lancaster, where the Liberal Democrats are not strong, giving Labour a good
chance of taking control.
Conservatives will also be concerned with results in wards in
Conservative-held parliamentary marginals where Labour came a strong second
in the 1987 general election - Ellesmere Port and Neston, Barrow-in-Furness,
Bolton North-East, Bury North, Bury South, Hyndburn, Lancashire West,
Pendle, Rossendale and Darwen and Wallasey.
The parties will also scan the results for an indication of whether the next
general election will be a three-party one. In Bolton West, Stockport, and
Pendle a strong showing by the Liberal-SDP Alliance ensured Conservative
victories over Labour in 1987. Labour stands to gain those parliamentary
seats if it can pick up a relatively small number of votes from former
Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters.
What happens in Lancashire may be the most telling indicator of the
electorate's mood. Because six district councils have to be elected in their
entirety, more than 421 seats of the north-west's 1,170 will be contested in
Lancashire alone.
Many are in places such as Hyndburn and Rossendale, where working-class
owner-occupation is high - but the houses were formerly low-rated. Thousands
who voted Conservative in such marginal constituencies in 1987 have been
poll-tax losers.
All parties say that their early canvass returns show local taxation to be
the dominant, possibly the only issue.
The Conservatives say everything will depend on how well people understand
the mechanisms by which this year's poll tax bills are being reduced.
Party workers will have to wait for May 2 to discover how the voters of the
north-west have judged the argument.

FT  29 APR 91 / Conservative victory close, says Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said yesterday that the
government is in striking distance of a fourth election victory.
'We are not quite there yet but we are in striking distance,' he said on LBC
Radio. He emphasised that this was because of the prime minister's
leadership style and strengths on the domestic and international stages.
As campaigning intensifies ahead of Thursday's local elections, conflicting
opinion polls suggest that neither the Labour party nor the Conservative
party has a clear lead.
They give widely differing impressions of how the parties are faring.
Most worryingly for Labour, an Independent On Sunday poll by Numbers Market
Research gave the Tories a 10 percentage point lead. Labour officials
dismissed the results as 'rogue'.
The Sunday Telegraph gave Labour a 3 percentage point lead over the Tories
and a Sunday Times Mori poll put the Conservatives 2 points ahead of Labour.
The Sunday Times estimated that the Tories were likely to lose 400 seats in
the local elections, while Labour stood to gain about 600.
The Sunday Telegraph poll said 52 per cent of voters thought Mr Major had
been bold in dealing with the poll tax. A Sunday Express poll said 54 per
cent were in favour of the council tax.
Liberal Democrats, although standing at about 13 per cent or 14 per cent in
the polls, remain pessimistic about Thursday's results, with one official
admiting at the weekend that the party might make net losses.
The party talks instead of raising its influence in areas of strength,
issuing a list of 12 councils where it expects to take control. They include
Berwick-upon-Tweed, Cheltenham, Eastbourne and Colchester.

FT  29 APR 91 / Labour to press on NHS funds today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION MPs plan to press ministers again today after last week's
announcement of about 600 job losses at Guy's Hospital, London, and a
probable 300 at the Bradford Hospitals Trust, as the uproar over National
Health Service funding continues in the run-up to Thursday's
local-government elections.
The financially provoked cuts, announced less than a month after the
introduction of the government's NHS reforms, have led to renewed calls for
publication of the business plans on which ministers granted self-governing
trust status to 57 hospitals and other services.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour health spokesman, has written to Mr William
Waldegrave, health secretary, asking whether the proposed job losses at
Guy's were in its plan.
Mr Waldegrave said in a BBC radio interview yesterday it would have been
wrong to expect hospital managers to predict last year - when the business
plans were prepared - exactly what their income would be for this year.
He agreed that a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, chartered accountants
and management consultants, had shown that only about 12 of the trust
candidates were without financial difficulties.
Mr Waldegrave said, however, that it had been his job to judge whether the
solution was going to come 'from the very management structure which had
created those problems' or from setting up trusts.
Under the health reforms, trust hospitals such as Guy's manage their own
day-to-day affairs. All hospitals, whether trusts or directly managed, now
receive their finance from contracts negotiated with health authorities and
general practitioners.
The more competitive funding system means that further cuts and service
reductions, such as those announced last week, are likely - particularly in
London, where the hospital sector faces substantial rationalisation.
The Guy's and Bradford job cuts, coming so soon after the start of the
reforms and just before the local government elections, have embarrassed the
government.
Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive of Guy's hospital, stands by his
decision to tell his staff last week that jobs needed to be shed.
He said: 'Too often, problems in the NHS have been caused by money running
out towards the end of the financial year and forcing hospitals into sudden,
unplanned decisions. I thought it was right to make the position clear at
the start of the financial year so that we would have as much time as
possible to tackle it.'
On Saturday Mr John Major, the prime minister, and other ministers met
medical and health specialists to discuss targets for improving the nation's
health. The meeting kept to its planned agenda, although Mr Major emphasised
to his audience that the government had no intention of reducing the overall
resources devoted to the NHS. He said the objective was to get more health
care for every pound spent.
The plans for health targets discussed on Saturday will be published by the
Department of Health next month. Although the idea is welcomed by health
specialists, it is likely to generate more controversy. Critics say that the
government's economic policies have added to the health problems of poorer
people.

FT  29 APR 91 / Council tax forecast to add Pounds 5bn to PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of the new council tax may lead to a Pounds 5bn-a-year
increase in the public-sector borrowing requirement, requiring increased
issues of gilts or a delay in tax cuts. The warning comes in a report
published today by Midland Montagu Research, a research offshoot of Midland
Bank.
The report, which appears in Midland Montagu's Greenwell Gilt Weekly, says
that the government's attempts to minimise the local tax burden on
individuals through subsidies to local authorities or transitional relief
schemes may increase public-sector borrowing in the next three years.
Councils have borrowed much more than forecast in recent years. In 1990-91,
councils borrowed a record Pounds 3.5bn, more than the total borrowing in
the four years before.
High wage settlements and greater demands on local services may push up
council spending even further in the coming year. Borrowing might increase
still more in the short term, as the report fears that the rate of
collection of the poll tax may fall.
'Now that the government line is to abolish the tax - as it is
'uncollectable' - it is unlikely that the collection rate will pick up in
the coming year,' the report says.
In the medium term, higher subsidies from the government may be required to
keep poll tax bills down in the year 1992-93, especially if the collection
rate has fallen the previous year.
In the long term, the introduction of the new tax in 1993-94 may lead to
councils increasing spending and blaming rising bills on cuts in government
support.
For 1991-92, the report forecasts the contribution of local government
overspending to the public-sector borrowing requirement might be almost
Pounds 2bn. In later years the cost of introducing the new tax might
increase the PSBR by Pounds 5bn or more.
The report claims the council tax will be more workable than the poll tax,
and says that ultimately it could have a positive effect on public finances,
by bringing greater stability, and making it more difficult for local
authorities to go on 'spending sprees'.

FT  29 APR 91 / Production and Employment: A Germany divided poses new
challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and JILL LEYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL-OUT from the monetary and political unification of east and west
Germany last year has left German policy-makers facing two very different
economic challenges.
Reliable statistics for industrial production and employment in the eastern
Lander are still hard to come by, but it is quite clear that the east German
economy has collapsed over the past nine months under the dual burden of
competition from the west and rapidly rising east German wages. Meanwhile,
consumer demand and industrial output in west Germany have continued to grow
at an apparently unsustainable pace, as the economic indicators show in the
chart.
The growth of output of west German companies has accelerated since the
collapse of the Berlin wall in October 1989, when east German consumers were
first able freely to travel to the west. Industrial production in 1990 was
5.2 per cent higher than in 1989.
Companies have also switched resources away from producing exports in order
to supply the expanding home market. The catalyst for this change was the
deterioration in Germany's export competitiveness which has occurred over
the past year. Rising German interest rates have attracted foreign capital
into Germany, causing the D-Mark to appreciate and pushing the German
current account into deficit in January of this year.
Retail sales were buoyant in the western Lander in late 1989 and early 1990,
but it was monetary unification last July, and the consequent rise in the
purchasing power of east German savings, which provided the biggest fillip
for west German retailers. Retail sales in the third quarter of last year
were 13.3 per cent higher than in the equivalent period in 1989, compared to
6 per cent higher sales in the second quarter of 1990.
The demand for labour in west Germany has also increased sharply as
companies have expanded production to meet rising demand for their output.
Vacancies in 1990 were almost double their level of 1986, while unemployment
fell to 4.5 per cent of the workforce in February 1991, from 7.2 per cent in
1985.
This increased tightness in the labour market has been manifested in a rise
in the level of wage claims. This combination of strong consumer demand and
increased wage pressure explains why the Bundesbank remains nervous about
inflation and may want to increase interest rates in Germany again, despite
falling output and rising unemployment in the east.
These and many other trends in the world economy are visible in the fourth
of our new series of statistical tables for the six largest industrial
countries. It follows tables covering National Accounts (April 8 1991),
Balance of Payments (April 15 1991) and Money and Finance (April 22 1991).
Today's table consists of five series which together provide a detailed
picture of both historical trends and future prospects for industrial
output, retail sales and employment.
The industrial production and retail sales series are shown annually in
index form (1985 = 100), and quarterly and monthly as growth rates on the
equivalent period in the previous year.
Because all countries calculate unemployment rates in different ways, the
table contains standardised unemployment rates for each country, adjusted by
the OECD from national sources to approximate to the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment.
This definition includes only those persons of working age who are without
work, available for work and actively seeking work. This unemployment
definition may not adequately capture the true rate of unemployment.
Published figures for unemployment in east Germany, for example, understate
the true level of unemployment considerably, since many 'employed' workers
are merely being paid to stay at home until they can legally be made
redundant later this year.
Changes in the level of job vacancies in an economy often provide an
advanced warning of future changes in unemployment or inflation, yet few
countries attempt systematically to record total available vacancies.
In the UK, the available measure of vacancies - unfilled vacancies at
job-centres - is estimated to represent about one third of total vacancies
in the economy. No vacancy data are available at all for Italy, while in the
US a help-wanted index, based on jobs advertised in main metropolitan
newspapers, is used as a proxy for actual vacancies.
The table contains a vacancy rate indicator which the FT has constructed for
each country except Italy. The available raw vacancy data for each country,
or proxy for the US, have been divided by total civilian employment, to
adjust for changes in the size of the employed work-force, and converted
into an index with 1985 = 100.
This vacancy rate indicator is informative, but must be used with care. Only
general trends in the index can be compared across countries, not levels or
even percentage changes. Even within countries, percentage changes in the
index over time must be interpreted with caution.
The composite leading indicators are weighted averages of a number of
forward-looking economic indicators for each country, which are compiled by
the OECD. Cyclical movements in the monthly index should precede cyclical
fluctuations in the index of industrial production by about six to nine
months.
The indicators included in the index vary across countries, but will often
include share price movements, housing starts or results from surveys of
business confidence.
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data
for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly
and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and
are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a
percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading
indicator are end-period values.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH Prime Minister Michel Rocard today begins a visit to New Zealand seen
as important in improving a relationship which for six years has been deeply
troubled.
Difficulties have included the Rainbow Warrior affair - when French agents
blew up a Greenpeace vessel of that name in Auckland harbour in 1985 -
irritation over French refusal to stop testing nuclear weapons in the
Pacific, and trade difficulties with the EC.
In turn, Mr Rocard's visit, the first by a French prime minister, is
important to the National party government of Mr Jim Bolger, which was
elected in December and wants to emphasise its desire to retain and
strengthen New Zealand's place in Europe just as France sees a similar role
for itself in the Pacific.
Wellington acknowledges that France gives essential aid to the economically
troubled small Pacific states, money that might otherwise have to come from
New Zealand. The government, obsessed with domestic economic problems of its
own, is happy with the French involvement and aware that it is based in part
on a determination to be some sort of counter to growing Japanese power in
the region.
There are also hopes that the visit will help improve trade flows running in
New Zealand's favour, mainly because of substantial agricultural exports,
notably wool. France has recently stepped up its investments in New Zealand
and has won business there, including landing substantial contracts, against
UK competition, to upgrade New Zealand's telecommunication networks over
seven years.
In its talks with Mr Rocard, the New Zealand government will be keen to show
a more conciliatory, less doctrinaire approach than the former government of
Mr David Lange.
However, Mr Bolger will have to tread warily, as there is deep animosity to
the tests.

THE future of European defence should be discussed in Nato with the
Americans, EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday, writes David Buchan in
Luxembourg.
At an informal meeting, the more Atlanticist states - Britain, the
Netherlands and Portugal - appeared to stem the tide in the political union
negotiations that had been moving in favour of presenting Nato and the US
with a fait accompli on European defence. This would be based on a western
European union ever more closely tied to the Community.
The US has warned Europeans that in building up the WEU, they should not
tamper with the Nato military structure or take action outside the Nato area
without consulting the alliance.
Commission president Jacques Delors urged Nato to hasten its strategic
review, due by the autumn.

FT  29 APR 91 / US rethinking Moscow policy: Washington accepts that
approach to encouraging reform has failed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration now accepts that its approach to encouraging
economic reform in the Soviet Union has failed and that new methods will
have to be adopted.
A senior official said the attempt to stimulate reform through the
International Monetary Fund-led study of last December 'did not work',
because President Mikhail Gorbachev had been unable or unwilling to grasp
the proposals for a movement to a market economy.
This reflects pessimism within the administration about the prospects both
for reform and for Mr Gorbachev's survival. US officials are beginning to
hedge their bets by talking about contacts with conservatives in the armed
forces and defence industries as well as with reformers, such as Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister. Mr Shevardnadze is due to
deliver an important address in Washington in 10 days.
US officials have not given up hope on the possibility of a union treaty
between Moscow and republics such as the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia
and the Russian federation by the end of the year. But even if this is
achieved, the question remains of whether a reform programme can be worked
out and implemented.
The administration has been forced to review its approach by the marked
deterioration in the Soviet economy in the last few months, and the
continuing power struggle.
The proposal in the December report for the Soviet Union to have associate
status with the IMF and the World Bank - to assist its integration into the
international financial community - has now been put on the 'back-burner',
according to Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs.
The main US priority is to sustain economic and political reform in eastern
and central Europe and to insulate those countries as far as possible from
the growing economic problems to their east. The US has pressed its allies
to be supportive of these countries.
The US Bush administration believes the economic programme of Mr Valentin
Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, is certain to fail. This gloomy
assessment is far more explicit than US officials have been prepared to go
in the past.

FT  29 APR 91 / Democrats warned on banking reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, will this week attempt to save
as much as possible of his comprehensive banking reform legislation after
warning House Democratic leaders against pursuing their plan for a narrow
bill excluding changes in the structure of the industry.
Congressmen Henry Gonzalez and Frank Annunzio, Democratic chairmen of the
House banking committee and a key sub-committee, have introduced legislation
proposing recapitalising the financially strained bank insurance fund, new
bank accounting standards and tighter supervision of problem banks.
This would omit the Treasury's proposals for interstate branch banking and
for allowing bank holding companies to become involved in a wide range of
financial services.
Mr Brady has described as 'the height of folly' the suggestion that any
legislation this year should be restricted to recapitalising the fund. 'We
should reform the industry and fix the problem, not just feed it and fund
it.'
The issue of the scope of banking legislation will come to a head in this
week's talks aimed a producing a compromise.
Mr Brady argues that a majority of the House banking committee, including
the minority Republican caucus, joined by a number of Democrats, have
expressed support for the need for comprehensive bank reform, in contrast to
the views of their leaders. This view is also supported by all the banking
regulators, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in
spite of reservations on detailed features.
Senate banking committee members are more sympathetic to Mr Brady's position
and this summer are expected to pass legislation which will not only
recapitalise the fund but will also reform deposit insurance and allow some
extension of bank activities.
There is plenty of time, Mr Brady argues, to consider comprehensive reform
since the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said more resources will
not be needed before October, and perhaps much later than that.
The urgency of recapitalising the fund has been underlined by new estimates
by the General Accounting Office that without quick action the fund will
'almost certainly be insolvent by next year.'

FT  29 APR 91 / German Green party conference does not support 'realo'
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an incident when a delegate aimed a water pistol at another member
of Germany's Green party the Greens took steps towards creating a more
conventional party structure at their weekend conference. However, they did
not, as had been expected, support a full-scale takeover by the pragmatic
'realo' wing.
The conference abolished the rotation principle, under which representatives
served only one term in office, and which had helped to mark the Greens as a
counter-culture movement rather than a real party. Also, a group of far-left
ecologists decided to leave the Greens. However the Greens stopped short of
swallowing all the 'realo' medicine and elected two left-wing leaders.

MRS Winnie Mandela, on trial in South Africa for kidnapping and assault, was
unexpectedly defeated at the weekend in an election to a senior post in the
African National Congress.
The wife of Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC deputy president, lost a secret ballot
for the presidency of the ANC Women's League.
This post carries automatic membership of the ANC's policy-making National
Executive Committee, under the organisation's proposed new constitution.
Mrs Gertrude Shope, a moderate on the ANC national executive, became Women's
League president late on Saturday night when she took 400 votes to the 196
of Mrs Mandela, who represents the organisation's most radical wing.
Despite her defeat, Mrs Mandela seems likely to be elected in July to an
expanded, 120-member ANC national executive.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Wakeham, UK energy secretary, said yesterday he had 'every reason to
believe' that British companies would soon receive substantial contracts to
help cap Kuwait's blazing oil wells.
Senior UK oil industrialists who accompanied Mr Wakeham on his three-day
visit to the emirate also said they were confident of winning a share of the
fire-fighting and capping work, now being undertaken by three US companies
and a Canadian group.
The British delegation is among groups from around the world, including
China and the Soviet Union, which have responded to the Kuwait government's
appeal this month for more help in fighting the fires. However, no further
contracts have yet been confirmed.
Mr Wakeham told reporters yesterday he expected contracts towards repairing
Kuwait's oil production facilities to amount eventually to 'a good many
billions of dollars'. He added: 'I have every reason to believe the Kuwait
Oil Company will be asking a British team to do some of the work.'
The British delegation, headed by Mr Basil Butler, president of the
Institute of Petroleum and a former chairman of the Kuwait Oil Company, is
offering expertise in management and damage assessment, as well as in direct
fire-fighting. British fire-fighters would be expected to concentrate on
blazes in northern oilfields, where no capping has begun. Many of the
delegation stressed UK expertise in addressing the fires by drilling relief
wells, rather than by tackling the well-head.
Mr Butler said it was too early to examine how long it might take to
extinguish the fire, but said there was little prospect of this within a
year.  More than 60 wells have been capped so far of the more than 500 set
alight by the Iraqis.

FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Global interdependence underscored -
Communique from G7 meeting in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following is an edited version of the statement issued last night by the
finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven nations
meeting in Washington.
The Ministers and Governors underscored that their countries are part of a
highly interdependent global economy in which economic power and
responsibility is shared. Accordingly, they reiterated that the pursuit of
international economic policy co-ordination is essential to achieving their
common objective of sustained growth with price stability and reaffirmed
their support for the policy co-ordination process.
With this in mind, the Ministers and Governors reviewed the global economic
situation and prospects in the aftermath of the Gulf War. They noted the
signs of prospective economic recovery and lower inflation in those
countries which are in recession. They also noted the persistence of high
real interest rates and the slowing of economic activity in those countries
which until recently had been experiencing strong expansion.
Against this background, Ministers and Governors emphasised the importance
of monetary and fiscal policies which provide the basis for lower real
interest rates and a sustained global economic recovery with price
stability. They believed that such a medium-term strategy was the best way
of reducing potential risks and uncertainties in the current outlook. They
reiterated the importance of policies aimed at increasing global savings.
They agreed to monitor the situation closely and to take actions as needed
within the co-ordination process with a view to achieving a sound recovery
and a growing world economy.
Given the close linkage between trade and growth, the Ministers and
Governors also emphasised the importance of bringing the Uruguay Round (of
trade talks under Gatt) to a successful conclusion.
The Ministers and Governors also reviewed developments in international
financial markets and reaffirmed their commitment to co-operate closely on
exchange markets.
The Ministers and Governors welcomed the reform efforts under way in Central
and Eastern Europe, and in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
They agreed that a strong global economic recovery and open markets in the
major industrial countries will provide necessary support for these efforts.
. .
The Ministers and Governors encouraged developing countries to continue the
pursuit of market-oriented reforms, and underscored the importance of active
IMF and World Bank support for this effort, both through conditionality and
financing. In this connection, they reaffirmed their commitment to implement
the increase in IMF quotas by the end of the year.

EFFORTS to erase Peru's Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.24bn) in arrears to
multilateral financial institutions are to resume today in Washington,
Stephen Fidler writes.
Countries and organisations friendly to Peru are to meet as finance
officials gather for the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.
Neither institution, nor the Inter-American Development Bank, can lend in
support of Peru's economic reform programmes until it has cleared the
arrears.

FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Lamont to push plan for poor nations' debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, will this week seek
international backing for a British plan to ease the debt burden of the
poorest developing nations.
The plan, known as the Trinidad Terms, is designed to cut and make more
manageable the debts owed to western governments by poor nations
implementing market-oriented economic policies.
It was first proposed by Mr John Major, when chancellor, at a conference of
Commonwealth finance ministers last autumn, and will be relaunched during
the spring meetings today and tomorrow of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank with the aim of reaching agreement at the London Economic
Summit in July.
Under the Trinidad Terms, members of the Paris Club of creditor governments
would forgive two thirds of the qualifying country's official debt and grant
extended repayment terms for the remainder.
Last week Mr Barber Conable, World Bank president, supported the UK plan. It
is expected that the chancellor will argue in tomorrow's session of the
joint IMF-World Bank development committee that action to help the poorest
countries is urgent in the light of the recent Paris Club decision to
forgive 50 per cent of Poland's official debt.
The UK is also seeking a more influential role in the committee. The
government has proposed that Mr Peter Mountfield, a Treasury undersecretary,
should be the committee's next executive secretary.
The committee was set up in 1974 and is made up of government
representatives from developed and third world countries.
Its job is to promote the transfer of resources to the developing world. The
executive secretary is responsible for planning, organising and reporting on
its work.

FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: US wants to use framework for political
discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is seeking to develop the Group of Seven framework of regular
economic discussions into a mechanism for more frequent political
co-ordination among the leading industrial countries, Peter Riddell writes.
The idea has been floated by Mr Robert Kimmitt, US Under-secretary of State
for political affairs, as a means of involving Japan and Germany, as well as
the European Community, more closely in international political discussions.
None is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, whose role was
enhanced by the Gulf crisis.
At present, the heads of government of the G7 - the US, Japan, Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy, with the EC attending - meet annually and
issue a political statement to accompany their economic communique. These
political discussions are held only once a year but the G7 finance ministers
meet on at least four other occasions to review economic policy
co-ordination, as they did yesterday.
The US wants this regular framework of economic consultation to be matched
on the political side. Mr Kimmitt is expected to raise the idea at a meeting
in Hong Kong this week of G7 political directors (senior foreign ministry
officials) in preparation for the annual summit - this year in London in
mid-July.
Mr Kimmitt argues that the success of the Gulf coalition has underlined the
importance of collective political action: 'But now the true test is to see
if we can prepare for and avert crises. The G7 is the one agency that, we
believe, can be useful to meet more frequently and more regularly to
anticipate and avert political crises.'
The US has been pondering for some time how to involve Japan and Germany
more closely in political discussions; the problem was underlined by the
Gulf crisis. Not only were these countries outside the UN Security Council,
they were also being asked to contribute financially to US efforts without
having had a say in decisions.
An expansion of the political role of the G7 is seen by senior State
Department officials as a way to broaden and make more politically
acceptable calls for sharing burdens or responsibilities.

FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Stalemate on arms spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN attempt to build a consensus among developing countries about the need to
reduce military expenditures failed yesterday, Stephen Fidler writes.
A meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 24 developing countries
dropped a reference to the issue from their communique for procedural
reasons. The Colombian chairmanship had introduced the item too late for
inclusion in the statement.
There has been growing pressure among industrialised nations for aid to
developing countries to be made conditional on low military spending. Mr
Rudolf Hommes, Colombia's finance minister, said high spending on arms
diverted resources away from poverty alleviation, health and other
development spending. Expenditures should be cut in both industrialised and
developing countries, he said.
The ministers expressed worries about the slowdown in growth in
industrialised countries and 'the worsening of the already unfavourable
external environment facing the developing countries.'
They also emphasised the need to keep up Third World representation in the
World Bank and IMF. There are concerns that new eastern European members of
the institution will further dilute the developing countries' influence on
the institutions.

FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Brady's tight schedule calls for some fast
talking - G7 Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is either a harsh taskmaster or an
incurable optimist.
He packed no fewer than seven items onto the agenda of yesterday's Group of
Seven meeting which began only at 11.30am and was to end at 5.15pm -
although in the event it slightly overran. The most contentious issue - the
world economy and the policies to be pursued to ensure low inflationary
growth - was given 1 1/2 hours at the beginning. A discussion on exchange
markets was scheduled over an hour-long working lunch.
Trade and financial issues relating to eastern Europe were allocated 50
minutes to 2.50pm, and ministers and central bank governors were then
expected to polish off long-term developments in the Middle East in the 40
minutes to 3.30.
Some 50 minutes were alloted to the international debt question, including
how best to help Egypt and how to avoid granting too favourable debt
forgiveness terms to too many countries. The 25 minutes to 4.45 were deemed
enough to deal with relations between the Soviet Union and the so-called
IFIs - bodies such as the IMF and World Bank. In the final scheduled
half-hour the 21 assembled finance ministers, central bankers and top
treasury officials were due to discuss the communique.
Under this schedule, if only the seven finance ministers opened their
mouths, they would have had 13 minutes each to discuss Mr Brady's wish for
lower interest rates and a mere 3 1/2 minutes each to address the Soviet
Union's future links to the IFIs.
We can only guess what G7 new boy Donald Mazankowski made of this. Mr
Mazankowski ('Maz') was appointed Canadian finance minister a week ago.
Known as 'minister for everything', because of the large number of
government offices he has held since 1979, Maz is said to be as hard-working
as his predecessor, Michael Wilson, who despite taking over Canada's trade
and industry portfolio will be chairing today's meeting of the IMF
policymaking interim committee.
Maz is a grassroots politician and has had only limited dealings with
economic issues. But this should be no handicap. Among the finance
ministers, France's Pierre Beregovoy, Japan's Ryutaro Hashimoto and
Germany's Theo Waigel came to their present jobs from non-financial
backgrounds.
Karl Otto Pohl, the German Bundesbank president, seems to be developing some
affection for European economic and monetary union. Speaking to the G7
Council, a talking shop of the great and the good, he recalled that the
feathered variety of Emu has two characteristics: it can't fly and can only
go forward. That specification would suit Mr Pohl, who doesn't want to rush
union.
The application in January by Albania to join the two institutions leaves
only three sizeable countries outside their sphere of influence. Although
the question of the Soviet Union's membership is likely to be put off for
some time, the institutions are regularly sending missions there. The
countries without applications pending are a rather odd mix: Cuba, North
Korea and Brunei.
The World Bank's new chief economist, Larry Summers, already has at the age
of 35 a pretty impressive resume. Eight years ago he became professor at
Harvard University, said to have been the youngest so appointed. If Michael
Dukakis was now in the White House, Summers would have almost certainly been
the head of his Council of Economic Advisors. He has made his first public
pronouncements since joining the bank over the past week, suggesting that he
will not be afraid to tackle some of the broad issues now facing the bank -
such as the link between economic performance and democracy.
Of the statistics he is fond of quoting, he points to one as the most
striking: that infant mortality is higher and life expectancy lower in New
York City than in Shanghai. The Chinese, he notes, spend only 5 per cent of
their Dollars 500 annual per capita income on health care.
In the third world, Yemen, Sri Lanka and Indonesia have about the same per
capita income. Yet life expectancy in Yemen is 51 years, in Indonesia 60 and
Sri Lanka 70.

FT  29 APR 91 / Bank initiative will tackle legal uncertainties in City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is launching an initiative to identify areas of legal
uncertainty which could harm London's standing as an international financial
centre.
A committee of leading City figures and members of the legal profession will
be chaired by Lord Alexander, chairman of the National Westminster Bank and
a leading barrister.
The initiative, spearheaded by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank Governor,
will address problems arising from grey areas of the law.
Most notorious is the local authority swaps affair where banks face losing
hundreds of millions of pounds because of confusion in local authority law.
Legal uncertainties have also posed difficulties in the stock lending
market.
The committee will have a full-time secretariat based at the Bank of
England, and will include a senior Bank official and a lawyer on secondment
from a City firm.
It will be funded and supported by the Bank, the major UK banks and leading
City law firms and will report to the Governor. It's first report will be
within a year or earlier if there are pressing issues.
The Bank says there is widespread City support for the committee. The City
needs firm legal underpinnings to succeed as an international financial
centre, particularly with mounting competition from centres on the
Continent.
Problems have arisen because the speed of innovation has left the law behind
in some cases and because many City practices are based on tradition rather
than the law.
The Bank says that committee's remedies will try to avoid the need for new
legislation. Where this is not possible, representations will be made to the
government on the need to clarify the legal position.
The committee includes representatives of foreign as well as UK banks. There
are also representatives of the investment banking and fund management
industries. The 11 members are Lord Alexander (NatWest), Gottfried Bruder
(Commerzbank), Lachlan Burn (Linklaters &amp; Paines), Robin Fox (Kleinwort
Benson), Mr Justice Hoffman, Charles McVeigh (Salomon), Humphrey Norrington
(Barclays), Ian Plenderleith (Bank of England), Peter Stormonth Darling
(Mercury Asset Management), Nicholas Wilson (NatWest), and Philip Wood
(Allen &amp; Overy).
The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee of the House of Commons
plans to give "further consideration" to the local authority swaps affair.
Any further steps will be await the conclusion of the review of the affair
by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The Bank has urged retrospective legislation to regularise the swap
transactions after the Law lords ruled that councils could not engage in
swaps.

FT  29 APR 91 / EC ministers back plan to protect Kurds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONDORF-LES-BAINS, LUXEMBOURG,, ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday backed Britain's proposal for
a United Nations police force to provide Kurdish refugees with protection on
their return to Iraq.
Their decision at a meeting in southern Luxembourg came as western military
officials prepared to extend the security zone in northern Iraq further east
yesterday. Officials confirmed that allied forces were already 30km east of
Zakho, the Iraqi town at the centre of the safe havens plan.
Brigadier Andrew Keeling of the British Royal Marines said the forces were
ready to extend the zone 'as far as we feel necessary to give adequate
protection'.
The plan is now to push further east into the main valleys along the
Iraqi-Turkish border where the largest concentrations of refugees fled after
Baghdad's crushing of the short-lived Kurdish rebellion.
The UK marine commander said the military was ready, but was still waiting
on a political decision. He added the logical step would then be to push
further south, Anatolia the official Turkish news agency reported.
In Mondorf-les-Bains Mr Jacques Poos, foreign minister of Luxembourg which
has the EC presidency, said the British idea to replace allied troops with
UN police had unanimous EC support. But some of Britain's partners were
sceptical of the UK belief that it could be done without a fresh UN
resolution.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said: 'The idea is to enable the
UN, without stretching its constitutional position, to provide protection as
well as relief for the Kurds.' The plan would go to New York as a British
initiative, but with the support of France and Belgium, currently on the
Security Council, and all EC states.
Explaining that the UK did not want to keep its troops in southern Turkey
and northern Iraq for more than 'a relatively small number of months', Mr
Hurd expressed the hope that the despatch of lightly-armed police, rather
than soldiers, might be possible under UN Resolution 688. The resolution
passed earlier this month seeks an end to Baghdad's repression of its
citizens.
He was not confident that a fully-fledged UN peacekeeping force, as sent to
southern Iraq, would receive Security Council backing.
Mr Hurd believed that eventually the Kurdish refugees would be persuaded to
come off the mountains and return home. He agreed that unarmed UN aid
workers might not appear sufficient security for the Kurds. But if the UN
police idea was approved, Mr Hurd said it should be possible for it to be
covered in the understandings that Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, has reached with Baghdad.
There were signs yesterday the UN may be indeed be preparing for a larger
role in the operation. A UN team visited the new sites for the first time,
before having talks with local Iraqi officials.
Mr Stefan Demistura, head of the three-man UN team, said: 'This is a
preparatory mission and we are talking with camp officials about
humanitarian issues and will introduce ourselves to the Iraqis in Zakho.'
Mr Poos also addressed the question of reported human rights abuses in
Kuwait. The EC presidency had already complained to Kuwait about abuses and
would do so again next week when Kuwait and other gulf states negotiate with
the EC on trade, he said. Mr Hurd also said he would press European concerns
when he visits Kuwait later this week.

FT  29 APR 91 / Peking wants to vet choice of HK judges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is demanding the right to have significant influence in the
appointment of all judges to a court of final appeal to be set up in Hong
Kong before the colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
This has been resisted by the UK and is being attacked by senior lawyers in
the territory who believe it shows that Peking intends to try to undermine
the colony's long-term judicial independence.
China is believed to want to vet the names of judges appointed to the
proposed new court before it takes Hong Kong back from Britain.
It also wants to restrict the appointment of non-Chinese permanent judges,
as well as expatriate judicial experts.
This could lead to a further diplomatic row with Britain, which fears
international confidence in Hong Kong will be hit if businessmen lose faith
in the territory's legal system.
Mr Anthony Rodgers, chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, said last
night: 'Any attempt to influence the appointment of judges before 1997 will
whittle away at the powers of the court of final appeal. It goes to the root
of judicial independence.'
China's demands are similar to its stance over Hong Kong's planned HKDollars
100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) airport. In both cases it is demanding consultations
and consensus on key issues that straddle the 1997 sovereignty handover.
Hong Kong, backed by the UK, has been resisting this, arguing that any
insistence on consensus would amount to virtual control.
At some stage, however, a compromise solution will be attempted.
The final appeal court is to be set up, probably with five permanent judges,
to replace Britain's Privy Council, which at present hears final appeals
from Hong Kong. This is contained in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration
on the 1997 handover, and in the Basic Law which will govern Hong Kong.
These documents promise judicial independence 'free from any interference'
after 1997.
The Basic Law says that judges should be appointed f executive 'on the
recommendation of an independent commission'.
Britain had assumed that China would not try before 1997 to influence the
choice of judges who are picked by an existing judicial services commission.
China has told the Sino-British joint-liaison group, which is preparing for
the handover, that it has a right to a say because it will inherit the
judges.
It has been putting forward names of Chinese lawyers and solicitors to
support its argument and to try to offset the fact that there are only three
ethnic Chinese among the High Court's 25 judges.
China has also insisted that the opening of the final appeal court should be
delayed from next year until 1994. Lawyers fear that this will seriously
reduce the court's ability to build up a track record before it comes under
China's direct influence.

FT  29 APR 91 / G7 agrees need to lower rates: Germany defends economic
policies against pressure from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MEDIUM-TERM strategy to lower real interest rates and promote world growth
was agreed yesterday by finance ministers and central bank governors from
the Group of Seven main industrial countries.
There was no indication in a communique issued after the meeting in
Washington that Germany had bowed to US pressure for an early cut in its own
interest rates.
Instead, the statement papered over the cracks between the US and Germany,
allowing all sides to claim that a day of tough talks had ended with G7
backing for their respective policies.
The statement emphasised 'the importance of monetary and fiscal policies
which provide the basis for lower real interest rates and a sustained global
economic recovery with price stability'.
Referring to the ministers, it added: 'They believed that such a medium-term
strategy was the best way of reducing potential risks and uncertainties in
the current outlook.'
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, said the emphasis now was more
on the interdependence of the global economy. This marked a change away from
past communiques which focused on high inflation and slow growth.
He told journalists he believed there was now 'relative price stability in
the US', and he expected that 'over time' there would be lower interest
rates in Germany and Japan.
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, said Germany was not opposed to
lower interest rates, but they had to be earned. The German economy was
expanding strongly and had to react to that. This was now better understood
by the US.
'Policy co-ordination does not mean that countries have to do the same thing
at the same time,' he said. A British official said the statement was in
line with UK policy of promoting growth through price stability. He
emphasised that the communique stressed the importance of fiscal policy in
achieving this end.
Immediately before the G7 met, President George Bush told the finance
ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada that the US wanted lower rates to foster global
growth.
The president's unusual intervention demonstrated that US concern about the
risk of worldwide recession exists at the highest political level.
The G7 meeting also discussed the gathering economic crisis in the Soviet
Union, problems of Third World debt and underlined importance of bringing
the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks to a successful conclusion.
Apart from underlining the need for sustained economic reform in the Soviet
Union, the communique gave no indication of what the west would do.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said it was clear there would
be great concern among the G7 if the Soviet Union got into greater
difficulties. Its problems had to be seen in connection with the efforts of
eastern and central Europe to reform their economies and political systems.
He said the G7 would foster dialogue and help for the Soviet Union, showing
the USSR how to boost exports and productivity.
Before the meeting with President Bush, the German and US delegations met
bilaterally to air their differences over the US demand for lower German
interest rates.
Speaking afterwards, both Mr Waigel and Mr Pohl made clear that the German
delegation had delivered a robust defence of German economic and monetary
policies, including the present level of the country's interest rates.

The reaction of financial markets to the US recession reminds me of the
small boy who was given a pile of dung for Christmas. An incurable optimist,
he dived into the smelly heap, shouting: 'There's gotta be a pony in here
somewhere.'
But it is not just Wall Street that ought to be reprogramming its errant
computers. In the light of depressing recent figures, the White House
forecast prepared by Dr Michael Pangloss (or is it Boskin?), also looks like
an exercise in self-deception. In January, the Bush administration,
confident perhaps that victory in the Gulf would revive the economy, said
the worst of the recession was over. Gross National Product would fall at an
annual rate of only 1.3 per cent in the first quarter and then start to
recover. In the event, real output fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent,
nearly twice as fast as at the end of last year. Rather than easing off, the
recession appears to have gained momentum.
The White House said the downturn would be one of the shortest in post-war
history. Wheels turn slowly in academia, but the wise men entrusted to chart
the contours of the business cycle finally delivered their verdict last
week. The National Bureau of Economic Research's dating committee identified
July as the month when the US downturn began. The recession has thus already
been running for nine months: it is shaping up as an average rather than a
particularly mild contraction. And contrary to the claims of many
commentators, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, it
was not caused by President Saddam Hussein. His disruption of world oil
markets merely accelerated a decline whose ultimate roots lie in the
excesses of the 1980s.
With industrial production, employment, retail sales and order books still
falling, optimists are pinning their hopes of imminent recovery on three
main indicators: the stock market boom that took the Dow briefly past 3,000;
signs of recovery in the housing market; and a fall in the number of people
claiming unemployment insurance.
The stock market has been right more often than wrong. Forecasters,
therefore, should respect its collective wisdom. But it is a mirror of
prevailing sentiment rather than an independent indicator: it is telling us
that investors are more confident, not confirming their grounds for
confidence.
The tentative signs of recovery in housing also warrant attention.
Construction and home sales, which respond quickly to falling interest
rates, are usually one of the most reliable forward indicators. The trouble
is that if you blink you might miss this upturn. Housing starts in March
fell back after a sharp gain in February. They are 6 per cent above the
January trough but still 31 per cent lower than a year ago - when the market
was already weak. Building permits and sales of existing houses have edged
forward in recent months. Estate agents in some areas talk excitedly of more
custom. But the most the honest forecaster can claim is that the foundations
for a housing recovery are being laid.
Analysts scrutinise unemployment claims closely because they are one of the
few indicators published weekly. In the last week of March and the first
week of April, claims fell by 92,000 to 451,000, well below recent highs.
This fuelled speculation that April's employment report (to be released this
Friday) would be good. Alas, the most recent figures show claims rebounding
to the 500,000 mark that historically has signalled sharp recession. It is
thus too early to conclude that the labour market is poised for recovery.
The first quarter GNP figures were encouraging in one respect: the rate of
decline of consumption spending, two-thirds of economic activity, was slower
than in the fourth quarter of last year. On the other hand, export growth,
adjusted for inflation, has slowed to a standstill - a reflection of
recessionary tendencies in the rest of the world. And US business
investment, resilient last year, has begun to fall sharply. The recession is
thus changing its character rather than melting away.
Fed policy-makers, after much internal debate, nevertheless continue to
resist calls for a looser monetary policy. Somewhat eccentrically, some
regional presidents still harbour fears about a resurgence of inflation.
They believe the interest rate cuts of the winter should be given more time
to work their expansionary magic. A couple of sets of really bad employment
figures, however, would probably be enough to shake their resolve.
The July downturn ended an expansion phase lasting 92 months, the second
longest since records began in 1854. The Reagan boom's longevity was
exceeded only by the flower-power expansion of the 1960s. That, one hates to
remember, was followed by a particularly difficult decade. The main problem
then was to control inflation; the challenge today is to reduce borrowing
and rebuild savings. Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would have
been appalled by the scale of the budget and trade deficits run up by
Republican supply-siders of the 1980s.
Don't worry, the business cycle is not dead. This recession will bottom out,
probably by late summer. But it is difficult to see how the US economy can
avoid a prolonged period of sluggish growth, as debt-sodden consumers and
companies struggle to regain their fiscal balance. No wonder the US Treasury
is pleading for interest rate cuts in more responsible parts of the globe.

FT  29 APR 91 / Monday Interview: Navigating in turbulent waters - Karl Otto
Pohl, president of the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
High in the slab-like Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt, an
anguished-looking post-impressionist portrait hangs above the desk of Mr
Karl Otto Pohl, the president of Germany's central bank.
The lugubrious painting, by the pre-war artist Karl Hofer, could hardly be
in greater contrast to the bonhomie characteristically radiated by the man
who enjoys his reputation as Europe's most powerful central banker.
Yet, as the Bundesbank faces political and economic turbulence unmatched
since 1945, the painting gives a clue to the challenges on all sides.
The Bundesbank enjoys statutory independence from government. It has become
the model for the European central bank which would eventually be set as the
centrepiece of European monetary union (Emu). But perhaps the chief
complexity facing Mr Pohl is that his own autonomy - both vis-a-vis the
politicians in Bonn, and in the decision-making apparatus of the bank itself
 -is clearly circumscribed.
During the past year, the task of navigating between these limits has
occasionally defeated even Mr Pohl's tactical skills, honed during two
decades operating the levers of German monetary power, the past eleven and a
half as Bundesbank chief.
He heads the institution responsible for extending the D-Mark to east
Germany last year. But the unsentimental Mr Pohl never regarded German
unification as a great priority - and, in far more realistic tones than the
government, consistently warned last year of the severe economic and social
problems facing the east.
In an interview last week, the Bundesbank chief, bronzed after his Easter
skiing holiday in St Moritz, showed every sign of standing up to the
strains. Perhaps partly because he has two children aged 10 and 12, he looks
younger than his 61 years. Interestingly enough for a person whose
Cassandra-like forecasts over east Germany have been largely vindicated, Mr
Pohl believes that once the difficult transition is over, Germany will
quickly extend its position as Europe's most powerful economy.
With characteristic jauntiness, Mr Pohl displays one piece of evidence for
his settled frame of mind. He brings out a photograph of himself and Mr
Nicholas Brady guffawing at a joke during the US treasury secretary's visit
to the Bundesbank earlier this month. Mr Brady, whom Mr Pohl knows well from
the former banker's time at Dillon Read, came to Frankfurt partly to
complain about Germany's tight money policy. On the back of the photograph,
ready for presentation to Mr Brady as a memento, Mr Pohl has scrawled
sardonically: 'Serious men, serious times.'
Mr Pohl does not think much of the US administration's arguments, tailored
above all to easing the US recession rather than meeting inflationary
pressures in the still-buoyant west German economy. He believes that the
D-Mark is somewhat undervalued - and that, especially if other countries in
the European Monetary System continue to cut their interest rates, the
German currency will soon move up again.
'The trend at the moment on the foreign exchange market is going in the
wrong direction. The US, which is trying to come out of recession, does not
need a dollar revaluation. And Germany, which is still experiencing
over-heating demand in some quarters, requires a stronger D-Mark, not a
weaker one,' he says.
The German central bank chief made clear again at yesterday's gathering of
the Group of Seven industrial countries in Washington that there will be no
cut in D-Mark interest rates for the moment.
The calls from the US represent just one of the conundrums taxing Mr Pohl.
Pressure from European partners, with France in the vanguard, to accelerate
the move to Emu has forced the Bundesbank to campaign against a premature
dismantling of its monetary powers.
Meanwhile, the continuing slide of the east German economy has badly
unhinged German fiscal policy, requiring DM140bn in public sector transfers
this year, and has also been an important factor behind the D-Mark's recent
weakness. East German restructuring is 'an enormous problem', Mr Pohl says.
But especially now that the government has at last decided, somewhat late,
to raise taxes to fund transfers to the east, he leaves no doubt that the
task is manageable. 'The former East Germany was only a small country - less
than 10 per cent of West Germany's Gross National Product. The problem is
that these transfers should have been financed to a greater extent through
cuts in public spending in west Germany.'
Mr Pohl's headaches at home have been aggravated by a battle with the German
federal states (Lander) over streamlining the structure of the Bundesbank.
Mr Pohl wants to push this through in a reorganisation made necessary by
German unification. But he is at odds with a sizeable minority of the
central bank's 18-man policy-making council, on which Lander appointees have
most votes.
Mr Pohl's relationship with the rest of the board, a mix of 11
regionally-appointed state central bank presidents and seven Frankfurt-based
directorate members, makes for a fascinating case study in behavioural
psychology. With just one vote out of 18, Mr Pohl cheerfully concedes his
dependence on his colleagues. Strictly speaking, he says he cannot buy a
postage stamp without consulting them. But he regards many council members
with affectionate disdain. When in the limelight at international monetary
meetings, Mr Pohl plainly enjoys not having to think about them at all.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a professor and former state economics minister, now
president of the regional central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia, is the
newest of the 11 state bank chiefs on the council. He is also one of the
most independent-minded, leading what some Bundesbank officials call 'a
rebellion'.
Mr Jochimsen has irritated Mr Pohl by writing to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
oppose his plan to cut the number of state central banks to eight. Mr
Jochimsen admits of the increasingly acerbic dispute - which Mr Kohl will
now have to mediate - 'For the image of the Bundesbank and the central bank
council, this is not very helpful.' None the less, Mr Jochimsen is a enough
of a heavyweight to lecture Mr Pohl on constitutional niceties: 'Assessing
the direction of the structure of the federal government and the Lander is
not for a top Bundesbank functionary to decide.'
Mr Pohl's own relationship with Mr Kohl, always cool, took a turn for the
worse last month when the Bundesbank chief termed 'a disaster' the
consequences of last year's introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany.
Mr Pohl was not told about the chancellor's sudden decision in February 1990
to propose speedy currency union with east Germany. The Bundesbank's advice
to the government at least to consider the need for tax increases last year
went unheeded - differences which have left their mark, despite efforts from
both sides to smooth over the traces.
Two days after his unguarded comments on March 19 in Brussels, which sparked
anger in Bonn and depressed the D-Mark on the currency markets, Mr Pohl sent
a letter to Mr Kohl saying he regretted the uproar. Trying to assure the
hyper-sensitive chancellor that the Bundesbank was not attacking him, Mr
Pohl stuck to the contention that east Germany was indeed experiencing a
'disaster' - but said he should not perhaps have admitted it.
Mr Pohl says that his stewardship at the Bundesbank has taught him above all
that independence can bring unpopularity. However, recent pressure has, if
anything, probably strengthened his public image. 'Pohl is doing the right
thing,' says Mr Karl Schiller, the 80-year-old former Social Democrat
economics minister. Somewhat ominously for France, Mr Schiller warns that
'the greatest restructuring crisis of all times' in east Germany will
inevitably delay the day when the D-Mark is abandoned as part of the
establishment of a single European currency.
Mr Pohl himself said with some satisfaction last week that a compromise
Luxembourg plan to delay until 1996 the target date for setting up a
European central bank - two years later than the French government desires -
was 'a step in the right direction'.
Significantly, by 1996 Mr Pohl's second eight-year term at the Bundesbank
(it expires at the end of 1995), will have come to an end. A Bundesbank
president may one day have to transfer control over German money to a
European central bank. But his name is highly unlikely to be Karl Otto Pohl.
