FT  29 APR 91 / Justinian: Reform in an area of frailty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One in every 10 of the population of this country suffers from mental
ill-health during the course of a single year, more than half being severely
affected. The mentally-handicapped forms another identifiable, but much
smaller, group of adults which needs special care and treatment. Old people
 -a growing number in an ageing population - deteriorate in their mental
capacity and hence ability to manage their personal lives. In their various
ways, all three groups display degrees of mental incapacity which
increasingly call for public assistance in coping with their social
handicaps, through legal and extra-legal procedures.
Tomorrow, the Law Commission is publishing probably its most significant
consultation paper on Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision-making. It
is a weighty document that is bound to provoke a lively and inevitably
protracted debate. The issues are complex, both legally and socially, and
touch on fundamental problems of human beings in society. So much so,
indeed, that there is a worry that the legislator's pen could potentially
inflict a bureaucratic edifice that accompanies any new law in a way that
would depersonalise the human condition.
While there is at present a plethora of law governing the requirements of
treatment - much of it dotted around the statute book - there is a paucity
of rules which even touch on, let alone affect, other matters involving
medical treatment for non-therapeutic purposes, such as sterilisation,
abortion and cosmetic surgery. The absence of declared law was starkly
pointed out in a case which was tested all the way up to the House of Lords
two years ago. It involved the sterilisation of a severely
mentally-handicapped 35-year-old woman. The ultimate ruling of the law lords
that such a surgical operation on a woman mentally incapable of giving her
consent could lawfully be performed if it was necessary 'in the best
interests' of the patient was less than satisfactory. What constitutes the
best interests of a patient was left undefined. Moreover, what the judges
failed to do was to tell those responsible for the care and treatment of
their patients about what the process should be in deciding whether the
criteria for lawful intrusion of the individual's body were satisfied.
Reformers - and reform appears to be needed in this area of human frailty -
point to three basic principles that should govern any prospective
legislation. First, the autonomy of the individual must be paramount. People
should be enabled, so far as possible, and encouraged to take decisions for
themselves. This principle has its main impact on the vexed legal and
philosophical question of a person's consent to treatment. Does the
patient's agreement to take a specific treatment merely reflect his or her
ability or capacity to understand what is being proposed? Or does it involve
a real understanding of the nature, purpose and likely effects of the
treatment, based upon relevant information supplied to the patient by those
proposing to administer the treatment? There are many who would go further
by supporting the concept of informed and real consent; they assert that
true adherence to autonomy demands that the issue be viewed as a question of
a patient's capacity to refuse treatment. If consent or agreement to
treatment is the right approach, there is a further point that the process
of obtaining that consent should be not episodic, but continual. Consent
should never be a snapshot decision.
The second principle is that intervention should always be on grounds of
necessity and involve the least restrictive form of intrusive treatment.
Third, any decision-making for those mentally incapacitated must contain
proper safeguards against exploitation by practitioners or the patient's
family and relatives. Appropriate safeguards would primarily focus on the
need to ensure that the mentally-incapacitated person was present and
legally represented in the decision-making process. Vigorous testing of the
medical diagnosis and prescribed treatment would have to be an essential
feature of any procedural safeguards.
The one area of the law which caters tolerably well for mentally-disordered
or disabled people is in relation to property and finance as distinct from
personal care and treatment. The decision last week of Mr Justice Hoffmann,
distrib-uting the Pounds 1.6m estate of a 75-year-old mental patient
ad-judged incapable of making a will, demonstrated the scope of legal powers
to administer the property affairs of the mentally-incapacitated. The Court
of Protection exists to safeguard the interests of anyone who is found on
medical evidence to be 'incapable by reason of mental disorder of managing
and administering his property and affairs'. The court has been criticised
from time to time for its inaccessibility to all but the well-to-do, and
even then is regarded as paternalistic in its procedures. At present, it
handles 22,000 cases throughout the country by a small staff based in
London.
The extensive social impact in the framing or shaping of legal rules for
handling the affairs of the mentally- incapacitated is such that the Law
Commission has approached its mammoth task both tentatively and with
sensitivity, aware that, as present constituted, it lacks the requisite
expertise outside the law. Its embarking upon a study of such a distinct
socio-legal topic will raise once more the exclusive lawyerly composition of
the commission. Its consultation paper is peppered with proposals for
multi-disciplinary bodies to make decisions on behalf of
mentally-incapacitated adults. A multi-disciplinary approach by a body like
the Law Commission, dealing with many, if not most, issues of law in modern
society would seem likewise to be needed.

FT  29 APR 91 / Money Markets: Holding support
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S political risk was illustrated last week by its nervous decline
as financial markets looked to this week's UK local elections in England and
Wales for guidance on the timing of the next general election. Disappointing
economic news, including a widening of the March UK current account deficit,
also had an impact.
If this trend continues, the market will be obliged to take another look at
the assumed timetable for cuts in UK bank base rates. Wholesale rates point
towards further reductions, but the mood is not quite as confident as it
was.
Short sterling futures give a good guide. The price for June delivery
touched a high of 89.13 on March 15, indicating that the three-month
interbank rate was likely to be below 11 per cent by mid-June.
To calculate the expected level, subtract 89.13 from 100.00. This gives an
answer of 10.87, or about 10 7/8 per cent for the three-month offered rate
in the cash market at delivery. This is not an exact prediction, because of
technical costs involved in running a futures contract, but it indicates
roughly where the market thinks it is moving.
The high point was touched a few day's before the Budget, on March 19, but a
week later the mood of euphoria had changed. June short sterling fell to
88.57 on March 26, suggesting a cash rate of about 11 1/2 per cent at
delivery.
The price of 88.57 is now an important level, with dealers noting that there
is then little in the way of further technical support until 88.35. A low of
88.55 was touched last Wednesday, but support was not decisively broken and
by Friday the contract had rallied to 88.62 at the close.
Whether this continues to hold is likely to depend on the result of the
local elections, and on sterling's performance in the ERM, nowadays two not
unrelated factors.

FT  29 APR 91 / Syndicated Loans: Banks consolidate position of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYNDICATED lenders have found themselves elevated from a position of
subservience to one of power in the last 18 months.
There are two main explanations for the banks' current caution when it comes
to lending: the Bank for International Settlements' requirements for capital
adequacy ratios, and fears that some borrowers may not survive the
recession.
As a result, pricings have increased and, in some cases, banks have been
able to negotiate tighter covenants. They are also keen to monitor a
borrower's accounts more frequently.
In the past 18 months, the price of corporate credit has doubled or in some
cases trebled in terms of interest margins, commitment fees and front-end
fees.
Bankers like to boast that they now have more clout when it comes to
requesting tighter financial ratios and more detailed covenants. For
example, Barclays, Manufacturers Hanover and S-E Banken recently arranged a
three-year Dollars 250m term loan for VME, the construction machinery group
jointly owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US.
The covenant stipulated interest cover (profit divided by total interest
charged) of 1.75 times for the first year and 2 times thereafter.
According to one banker involved in the deal, had VME chosen to do such a
deal a year ago, the interest cover requested probably would have been 1.5
times and 1.75 times respectively. The banker says that, in general,
interest cover requested now is usually in the range of 2-2.5 times.
Another banker points out that gearing (the debt-to-equity ratio) is also
scrutinised more closely. Whereas a year ago, gearing ratios of up to 150
per cent were acceptable, bankers prefer gearing of 100 to 125 per cent
today.
Finally, where once the yearly audited accounts were considered adequate,
bankers now want to see half-yearly or even quarterly management accounts to
check the company is meeting the financial ratio requirements.
Not surprisingly, companies tend to resist the banks' requests for financial
covenants - to which the banks' reply is simply 'no covenants, no quality
banks' - unless the borrower is prepared to accept a higher pricing.
A handful of syndicated loans came to the market last week. Deutsche Bank is
arranging a DM150m five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility for
Varde Bank, Denmark's fifth largest commercial bank.
The interest margin is 30 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate (Libor), with a commitment fee of 15 basis points and a participation
fee of 15 basis points for amounts of DM15m. The pricing is regarded as
rather aggressive: one bank which arranged a similar financing for Varde
Bank in recent years suggested that an interest margin of 40 basis points
might be required to attract lenders.
While syndication for Inntrepreneur, the holding company in a
pubs-for-breweries swap between Grand Metropolitan and Elders IXL, has
finally closed, there is a new Pounds 160m two-year financing in the market
for Inntrepreneur Estates (CH) plc, arranged by Citicorp, Barclays, SG
Warburg and National Westminster.
This is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inntrepreneur Estates Limited, which is
jointly owned by GrandMet and Fosters Brewing Group. The interest margin is
1 percentage point over Libor and there are participation fees of 30 basis
points on Pounds 20m, 20 basis points on Pounds 10m and 10 basis points on
Pounds 5m.

FT  29 APR 91 / International Bonds: Japanese equity warrants begin cautious
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE MARKET for Japanese equity warrants
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
long-dated options to buy shares - bounced back in April, when 23 new issues
of equity warrant bonds were launched.
The recovery of the market is the latest in a series of resurrections over
the past year or so. But potential supply in the sector still outstrips
demand, so the market is being carefully monitored in an effort to ward off
another collapse.
At the end of last year, about 80 per cent of warrants were out of the money
 -that is, the exercise price of the warrant was lower than the share price,
so they were not worth converting. Now, according to Robert Fleming, 114
actively-traded dollar warrants are in the money and 282 are out, following
the recovery of the Japanese stock market.
Although new issue volume has picked up steadily, demand for paper is not
even close to the peaks of 1989.
Equity warrants follow underlying stock prices, but their movements are
exaggerated because they are highly-geared instruments.
Consequently, they are most useful - and most dangerous - in volatile
markets. The current trading range of the Japanese stock market between
26,000 and 27,000 has put a damper on the secondary market. 'In a flat
market, it is impossible for investors to make the 1 1/2 points bid/offer
spread to break even,' one analyst pointed out.
Japan's Golden Week holiday this week is further stifling activity.
Meanwhile, the pattern of the new issues market is changing. Seven of this
months' new issues were denominated in a currency other than dollars, the
usual sector for equity warrants.
There are signs that warrants in European currencies will form an
increasingly important portion of the market. D-Mark and Swiss franc issues
made up less than 9 per cent of the market at the end of 1990, but accounted
for more than 15 per cent by the end of the first quarter of 1991.
Historically, the D-Mark sector has been the domain of smaller, lesser-known
companies. Japanese investors have not bought such paper because these small
issues were rather illiquid, but larger companies have started to enter the
market, enticed by better swap opportunities and the chance to tap a fresh
investor base.
According to Robert Fleming research, the all-in yen cost of borrowing is
now marginally cheaper in D-Marks than in dollars, at 3.5 per cent versus
3.6 per cent for a four-year issue of 4 per cent bonds with warrants. There
have also been suggestions that large issuers have stayed away from the
dollar sector because of embarrassment that their existing warrants in the
sector were substantially out of the money.
The appearance of larger deals, such as a DM400m issue for Daiwa earlier
this month, has encouraged Japanese investors to become more active in the
D-Mark sector. However, they are still not buyers of Swiss franc equity
warrants, because that market, dominated by the domestic investor, is still
quite illiquid.
Meanwhile, marketmakers in dollar warrants based in London, which provides
much of the market's liquidity, are starting to make markets in D-Mark
warrants as well.
More importantly, it is expected that D-Mark warrants will soon be traded on
the broker-broker market in Japan, which would encourage greater
participation by Japanese investors. Issues of more than DM200m are expected
to be traded.
The growth of the Ecu bond market this year has increased the prospect of
Ecu-denominated warrants. But the relatively high cost of funds for
borrowers remains a barrier. The Ecu/yen swap market is less liquid than
either the D-Mark/yen market, as well as the dollar/yen market.
Further, the Swiss franc and D-Mark sectors were supported at the outset by
domestic buying, while there is no obvious investor base for Ecu warrants.
The lack of a domestic investor base may also slow development of a market
in French franc equity warrants. The first such deal, a FFr1bn offering for
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, was launched at the beginning of April, and
opened at a three-point premium to its par issue price.
Japanese securities houses are keen to nurture demand for their lucrative
equity warrant business. The Y50bn equivalent limit on the size of new
issues has been in force for a year and is likely to remain.
However, the market may face a further threat in the form of supply from
another source. The Japanese equity market, which has been closed to new
issues for a year, may reopen in June or July. The reopening of this market
'may take some of the money out of the equity warrant market,' said one
Japanese banker.

FT  29 APR 91 / US Money and Credit: Bonds mark time as slide continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN A little; up a little. Up a little; down a little. Investors' attempts
to read the economic runes continued unabated last week but, by the end of
the five trading sessions, the US bond market had gone precisely nowhere.
On Friday evening, for example, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was
yielding 8.21 per cent. That was only slightly different from the 8.24 per
cent return offered by the same stock a week earlier.
Such lack of progress is scarcely a surprise. The market decided a fortnight
ago that the authorities were unlikely to make any further moves on interest
rates until the Federal Reserve's policy-forming Open Market Committee met
again next month, and little has happened since to shake this conviction.
True, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, testified before the Senate
Banking Committee on Tuesday - but his remarks were opaque at best.
Mr Greenspan's general thrust was that the economic slide was continuing,
but at a slower rate, and the central bank needed to move cautiously before
trying to hasten the recovery with further interest rate cuts.
Those comments also coincided with the March statistics on new orders for
manufactured durable goods. At first sight, these figures might have been
read as a positive signal for the bond market.
The 6.2 per cent decline overall was considerably worse than pundits had
feared, and bond prices usually rise on negative - and, therefore,
anti-inflationary - economic news.
However, in this case, closer inspection seemed to suggest that a good part
of the decline was centred on aircraft and military hardware.
That fact, coupled with Mr Greenspan's caution and prospective Treasury
auctions later in the week, limited the market's response. The long bond,
for instance, gained less than half a point on Tuesday, with its yield
sliding from 8.29 to 8.26 per cent.
Indeed, in terms of hard data, there has been no unequivocal evidence on the
economy all week. Aside from the durable goods orders, traders confronted
grim news from the car companies on recent sales, and a significant increase
in the weekly claims for unemployment insurance. On Friday, however, the
inflation fears returned when the GNP implicit price deflator showed an
abnormally large jump for the first quarter of 1991.
This statistic is designed to measure domestically-generated inflation only.
In part, the steep quarterly increase was seen as a function of a sharp fall
in oil import prices in the first three months of the year, although the
extent to which blame could be apportioned here was a matter of debate. That
said, however, the figure still gave rise to unease - or at least provided a
reason for traders to lighten their holdings at the end of the trading week.
Their concerns, moreover, were scarcely allayed when Federal Reserve Board
governor, Mr David Mullins, suggested that the authorities needed to see
more price data before 'we declare major victory over inflation and say
we've made major progress'.
In fact, as good a sense as any of where the economy stands can probably be
derived from the flood of company earnings announcements. For the past
fortnight, a large chunk of corporate America has been unveiling its
first-quarter earnings, and it is clear that any economic upturn is
tentative at best.
Significant sectors - such as the steel industry - are still highly
pessimistic about the rest of the year, and even some apparently healthy
segments, such as food manufacturing, concede that their relative buoyancy
stems largely from overseas operations.
As for the week ahead, most attention will focus on the April employment
report, due out on Friday. Analysts are predicting that the national
unemployment rate will rise to between 6.9 per cent and 7.1 per cent.
If correct, that would represent a gain of 0.1 to 0.3 of a percentage point
on the March figure, and could entail a contraction of perhaps as much as
275,000 in non-farm payrolls.
Everyone concedes that the unemployment trends lag behind any incipient
recovery in the economy, but figures of this magnitude would at least
indicate some stabilisation. Anything beyond these parameters would be
grounds for some excitement.
A broker's circular referred to last week should have been attributed to SG
Warburg and not James Capel.

FT  29 APR 91 / ECU Bonds: Offshore freedoms bring responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the first quarter of the year the Ecu international bond sector
completed its transformation from a niche area into a flourishing offshore
government bond market.
However, offshore freedom also brings responsibilities, a point made last
week by the European Commission. The Commission is concerned that
unregulated supply of Ecu bond issues by governments could lead to a glut of
paper on the market.
The Ecu8.75bn of bonds launched in the first two weeks of February had a
debilitating effect. Spain's Ecu1bn issue last week was the first
substantial deal in the sector in nearly two months.
The Commission itself was the last big borrower to tap the market, raising
Ecu1bn to finance a loan to Greece. The Commission's concern may partly stem
from the fact that its two Ecu500m deals launched on February 26 were poorly
received in a market awash with unplaced paper.
However, as any watcher of the gilts market will testify, the threat of
oversupply is not a unique problem. Despite its sometimes unruly nature, the
Ecu bond market has turned in a creditable performance over the past year.
At the end of 1989, 10-year Ecu bonds offered a yield spread of 180 basis
points over comparable German government bonds. By the end of 1990, the
yield spread had fallen to 126 basis points and had narrowed to about 70
basis points.
Indeed, the price performance of Ecu bonds has confounded theoretical models
which calculate the 'correct' price of Ecu bonds from the performance of the
underlying national bond markets.
At the start of this year benchmark 10-year Ecu bonds, such as the French
government's 10 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT maturing 2001, were yielding 40
basis points less than theories suggested, moving to more than 70 basis
points by mid-February.
But since then Ecu bonds have generally underperformed the underlying
national bond markets - in part due to the volume of new issues. Future
advances may depend on the pace of progress towards European monetary union.
For example, if German proposals for a 'hardened' single European currency
were accepted, the basket Ecu would no longer be vulnerable to devaluation
against the strongest currency in the exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark.
'As a result, yields on Ecu bonds would collapse to about the level of the
lowest running yield in the system, which is currently that on bunds, rather
than moving in line with a weighted average of European bond yields,' said
Mr Gavyn Davies and Mr Jeremy Hale of Goldman Sachs in a recent research
paper. 'In other words, the spread between Ecu bonds and bunds would be
entirely eliminated.'

FT  29 APR 91 / UK Gilts: Bank's auction allays fears of flood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FACTORS have emerged to dominate the gilts market. The pound has become
collateral damage in the war between the dollar and the D-Mark; and it
appears that public spending is running out of control again when the
government is already committed to raising up to Pounds 1bn a month through
gilts.
All this took place last week against the building suspense about exchange
and interest rates at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington; the sudden
angry eruptions about the 'somewhat home-grown' recession by MPs of all
persuasions and right-wing industrialists and company directors; and a
highly-successful auction - four-and-a-half times subscribed - of Pounds
1.2bn of the 10 per cent Conversion stock due in 1996.
These singularly busy conditions set the tone for a week in which,
surprisingly, the market rose right across the yield curve until late on
Friday.
Then - much in the same way as a big Middle East sell order drove down the
pound the day before - a large domestic sale took a point off prices of
long-dated gilts.
The earlier springiness owed much to the outright success of the Bank of
England's auction, which defied doomsters' predictions that an
over-abundance of new gilts would flood the market and depress prices.
Instead it proved, to the authorities' relief, that there remained an
unsatisfied demand for gilts of up to Pounds 3.5bn after the auction. This
suggested that the funding programme for the predicted Pounds 8bn public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1991-92 might go more smoothly than
officials have dared to hope.
Although the auction eased technical concerns about the funding programme
and investors' appetite for gilts, other anxieties started to build.
Sterling's weakness has kept the short end of the market on hold. Although
talk of a sterling crisis was overdone last week, the pound started looking
vulnerable to the dollar and even had sand kicked in its face by the D-Mark,
the weakling of the foreign exchanges.
This has retarded hopes of interest rate cuts. Sterling last week slipped
briefly to the bottom of its grid in the European exchange rate mechanism,
perhaps causing a few grey hairs at the Bank of England.
The authorities have announced a pause in their efforts to bring down rates
to give the pound the space to settle after the cuts from 14 to 12 per cent.
This rules out more cuts for now, as sterling is not looking strong enough.
Diminishing prospects of cuts does, however, help the longer end. Mr Nigel
Richardson, of Warburg Securities, says: 'The longer base rates are kept up,
the better the long end does, as the recession gets deeper and the prospects
for lower underlying inflation improve.'
Then there are the public spending worries, which are just as bad for
sterling and gilts - and never absent for very long from the market.
As soon as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced the PSBR forecast for
this year, analysts started deriding it as too low. Even before the most
recent shenanigans over the financing of local government, the chancellor's
funding arithmetic was reckoned to be on the optimistic side.
Sterling bond analysts expect higher spending on unemployment - likely to
top 2.3m this year - and other recession-induced outlays to enlarge the
PSBR.
The Treasury last week said the Pounds 3.5bn reserve would be drawn down by
Pounds 640m to finance higher pay for the armed forces, health service
employees, employment training schemes and child benefit. But its public
spending forecast of Pounds 205bn remained intact.
The actual PSBR outcome remains the subject of speculation. But today's
research paper by Mr Simon Briscoe, of Greenwell Montagu, says there will be
high levels of local authority borrowing for the next three years as the
government attempts to minimise individual tax burdens while the authorities
raise spending.
Although this could make the PSBR balloon, last week's auction suggests it
might not shock the gilts market, which appears to be ready for more stock.
The tap stock of 9 per cent due in 2008, priced two points higher than the
market, could be snapped up quickly.

SKANSKA, the largest construction and property company in Scandinavia,
turned in 1990 profits before extraordinary income up 16 per cent to
SKr2.37bn (Dollars 380m), in line with forecasts, writes John Burton in
Stockholm.
However, the Swedish group predicted that profits in 1991 would drop back to
the 1989 result of SKr2bn, reflecting a slowdown in the Nordic construction
market.
It proposed that the dividend be increased by SKr1 to SKr6.25 per share.
There would also be a stock dividend, in which shareholders would receive a
bonus issue of one new share for each old share.
Sales increased by 25 per cent to SKr37.2bn, with sales outside Sweden
accounting for SKr4.2bn. The order backlog at the end of 1990 totalled
SKr31bn, up 7 per cent.
Although Skanska reported a 98 per cent occupancy rate for its properties in
Sweden, it noted difficulties in leasing some US properties, as well as its
Oslo City complex which it acquired in February.
Only 20 per cent of the Trinity Tower project in London, which will be
completed this spring, has been leased or sold.

recession and the Gulf war, is asking Boeing to cancel orders on three
747-400s for first delivery in 1993 and is expected to seek cancellation of
orders for six 767-300s and options on another 12. Air Canada has been
losing money for several successive quarters and has to cut back on its

CDollars 500m

<TEXT>
NORANDA, Canada's biggest resource group, is selling assets worth nearly
CDollars 500m to keep its consolidated long-term debts of CDollars 4.4bn
(USDollars 3.8bn) under control, says chairman Mr Alfred Powis.
Some sales have been negotiated, including disposal of Noranda's wire and
cable subsidiary, with a book value of CDollars 220m, to Alcatel Cable, he
said after the annual meeting in Toronto.
He would not reveal the price being paid by Alcatel, but said it would be
above book value.
The total also includes about Dollars 100m of natural gas properties; half
Noranda's holding in Cognos; a successful software company; and a 34 per
cent interest in a western oil and gas exploration holding, with some
smaller holdings.
'We don't need to sell anything else,' Mr Powis said.
Noranda made a profit of CDollars 15m on sales of Dollars 2.13bn in the
first quarter. Nothing was attributable to the common stock after payment of
preferred dividends. A year earlier it turned in profit of Dollars 59m on
sales of Dollars 2.4bn.
The decline was due to a slump in the forest products subsidiaries and a
strike at Noranda's zinc mining operations in New Brunswick.
Royal Trustco, one of Canada's two biggest trust companies, returned to
profit in the first quarter with earnings of CDollars 39m, or 15 cents a
share, against CDollars 72m, or 40 cents, a year earlier.
In the final quarter of 1990, it posted a loss of CDollars 251m, or CDollars
2.17 a share, following write-downs on its European operations and portfolio
investments.
Royal Trustco is the main financial services arm of the Toronto-based
Brascan group. It said 1991 would be difficult, with a high level of
non-performing loans, which totalled CDollars 180m at March 31.
The Federal government has moved to wind up Standard Trustco and sell its
trust assets. The Canada Deposit Insurance Corp will then pay out CDollars
1.5bn owed to more than 100,000 depositors.
A hearing into the winding-up application is due tomorrow in Ontario Supreme
Court.
The Federal government seized the trust company's assets on 18 April and
closed all 37 branches.

<TEXT>
AG-AMEV, the financial services group formed last year from the merger of
Belgium's largest and the Netherlands' third biggest insurers, unveiled a 4
per cent rise in net profit for 1990.
This was measured against a pro-forma consolidated income statement prepared
for 1989. The two companies finalised their link-up in December, to be
retroactive to the beginning of 1990. Groupe AG and NV Amev each hold a 50
per cent share in the group.
To celebrate what it claims is the first full European Community merger in
financial services, the group has drawn up its balance sheet in European
currency units (Ecu).
It earned Ecu393m (Dollars 464m) last year on turnover of Ecu6.3bn, against
profits of Ecu373m from Ecu6.2bn in 1989. The advance looks slightly better
in Ecus than in Belgian francs, in which it would have been only 2 per cent.
Dividends, paid out separately - and in national currencies - were raised
from BFr150 to BFr165 by AG and from Fl 2.65 to F l2.85 by Amev.
The group's co-chairman, Mr Maurice Lippens from AG, pointed out that, but
for the weakness of the dollar, earnings would have risen by 5 per cent.
Results from the group's US operations - largely AMEV-provided - had,
however, shown a high return on turnover, and there had been a significant
advance in the Spanish car insurance market.
A black spot was the cost of last year's storm damage in western Europe,
which cost the group Ecu20m in Belgium alone.
While consolidating its position in its core markets in Belgium and the
Netherlands, AG-AMEV wants to reinforce its presence in Spain and the UK,
and seek out new niches in the US.
Mr Lippens said that given the group's strong financial position he 'could
envisage important acquisitions'.
AG is closely allied with Belgium's leading bank, Generale de Banque, as
part of its 14 per cent holding in Societe Generale de Belgique, the
country's leading holding company. AMEV in 1989 merged with VSB, the largest
Dutch savings bank.

<TEXT>
MITSUKOSHI, the Japanese department store operator, yesterday reported a
12.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y19.33bn in the year to the end
of February. The company said demand for imported paintings and other luxury
goods boosted sales.
This year, however, the group expects profit growth to increase only
marginally.
Total sales rose 10 per cent to Y866.7bn (Dollars 6.24bn), with an 8 per
cent increase in clothing sales, a 15.3 per cent increase in those of
household articles and a 17.9 per cent rise in sales of sundry goods.
Japan's department store sales rose sharply early last year, but growth has
been slower in recent months. Consumer confidence was affected by the Gulf
crisis and by more general concerns about the slowing of Japanese economic
growth.
Mitsukoshi expects pre-tax profit this year to rise only to Y19.4bn on sales
of Y936bn.
Japanese department stores fear that consumer spending could slow if
interest rates remain high and that purchasing power will be lessened by the
relatively low wage increases won at the annual spring bargaining sessions.
The Brazilian government has raised the share of steel group Usiminas held
by Japanese group Nippon Usiminas from 4.65 to 12.88 per cent in preparation
for the group's privatisation.

STEFANEL, the Italian clothing manufacturer, raised group net profits by
33.7 per cent to L36.1bn (Dollars 27.9m), thanks to a 41 per cent jump in
sales to L434.2bn from L308bn in 1989.
The rise, which follows difficult years for Italy's second biggest casual
clothing group after its flotation in October 1987, has prompted a L10
increase in the dividend to L140 a share.
However, the rises in both net earnings and the dividend remain below
company predictions in November, when it said net profits would reach about
L38bn for 1990, while the dividend would be L150.
In volume terms, sales last year rose to 12.8m items from 9.3m in 1989, with
foreign markets playing an increasingly important role.
Stefanel has been particularly active in increasing its presence in eastern
Europe, where it is represented in Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
It has also raised its profile in the Far East. This year, its Hong
Kong-based subsidiary expects to have 100 units operating in the region, 60
of them in Japan.
According to Mr Giuseppe Stefanel, chairman and managing director, sales
this year should rise to L480bn, and net group profits to L44bn.

<TEXT>
DOFASCO, Canada's largest steelmaker, made a small profit in the first
quarter, but its competitor, Stelco, continues in a precarious cash position
with mounting losses, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Both companies have been badly hit by the recession and high steel imports
from the US, and see little chance of a turnround in 1991.
In addition, Stelco is struggling to recover from the impact of a long
strike last year.
Dofasco, with a large sheet business, recorded first-quarter earnings of
CDollars 11.2m (USDollars 9.6m), or 7 cents a share, up 12 per cent from a
year earlier on sales down 12.5 per cent at almost CDollars 500m.
Stelco lost CDollars 52m, or CDollars 1.56 a share, against a loss of
CDollars 13m, or 48 cents, while sales dropped 42 per cent to CDollars 370m.
The company is trying to negotiate higher bank credit lines.
Stelco has stopped paying common and preferred dividends and Dofasco has cut
its quarterly rate from 32 cents to 20 cents a share. It wrote off its
CDollars 713m investment in Algoma Steel at the end of 1990.

DYNO INDUSTRIER, the Norwegian chemicals and explosives group, saw
first-quarter profits, before year-end adjustments, more than halved to
NKr46m (Dollars 6.7m) from NKr94m a year earlier.
Dyno said the main causes of the weak result were lower profits from stock
market trading and increased development costs for one of its
high-technology businesses. The Gulf war and US recession also had an impact
on the result, it added.
Group turnover increased to NKr1.84bn from NKr1.64bn, while operating
expenses, before depreciation, rose to NKr1.64bn from NKr1.44bn.
The explosives division saw operating profit fall to NKr56m from NKr65m.
Dyno warned that its Australian company, which was being restructured, was
still operating at a loss, although less than that of last year.
The chemicals division suffered a fall in operating profit to NKr35m from
NKr50m on turnover up to NKr534m from NKr448m, mainly because of
acquisitions. The plastics division saw no change in operating profit of
NKr25m, but turnover rose to NKr434m from NKr335m, also because of
acquisitions.
Dyno forecast an increase in demand and falling prices for most raw
materials in 1991.

FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: A bout of indigestion in the construction
sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP drop in the share prices of Alfred McAlpine and YJ Lovell at the
end of last week indicates that rights issue fatigue may finally have caught
up with the construction sector.
Lovell's share price tumbled by 18.5 per cent to 145p on Thursday after the
group announced a two-for-five cash call to raise Pounds 30m. The shares
closed at 143p on Friday.
McAlpine, equally, got short shrift from the market on Friday. Its share
price fell by almost a tenth to 258p after the group announced a one-for-two
rights issue to raise Pounds 38.8m.
Both groups are currently trading below their theoretical ex-rights price.
The fall in Lovell's share price will have been exacerbated by a warning
from the group that it will have to make substantial extra provision against
some of its developments.
Institutional investors, however, have every right to be suffering from
indigestion given the large amounts of paper which construction, building
materials and property groups have sought to issue this year.
Since the beginning of January these companies have announced 16 separate
rights issues worth more than Pounds 1bn. They account for a third of the
Pounds 3bn all types of companies have attempted to raise from rights issues
this year.
Construction companies, most of them heavily involved in housebuilding and
property development, have justified their fund-raising by saying they need
the cash to prepare for the next upturn - particularly in the housing market
which is expected to lead the sector out of recession.
The weakness in the commercial and residential property markets, they say,
will allow them to take advantage of distressed sales and pick up some
bargains.
These seem more likely to arise in the commercial, rather than the housing,
market where there has been a surprising shortage of cheap quality land
coming onto the market in spite of the recession.
Nonetheless, many builders need to replenish their housing landbanks as
sales have started to pick up.
Mr Graeme Odgers, McAlpine's chief executive, says: 'There may be no
outright bargains about but housing land is still cheaper than it was two
years ago.'
Another reason for a rights issue is to reduce the large debts builders
raised when the residential and commercial property markets were at their
height. Alfred McAlpine fits into this category with average borrowings of
Pounds 80m - equivalent to more than 60 per cent of net assets at the end of
October last year.
The classic property play at the bottom of the investment cycle, when prices
are at their lowest, is to raise debt rather than equity to finance new
purchases - as any home owner with a mortgage knows.
It is arguable that less highly-geared companies such as Taylor Woodrow,
which last week announced a one-for-four rights issue to raise Pounds
162.4m, should have increased borrowings rather than turned to their
shareholders for finance.
Mr Peter Drew, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, responds that he would rather
have equity than raise debt at current rates of interest.
The big share price rises enjoyed by construction companies earlier this
year has allowed them to take advantage of the market to hold a rights
issue.
The problem of McAlpine and YJ Lovell is that they have come at the end of
the queue at a time when the market is questioning how quickly a recovery in
house sales will show through in improved profits.

FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tace to buy out minority in Goring arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TACE, the environmental control equipment group where a revolt by
institutions removed founder chairman Mr Jock Mackenzie, is proposing to buy
out the minority holding in its Goring Kerr subsidiary.
The offer is expected to be roughly six Tace shares for every five held by
the owners of the outstanding 49 per cent in Kerr.
This assumes that the relationship between the two share prices is similar
to Friday's close of 147p for Tace and 176p for Goring Kerr.
Mr David Wilson, Tace's finance director, said it was intended that the
holders of Kerr shares would be no worse off. The proposals would also take
account of Kerr's slightly higher dividend yield.
The benefits of bringing the two together included overhead cuts, the full
use of tax allowances which would have saved Pounds 800,000 last year, the
removal of obstacles to fund raising and a better use of group cash.
Mr Wilson said he hoped the reconstruction would not be held up by the
'shennanigans' of Norwich Union, which has a 5 per cent stake. He said the
UK mutual insurance group was the main backer of Mr Michael Beckett's
candidacy for the chairmanship. Mr Beckett resigned on Wednesday from the
board, which had preferred Sir David Nicholson.
The board had hoped that the institutions would have been placated by the
departure of Mr Mackenzie, who with his family still has a 23 per cent
stake, and the cutting of central costs.

FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 31m provisions leave Clayform Pounds
39m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAYFORM PROPERTIES, the property developer, saw a sharp reversal in its
fortunes last year as the fall in property values necessitated heavy
exceptional provisions against the group's development portfolio.
A pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.03m in 1989 turned into a loss of Pounds
39.14m in the year to December 31, largely as a result of Pounds 31.56m in
provisions stemming from a reappraisal of the group's development portfolio.
The reappraisal resulted in a substantial write-down of the group's
developments in Bristol, Cannon Street and Sheffield.
Turnover was up to Pounds 83.90m (Pounds 82.42m). The loss per share was
101.0p (earnings 36.7p) and net assets per share were halved to 201p (410p).
No final dividend is recommended (6.5p) bringing the total for the year to
2p (10p).
'This country has been experiencing the worst property recession in my
experience,' commented Mr Bryan Burletson, chairman. Although the market now
appears to have hit bottom, 'I don't see any early rise,' he said.
The group's borrowings, which shot up when Stead &amp; Simpson was acquired for
Pounds 120m in 1989, have been reduced from a year-end figure of Pounds 125m
to Pounds 85m, chiefly through disposals, which, since January last year and
through to after the year end, amounted to Pounds 30m.
A sharp fall in net assets, from Pounds 150.69m to Pounds 75.83m, however,
means gearing was at 112 per cent.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels returned profits of Pounds 145m pre-tax for the
1989-90 year, an improvement of 17 per cent over the previous year's Pounds
124m. Turnover pushed ahead by 14 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn.
Mr Christopher Harding, chairman, said the publication of the company's
results had been delayed by the continuing negotiations with its two main UK
customers, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, over new fixed price
contracts for fuel services.
These discussions had been held up by the government's decision to keep the

FOLKES GROUP, the property, engineering and building products group, lifted
pre-tax profits by 12 per cent from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 4.03m in 1990.
The result was achieved on lower turnover of Pounds 47.71m against Pounds
58.51m.
Mr Constantine Folkes, chairman, said the group had changed more
significantly during the year than at any time in its history, enhancing its
profit potential and its position in both open die forging and property.
The balance sheet remained strong.
Earnings improved to 7.49p (6.77p) and the recommended final dividend of
1.75p makes a total of 2.3p (2.05p).

FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: MGN flotation price set at 125p per share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Mr Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers will cost 125p each
when the company is floated later next month. The yield, howver, has yet to
be finalised.
The flotation price will be revealed officially tomorrow morning and the
minimum outlay will be about Pounds 250, a level set to encourage the small
investor.
The yield is likely to be between 6.5 and 6.7 per cent, compared with a
market average of 4.8 per cent, and 8.4 per cent for shares in Maxwell
Communication Corporation - also controlled by Mr Maxwell.
Flotation advisers say the mixed views in the investment community on Mr
Maxwell's management style mean they must set a higher yield, to the tune of
about half a percentage point, than might otherwise be expected. At the same
time they argue that without Mr Maxwell the company would be making less
money and thus command a lower total price.
The prospectus will be distributed to institutions on May 2. It will argue
that Mirror Group is both defensive, because two-thirds of its income comes
from circulation rather than more volatile advertising revenue, and
well-placed to take advantage of the recovery from recession as advertising
picks up.
Both Mr Maxwell and his advisers want the shares to show a significant
premium when dealings start on May 21, and the yield will be set to try to
ensure this.
Morale in the flotation team has been helped by research conducted on Friday
and Saturday among readers of Mirror Group Newspapers by AGB, a market
research company owned by MCC. Details of AGB's findings were not made
available yesterday.
In addition, the securities house in charge of the US side of the operation,
Salomon Brothers, has asked for an increase in its one-third allocation of
stock. The proportion it receives is likely to rise to 35 per cent.
About a third of the shares has been earmarked for the UK private investor,
with UK institutions getting another third and the remainder going overseas.
Before the official announcement of the flotation price Midland Montagu, the
merchant banker, and broker Smith New Court intend to put in place the
underwriters of the issue.
The prospectus will also be available from some branches of Lloyds Bank and
the Bank of Scotland and be advertised on Friday in some UK newspapers.
The sale of 48 per cent of Mirror Group is intended to raise Pounds
240-Pounds 270m. Most of the money will go towards reorganising Mirror
Group's debts.

FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: An insatiable demand for new
paper - The recent spate of cash calls on shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPATE of rights issues in the UK equity market since the start of March
seems to show no sign of abating. So far this year Pounds 3bn has been
raised, but despite the cash calls the FT-SE 100 index has risen by more
than 15 per cent.
With the stock market having already reached some equity strategists'
forecasts for the end of the year, the continued demand from companies for
new equity might be expected to put a damper on share prices.
However, the amount of cash raised through rights issues is not surprising -
although it is already nearing the Pounds 4bn raised in 1990 and exceeds the
Pounds 3bn total for 1989.
At the start of the year, for example, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker,
was expecting Pounds 6bn to be asked for during the year. County NatWest was
predicting that issues would total Pounds 20bn over 1991 and 1992. So Pounds
3bn in four months is a not an unexpected amount.
On the other hand, Nomura, the securities house, suggests the market had
also been looking for some big takeover bids to put some of the cash back
into the stock market.
So far nothing sizeable has been seen, and if some big bids do not appear
soon the market could become nervous.
Nonetheless, the supply/demand balance does not seem to be a problem.
Institutional liquidity, which was unusually high at the end of last year,
has fallen to a more normal level and no lower. Investors are not short of
cash to invest in rights issues - or in government sales of gilts and its BT
shares - if they think there is a case for putting money into the market at
all.
Since companies are making rights issues to take advantage of the high level
of the market, should the market fall or the take-up of shares by investors
slacken, the number of issues ought to dry up.
Equity strategists do not expect the rights issues to trigger a fall in the
market, although there have been famous occasions when one big issue coming
on top of a stream of lesser calls has cracked the market - such as Hanson's
Pounds 519m rights in June 1985 and National Westminster Bank's Pounds 714m
call in May 1986. So long as the issues are from companies which investors
regard as worthy, and issuers do not get greedy on price, there appears to
be demand for new paper.
It is the institutions' propensity to invest rather than the weight of cash
calls that could cause problems for the stock market.
If investors began to worry about fundamental concerns such as the economic
recovery, interest rates and inflation, sterling and the trade balance, and
the looming general election, then they could resist future rights issues.

FT  29 APR 91 / Revival of flexible work plan runs risk of Tube strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON UNDERGROUND is to revive an attempt to introduce more flexible
working practices which it modified two years ago because of a one-day
strike campaign. The move is expected later this year in spite of a current
dispute over job cuts.
London Underground proposals include allowing its 22,000 station staff to
sell tickets as well as supervising platforms, and would include a new
multi-skilled senior grade of station employee.
The corporation wants to have the flexibility when rostered staff are absent
for employees who operate as 'relief' workers to substitute for all grades
of platform staff rather than only for their own grade.
The plans are being considered amid a dispute over the corporation's attempt
to cut 1,005 jobs because of financial difficulties.
The RMT rail union is expected to announce today that members have voted for
industrial action. Members of the TSSA white collar union have already voted
for strikes by a 575 to 289 majority.
London Underground has already drawn up plans to suspend any workers who
take part in industrial action over the job cuts.
Mr Roger Straker, London Underground personnel director, said it would
negotiate further over job cuts, but if there were strikes the corporation
would 'take a very hard line indeed'.

FT  29 APR 91 / Lesson from the indexed decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, Mr Robert Hetzel, vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond, proposed that Congress should instruct the US Treasury to issue
index-linked bonds. (We will come to his reasons later.)
Since it is the 10th birthday of index-linked funding in the UK, give or
take a few days, this is a good occasion to look back at the British
experience. The initial aim was simply to save money. It was Mrs Thatcher's
rage at the Bank of England's judgment that the market would require a
return of nearly 16 per cent on 20-year conventional bonds, just when her
strong assault on monetary inflation had started to show clear results, that
triggered the decision.
The bonds have indeed proved a spectacular economy for the Treasury. The
initial success confirmed the theoretical case: that the right time for
indexed funding is when official inflationary expectations are much more
optimisitic than those of the market. In more recent years, the saving to
taxpayers has shown how highly the market values the absence of risk.
In offering a guarantee against nasty inflationary surprises, an
inflation-fighting government is, as it were, putting its money where its
mouth is. This, however, is just what the British authorities had failed to
understand in years of missed opportunities. The Bank, in particular, argued
that these would be 'banana republic' bonds (in spite of the fact that
banana republics are the main exponents of inflating away conventional
debt).
More recent comments from the US Treasury and from the budget director, Mr
Richard Darman, have been on the same lines. It was nonsense then, and it is
still nonsense now.
Some British Treasury officials, on the other hand, were held back by a
secret nostalgia for the early 1970s, when they had been using banana
republic tactics with great success. British bonds paid such hugely negative
real returns that the national debt had by 1976 shrunk to its lowest level
since the days of Gladstone, in comparison with national income. It was only
after investors had rumbled this strategy that official minds moved.
The economies are easiest to measure in terms of relative interest payments.
Mr Robert Bootle of Midland Montagu, a leading student of indexation, has
calculated what he calls the 'break-even' level of inflation - the rate
which would compensate indexed holders for the income they could have had
from conventional bonds - for every year since 1981. For non-taxpayers - the
pensions funds that hold most of the bonds - actual inflation has been well
below break-even level in most years until interest rates were raised
sharply during 1988.
sured as it is in other countries, without an interest rate component, gross
investors have consistently lost 200-300 basis points throughout. Even for
high-rate taxpayers, indexed bonds do not look a rewarding investment,
except for insomniacs. It is clear, then, that the yield gap represents a
risk premium.
There is also, more surprisingly, a fairly consistent risk premium over
income returns on equity. This is surprising because while the indexed bonds
offer simply a guaranteed real return, equities should, on average, offer a
rising real return, reflecting the real growth of the economy.
In spite of this, equity dividends have pretty consistently exceeded the
running return on indexed gilts - by more than 300 basis points in the early
days, when an inflation guarantee seemed too good to be true, and by an
average of about 75 basis points in recent years. This yield gap only
reversed once. In 1987, a negative gap of nearly 2 per cent appeared - and
we all know what happened then. The positive gap is now suggestively thin
again.
In short, the existence of a reasonable pool of indexed bonds (about Pounds
14bn at issue price at the moment) has provided an anchor rate of real
return for the whole British financial market. This probably restrains
upside volatility, making the task of monetary management a bit less
difficult. It may also raise the cost of investment capital compared with
other countries; but this depends on one's assessment of the other great
advantage of indexed issues - as a marketing strategy.
Most people prefer milk chocolate to plain; but there is an obstinate
minority, including myself, which greatly prefers its chocolate dark and
bitter. (Perhaps plain chocolate is for pessimists.) European chocolatiers
have always catered for both markets; in the US, Hershey took a long time to
come round. The issue of indexed bonds provides plain chocolate for
investors, a security for those, such as regional Federal Reserve officials
who worry a great deal about inflation.
Once these pessimists are out of the conventional bonds market, remarkable
things can happen. In the UK, holders of ordinary long bonds made a 50 per
cent profit in the first six months after the indexed became generally
available.
From the taxpayer's point of view, this means that the government now pays a
plain risk premium rather than a panic premium on its borrowing; so it may
be that industrialists are also able to raise capital a bit more cheaply
than they could if there were no indexed bonds in Britain, although they pay
a bit more than most competitors in the developed countries.
In one respect, though, indexed gilts have failed to live up to their
supposed promise. It was thought that the gap between indexed and
conventional yields would provide a temperature chart of the market's
inflationary expectations. In the event, it seems that the market forecasts
the way a picnicker does - by looking out of the window. The gap has tracked
current inflation faithfully, but has no forecasting value at all.
Unfortunately, this is precisely the merit which has attracted Mr Hetzel to
the idea - he thinks it would give a valuable steer on monetary policy. No
such luck, in London, anyway; but the other advantages are surely worth
attention.

FT  29 APR 91 / Lilley to stress innovation at DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Lilley, trade and industry secretary, will announce a revision of
his department's formal objectives tomorrow in a speech setting out a
free-market industrial policy for the 1990s.
A greater emphasis on improving the quality of DTI staff, on innovation and
on promoting deregulation will be included in a reworking of departmental
objectives as set out in 1987 by Lord Young, the then trade and industry
secretary.
Mr Lilley's speech follows a 'brainstorming' weekend summit of DTI ministers
last month at the home of Lord Hesketh, minister for industry.
At the Institute of Directors in Birmingham, Mr Lilley will set out a
non-interventionist role for government in industry, but he will stress his
belief that the DTI has a role in promoting innovation. No change is
expected in the DTI's 'department for enterprise' logo.
His speech comes as the Labour party steps up its attack on the government's
handling of the economy. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry
spokesman, said the DTI had been turned into 'an adventure playground' for
the No Turning Back Group of Thatcherite Conservatives of which Mr Lilley is
a member.
Lord Young set objectives of creating more competitive markets, improving
information available to businessmen, extending privatisation and protecting
consumers and investors. The emphasis was on enterprise, wealth creation and
reducing red-tape.
Mr Lilley will aim to build on, rather than alter, that free-market
approach. But he will seek to counter critics' claims that the government
does not have an industry policy, in particular by recognising the
importance of manufacturing in the economy. He will argue that the long-term
decline in manufacturing has been halted in the past decade.
Mr Lilley will cite government efforts to win contracts in Kuwait for
British companies as an example of how partnership is possible between
industry and government.
He wants to improve the quality of staff at the DTI so government assistance
is more accessible.
The DTI's regional offices could be used as 'one-stop shops' for businessmen
to obtain information about all government department's programmes,
including the training responsibilities of the Department of Employment.

FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: A misleading link in the debate over capital
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D H A HARRISON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With the banking industry still dominated by the conviction that 'Too
Big To Fail' rules, Paul Collins' argument for market-based bank capital
requirements ('Prescription for a financial ailment', April 24) is
particularly valuable. As he says, 'Less capital is not better. Nor is more
capital.' The amount of capital needed is that which convinces risk-exposed
investors and depositors to invest and deposit.
It is misleading, however, to bracket the US with the EC in the debate over
limiting the extent of government guarantees to depositors. The US, even in
the wake of the savings and loans disaster, continues to concentrate on
limiting the quantum of the guarantee, while leaving 100 per cent cover
intact. The EC's plans are still under discussion but there is every hope
that its proposals for a harmonised scheme will restrict cover to well below
100 per cent of whatever quantum is selected - as does the UK system. Only
thus can the depositor discipline, which Mr Collins seeks, be achieved.
It is surprising also to meet such enthusiasm for formula based capital
requirements from an exponent of market discipline. The evidence is that the
new, undiscriminating, 'credit risk' based system is risk-generative and any
workable market risk add-on is likely to be so simplistic as to achieve the
same result.
Mr Collins' basic premise needs no such artificial support. If depositors
can be convinced that they are at least partly at risk, the market will make
capital requirements, imposed by supervisors, obsolete. Banks will vie with
each other to demonstrate how well capitalised and risk averse they have
become. On the other hand, if the US revision of deposit insurance leaves
100 per cent cover intact - at whatever level - the US taxpayer had better
start saving up for a repeat performance.

(1):
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL MORRIS.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your feature on the problems facing the British motor industry arising
from government economic policies (April 24) mentions the negative effect of
the special car tax on the industry.
The Transport and General Workers' Union - the largest trade union in the UK
car industry - is launching a campaign to persuade the government to scrap
this tax, which is jeopardising thousands of motor manufacturing jobs.
The car tax is levied in addition to VAT on all new passenger cars at a rate
of 10 per cent of the wholesale price. This adds about 8.3 per cent to the
recommended retail price. Together with VAT, the effective rate of tax on
new cars is therefore 27.5 per cent in the UK, compared to 22 per cent in
France and just 14 per cent in Germany.
Abolition of the tax would help the industry at a time when help is most
needed, with the recession hitting demand and hence employment. The revenue
lost to the government through the abolition of the tax would, I believe, be
largely made up through additional VAT receipts and petrol tax consequent on
more new car sales.
Of course, the TGWU's interest is in the first place in protecting the jobs
of the thousands of our members in the industry, which the recession is
currently putting at risk. We recognise that this can only be done by
helping the industry on to a better competitive footing. The simplest single
step the government could take in order to do its bit would be to scrap this
unjustified and burdensome tax.

FT  29 APR 91 / You don't have to 'compete'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has long looked likely that economic performance depends not only on
'economic' variables such as resources, or incentive and ownership
structures, but also on more elusive psychological attributes - which have
been treated in studies such as Martin Wiener's well-known English Culture
and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit.
It was therefore worth seeking out evidence of national differences in
attitudes to work, studies, money and so on, and see how they related to
more conventional indicators. Prof Richard Lynn's study, undertaken with a
48-person international team, entitled The Secret of the Miracle Economy
(Social Affairs Unit, 104 Park Street, London, W1Y 3RJ, Pounds 8.95) is
therefore welcome - so long as it is examined critically.
Attitudes were ascertained by means of questionnaires put to students. This
is obviously far from ideal, but better than nothing. The four theories
examined in the study relate to economic growth to a Protestant-type work
ethic, to a comprehensive 'achievement orientation', to competitiveness at
the individual level and to 'valuation of land'. The last is a negative
factor and is a generalisation of the Wiener theory relating to Britain's
poor relative performance in the last century to a national preference for
the supposed virtues of the landed gentleman over those of the successful
businessman.
Lynn reports that only 'competitiveness' is significantly associated with
economic growth. By competitiveness Lynn does not mean a low real exchange
rate or openness of markets to new entrants, but enthusiastic personal
support for propositions such as: 'Winning is important in both work and
games.' Competitiveness is itself associated with other variables such as
individuals attaching high value to money and wanting to enter business. But
the essence is the triumph of winners over losers. It is different from the
economist's idea of the pursuit of wealth or real income (including leisure)
which does not in principle require the existence of losers at all.
The headline conclusion is that competitiveness is higher in the five
'miracle' economies of East Asia - Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong Japan and
Singapore - than it is in Europe. There is a consolation for Britain, which
is well up in the European league, and scores higher not merely than Norway
or Sweden, but Germany and Switzerland as well.
But if the reader glances at the full table in the study he will find that
the world leaders in competitiveness are not the East Asian stars at all,
but Egypt, Jordan and Bangladesh in that order. There is, however, more
genuine reassurance elsewhere. If developed and developing countries are
considered in separate groups, no significant relationship is found between
competitiveness and real per capita income. Thus the not very edifying
elbowing-out attitudes are much less important for countries wishing to stay
at a high income level than for poorer countries aspiring towards them.
A similar disclaimer applies to the warning about the ambitions of the able
young in advanced societies towards the caring professions, such as
medicine, teaching and social work. The psychological law of diminishing
marginal utility, which is studied more by economists than psychologists,
tells us very crudely that the more you have of something the less you value
additions to it, relative to something else. Thus, rich countries can afford
a shift to less business-oriented values even if it means a sacrifice in the
rate of growth of take-home pay.
The value of a market economy to me has always been the choice of
life-style. You do not have to be a thrustful competitor unless you want to.
This advantage remains despite the new study.

FT  29 APR 91 / Challenge to foster human capital: As bankers and finance
ministers gather in Washington, the World Bank looks for fresh vigour under
a new chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote
development in the Third World? That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis
Preston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes
over as president of the World Bank this September.
As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the
spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no
shortage of advice. The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments
of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private
sector. The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques
Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach
strict political conditions to its loans. Development economists, meanwhile,
are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development
Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.
Mr Preston may relax on one count. Few in Washington now doubt that the bank
is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the
Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems:
Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn
people live on less than Dollars 1 a day.
More than 110m Third World children lack access even to primary education.
Horrific inequality abounds. In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10
per cent is 20 years less than for the richest 10 per cent.
What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber
Conable? Most reports are mixed. 'It is not an impressive bureaucracy,' says
Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics. 'The morale of staff is lousy,' says Mr Charles Flickner, a
senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the
bank. Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in
1986 knowing little about either banking or development. Although now
well-liked (partly for championing causes such as women's rights in the
Third World), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start
involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank.
Mr Percy Mistry, a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, and former
senior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from 'presidential failure'
during the 1980s. Mr Robert McNamara, a forceful chief executive in the
1970s, built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership
from the top. But neither Mr Conable nor his predecessor, Mr A W 'Tom'
Clausen, a commercial banker, could fill his shoes. For a decade the bank
has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed -
vice-presidents: Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the
EBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi.
Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of
the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of
'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience. His
third, one might add, will be quickly to establish his independence from the
US Treasury which always browbeats a newcomer.
What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit? In spite of recent
progress in a few countries, such as Mexico, the past decade has been one of
relative failure. Many Third World countries have gone backwards. Real per
capita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the
Middle East, and mildly in Latin America.
The biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and
early 1980s. Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr
Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, in 1989, as a 'final solution' to
the debt crisis. Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden
of developing countries' private debts on condition that they implement
market-oriented economic reforms.
'The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are
willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of
official debt. Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the
recent forgiveness of about half of Poland's official debt will not set a
precedent for other debtors. Mr Williamson laughs. 'In the long run it will
be impossible to isolate Poland,' he says. 'It is not so much more deserving
than other countries.'
But why was a Brady-type solution not launched much earlier? For most of the
1980s, the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness. The
result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some
Dollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980.
'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,'
concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council
in Washington. (The IMF was equally short-sighted.)
As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for
promoting development. The main innovation of the 1980s was a switch from
project lending to 'structural adjustment' lending. Making finance
conditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic
performance of developing countries.
But studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive. This is both
because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the
bank's policies were sometimes misguided. Professor John Toye, director of
the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, recently
completed an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes. He concludes (as do
internal bank analyses) that policy-based lending has 'achieved something,
particularly in relation to the external account, but not nearly as much as
the bank and donor community hoped'. On average programmes have reduced
balance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Product
and led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP.
Mr Feinberg calls the decline in investment the 'great shortcoming of
structural adjustment lending in the 1980s'. (Investment to GNP ratios have
fallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.) He says the
bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of
adjustment by increasing investment.
How can the bank do better in the 1990s? One problem is that it has lost
leverage over many Third World governments. The maturing of bank programmes
and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked
shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries. According to Mr
Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next
five years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world
compared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s. For the large
number of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans, the net flow
will be negative.
Some analysts, including US Treasury officials, believe lacklustre
performance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency (and
sometimes corruption) of governments. The EBRD's constitution requires
borrowers to be 'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party
democracy, pluralism and market economics'. It also says 60 per cent of EBRD
resources must be devoted to the commercial sector - private businesses and
state concerns in the process of privatisation. The World Bank operates
under very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political and
only its small affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), can
make direct loans to private businesses. Should the bank's charter be
amended?
Direct parallels between the bank and the EBRD are dubious. The EBRD is
ministering to a region that has historical ties with western Europe and
that has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets. Such values
are alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should
be denied the means for economic development. If strict political
conditionality had been imposed in the past, the bank could not have lent to
a development star such as South Korea.
Most analysts, however, say the bank should tighten up a little. Mr Flickner
of the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist on
Westminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that
'loans will benefit the majority of the people'. Bank officials say greater
attention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of
decision-taking.
Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the private
sector? Mr Conable, to his credit, is resisting the US Treasury's pressure.
He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a
'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing
countries. In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is in
spheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governments
play a dominant role even in industrialised countries.
Indeed, one conclusion of Prof Toye's analysis is that policy-based loans
would have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand
the role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote
economic liberalisation.
Sir William Ryrie, the head of the IFC, says the objective of a large volume
of public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed. 'What we are trying
to do is facilitate the flow of private-sector funds into sound
investments.' Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector
are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs;
but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of market
risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?
There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development.
During the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums. It
wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently
fashionable in the industrialised world. But the notion that economic
liberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned. The bank's
own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly
and to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care.
'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for
International Economics, 'but education is more important.' He argues that
the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to
put resources into education and primary health care. Mr Feinberg at the
Overseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way
of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development'.
The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles
of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis
on the formation of human capital.
Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because
development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and
other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas. Ideas are
certainly important, but they do not build hospitals or schools. More money
could be made available: a mere 10 per cent cut in western defence spending,
for example, would pay for a doubling of official aid. Rather than tamely
accepting the status quo, Mr Preston could use his platform to promote a
more constructive attitude in rich countries.

FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Carmen - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the morass of mediocrity which is the new Royal Opera Carmen (sponsors:
Daiwa Europe Ltd and the Linbury Trust), a handful of rewarding performers
stand apart. There is, for example, Leontina Vaduva: her Micaela, played as
a milksop entirely lacking in country-girl determination, delivers
nonetheless an exquisite third-act aria - the voice of the young Romanian
soprano is not yet in full bloom, but the quality is lustrously fresh.
There is also Gino Quilico, a bit slow on his pins for a star bullfighter,
but a stylish baritone with vocal elegance and verbal wit to his credit -
and native French (or rather, Canadian-French) as well, not something heard
at Covent Garden very often. Christopher Booth-Jones (Morales) cuts a dash;
and though often the wretchedly bad blocking of the staging contrives to
deny us clear sight of the attractive persons of Judith Howarth (Frasquita)
and Jean Rigby (Mercedes), at least we are not denied sound of their
attractive voices.
Best of all - and principal saving grace of an otherwise dispiriting evening
 -is the Jose of Luis Lima. He is, as we recall from his Carlos and Nemorino
on the same stage, a fine, intensely physical actor: small, trim, darkly
handsome, with liquidly expressive eyes and a way of being stirred to love
or violence which combines Latin volatility and acute psychological
understanding (and vital, poetically accented use of words, spoken as well
as sung).
That the opera is Jose's tragedy was at Covent Garden on Friday clearer than
ever; for on a stage clogged and cluttered by a particularly debased form of
pictorial naturalism, with bits and pieces of characterisation unlinked by
any discernible dramatic thread, Lima provides the single developing line of
dramatic coherence and consistency.
In the past he has tended to force his lean, dusky-toned tenor at climaxes,
as much (one suspects) through dramatic enthusiasm as anything else. Here,
some unwanted bursts of final-duet sobs notwithstanding, he sounds
impressively apt to the music, neither too heavy nor too light; and while a
conductor less limited in his command of French-operatic style than Zubin
Mehta would no doubt encourage Lima to mould the melodies with even greater
suppleness, this is in sum one of the most moving Joses of recent times.
Mehta is a conductor with a gift for waking up an orchestra (and, evidently,
a chorus - their form was above the recent house average). He approaches the
work with energy, and a certain feeling for the beauty of detail in Bizet's
scoring. What he entirely lacks is rhythmic elasticity - the Spanish
metrical inflections receiving either a drum-banging underlining or a
hot-handed caress - and, more seriously, any sense of unfolding dramatic
impetus.
Friday's was a Carmen experience of stop-starts. In a theatre larger than
that for which it was written, the opera needs not flashy moments, but a
clear grasp of how to keep the work moving and, above all, certainty of
taste. But since the conductor insists on performing the work in the roundly
discredited edition by Fritz Oeser, plumped full of those obviously
ineffective short passages or repetitions which Bizet himself cut before
opening night, certainty of taste is not Mehta's calling card. Can no-one at
Covent Garden hear how completely those added bits of Oeserie lame the close
of the 'Chanson boheme', for instance, or the final duet? Does no-one care?
The blend of Mehta's stylelessness and Nuria Espert's limp production (in
the tall, Goya-influenced but plasticky-looking and space-cramping single
set of Gerardo Vera) is a lethal one. There are few things in opera more
numbing than the meaningless operatic naturalism on offer here. The
production's flubbed details and attempts at novelty are countless - the
Sevillian working people doing their little cameos in Act 1, the flamenco
dancer spoiling the quiet opening music of Act 2, an utterly incompetent
fight in Act 3, the milling crowds plus two horses in Act 4, and so on. How
so distinguished a woman of the Spanish theatre can have failed in this
particular way with this particular opera is a sad mystery.
Having Maria Ewing in the title role was obviously no help. Reports tell us
that her attendance at rehearsals was slight; but even without that
information we could probably guess as much. For this is Carmen in an
hermetically sealed bubble, giving us Her Performance, unresponsive to
others on stage; even her singing, with its fascinating timbre (albeit
shrill on high notes) and phrase-shapes, sounds self-directed.
Miss Ewing can be the most mesmerising of stage artists. Here, her presence
is negative, a final drain on the vitality of the character and the opera.
Indeed, one must accord the production a last benefit of the doubt: perhaps
a different Carmen will make it all seem different.

FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Complementary to historic sites - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cambridge University's announcement last week that it is to go ahead with
its development plans for the new Judge Institute of Management Studies was
accompanied by the naming of the architect for an historic site in the
centre of Cambridge. John Outram Associates have been selected to design a
major new building that has to incorporate elements of the listed Old
Addenbrookes Hospital currently occupying the site between Trumpington
Street and Tennis Court Road. Both the major donors, Mr and Mrs Paul Judge
and Mr Simon Sainsbury as well as the university were involved in the
selection procedures to find an architect. They have made a brave choice
because John Outram is an original, hard to classify and yet highly
appropriate because he understands and responds to the historical density of
this site.
But Outram is not in any way an historical pasticheur. His particular sort
of architecture achieves what many modern architects had thought to be
impossible. His buildings are both technically innovative and ornamental. He
does not, like some architects, make the innovations of technology
themselves into an artistic language. His own architectural language is
strong enough to encompass the existence of the old hospital and to add to
it in a manner that will be complementary without being imitative.
The Old Addenbrookes Hospital goes back to the 1740s but the most visible
part from Trumpington Street is the facade of the 1860s, designed by Matthew
Digby Wyatt. It was described by Pevsner in his 'Buildings of England' as 'a
depressing example of its date, with many rather dry, thin motifs, Italian
as well as Tudor, assembled without any tension or accentation.' It has more
friends today and its curious, round arched North Lombardic character is not
without possibilities. As Outram says, the facade has lost little of its
relevance to the problem of urban architecture and seems less of an artifice
today than it probably was at the time of its original design.
His solution to the problem of inserting a new and innovative centre for
management studies on to this site is to create three buildings which will
all be linked by a 16-metre high animated internal street where students and
faculty will meet and mingle. There will undoubtedly be considerable
architectural drama that will give the new faculty a colourful profile in
the university.
John Outram's name is strongly linked to an eclectic range of new buildings.
His country house in Sussex with its five typologies for the column and
richly colourful palette of materials is undoubtedly one of the most
interesting country houses built in Britain this century. At some remove,
but just as interesting, is the pumping station on the Isle of Dogs directly
commissioned by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The earlier
headquarters building for Harp Heating combined service columns with a
considerable wit concerning the iconography of engineering.
There are two as yet unbuilt schemes; the Milton Keynes based headquarters
for the Consumer Association (Which?) and the large new office development
for the Rosehaugh-Stanhope Holborn Viaduct/Blackfriars Station site. The
Outram element of this scheme is at the Blackfriars end of the site and is a
remarkable essay in prefabricated brick and concrete technology. This
building - by far the most outstanding of the whole development - is at
present on hold awaiting the upturn in the City property market. It will be
a very positive addition to the City.
Outram has been selected for the British Pavilion in this year's Venice
Architectural Biennale.
Architects were named for another important project last week: the sensitive
and important Spitalfields Market site. The proposed redevelopment of this
is a long saga. But minds will have to be focused in May when the fruit and
vegetable market finally moves out to its new home in east London at Temple
Mills. The Spitalfields Development Group announced their selection of the
international firm of Benjamin Thompson and Associates as master planners
for the whole 12-acre site of the market.
Ben Thompson and his wife Jane pioneered, with the Rouse Company in the US,
the rescue of redundant urban market sites or collapsed areas of major
cities. They have made an enormously successful impact - particularly at
Boston's Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, at New York City's South Street
Seaport development and at the Bayside Marketplace, Baltimore. I recently
admired their elegant rescue operation at Union Station, Washington DC Are
they the right people to rescue this vital part of London that has been
fought over by conservationists for years and lies on the brink of some of
the most socially deprived parts of the capital? Spitalfields is important
for the City too: it is a close neighbour to the monumental Broadgate
development as well as the Georgian streets of the former Huguenot quarter
around Hawksmoor's Christ Church.
The Spitalfields Development Group have another scheme on the table at the
moment which is due to be examined at a public inquiry in October. This
scheme, by Swanke Hayden Connell, should surely be dropped at once and a
groundswell of support ensured for the ideas of the Thompsons. I was shown
their very early ideas for the site, but I liked their informality and I
agreed with the wish to make the whole place 'walking scale'. It is surely
right to have a wide selection of architects working on a whole range of
buildings under the careful direction of a master planner to ensure a sense
of harmony without uniformity. The track record of Ben Thompson Associates -
currently also working in Dublin and Cardiff - shows that they have often
achieved the impossible and made enjoyable places flower in the urban
deserts. As long as they remember that Spitalfields has to be the key to the
regeneration of east London as well as a link to the City, I feel that they
have the sensitivity to rescue Spitalfields from squalor. They must not be
hedged about with any more bureaucratic delay.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In her small black sunglasses, short black dress and stilettos, a headset
mike fitted around the razor cheekbones, Tania Maria totters on to the stage
like a formidable adversary for Mad Max's Tina Turner. She looks as though
she means business.
The Brazilian singer/pianist's business is hot Latin fusion and on Thursday
it came fast and tight as ever. It was the last night of a European tour
and, according to the salsasavants, she is at her at 'pre-New York best'.
This presumably means that the melodies are uncomplicated and the rhythm,
borne by congas, drums and bass, uncompromising. The carnival fireworks are
in the voice and the streaming wordless vocals and scatting. Or even
whistling (she trilled a complicated 10-minute salsa version of 'Do you
think I'm sexy?').
Whistling jazz fusion and getting away with it is one thing: any singer who
can make a Royal Festival Hall audience dance has spirit. But the steaming
mix of rock and Latin jazz, cranked up by horn and trumpet, was completely
irresistible.
The Maria method can be applied to any number, 'Ce c'est bon', a carnival
stomper fitted in perfectly with an unlikely, but sizzling version of the
Stones' 'Satisfaction', carried off bolero style. 'Hup]' the changes are
signalled as she comes crashing down the keyboard, cheeks sucked into an
impossible pout and out pour the words. She crouches at the keyboards (one
is electric) and telegraphs the cues to her slavish accompanists in between
batting the lyric around with her hands as it tumbles forth. Block chords
are plonked in, when she can restrain her hands, to keep the careering voice
on course.
It did the trick. By the end of the set more than a few of us were doing the
merengue, elbows akimbo, down the gangway to meet the po-faced ushers in
front of the stage. 'I'm very happy - a little homesick - but I think we
done a very good concert,' Tania concluded modestly as she left an RFH
crying out for more.
Three hours earlier singer Cleveland Watkiss was taking the stage in support
of Tania Maria. Showcasing a splendid new album, Blessing in disguise
(Polydor), the young black Londoner has a style and voice which could be
mass marketed to a wider than jazz audience. That seems to be the idea,
anyhow. But a fine Guildhall-trained voice is no guarantee of commercial
success. My feeling is that he is too hard to pin down - and too crafty with
the grooves - to appeal to non-jazzers. Like a junior jazz version of Taj
Mahal, he has absorbed almost the entire range of black music from calypso
and reggae ('Bagah-Orange') to George Bensonesque schmooze ('Memories'). It
is clever stuff alright and the six piece band behind him, led by guitarist
Tony Remy, are spot on. But it is worth noting that the biggest cheers - led
by his mother - were for a straight Motown soul sounding ballad which is
pure Marvin Gaye, 'Be Thankful for what you got'.

There is a tremendous amount of talk about this 'three dimensional

With its eye on the local elections on May 2, Panorama (9.40 BBC1) has a

FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship - Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to see why a recession should cause a drop in the output of good
young singers. Voices are not acquired on credit and one would have thought
there should be a continuous supply of new talent, if the teachers and
interest in the art form are still there, as there is every reason to
believe they are.
The Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship, awarded since 1956, has a history
of producing winners who have gone on to successful careers. This year,
indeed, it may do the same again, as the prizes went to very worthy
competitors. But there was not the same depth of talent that has made it
difficult in the past to decide the order of merit between a large field of
high-quality entrants.
On Friday, at the finals held at the Wigmore Hall, it seemed a fairly
straightforward choice between two or three singers. The jury selected the
soprano Mary Plazas, not necessarily the most exciting of them, which
suggests that they were looking for a sense of style as well as purely vocal
accomplishment. Her Debussy and Bellini were equally stylish, quietly
expressive, and she sang as though she loved the music, which is always a
help.
The runner-up was the youngest competitor, 22-year-old mezzo Jane Irwin, and
third prize went to the soprano Gail Pearson. I would have put them round
the other way or even given first place to Miss Pearson. In a competition
that had been singularly lacking in zest, she really made the audience sit
up with her bright and confident singing of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette,
while always giving the impression that she had plenty of voice to spare.
Still, Jane Irwin's programme was well presented and there was every sign in
her performances that voice and personality are developing in equal measure,
which is a valuable attribute in one so young.
In the closing address on behalf of the jury Janet Baker summed up three
failings that it was felt had been prevalent during the competition: poor
physical presentation; poor languages; and a poor choice of programmes. At
many other Ferrier finals this would have seemed a querulous attitude with
which to end. But not at this one. For all three faults had been
disturbingly in evidence in the course of this last evening.

FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: The Stick Wife - The Gate Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The staging is terrific; the lighting is pretty good, too. And, of course,
this being the Gate Theatre, the acting and direction are superb. There are
some doubts, however, about the play.
The Stick Wife by the American playwright Darrah Cloud is set in Birmingham,
Alabama in 1963, a pregnant year in US politics. The stage action takes
place outside a suburban white lower middle class house, where the washing
is hung out to dry in the days before drying machines took over. Since most
of the washing consists of white sheets, the message is clear enough from
the start. 'I'd never realised how much white shows up the dirt,' says one
of the female characters later on. There are three wives and three husbands.
The men are involved in the bombing of a black church which results in the
death of four children. The women are in varying degrees and at various
stages opposed to the violence, which the men call war. One of the wives
informs the federal authorities that the husbands are members of the Ku Klux
Klan. This is a true, or at least true-ish, story, documented by the New
York Times.
In the end, however, the women stick to their men. The crowning blow, as you
might have guessed from the date, is the assassination of President Kennedy.
'Oh my Lord,' the women wail in unison, 'who's going to take care of us
now?' No point in shooting their husbands, as they had once seemed prepared
to do, if there has been a collapse of authority in the White House. They
may not have stuck to their guns anyway.
There are some good moments: for example, in reference to war - 'Where's
Vietnam?' 'Africa.' And Marty Cruickshank, as the leading wife, comes
dramatically close to pulling the trigger. One half-expected a section of
the audience to rise up in protest that she does not. Ms Cruickshank is
marvellous in her intensity, as indeed is the whole production - down to the
sound of the crickets - by Nancy Diuguid. Written 20 years ago, this would
have been a stunning piece. Now it seems a bit dated: the women's movement
looking for roots.

FT  29 APR 91 / Management (Under Pressure):  The Scottish bank with an
English money-box - James Buxton continues the series on UK clearers by
assessing the Bank of Scotland, one of Britain's more innovative
institutions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When Bank of Scotland produces its annual results on Wednesday they will
show its first fall in pre-tax profits since the early 1980s. Higher
provisions for bad debts means that group profits for the year to February
are likely to fall short of last year's record Pounds 194m.
Yet despite this, the bank's reputation as one of the most successful
clearing banks in Britain is unlikely to be tarnished. Over the past decade,
it has devised a strategy which has resulted in its share of the UK banking
market roughly doubling (to about five per cent), with half its business now
coming from south of the border, despite having only a skeleton branch
network outside Scotland.
That is backed by a management system which has so far enabled it to avoid
many mistakes, to keep costs low and consistently to innovate. Most of its
growth has been organic.
The transformation of what at the end of the 1970s was a competent but
hidebound organisation owes much to Bruce Pattullo; now deputy governor and
chief executive, he took over running the bank, which he had joined straight
from Oxford, in 1979 when he was 41.
When he arrived at The Mound, the bank's headquarters in Edinburgh, no one
seemed to be responsible for the direction the bank was taking. 'The
management assumed that the non-executive directors were worrying about
future strategy and left it to them,' he says. 'In fact the directors were
busy running their own businesses and assumed that the management was
thinking about the future. Despite good intentions there was a void.'
Pattullo, a man whose liveliness belies his somewhat stern appearance,
created a management board consisting of the clearing bank's full-time
senior executives and told them that where the bank was in five years' time
was up to them. The main board of directors became entirely non-executive
and its role became that of vetting the decisions of the management board,
with Pattullo the only person on both.
'The idea was to give the managers responsibility. They wanted change and
were delighted to rise to the challenge,' he says.
Responsibility then began to cascade down the managerial ranks. According to
Peter Burt, 47, who took over as chief general manager in 1988, Pattullo
'took the lid off the pressure cooker and allowed ideas to bubble up in a
gradually accelerating process'.
The bank's initiatives in the English market are designed to reduce
dependence on the sluggish Scottish economy, and to offset and even exploit
the fact that it does not have a full branch network in England. 'If we'd
inherited a network like Royal Bank of Scotland we'd have been delighted,'
says Pattullo. 'But it was too late to buy or to build. Necessity is the
mother of invention.' The bank still has only about 15 branches in England
outside London compared with 487 in Scotland.
The initial big step was the 1983 launch of the first money market cheque
account offered by a clearing bank. It was an immediate success in the
south-east of England.
That was followed by:
Joint ventures with more than 30 organisations such as the Halifax Building
Society and the Automobile Association, with the bank normally contributing
financial products and processing, and the partner offering its customer
base.
HOBS, the bank's Home and Office Banking System, which was the first in the
UK whereby a customer can operate his account remotely. The majority of HOBS
customers are companies which had no previous connection with Bank of
Scotland.
Creating a card-processing centre at Dunfermline, Fife, which processes the
Bank's own Visa and Mastercards as well as those issued by institutions such
as National Provincial building society and, in a joint venture, Halifax
Building Society. It now operates 1.5m cards.
Invention of TAPS, the bank's transcontinental automated payment service,
which links countries' automated payments systems for low cost transmission
of very large numbers of small payments. The bank says it was a first and is
still unique in dealing with payments to several countries simultaneously.
Development of a substantial English business in mortgages and targeted
loans fed to it by intermediaries and operated through the bank's
computerised central banking services in Edinburgh. It says it was the first
UK bank to create this kind of centre for processing remote transactions.
With its small English branch network the bank has a low cost-base. Its
cost/income ratio fell three points in 1989/90 to 53 per cent as it pushed
more business through its existing structure. That compared with ratios for
London-based clearers of 64 per cent in the case of Barclays and 76 per cent
for Midland.
Bank of Scotland did not make some of the mistakes committed by other banks.
Its first criterion for new ventures is never to do anything that might
imperil the independence of the bank (reinforced by a 33 per cent stake held
by its Edinburgh neighbour, Standard Life), which automatically makes it
cautious.
Thus it did not buy into capital market operations at the time of Big Bang
(though it was anyway hardly big enough to have made much impact). It
contemplated and rejected buying a chain of estate agents before that became
fashionable. It has a low exposure to less developed country debt; it did
not buy a US bank, though, in this case, it tried but was outbid.
'We've elected not to pay more than book value for acquisitions,' says
Archie Gibson, general manager for central banking services. 'You'll be
familiar with the expression 'short arms and deep pockets'.'
Although Bank of Scotland has a joint venture in a new bank in Greece, a
joint venture in credit card-processing with Quelle, the German mail order
company, and a stake in Italian credit card processing as well as a venture
in New Zealand, the UK is the main focus of attention. It believes it
understands UK banking best. Says Burt: 'I believe we are still small enough
to double our market share in the UK.'
Already relatively small, Bank of Scotland believes it benefits from
devolved authority and short lines of communication. Gavin Masterton,
general manager since 1986 for UK banking east (covering the east of
Scotland), says: 'Cascading authority goes down as far as there's a
willingness to accept it.' Every branch manager, he says, should feel that
he 'owns' his branch. Within branches junior managers should feel they
'own', say, their own operations.
In a phrase which often comes up in conversations in the bank, he says, 'the
triangle of authority here is flatter than in other banks'. The district
manager in, say, Fife, is 'the man of business there who doesn't need to
refer many decisions to Edinburgh'. He says he regards both his regional
managers and his colleagues on the management board as his partners.
Masterton says the bank is continually asking 'is your journey really
necessary?' to cut out redundant work. Staff put up ideas and a formal staff
suggestion scheme produces results, such as a more economical way of storing
a customer's standing orders, and ditching a rule requiring mortgage arrears
to be reported to the district manager.
In February, as the effects of recession in England on the bank's lending
book deepened, the bank told its staff that there would have to be
significant belt-tightening, but assured them that there would be no
compulsory redundancies, though some of the 12,200 jobs would go through
natural wastage. 'If a person knows he isn't going to be sacked it becomes a
lot easier for him to agree with you that his current job may not be
necessary and do another one,' says Burt.
Pattullo believes, he says, in a 'bottom up' approach to management,
preferring to wait for ideas to germinate down the line and be pushed up to
the management board for approval, rather than to dictate from above.
'A chief executive who is over-anxious to stamp his personality on a bank
has a high risk of failing,' he says. 'Such an executive might say: I want
to create an operation in every country in Europe. But if the people down
the line don't really want to do it, if the chemistry isn't right, it won't
succeed.'
Some people who know the bank well suggest that its wish to keep its
distinctiveness as a low-cost institution, its typically Scottish refusal to
pay for goodwill and its dedication to increasing the wealth of its
shareholders limit its growth.
But the bank's record of expansion and new ventures contradicts that; the
need for consensus in the management board, however, restrains individual
egos and may avert rash moves. Pattullo says he exercises direction with a
light hand, and the consensus has very occasionally gone against him. But
senior managers believe his leadership and consistency of approach are the
key to the the bank's success, not least in engendering high morale. Burt
says: 'With high morale you achieve miracles.'

Career gridlock: baby boomers hit the wall. DT Hall &amp; J Richter in Academy
of Management Executive (US), Aug 90 (16 pages)
Points out that for people born between 1946 and 1964 the number of
management jobs available is less than the demand and shrinking.
This can lead to problems of career plateauing for those with traditional
ambition; asserts, however, that there are infinite ways of achieving
'psychological success'; expands on this idea by profiling the baby boomers'
value systems, eg they have a need for autonomy and to question authority
with a greater concern for a work/family balance.
Suggests guidelines for more effective utilisation of baby-boom potential,
such as replacing the promotion culture with a psychological success
culture.
Human resources strategy. RS Schuler &amp; JW Walker in Organizational Dynamics
(US), Summer 90. 15 pages.
Asserts that 'just as organisations can engage in short-term as well as
long-term planning of business strategies, HR planning can be done with a
short-term and a long-term focus'; then decides to use the term 'HR
strategy' to refer to the short-term thrust.
This is said to necessitate greater emphasis on HR concerns, concentration
on key issues, the interpretation of just about every aspect of business in
HR terms, and the involvement of the line in HR concerns.
Relates several cases in which action on the personnel front has shown
noteworthy results: the Weyerhaeuser Company's Bayer (ball bearings) plant
where crash courses in (product-related) English increased the utility of
ethnic labour; Grand Union (food retail) where HR measures brought about
better customer service; and Swiss Bank Corporation North America where the
marketing people needed training in communications with non-marketing staff.

FT  29 APR 91 / Economics: Markets looking for signs of move from recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOCUS this week will be on the pointers from the US and UK on the paths
likely to be taken by the two countries as they emerge from recession.
A big worry for economic policy makers is the lack of synchronisation
between trends in these two nations and in Germany.
In the case of the latter, demand has been racing away due to the pressures
of reunification, delivering a dose of unwelcome inflationary pressures.
The US and Britain, meanwhile, are struggling with the consequences of low
demand and sagging output. In recent weeks, indications of when an upturn in
either economy might take place have been far from clear.
Of a raft of indicators in the US, among the most important data are the
non-farm employment numbers, due on Friday. These are expected to show a
fall in employment in April of about 130,000, a smaller figure than the
206,000 in March and hence an encouraging sign for anyone looking for an
upturn.
Attention will also be directed towards other US figures such as the levels
of consumer income and spending.
Wednesday marks the publication in the US of the important National
Association of Purchasing Managers Survey which indicates the level of
demand in the economy. This is thought likely to show a small upward
movement from the 40 per cent reading in March, indicating a slight change
for the better in terms of the economic outlook.
In Britain, all eyes will be on the publication on Tuesday of the
Confederation of British Industry's latest quarterly survey of the level of
confidence in manufacturing industry.
The UK government, which in the past two weeks has suffered a deluge of bad
economic news, will the hoping the latest survey contains a few glimmers of
hope that a recovery of sorts will start up on schedule around the middle of
this year.
Other important economic figures and events due this week are as follows.
Median market forecasts are in brackets and are provided by MMS
International, the financial information group.
Today: US, March personal consumer income and spending (up 0.3 per cent and
0.2 per cent) and new home sales (up 0.3 per cent). France, March final
consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent).
Tomorrow: US, consumer confidence index for April, March factory goods
orders (down 3.2 per cent), agriculture prices for April, 1st quarter
employment cost index. Japan, March construction orders and new starts (down
13 per cent). Canada, February level of building permits.
Wednesday: May Day - most continental European markets closed. US, March
leading indicators and construction spending (down 0.5 per cent). Japan,
April foreign exchange reserves.
Thursday: UK, official reserves in March (up Dollars 250m). Germany, regular
Bundesbank council meeting. US, M1, M2 and M3 monetary aggregates for week
ended April 22 (up 1.5 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent). Japan,
trade balance for first three weeks of April and for March.
Friday: Japan, Constitution Day, markets closed. US, April manufacturing
payrolls (down 50,000) and civilian unemployment rate (7 per cent). Canada,
foreign reserves and leading economic indicators.
During the week: Germany, March industrial production and money supply data.

RESULTS DUE
THE SPOTLIGHT has gone off Retrovir, the anti-Aids treatment, as far as
followers of Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group which manufactures it,
is concerned.
The company is expected to say profits from the drug have been broadly flat
when it unveils results for the half-year to March on Thursday.
Analysts will be looking for further signs that the chief executive, Mr John
Robb, is adopting a more commercial approach to running the company.
Interim pre-tax profits should be no more than about Pounds 5m up on last
time's Pounds 164.1m.
The two Scottish clearing banks produce their results on Wednesday. Both are
expected to display the impact of the recession in the form of mounting bad
debts.
Bank of Scotland's results will be for the year ending last February.
Analysts are forecasting a decline of as much as a quarter from the previous
year's Pounds 194m before tax. Royal Bank of Scotland will be producing
interim results for the six months to March, and these will show a similar
fall.
When Evered Bardon, the quarry products group, announces its 1990 results on
Tuesday, it will be the last set of figures for the Evered group before the
merger with Bardon early this year. Even so, historic comparisons will be
difficult because of the rapid rate of acquisition in 1989 and early 1990.
Thanks to the purchases, pre-tax profit is expected to have risen to Pounds
44m, compared with Pounds 39m in 1989.

FT  29 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 70m work for Gammon
Construction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Contracts worth over Pounds 70m have been won by GAMMON CONSTRUCTION, the
Hong Kong-based company jointly owned by the construction division of
Trafalgar House and Jardine Matheson.
The largest is a subcontract with Chiyoda Corporation valued at Pounds 35.3m
for the design, approvals, procurement and construction of all civil,
building, mechanical and electrical services and fire protection work for
Mobil Oil's Hong Kong fuels terminal project. Gammon was appointed the
company's principal subcontractor early last year following completion of
work with Chiyoda in Malaysia.
Gammon is already at work on site following an earlier contract award from
Mobil Oil for the design and construction of the marine pier.
The second major contract award, worth Pounds 24.6m, involves the
construction and fitting out of a seven-storey members' club house with an
outdoor pool and deck area as well as all associated drainage and external
works for the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.
Gammon's piling division has won new work worth over Pounds 10m for site
investigations, substructure and bored piling.

FT  29 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Access to Glasgow Airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BALFOUR BEATTY has been awarded by The Scottish Office what is believed to
be the largest design and build road construction project in Britain. Valued
at Pounds 28m the St James Interchange improvement is designed to relieve
traffic congestion at the bottleneck to the west of Glasgow Airport.
The award followed several months of intense tendering by Balfour Beatty's
Edinburgh office, working closely with its designers Scott Wilson
Kirkpatrick &amp; Partners, based in Glasgow. During the tendering period, Royal
Fine Arts Commission approval had to be obtained by the contractor.
The St James Interchange improvement will involve the construction of two
flyovers linking the A740 with the M8, each almost 800 metres long and
consisting of a total of 14,000 cu metres of reinforced concrete and 4,000
tonnes of structural steel. Associated works include a railway bridge,
extensive piling and six adjoining slip roads which will involve complex
traffic management. Also included are extensive areas of settlement
embankments, vertical drains and various other ground treatment measures,
together with motorway lighting and traffic control systems.
Balfour Beatty aims to have the interchange open within 98 weeks of the
start of construction.
Balfour Beatty is also working for The Scottish Office within the
Strathclyde region on the construction of a major section of the new M74
motorway between Millbank and Abington.

Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KIER INTERNATIONAL, the overseas contracting arm of Beazer, has won a Pounds
16m contract to design and build a jetty at Sri Racha in the Bight of
Bangkok, for the Sri Racha Harbour Company. Work is being carried out in
joint venture with Beazer Asia group companies in Hong Kong.
A fast-track approach will be applied to achieve a construction period of 12
months. The whole project is due for completion in August 1992.
Designed in-house by Beazer, the jetty will be a steel trestle type decked
with precast concrete. It will be supported by steel piles measuring up to
one metre in diameter. Around 30,000 cu metres of concrete and 10,000 tonnes
of steel will be used during construction.
The structure, 3km in length, will begin to the south of an existing jetty
and cross over it, finishing on its north side. At the crossover, the new
jetty will be 10 metres above sea level.
Designed to accommodate up to 45,000 dwt vessels, the jetty will enable the
importation of scrap metal for processing at a plant in Sri Racha.

FT  29 APR 91 / Council tax may increase PSBR by Pounds 5bn a year, report
says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of the new council tax may lead to a Pounds 5bn-a-year
increase in the public-sector borrowing requirement, requiring increased
issues of gilts or a delay in tax cuts, a report published by Midland
Montagu Research warns today.
The report, which appears in Midland Montagu's Greenwell Gilt Weekly, says
that the government's attempts to minimise the local tax burden on
individuals through subsidies to local authorities or transitional relief
schemes may increase public-sector borrowing in the next three years.
Councils have borrowed much more than forecast in recent years. In 1990-91,
councils borrowed a record Pounds 3.5bn, more than the total borrowing in
the four years before.
High wage settlements and greater demands on local services may push up
council spending even further in the coming year.
Borrowing might increase still more in the short term, as the report fears
that the rate of collection of the poll tax may fall.
'Now that the government line is to abolish the tax - as it is
'uncollectable' - it is unlikely that the collection rate will pick up in
the coming year,' the report says. 'It would not be surprising if the
commitment of some authorities to tax collection also wavered.'
In the medium term, higher subsidies from central government may be required
to keep poll tax bills down in the year 1992-93, especially if the
collection rate has fallen the previous year. Because of the political
sensitivity of the issue, no government could allow bills to grow too big.
In the long term, the introduction of the new tax in 1993-94 may lead to
higher spending - as happened when the poll tax was introduced. That is
because the reorganisation might again 'muddy the waters of responsibility
and accountability'.
Local authorities might increase spending on services, and blame that on
central government cuts. After the poll tax embarrassment, the government
might feel compelled to raise grants to authorities to spare the taxpayer.
For 1991-92, the report forecasts the contribution of local government
overspending to the public-sector borrowing requirement might be almost
Pounds 2bn. In later years the cost of introducing the new tax might
increase the PSBR by Pounds 5bn or more.
The report claims the council tax will be more workable than the poll tax,
and says that ultimately it could have a positive effect on public finances,
by bringing greater stability, and making it more difficult for local
authorities to go on 'spending sprees'.

FT  29 APR 91 / Sales show consumers keen on cleanliness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of impressions to the contrary, Britain is increasingly becoming a
nation of squeaky-clean people who wash their clothes regularly and take
pride in keeping their homes spick-and-span.
According to a new report from Euromonitor, the market research company:
'The 1970s hippies and 1980s punks have given way to the 1990s conformist,
with the mid-1980s spending boom fuelling a youth culture geared towards
smart and sophisticated attire and quality clothes.'
Partly because of food hygiene scares, consumers have placed an increasing
emphasis on cleanliness in the home in recent years and demand for household
cleaning products, such as kitchen cleaners and washing powders, has grown
strongly.
The overall market for such items grew by 8.7 per cent in 1989 and was
estimated to have expanded by a further 7.1 per cent in 1990, showing few
signs of abating, in spite of recession.
The trend towards more expensive clothes and fabrics has increased demand
for specialist cleaning products, although not at the expense of
environmental considerations, which, Euromonitor suggests, represent the
'overriding influence' on the UK household cleaning market.
British consumers are increasingly using environmentally friendly
trigger-action sprays and are rejecting phosphate-laden detergents.
However, in spite of the general increase in cleanliness, the humble bar of
soap has surprisingly been one of the few in the market to suffer and has
steadily lost sales to more sophisticated products.
Household Cleaning: UK and European Trends and Forecasts to 1995.

FT  29 APR 91 / Polls mixed ahead of local elections

<TEXT>
CONFLICTING opinion polls suggest that neither the Labour party nor the
Conservative party has a clear lead ahead of Thursday's local elections, but
the Tories have received some cheer about the effect of the new council tax.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, speaking on LBC Radio,
emphasised the prime minister's strengths on domestic and international
stages. He said: 'This has brought us up to a position where we are in
striking distance of a fourth election victory. We are not quite there yet
but in striking distance.'
As campaigning intensifies ahead of Thursday's elections, opinion polls gave
widely differing impressions of how the parties are faring.
Most worryingly for Labour, an Independent On Sunday poll by Numbers Market
Research gave the Tories a 10-percentage-point lead. Labour officials
dismissed the results as 'rogue'.
The Sunday Telegraph gave Labour a 3-percentage-point lead over the Tories
and a Sunday Times Mori poll put the Conservatives 2 points ahead of Labour.
The Sunday Times estimated that the Tories were likely to lose 400 seats in
the local elections, while Labour stood to gain about 600.
The Sunday Telegraph poll said 52 per cent of voters thought Mr Major had
been bold in dealing with the poll tax. A Sunday Express poll said 54 per
cent were in favour of the council tax.
Liberal Democrats, although standing at about 13 per cent or 14 per cent in
the polls, remain pessimistic about Thursday's results, with one official
admiting at the weekend that the party might make net losses.
The party talks instead of raising its influence in areas of strength,
issuing a list of 12 councils where it expects to take control. They include
Cheltenham and Eastbourne.

FT  29 APR 91 / UN plans crackdown on drug laundering: New narcotics chief
sees attack on crime profits as crucial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW routes and markets for drug traffickers have been created with the end
of the Cold War and the opening of east European borders. The Soviet Union
has reported large increases in addicts during the last three years and the
United Nations says that some of the drugs now being smuggled through the
Balkans are 'sticking' en route.
The spread of the problem has added to the urgency with which the UN has
started to merge its three drugs agencies to cut out duplication. The aim is
to escalate and globalise its fight against the illicit drugs industry,
which Mr Giorgio Giacomelli, new head of the UN's programme, says is worth
up to Dollars 500bn a year.
Mr Giacomelli said the UN would take the lead to co-ordinate a more rigorous
worldwide fight against drug abuse. He sees a more vigorous attack on money
laundering as crucial, to stop drugs money being channelled into legitimate
businesses.
Mr Giacomelli, a senior Italian diplomat who took up his post last month,
will report progress to the UN Commission of Narcotic Drugs, which starts
its annual 10-day meeting in Vienna today.
The three agencies - the Division of Narcotic Drugs, the UN Fund for Drug
Abuse Control, and the International Narcotics Control Board - are being
merged into a single organisation called the UN International Drug Control
Programme.
The agencies employ about 150 people in Vienna and 50 in 15 offices around
the world. They implement and monitor treaties on legal drug production and
run intervention programmes to try to change the economic and cultural bases
of Third World countries producing opium and coca leaves.
Recent years have seen increasing emphasis on tackling the problem in the
marketplace by reducing demand among drug abusers through educational,
social, welfare and medical initiatives.
However, Mr Giacomelli acknowledged that the UN agencies have been 'parallel
institutions', not always in harmony, despite good work done.
Mr Giacomelli said the UN's estimate of the size of the illegal drugs
industry was between Dollars 300bn and Dollars 500bn. People tended to fix
on the higher figure, which he thought was reasonable.
'It is second only to the arms trade and is bigger than the oil trade. With
such amounts there is no limit to what you can achieve. You can buy or kill
judges and you can set a very sophisticated underground pharmaceuticals
industry,' he added.
'Against it, we have to operate within the framework of law or agreed
strategies and tactics, while the crime world has no such constraints. They
have no problems of sovereignty or borders.'
Mr Giacomelli said organised crime had 'globalised as much as any other
international industry.' This was why an attack on money laundering was at
the heart of the struggle.
'This is where the international community is worried. It is a very
significant amount of money and can influence the state of world finance. We
have to go to the point where there is a linkage between the criminal origin
of funds and the legitimate enterprise and then stop the criminal activity.'
The three UN agencies have a combined annual budget of Dollars 80m. Mr
Giacomelli believes that more will be available once he has proved to UN
member states that the new single organisation is giving better value for
money.
Italy is the biggest contributor, because its agency for co- operation and
development - which Mr Giacomelli set up in 1971 - recognised the importance
of fighting drug problems early on. Britain, the US, Germany and Sweden are
also among the UN's leading supporters.

FT  29 APR 91 / Brussels blocks Pounds 100m UK aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is withholding Pounds 100m in grants for British
coal mining communities until the UK government explains how it is using EC
regional aid.
This is the first time that Brussels has blocked transfers from its
structural funds, the EC's second largest budget after farm spending. The
funds, intended to boost development in backward and industrially declining
regions, were doubled to Ecu63bn (Pounds 45bn) for 1989-93, of which the UK
was allocated Ecu3.9bn.
The Pounds 100m, aimed at regenerating former mining areas under the EC's
Ecu300m Rechar programme, has been awaiting signature in Brussels since
January.
The UK, some of whose ministers have privately criticised the Commission's
administration of the structural funds as wasteful, has been singled out
because its disbursement of the aid has not been 'transparent'.
London questionsion's principle of 'additionality' - that EC funds should
supplement central or local government commitments to the projects selected.
Officials in Brussels say the aid 'goes into a Whitehall pot, which makes it
difficult for us to see that our money is getting to where it's aimed.' The
funding thereby 'loses its deliberately discriminatory effect', which is to
help poorer regions catch up with richer areas.
Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for regional policy and former Scottish
secretary last week met three UK ministers including Mr Peter Lilley, trade
and industry secretary, to seek a solution. Commission officials say his
questions were not answered but that the UK had 'agreed to produce the
factual information we asked for sometime ago.'
The British government contends that additionality does not apply because
the UK's allocation from the structural funds was not increased when they
were doubled in 1988, and there was no such requirement under the previous
regional aid system. However, the Commission complains that, first, the UK
does not supply 'base figures to which we can see our money being added,'
and second, that it uses EC aid to spread its own spending on the regions
more evenly.
'We do have some evidence from the user end that the money is not getting
through in its entirety ..that they even it out, keeping money spare for
other regions,' a senior Brussels official said.
The UK case sets a precedent for all member states, since there was no
explicit sanction for misuse of aid written in when the structural funds
were reformed in 1988.

FT  29 APR 91 / West German current account balance to show small deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The west German current account balance will show a small deficit both this
year and next and growth in the west will slip to 2.5 per cent this year,
according to the spring report of Germany's five leading economic institutes
published today, writes David Goodhart in Bonn.
The institutes expect average inflation in west Germany this year of 3.5 per
cent (touching 4 per cent at the end of the year) and 11 per cent in east
Germany (touching 15 per cent at the year's end). GNP in east Germany is
expected to fall by 17.5 per cent.
The report expresses cautious hopes of a construction-led turnaround in east
Germany in 1992. But by the end of this year 3.5m people will be without
work or on short-time work in the east. The institutes are critical of the
large wage increases in east Germany and propose that the Treuhand agency,
which owns most east German companies, should become involved in wage
bargaining.

FT  29 APR 91 / How Bonn got it wrong on the east German economy: A candid
commentary from a senior economics official who retires tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government deceived itself in failing last year to foresee the
depth of the economic crisis in east Germany, says Mr Otto Schlecht, state
secretary at the economic ministry.
In a frank admission from a Bonn insider of policy shortcomings over German
unity, Mr Schlecht said: 'We deceived ourselves about the size and depth of
the restructuring crisis.'
In particular, the government's much-broadcast comparison between the
hoped-for recovery in east Germany and the positive aftermath of the west
German currency reform in 1948 was 'wrong from top to bottom,' Mr Schlecht
conceded.
Mr Schlecht, Bonn's most senior civil servant in the economic policy field,
is retiring tomorrow after 18 years in the job. He revealed that he was
initially highly sceptical about Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister
who took over in January, but now backs the minister's more active line on
aiding the east German economy.
During the run-up to the united German elections last December, Mr Schlecht
said the government seized on optimistic forecasts that the east German
economy would recover relatively quickly. 'We gave prominence to the
positive elements, and forced the negative ones into the background. This
was because we wanted people to take heart (over economic prospects) - and
because there was an election campaign.'
'At the beginning, we somewhat underestimated the effect of the shock of
liberalising overnight a command economy which had been barred off from the
world for 40 years,' Mr Schlecht said.
On the outlook east of the Elbe, he said that, by the end of this year 'we
will have gone through the worst'. Next year would see recovery, but from a
far lower basis of economic activity than the government had previously
predicted.
Unemployment in east Germany would continue to rise, but not above 2m,
thanks to the policy of putting large numbers of effectively-unemployed
people on to short-time working, Mr Schlecht said.
Until a few months ago, the government, together with the country's leading
independent economic forecasters, were unanimous that an upturn in east
Germany would begin this summer.
Mr Schlecht praised the hard work and energy of Mr Mollemann who replaced
his luckless predecessor Mr Helmut Haussmann. Mr Mollemann has played a
leading role in bringing about increased public sector funding and
administrative support for the east, as well as a shift to more pragmatic
policies over property rights and privatisation.
Mr Schlecht, 65, will now head the Ludwig Erhard Foundation, the body
promoting the ideas of the German-style 'social market economy' at home and
abroad. He may also act as an economic adviser in the Soviet Union and for
other east European governments such as Hungary and Romania.

FT  29 APR 91 / The European Market: US lobs a cut-price spanner into
Europe's cosy soda ash market - The looming upheaval in production of a
major industrial chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON

<DATELINE>
   THE Pounds 700m a year European market in soda ash
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the world's main bulk chemicals - is entering a period of upheaval,
after 40 years during which the pattern of trade hardly changed.
The soda ash story illustrates both the continuity of the European chemicals
business and the forces of change now working on it. In the case of soda
ash, these include:
Low-cost US producers whose prices can undercut the European manufacturers
at current exchange rates;
The EC, which dealt the European companies a double blow late last year, by
fining them Ecu48m (Pounds 33.4m) for allegedly running a soda ash cartel
and by lifting an anti-dumping duty that had kept US producers out of
Europe;
The opening up of eastern Europe's huge soda ash market to western
manufacturers.
Solvay of Belgium has dominated the soda ash business since the 1860s when
Ernest Solvay founded the company to synthesise the material - used in glass
making and other industries - from cheap raw materials (salt and limestone).
During the late 19th century Solvay built a network of soda ash plants
across the continent from Russia to Spain, while licensing Brunner, Mond - a
predecessor of ICI - to use his process in the UK.
Today Solvay, Belgium's second largest company, makes about 4m tonnes a year
of soda ash in west European plants. Soda ash - currently selling for about
Dollars 200 per tonne - still represents 11 per cent of Solvay's BFr255bn
(Pounds 4.16bn) a year turnover. The company has long used soda ash as a
'cash cow' to help finance expansion into other fields.
ICI makes 1m tonnes a year of soda ash in the UK. Smaller European
producers, including Rhone-Poulenc of France, Akzo of the Netherlands and
BASF and Henkel of Germany, produce 1.5m tonnes a year.
The sales pattern established in the 19th century persists today. ICI has
more than 90 per cent of the UK and Irish soda ash markets and sells very
little on the continent. Solvay, conversely, has 70 per cent of the
continental market.
Solvay and ICI abandoned their formal market-sharing agreement in the 1960s
and insist that there is now no collusion between them. The EC competition
directorate disagrees and in December fined Solvay Ecu30m and ICI Ecu17m for
operating a cartel and offering illegal price rebates to lock in large
customers. In addition BASF was fined Ecu1m.
The companies are appealing against the fines. The rebates are normal
commercial practice, they say, and the trading patterns result from the
nature of soda ash, a bulky low-value chemical which is expensive to
transport and requires special supply facilities. Customers do not maintain
large stocks of soda ash - a glass manufacturer keeps less than a week's
worth on the premises - and they rely on the suppliers to keep the material
flowing steadily into the works.
For example Pilkington, the leading UK glass maker, has a very close working
relationship with ICI, which has supplied virtually all its soda ash for
many decades. ICI's soda ash factories in Cheshire are conveniently close to
Pilkington's glass works in St Helens on Merseyside.
Mr Olivier Montfort, manager of Solvay's soda ash business, says his company
recently offered to supply Pilkington in St Helens with Solvay soda ash at
the same price as it sells the material to Flachglas, Pilkington's German
subsidiary, with transport costs added. 'They could not accept it,' he says.
The great misfortune for the synthetic soda ash producers was the discovery
in the 1950s of vast deposits of a mineral called trona in Wyoming, USA.
Trona is a naturally occurring form of soda ash (sodium carbonate) and
represents a cheaper source of the material than the Solvay process. In 1986
the last Solvay plant in the US closed down after making heavy losses for
several years, leaving the US field clear to a group of six companies
selling natural soda ash.
The group operates an export cartel, American National Soda Ash Corporation
(Ansac), which has had great success selling US ash in Asia and South
America. Small quantities have come into Europe, particularly when the
dollar was very weak in the mid 1980s, but the EC anti-dumping duty of
Dollars 65 per tonne effectively shut out US imports.
After the EC lifted the duty last October, it told Ansac that it could not
operate as a cartel in Europe. That decision has somewhat delayed US
shipments to Europe, while the six individual companies make their own
export arrangements, but sources in the industry say that significant
amounts of American ash are beginning to reach UK and west European ports.
The US producers say they are aiming to win at least 5 per cent of the
European market. But they are acting cautiously, in response to an EC
warning that it would monitor their activities closely and re-impose the
anti-dumping levy immediately if there was any evidence of unfair
activities. Richard Bell, ICI's commercial manager for soda ash, says some
US material is reaching Europe at prices very close to dumping levels.
Mr Montfort says Solvay accepts that the Americans will win a slice of the
west European market. Some glassmakers near good harbours - for example in
the Rotterdam/Antwerp region - may take as much as 10 per cent of their soda
ash from the US, he says, although they will be reluctant to go beyond that
level and jeopardise the long-term security of their relationship with
Solvay.
Solvay plans to make up for the loss of market share in western Europe by
winning business in the east. The company is close to regaining control of
the Bernburg plant in eastern Germany, which was appropriated from Solvay in
1940. As soon negotiations with the Treuhand privatisation agency are
complete, Solvay will invest DM200m in Bernburg, which can produce 500,000
tonnes per year.
Meanwhile ICI says it has been approached by a number of east European
countries. 'We're looking at a variety of options,' said Mr Bob Collicut,
ICI soda ash manager. 'I think that soda ash is an industry that eastern
Europe might want to concentrate on, since it is not environmentally one of
the worst industrial activities and it is used in so many other basic
industries - particularly glass, detergents and chemicals.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO has warned that it may retaliate if Washington restricts Japanese
contractors' involvement in US government-funded projects, as a means to
open Japan's construction market.
A US announcement that sanctions would be imposed after 30 days, unless a
market-opening agreement were achieved, has angered Japanese officials, who
say the threat will hinder bilateral negotiations on the construction
market.
Tokyo officials were surprised by Washington's announcement, as they had
assumed US threats were a negotiating ploy and did not expect the
administration to set sanctions in motion.
Mr Misoji Sakamoto, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said the two countries
were nearing a conclusion in the construction talks - Washington's decision
was 'regrettable'. He said the unilateral action was in breach of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and might provoke retaliation by
Japan.
The US threats follow unsuccessful attempts to supersede a 1988
market-opening agreement which provided help for US companies in 14
designated public works projects, including a new airport near Osaka which
has been the site of trade disputes over the past year.
Washington wants the list of projects extended, claiming Japan's
construction market is still effectively closed. Tokyo has argued that the
first agreement was intended to provide experience for US companies and that
they should not continue to receive special assistance.
Behind the US action is the belief that Japanese construction companies
routinely organise cartels and rig bids, and that, without special
assistance, US companies will struggle to win contracts. Japanese officials
say the market is open and contracts are decided on merit.
Japan's Fair Trade Commission in the past two years has uncovered several
big construction cartels, including one for the Osaka airport project and
another which had rigged bids for contracts at US military bases in Japan.

<TEXT>
SENIOR US envoys met the embattled President Mengistu Haile Mariam of
Ethiopia at the weekend in an initiative aimed at preventing the country's
civil war engulfing the capital Addis Ababa.
Mr Rudy Boschwitz, an envoy of President George Bush, and three other
officials had extensive talks with Mr Mengistu and his government on an
Ethiopian parliamentary proposal for unlimited, open talks with all rebel
groups and a transitional government followed by a ceasefire. The meetings
followed a week of heavy fighting between government troops and rebels who
have advanced to within 65 miles of the capital.
One US official said the Ethiopian government had embarked on 'a major,
sincere undertaking. All the elements have come to the real fundamental
judgment that profound political concessions must be made, and that a
military solution is impossible. There are no limitations. Everything is up
for negotiation, even the formation of multi parties.'
A US official left Addis Ababa yesterday for Khartoum to meet the two
leaders of the main rebel groups, Mr Issayas Aferwerki of the secessionist
Eritrean People's Liberation Front and Mr Meless Zenawi of the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. The official will brief them on the
government's position and try to facilitate dialogue.
However, despite the backing of Washington and Moscow for the proposal and
the optimism of US officials, doubts remain over whether the rebels, lifted
by recent victories, can be made amenable.
EPRDF statements last week criticised the parliament for calling a national
mobilisation, and threatened to fight Mr Mengistu to the finish. Even so,
the rebels are anxious to avoid the huge civilian casualties and destruction
of infrastructure which would accompany a battle for the capital.
'It is in our interest to minimise the bloodshed and come to a peaceful
resolution,' Mr Asefa Mamo, EPRDF spokesman in London, said yesterday.
Mr Mengistu's apparent determination to remain in power, rather than
allowing a transitional government to be formed, continues to obstruct
peace. Rebel groups have built up much hostility to, and suspicion of, Mr
Mengistu and the clique which surrounds him.

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, Israeli prime minister, has rejected a US proposal for an
open-ended Middle East peace conference. This is likely to cause tension
between the two countries.
The US proposal was one of five points that Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state, and Mr David Levy, Israeli foreign minister, had agreed during talks
in Jerusalem on Friday.
Mr Baker's latest Middle East tour ended abruptly later that day when he
heard of his mother's death. He arrived in Israel after meeting leaders in
Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Mr Shamir insists that the regional peace conference, which would be
sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union, meet only once to lay the
groundwork for direct bilateral negotiations between Israel and individual
Arab states, and Israel and the Palestinians. The premier fears that, under
the conference's auspices, Israel might be forced to give up Arab
territories occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
'We are opposed to that because, if there are subsequent sessions of the
same meeting or conference, we'll never get to direct negotiations,' said Mr
Shamir.
As part of the agreement by Mr Baker and Mr Levy, the conference would
reconvene occasionally to hear progress reports, but only with the support
of every member, including Israel.
News of the agreement led to a furore at the weekend among some of the more
obdurate members of Mr Shamir's right-wing coalition, who threatened to
resign if Israel agreed to the open-ended peace conference.
Some of the key issues left unresolved at Mr Baker's abrupt departure from
Jerusalem are: what role the UN and the European Community would play in the
peace conference, and who would be in the Palestinian delegation to the
talks.
Following the weekly Israeli cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Levy said his
agreement with Mr Baker had been co-ordinated in advance with the prime
minister. Mr Levy insinuated that Mr Shamir had got 'cold feet'.
'We will continue to act to advance the peace process and whoever cries of
despair or gets cold feet cannot distort the picture - which is that Israel
is achieving the most important parameters from the diplomatic point of view
in a way that was not achieved in the past.'
Mr Shamir tried to play down differences with the US, Israel's closest ally:
'I do not think we are heading towards a crisis. These negotiations are
important, but I think it's too early to say that efforts in this direction
have been frustrated.'

PRESIDENT Roh Tae Woo of South Korea has sacked his home minister in an
attempt to defuse anger over the death of a student at the hands of riot
police.
Mr Kang Kyong Dae, a 20-year old economics student, died on Friday night
after being beaten by police during a demonstration against the arrest of a
student leader at Seoul's Myungji University.
This was the first death of a student in a clash with riot police since 1987
and will increase social tensions at a time when the annual wage-bargaining
and student protests are getting under way.
It prompted demonstrations in Seoul at the weekend, Riot police used tear
gas and water cannon to block a protest march towards central Seoul on
Saturday afternoon.
A spokesman for the ruling Democratic Liberal Party said that the government
'whole-heartedly apologises to the nation'. He said that Mr Ahn Eung Mo,
home minister, would be superseded by Mr Lee Sang Yeon.
However, opposition groups said that the government's response, and the
issue of arrest warrants for the four policemen believed responsible, was
not enough.

Dr Subramaniam Swamy, India's commerce minister, yesterday said 'we should
not over-react' to the US decision. The statement by Ms Carla Hills, US
trade representative, accompanying the announcement was 'conciliatory and
leaves the door open for negotiations'.
Dr Swamy's surprisingly mild reaction to a decision that could imperil
India's exports to its largest trading partner, at a time when its
balance-of-payments position is critical, is in marked contrast with the
condemnation of the decision from Indian business and officials.
The subdued comment could also be related to India's hope that the US and
other donor countries will give emergency assistance to the country to help
tide it over its current payments problems.

FT  29 APR 91 / US rethinking Moscow policy: Washington accepts that
approach to encouraging reform has failed
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration now accepts that its approach to encouraging
economic reform in the Soviet Union has failed and that new methods will
have to be adopted.
A senior official said the attempt to stimulate reform through the
International Monetary Fund-led study of last December 'did not work',
because President Mikhail Gorbachev had been unable or unwilling to grasp
the proposals for a movement to a market economy.
This reflects pessimism within the administration about the prospects both
for reform and for Mr Gorbachev's survival. US officials are beginning to
hedge their bets by talking about contacts with conservatives in the armed
forces and defence industries as well as with reformers, such as Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister. Mr Shevardnadze is due to
deliver an important address in Washington in 10 days.
US officials have not given up hope on the possibility of a union treaty
between Moscow and republics such as the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia
and the Russian federation by the end of the year. But even if this is
achieved, the question remains of whether a reform programme can be worked
out and implemented.
The administration has been forced to review its approach by the marked
deterioration in the Soviet economy in the last few months, and the
continuing power struggle.
The proposal in the December report for the Soviet Union to have associate
status with the IMF and the World Bank - to assist its integration into the
international financial community - has now been put on the 'back-burner',
according to Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs.
The main US priority is to sustain economic and political reform in eastern
and central Europe and to insulate those countries as far as possible from
the growing economic problems to their east. The US has pressed its allies
to be supportive of these countries.

FT  29 APR 91 / Democrats warned on banking reform
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, will this week attempt to save
as much as possible of his comprehensive banking reform legislation after
warning House Democratic leaders against pursuing their plan for a narrow
bill excluding changes in the structure of the industry.
Congressmen Henry Gonzalez and Frank Annunzio, Democratic chairmen of the
House banking committee and a key sub-committee, have introduced legislation
proposing recapitalising the financially strained bank insurance fund, new
bank accounting standards and tighter supervision of problem banks.
This would omit the Treasury's proposals for interstate branch banking and
for allowing bank holding companies to become involved in a wide range of
financial services.
Mr Brady has described as 'the height of folly' the suggestion that any
legislation this year should be restricted to recapitalising the fund. 'We
should reform the industry and fix the problem, not just feed it and fund
it.'
The issue of the scope of banking legislation will come to a head in this
week's talks aimed a producing a compromise.
Mr Brady argues that a majority of the House banking committee, including
the minority Republican caucus, joined by a number of Democrats, have
expressed support for the need for comprehensive bank reform, in contrast to
the views of their leaders. This view is also supported by all the banking
regulators, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in
spite of reservations on detailed features.
Senate banking committee members are more sympathetic to Mr Brady's
position.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): The trend spotters - Chart
Analysts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'OLD men in dirty white raincoats' was how a famous entrepreneur once
described chart analysts, or so the legend goes.
Exactly what the boffins of the financial markets had done to upset this
particular financier is not known. But they had probably used their curious
art to predict that one of his investments was on 'a downward trend.'
To those with little familiarity of chart or technical analysis, much of it
must seem like mumbo-jumbo. Strange lines drawn on charts reveals such
things as 'head and shoulder' formations. They also claim to do the
impossible: tell the future course of financial markets.
However, for those with an interest in financial markets, particularly
foreign exchange, the growth in influence of technical analysis during the
last five years has been too great to ignore.
One measure is the membership of the Society of Technical Analysts, which
with 650 members is the largest chartists' organisation in the world. STA
chairman Mr John Bream says that 10 years ago an STA 'teach-in' would
attract 15 to 20 people. Now it is 80-100.
The dynamic growth of the foreign exchange market during the last decade has
led to renewed interest in the all-important question of what determines a
particular currency's level.
Over a period of years, the economic fundamentals of a country are what
counts; for example, the declining competitiveness of American industry over
the past ten years has led to a long-term decline in the dollar.
The same has been true for sterling over an even greater time span.
Economists have developed a theory which attempts to determine a currency's
level based on economic fundamentals.
It is called purchasing power parity (PPP) and calculates a currency rate on
the basis of the different inflation levels prevailing in the two countries
concerned.
PPP is a useful tool for identifying trends over a number of years. However,
it is of more limited use in determining where a currency is likely to be
over a period of days or weeks. In fact, some chart analysts say that a
currency can be out of line with its PPP value for up to five years.
Undermining the importance of economic fundamentals on a short-term basis is
the size of the currency market. With more than Dollars 180bn changing hands
each day on the London market alone, and the world currency market 32 times
greater than world trade, currencies often bear little relationship to
underlying changes in the real economy, which by their very nature move at a
far slower rate.
Until the mid-1980s, corporate users of the foreign exchange market would
use PPP and other economic reports to analyse the market and estimate where
they were likely to move in the future. However, the experience was not
always a happy one. Many lost money on the basis of PPP predictions.
For an economist, if the currency failed to move in the direction predicted,
the underlying assumptions would have to be revised. However, chart analysts
can constantly revise their opinions.
It was this experience which triggered a greater interest in technical
analysis, particularly in broking houses which were advising the corporates.
Few of today's foreign exchange managers do not have a knowledge of the
trends which chart analysts have identified and the important points which
have to be breached to confirm that trend.
Essentially, chart analysis is a study of the balance of buyers and sellers
in a market and the sentiment which follows from that. When a price breaks a
certain level it is an indication that the balance between buyers and
sellers has changed. This determines the sentiment in the market - bullish,
bearish or neutral - which in turn will influence the way news items are
perceived.
So how do analysts apply this to their day-to-day work? Mr Michael Feeny of
Sumitomo Bank explains how he uses chart analysis in foreign exchange
dealing. 'The first thing I do is run off charts showing the movement of
different currencies over the past 48 hours, week and six months. I then
look at the charts and try to establish trends by drawing lines between
troughs and peaks.
'Once you have established a trend then you know whether a position you are
taking is going to be with or against the trend - which is important to be
aware of. The next thing is to look for consistent levels of support or
resistance to movement.
'When a price has stopped falling it can mean there are lot of buyers there.
If the currency succeeds in breaking through that support it means the
buyers have been satisfied and it may be set to fall sharply. And by
implication you expect it to fall to the next support level.'
Mr Feeny says that these technical factors account for virtually 100 per
cent of one day's trading movements. The only exception comes when there is
a dramatic news item, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Over a two week
basis, movement is still technical; after a month, its importance is
declining but still the best indicator of movement; after three months, it
is 50 per cent technical and 50 per cent economic fundamentals; over six
months, fundamentals have become more important; and by one year it is all
fundamentals.
There are also longer-term trends which are caused by economic changes and
can be determined by technical analysis. But as most companies are not
interested in two or three year currency positions, this tends to be used
less.
Many traders use a mixture of personal judgement and technical analysis to
determine their day-to-day market decisions. A September 1989 study by the
Centre for Economic Policy Research found that some chartists performed
extremely well compared to a range of alternative forecasting procedures,
but that they typically failed to predict turning points in the market.
The use of judgement along with technical analysis makes this method more of
an art than a science. This was shown up in the CEPR study, in which it
tantalisingly revealed that one chartist, who it called 'M', had
outperformed not only the alternative forecasting methods but also all the
other chartists. To this day, M's identity remains a mystery.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (13): Telerate prepares to do
battle with Reuters - Developments in dealing technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LISTEN to Mr Peter Taylor and you could be forgiven for thinking that war
had broken out. Telerate, whose European sales and marketing effort he
heads, 'are starting to surround Reuters'. The official outbreak of
hostilities comes in June, when an enhancement to Telerate's The Trading
Service (TTS) will 'do Reuters an awful lot of damage', according to Mr
Taylor.
Launched 18 months ago, TTS automates the 'spadework' in a foreign exchange
deal and ploughs data down to the back office, allowing managers to monitor
costs. It has not been a success, however.
TTS version two will offer 'the best of everything', promises Mr Taylor. It
will need to, if it is to convince those such as Mr Rob Lowey, senior
foreign exchange manager at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank in London, who were
unimpressed by TTS' debut.
'We installed (TTS) on an informal basis, running alongside Quotron &amp;
Reuters' Direct Dealing Monitor', recalls Mr Lowey (Quotron rivals Telerate
as a technology supplier).
The bank's aim was to pick a secondary system to run alongside Reuters. But
Telerate had incorporated a remarkable innovation into TTS. Screen-based
messages between dealers followed a set format. Intercontinental
pleasantries were a thing of the past with TTS, as dealers could not key in
greetings to colleagues in New York - the system dictated their words.
'You need comfort in a fast-moving market', says Mr Lowey, and his team did
not feel comforted by a product that took the words out of their mouths.
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank's London dealers rejected TTS after a three-month
trial. Telerate, which had sunk upwards of Dollars 60m into developing TTS
and its associated telecommunications support, were not paid.
Mr Taylor describes the upcoming improvements to TTS as 'multi-format
trading'. What this means is that dealers will break out of the fixed format
at the flick of a 'conversation button'. The new, as yet anonymous product,
will be promoted by what Mr Taylor promises will be 'incredibly aggressive
pricing'. Any institution installing more than 10 positions will get TTS at
one-third less than the price of Reuter's system.
Mr Taylor defends TTS with the observation that 3 per cent of foreign
exchange deals lead to some error or require further human intervention
before the deal can be completed. Erasing the messy notes between dealers
was supposed to wipe out these errors and save costs.
Reuters, however, are quietly confident. The company has endured years of
complaints about its effective monopoly of market data feeds. It argues that
its pricing policy is merely to keep in line with inflation. Critics counter
that Reuters contracts are pricy and almost impossible to terminate.
Subscription to Reuters is estimated at Pounds 14,000 per dealer per year.
Reuters' attachment to video feeds has also been a source of criticism.
Traditionally, subscribers to Reuters or Telerate bought the service in the
form of fixed pages of data. The arrival of digital feeds in the 1980s
delivered raw data that in-house computers can rearrange to suit the user's
needs. Technically literate dealers praise digital technology, but there
remains a substantial demand for simple video feeds. Prism, a colour video
switch introduced two years ago by Reuters, has sold well.
Phase 2 of Reuter's Dealing 2000, itself an enhancement to the traditional
Reuter's Monitor Dealing Service, is imminent. With Phase 2, dealers will
have electronic matching - inserting an order for a currency, amount and
price. The central computer will match bids and select the best deal;
automatic dealing, but on a strictly optional basis and from the one
information provider no dealer can afford to be without.
A Reuter's spokesman picks choice as a prime attribute of Dealing 2000 -
including the option to hold familiar conversations with foreign exchange
sparring partners on the other side of the globe. Reuters believe that this
is where Telerate's offensive foundered. Of TTS, the Reuters spokesman
observes that 'dealers wanted automation, (but) they didn't want to become
automatons'.
Like Telerate and its decision to incorporate the popular Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet in its products, Reuters has acknowledged the importance of
familiar PC software. Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet now has a formal link to
the Reuter's Money 2000 information feed.
California-based Quotron also recognises the popularity of the PC. Its FIX
Trader runs on a PC using a large Digital Equipment Vax machine as the
'engine'. Since its launch two years ago, FIX Trader has been sold to 90
banks, with between 10 and 20 more signing on every month.
'Our system lets you choose between free and fixed format. We have had the
benefit of learning from others' mistakes', says a Quotron spokeswoman.
What the banks have learned from recent history is to watch costs. Foreign
exchange dealers are expensive, and it helps to know which of them is making
money.
Dublin-based software house Kindle has been selling applications to major
banks since 1979. It recently polled 75 customers and sales prospects to
find out what they wanted from foreign exchange technology.
Ms Rosemary Bowe, a former foreign exchange spot dealer with the Bank of
Ireland who is now Kindle's senior banking consultant, explains that almost
all of the 75 banks came up with 'exactly the same requirement' - they
wanted to cost the dealers position by position. 'The main thing was to know
each position by the end of the day, and the profit and loss by the dealer',
she says.
This emphasis on costing is hardly surprising. But what preoccupies the
suppliers is how to keep up spending on technology when customers are
prepared to shed valuable staff. Kindle's answer was to buy in the Strategy
Treasury Online Risk Management System (Storm), a decision support system
for dealers, from a US company. Kindle decided that since 'we don't have the
money or the time to develop our own deal capture and processing system', it
made sense to buy in a product that had proved itself in the market.
Large information providers find it difficult to admit that an outside
program is what the customer wants. But the risks involved in following
internal convictions are obvious from the TTS fiasco. War produces fierce
propaganda, but it also causes casualties.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (14): Competition helps cut costs
 -Derivatives can be useful tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT Pounds 150m loss sustained by Allied-Lyons through its use of
derivative products in the foreign exchange market may have detered some
companies from investigating the benefits of such instruments.
But derivative products can be useful tools for both corporate treasurers
and fund managers faced with increasingly daunting levels of foreign
exchange risk. Competition among banks for a share of this lucrative market
has fuelled innovation and reduced costs.
The growth of business in overseas markets over the last decade has forced
company treasurers to pay greater attention to foreign exchange risk.
Currency risk management is no longer relevant only to exporters and
importers, since many companies now have overseas operations, and currency
volatility is no longer seen as an adequate excuse for tumbling profits.
Derivative products allow companies to fix costs and income flows in
advance, which is particularly valuable at a time when recession is biting
into margins.
European fund managers have generally been slow to get involved in
derivative products, often considering such instruments to be speculative.
However, as markets become more international they have been forced to take
more account of foreign exchange risk, as well as of the potential rewards
of picking currencies correctly.
While many investors include such considerations when they choose a bond or
equity market, more sophisticated investors use derivative products to
separate the currency component from the bond or equity market view they are
taking. For example, a fund manager who is bullish on the US dollar, but
thinks the US Treasury market has run out of steam, can be in overweight in
dollars, but underweight in dollar bonds. The overweight currency position
can be achieved by buying options.
There are two main markets for hedging foreign currency exposure: the
forward market, where companies buy or sell currencies forward and the
options market, where the holder can buy or sell a currency at a set rate.
Unlike futures contracts, options give the purchaser the right, rather than
the obligation to buy or sell. This means that a treasurer can use an option
as insurance against adverse changes, but leave it to expire if such
protection proves unnecessary.
The technology surrounding straightforward currency options - to buy or sell
a currency at a set rate - has become widely understood, and such options
are now considered to be 'commodity' products, for which high premiums can
no longer be charged.
In addition to these, new and hybrid structures are becoming more widely
used.
For example, the 'range forward' is a forward contract which allows a
company to set an upper and lower limit on an exchange rate. The structure
is legally structured as a forward contract, but is the technical equivalent
of buying a put and funding that position by selling a call option.
The advantage is that it allows a company, which thinks a currency is set to
rise but requires some downside protection, to keep some of the benefit if
the currency does improve (unlike an ordinary forward contract). At the same
time, banks do not charge an upfront premium premium (as they do for
options).
A 'participating forward' combines features of forward contracts and option,
but again there is no upfront premium.
There is a set floor, as for an option, but there is also some participation
in any gains - perhaps 50 per cent of the benefit is received by the
company, which the other 50 per cent is given up to the bank as,
effectively, the premium.
A number of banks have also been active in issuing currency warrants,which
are long-dated currency options. These warrants have often been sold to
retail investors, but there has also been some institutional participation
too. However, such warrants have mostly been expensively priced.
Another type of structure is the 'average-rate' option, which gives holders
the right to buy or sell an underlying market not at the average price over
the duration of the option.
Unlike the fixed-income market, foreign exchange derivatives business is are
dominated by the vast over-the-counter market, where volume is impossible to
measure. (Options to buy or sell an underlying market which are not listed
on an exchange are called over-the-counter, or OTC, options. They are often
tailored to suit specific needs and are not actively traded.)
In the US, however, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the International
Monetary Market in Chicago are both active in currency derivatives. The
Philadelphia exchange lists options in eight currencies, relative to the
dollar, the most actively traded of which is the D-Mark contract which
traded 41,000 contracts daily on average in March. The exchange is currently
waiting for Securities and Exchange Commission approval to list D-Mark/yen,
sterling/yen and sterling/D-Mark contracts.
The IMM lists six foreign currency futures contracts, and also options on
futures. The most actively traded contract is the D-Mark future which had an
average daily volume of nearly 40,000 during the first quarter of 1991. The
IMM will soon set a date to start trading six cross-rate contracts, for
which it has already received approval from the Commodities and Futures
Trading Commission.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange suspended all currency
contracts a year ago, blaming 'minimal activity, mainly due to the healthy
interbank market.'

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Polish zloty shows the way
 -The monetary changes in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVERTIBILITY of the eastern European currencies into foreign currencies
goes with economic reforms like a horse with a carriage: it serves little
useful purpose in isolation, but is essential if domestic reform is to be
pulled along.
As Brigitte Granville remarks in her study of currency convertibility in
Poland between 1957 and 1990, 'the real objective is not convertibility per
se, but the creation of a free environment for economic agents.'
Aiming at currency convertibility while maintaining the centrally planned
economy would be folly. If Leviathan is to set prices and quantities, it
cannot permit its citizens to undermine its plans via the arbitrage
opportunities of foreign commerce.
Once the decision to move towards a market economy has been taken, however,
a degree of currency convertibility is among the first steps, for three
reasons:
combined with liberalisation of commercial policy, it forces the
introduction of world prices into the domestic economy and curbs domestic
monopoly power;
it can help control inflation;
it encourages import of foreign capital, technology and management.
Of these, the first, which demands convertibility on current account, is
fundamental. For a small economy, (although, as the Soviet Union has
discovered, for larger economies too), a rational pattern of prices is the
prices at which it can trade. Only when those prices are the domestic prices
will a profit-seeking economy specialise efficiently. With international
competition imported via current account convertibility, domestic monopoly
power will also be limited.
Currency convertibility, again on current account, can also be an element in
economic stabilisation. A fixed exchange rate determines the domestic
nominal prices of internationally competitive goods at the levels set
abroad. In this way, the exchange rate becomes the 'anchor' for
stabilisation.
Without alternative anchors, particularly domestic monetary policy, the
exchange rate is an effective, if sometimes brutal, instrument of
disinflation. But domestic monetary policy must follow the lead of the
exchange rate, which normally requires the elimination of the budget deficit
as well.
Finally, convertibility, on capital as well as current account, is an
element in facilitating the required import of foreign capital and
technology. Not only must foreigners be able to repatriate interest, profits
and dividends, all of which relate to the current account of the balance of
payments, but they also need to purchase domestic assets with foreign
exchange and, in the end, convert it back again when wishing to repatriate
their capital.
Currency convertibility can be taken further, to embrace all capital and
current transactions for all holders of the currency. One argument for such
freedom is that otherwise there will be leakage and fraud.
Some would argue that freedom on capital account can facilitate external
stabilisation as well. But for economies as distorted and as inflation-prone
as those of eastern Europe, this must be regarded as doubtful. Indeed, in
those circumstances convertibility on capital account can be destabilising.
Fortunately, the experience of the advanced industrial countries suggests
that freedom on capital account is not a necessary condition for market-led
economic development.
That is the view of the government of Poland, the country which has taken
reform furthest (apart from the unique case of eastern Germany). It has not
embraced complete currency convertibility. But it has gone far in that
direction.
On January 1 1990, the zloty, then subject to hyper-inflation, was devalued
by 31.6 per cent and fixed at 9,500 zlotys per US dollar, where it has
remained ever since.
Domestic enterprises may buy and sell foreign exchange freely at that rate
for current purposes, other than for payment of interest, profits and
dividends. Residents can buy foreign exchange for current purposes (but not
to purchase assets abroad) through officially sanctioned foreign exchange
counters. The rate on the latter is, in theory, allowed to float freely; in
practice, the authorities have managed to keep the two rates close together
since January 1990.
Companies with foreign participation are also to enjoy convertibility on
both current and capital account, in order to repatriate 100 per cent of
profits after tax, salaries of foreign employees and sums due from the sale
or liquidation of the company or of equity holdings in the company.
How far do these policies go towards meeting the three objectives of
currency convertibility?
As well as eliminating virtually all quantitative restrictions on trade and
reducing tariffs to an average level of only 4 per cent, Poland has gone a
long way towards the successful import of global relative prices. That
success has been bolstered by the achievement of a trade surplus in
convertible currencies in 1990.
Poland has also made progress towards price stabilisation, largely because
the fixed exchange rate has been backed by a tight budget and monetary
policy. Nevertheless, inflation continues to be well above rates in Poland's
main trading partners, partly because the exchange rate was initially
over-devalued and partly because of the absence of a competitive response
from state enterprises.
From a monthly peak of 80 per cent in January 1990, inflation was brought
down to a trough of 1.8 per cent in August, but has since been running at an
annual rate of around 100 per cent. This sets a large question mark against
the success of stabilisation.
Finally, in spite of the incentives given for the import of private capital
and know-how, there has so far been little foreign investment. At the end of
1990, some Dollars 160m had been invested in the joint ventures then in
operation.
Currency convertibility is an essential component of the free convertibility
of money into goods, services and assets that is a market economy. The case
of Poland suggests that changes can be introduced rapidly if the government
is determined to move on all fronts. But it also suggests that sustaining
those changes will be difficult, just as reaping the full benefits will take
time.

given a long chain - Sterling has rarely seemed in danger of breaking its
bands
</HEADLINE>

STERLING'S years of living dangerously are over. Once the most volatile of
internationally-traded currencies, the government finally padlocked it to
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in October last
year. To allow for its propensity to respond to the tiniest of domestic and
international changes, the government gave sterling a long chain.
Apart from the peseta, it is the only currency in the system allowed to move
6 per cent up and down either side of a central rate. Sterling's central
rate was set at DM2.95 against the German currency, and over the last eight
months it has rarely seemed in serious danger of popping out of its bands.
That in itself sums up sterling's initial success in the ERM. It has been a
performance which the monetary authorities have professed themselves
generally 'comfortable' with.
It has, up to now, been a far cry from the economic consequences of joining
sketched out by Sir Alan Walters, once Mrs Thatcher's personal economic
adviser. In his book Sterling in Danger, he makes the point that pegging the
exchange rate would force Britain 'slavishly to follow that of the major
monetary power, whether the US or Germany'. But what has become known as the
'Walter's critique' has been largely discounted.
This was essentially that sterling, backed as it then was by 15 per cent
base rates, would zoom to the top of the currency grid as the peseta did.
Then the authorities would have to restrain it from appreciating beyond
agreed limits with base rate cuts, thereby unleashing another demand boom
and inflation.
Only last month has the pound's appreciation - it rose to second place in
the ERM - prompted speculation of rate cuts to restrain its further rise,
with reunification worries weakening the D-Mark. But central bank
intervention seems more likely to result from an over-strong pound.
Such a satisfactory position was difficult to foresee back in October last
year.
The monetary conditions at the time of 1990 entry were regarded as
inappropriate - a fact which renders considerable the achievement of Mr John
Major, then chancellor, to foist the move on a recalcitrant Mrs Thatcher.
Just before Mrs Thatcher was persuaded to agree in October, the all-items
index of retail prices was rising at an annual rate of 10.6 per cent.
Interest rates had been at 15 per cent for a year. The inflation conditions
in particular invited widespread accusations that the ERM move was political
engineering of the economy at the worst possible time.
The Bank said the Government's 'dilemma' was that while monetary growth,
output and real demand were falling, putting huge pressure on companies'
trading margins, wage settlements and inflation were still rising.
But Mr Major's gamble paid off. The Bank later acknowledged that joining
would reinforce the Government's anti-inflationary strategy, as companies
could no longer expect a lower exchange rate to validate their failure to
contain costs.
As it has turned out, inflation was on the way down as Mr Major had
maintained, and the UK heading for a recession as deep as the one in
1980-1981. With hindsight, the much-criticised base rate cut that
accompanied the move was more than justified by the speed with which the UK
went into recession.
Equally satisfying was the fact that the only limit sterling has come very
close to touching has been the lower one, in December last year - the
opposite of what Sir Alan argued would happen. The markets have provided
both a floor and a cap for sterling, keeping it trading comfortably within
its ERM bands. So comfortably, in fact, that rumours started circulating
just before the March Budget that the government was going to tighten to the
2 1/4 per cent narrow bands.
Since entry, sterling has steadily appreciated - even edging close to the
DM3 level - against a background of domestic recession. Unemployment is
rising by about 70-80,000 a month, while the current account is averaging
around Pounds 1bn a month as imports respond to weak domestic demand.
In reflection of falling economic activity, interest rates have been cut
four times, by just half a percentage point each time. They are now at 12
per cent and are expected to fall further by June.
This has not undermined sterling, however: the D-Mark has been weakened by
the perceived 'disastrous' consequences of German reunification; the dollar
is bouncing back from record lows - pulling sterling with it - as consumer
confidence has resurged at the ending of the Gulf war and hopes that the
recession will be as short and shallow as the Fed as predicted.
But although sterling is strong now, it faces hurdles ahead. The government
would clearly like to reduce interest rates further, to stimulate the
economy and win voters in the run-up to the general election. As Mr Norman
Lamont said in his Budget Speech, 'interest rates remain the essential
instrument of monetary policy, but now the overriding factor in setting them
is the need to meet the UK's ERM obligations'. This means the Bank cannot
cut interest rates unless the move is fully discounted in the markets.
What does the medium term then hold? A general election, for a start. If the
election is in June, the pound will hold an election risk - though a Tory
win should leave it higher than a Labour win or hung parliament.
Goldman Sachs, the US-owned investment house, says that the Tories retain
the credibility of having taken sterling into the ERM and would not be
likely to devalue; a hung parliament's uncertainty would depress the pound
while a Labour government would introduce market worries about devaluation
and spending, in spite of the trust inspired by the Scottish members of
Labour's front bench.
An October election would produce much the same result, while one left till
June 1992 would be likely to be held against a background of 4 per cent
inflation and 10 per cent interest rates.
With either a Tory or Labour win, 'the sterling/DM exchange rate's most
probable path is very stable for the next six months,' says Goldman Sachs.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): 'Big three' battle it out -
London, Tokyo and New York dominate in their time slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINANCIAL market which never closes, knows no national boundaries and is
beyond the control of governments; such is the popular image of the foreign
exchange market. But this is only half true.
It is also a market where a large proportion of the business is divided
between three large centres, each striving to expand their share of business
in the world's largest market.
London, Tokyo and New York together account for two-thirds of total foreign
exchange business. In the 24-hour market, these three dominate dealing in
their own eight-hour slot.
London is the major centre in the European time zone, Tokyo in the Asian and
Pacific basin and New York in North America. For the big three, it is
dominance in their own time zone which accounts for their success.
Nevertheless, there is competition between the big three and it is at its
most intense when the markets briefly overlap. The ranking of the three is
one of the hottest conversation topics in the market.
The last official survey was conducted in 1989 by the Bank for International
Settlements. It estimated a global net daily turnover of Dollars 640bn,
divided between the UK (daily turnover Dollars 187bn), US (Dollars 129bn)
and Japan (Dollars 115bn). The remaining Dollars 311bn divided between
another 11 centres, with Switzerland accounting for Dollars 57bn, Singapore
Dollars 55bn and Hong Kong Dollars 49bn, with the others lagging behind.
It is impossible to be precise about what has taken place since the 1989
survey, although some important trends can be identified.
Foreign exchange managers say that since the 1989 survey, London has
maintained or even increased its dominance in currency trading. But Tokyo
has caught up with (and possibly overtaken) New York as the second largest
centre and appears to be growing at a faster rate than London and New York.
'There is no doubt that London still remains the largest market for both
inter-bank and corporate currency business', says Mr Doug McGregor, senior
manager of corporate services at Barclays Bank.
According to Mr McGregor, Barclays' gross turnover in foreign exchange has
increased to a daily average in the fourth quarter of Dollars 19bn, compared
with Dollars 16bn at the time of the BIS survey.
This has taken place in spite of the dollar trading for much of the time in
a steady range against the major currencies. London, after all, has built
its reputation as the largest centre in which to trade dollars.
In spite of the relative stability of the dollar, total foreign exchange
turnover has not fallen. In fact, foreign exchange managers say it is still
increasing. This points to the dynamism of the currency market. In 1989,
nearly 90 per cent of deals were conducted in dollars.
Foreign exchange traders have responded to the relative stability of the
dollar by developing a range of different currency rates to deal in, notably
the D-Mark/yen, D-Mark/Swiss franc and D-Mark/sterling. There has also been
a growth of interest in the Canadian and Australian dollars.
The growth in European currency trading has also been helped by the lifting
of the remaining foreign exchange controls in France, Spain and (partly)
Italy.
London's ability to develop in this area has allowed it remain the largest
foreign exchange centre. According to Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank,
these cross rates can sometimes account for up 50 per cent of the day's
trading, which is an important change on 1989.
This has partly been at the expense of other European financial centres.
Increasingly, European central banks have to monitor the movements in the
London market. Currency dealers say some European central banks have become
frustrated at the lack of liquidity in their own national centres.
Their important interventions in the currency markets, required by
membership of the European Monetary System, are beginning to take place in
London. Today, a large part of the market in French francs, Swiss francs,
lire and pesetas is in London.
The main exception to this seems to be the yen/mark rate, which has grown in
interest and is probably now in top five most actively traded currency
rates. This would appear to be a truly global market, with turnover split
fairly evenly between London, New York and Tokyo, although Tokyo probably
has the edge.
However, the dollar remains the world's most important currency and
dominates the market. The dollar/mark rate is still the busiest exchange
rate, closely followed by dollar/yen. Dollar/sterling, dollar/Swiss franc
and yen/mark take third, fourth and fifth places.
The importance of dollar/yen and the growth of yen/mark has increased
Tokyo's importance. Although Japan's economy still has some way to go before
it overtakes the US, its funding of US deficits and growth in exporting has
given the Tokyo currency markets a tremendous boost.
The next BIS survey is likely to confirm New York's relegation to third
place. As currency traders know, New York is active during the morning while
Europe is open, but during the afternoon the market quietens, spreads widen
and rates become more volatile.
Foreign exchange managers believe New York continues to grow in size. The
problem is that the importance of Japanese financial institutions is
allowing Tokyo to grow faster, while London benefits from the interest in
European currencies. But New York lacks new growth areas which will allow it
to keep up with Tokyo.
New York's difficulties are compounded by weaknesses in the US financial
system. Corporate and banking customers are increasingly paying attention to
the credit rating of the banks they do their foreign exchange business with.
For a large company wanting to hedge its currency exposure one or two years
forward, this is becoming an important factor. It does not just affect the
New York market. Many US banks have large foreign exchange operations in
London, and dealers say there are dwindling number of players in the London
market willing to deal in large currency blocks.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (8): Currency in search of a role
 -Why the yen has yet to displace the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SETH SULKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE steady fall of the yen over the last three years seems to have come to
an end, but in spite of generally favourable market conditions, there does
not seem to be much hope for a rapid turnaround in the near future.
One of the biggest negative factors affecting the yen rate over recent years
has been the outflow of Japanese capital, requiring Japanese investors to
sell yen in order to obtain dollars and other currencies to make foreign
investments.
But the situation changed in 1990 as total Japanese indirect, or securities,
investment abroad plunged to Dollars 39.45bn, down from Dollars 113.67bn in
1989. More significantly, Japanese investors were huge net sellers of US
securities - to the tune of more than Dollars 16bn in 1990 - and more modest
net sellers in west Germany and Australia. The only country where Japan made
substantial net purchases was Luxembourg, and these were thought to be
mostly Euro-yen paper.
Excluding the Luxembourg investments, Japanese foreign securities investment
only totalled about Dollars 7bn in 1990 - little more than one-tenth of the
1989 figure. This was offset by a slight increase in Japanese direct foreign
investment to about Dollars 48bn in 1990, up from Dollars 44 bn in 1989, but
quarterly statistics show a steady decline throughout last year.
This change in the amount and nature of Japanese investment has led Nomura
Research Institute economist Mr Richard Koo to say 'the worst reason for yen
weakness is gone'.
Given the absence of heavy yen-selling pressure and the continued growth of
the Japanese economy, 'the biggest mystery is why the yen is still weak', Mr
Koo says.
With most Japanese foreign securities investment made in yen and a
substantial portion of the funds in other currencies raised outside Japan,
it is surprising that the yen has not benefitted in foreign exchange
markets, he says.
At a current rate of Y135 to the dollar, the yen is in the middle of its
three-year range. According to the Bank of Tokyo, the yen-dollar average was
Y128.13 in 1988, Y127.98 in 1989 and Y144.81 in 1990.
The yen was fairly stable for most of 1990 until Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
when surprisingly, it strengthened against the dollar. Since the end of
hostilities, the dollar has risen, which market players attribute to the
quick and decisive conclusion to the US-led war. The power shown by the US
and the perceived indecisiveness of Japan and Germany, which have the two
most significant currencies after the dollar, highlighted prospects for
economic recovery in the US and increased confidence in the dollar.
However, some economists say US recovery is by no means certain and the
Japanese economy generally looks much healthier. Further signs of a US
recession and steady Japanese growth could lift the yen somewhat, but few
look for a big move. The yen's range of Y135 to Y140 in recent weeks
represents an equilibrium level, many say.
While a combination of factors may have benefitted the Japanese authorities'
interests in halting the slide in the yen, Tokyo's desires to increase its
currency's international role have not made much progress.
Although the ministry of finance and Bank of Japan continue to liberalise
financial markets and the dollar's international role remains on the
decline, there has been little interest around the world in picking the yen
as a replacement. Japan's yen-dominated exports rose in 1990, but coming
after a decline in 1989, the trend has been mixed.
Bank of Tokyo director Mr Keikichi Honda says the minimal international
interest in the yen stems from the lack of a visible, consistent policy by
the Japanese government to promote the yen. Yen holdings are not attractive
to international investors and official authorities because of the lack of a
liquid short-term money market in Japan, he says.
'The absence of a yen TB (treasury bill) market is a real impediment', Mr
Honda says. 'TBs are like air and water; without a base, arbitrage
transactions are not as liquid as desired.'
While the US Treasury has a deliberate policy of fostering liquidity in its
debt markets, Japan's authorities are hesitant to issue government
securities without a specific funding need. The finance ministry finally
relented last year and issued treasury bills for liquidity purposes, but Mr
Honda says conflicts of interest throughout the bureaucracy prohibits an
overall consensus on the importance of promoting a short-term yen money
market. While the US Treasury has weekly bill auctions, Japan's finance
ministry still prefers to issue what it calls financing bills only when the
need arises.
A committee of government and private-sector experts attached to the
official Economic Planning Agency has been studying liberalisation and
internationalisation of finance, but the EPA is thought to lack the
influence needed to settle disputes between the Bank of Japan and the
finance ministry. Conflicts of interest among various finance ministry
bureaux, such as international finance budget, finance and tax, have also
made it more difficult to develop a larger money market in Japan.
The unattractiveness of the yen as an instrument of international trade is
shown by the almost negligible amount of yen-dominated trade by third
parties. The yen's share of world trade inched up to 4.3 per cent in 1989,
from 4.2 per cent in 1988, according to the Bank of Tokyo.
Over the next few months, the yen may be buffeted by domestic developments
in Japan. Prime minister Mr Toshiki Kaifu's term as president of ruling
Liberal Democratic party ends in October, and the expected political
manoeuvring could create uncertainty, although analysts see the impact of
this as being short-lived.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (7): Hit by costs of unity - The
D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYED throughout last year by the psychological and interest rate effects
of German unification, the D-Mark has suddenly started to wobble.
It is now over a year ago that domestic bond yields climbed nearly 2 per
cent (to the 9 per cent mark for ten-year paper), as investors, primarily
those abroad, sold heavily in anticipation of the vast, but then quite
unknown, cost of unification. The equity market suffered later in the year,
as eastern euphoria melted into sober assessments of how distant the
benefits and how immediate the costs would be.
During that time, the foreign exchange markets chose to ignore such
concerns, both as regards east Germany and with respect to events further
east, including in the Soviet Union - the latter typically having a strong,
if primarily psychological, effect on the currency's fortunes.
Since February, when the dollar touched a low of just under DM1.45, there
has been a rapid - some would say exaggerated - reversal in the relative
assessment of the economic prospects of the US and Germany on the foreign
exchanges.
While the end of the Gulf war toned up US consumer confidence markedly,
other more concrete factors, including a pronounced narrowing of the trade
deficit, have bolstered the dollar.
Meanwhile the D-Mark's softness - which must not, given most estimates of
purchasing power parity between the two currencies at over DM2 to the
dollar, be exaggerated - appears to be more than the mirror image of the
dollar's current strength. The D-Mark has weakened considerably within the
EMS since earlier in the year, when talk was of realignment strains because
of its buoyancy. It has also slipped noticeably against the yen.
What has happened is delineated on one level in the political headlines, as
the 'unity chancellor', discredited by his reversal of policy on taxes, is
now charged with having seriously underestimated the scope of the task of
bringing east Germany to its feet.
Returning to the new Lander at the beginning of April for the first time
since the federal elections in December, Mr Helmut Kohl was bombarded not
with cheers but with eggs for his inability to bring last year's fulsome
promises true. In spite of transfers of around DM100bn from west to east
this year, sharply rising unemployment and falling living standards provoke
social unrest, and the point at which the east German economy is expected to
turn the corner, if anything, recedes.
For the Bundesbank, unification has represented a continual struggle to
emerge with its prized political independence untarnished. At present it is
not winning the battle as comfortably as it (or foreign D-Mark investors)
would like. From the point at which the Bonn government imposed the terms of
currency union with the east - in the highly generous conversion recently
dubbed 'a disaster' by Bundesbank president Mr Karl Otto Pohl - the central
bank has had to fight hard to preserve its formidable reputation.
Most recently, the tussle between Frankfurt and Bonn over the composition of
the post-unification Bundesbank - which must be resolved by October - has
left markets wondering whether Mr Pohl's keeness to win political acceptance
of a slimmed down policy-making council, with considerably less power to the
Lander, may not create indirect strains on current policy-making.
More obviously, the levers of monetary control are far more difficult to
operate in the enlarged Germany. Inflation, still only 2.5 per cent in
March, is set to increase, partly as a result of the hefty tax surcharge
coming into effect from July. Moreover, the current wage round is proving
more acrimonious than expected - not helped by the imminent tax increases -
with average settlements likely to be in the 7 per cent range, representing
almost a doubling of unit labour costs compared with last year. A weaker
currency would also have an additional inflationary effect, although it is
too early for the increased costs to have fed through in the monthly price
numbers.
Another factor affecting the foreign exchange market's perception of the
D-Mark is the speed with which the pan-German economy has slipped into
current account deficit (in January and February) after years of west German
surpluses dating back to the early 1980s. The demand surge prompted by
unification has sucked in imports, while many of Germany's traditional
exporters have found major overseas markets weak or recession-bound.
The current account surplus (DM104bn in 1989 and DM71bn last year for west
Germany) may be in deficit in 1991 across the united country. While this
reallocation of capital from abroad to the domestic market is precisely what
is required to effect the task in hand, the spectre of a current account
deficit tends to spook currency markets.
Finally, the record public sector borrowing requirement - officially DM150bn
this year - is taken as a further symptom of the economy's changed nature.
Even with the tax increases, some investors fear that official targets could
be exceeded, and the Bonn government is besieged by criticism, from its
central bank as well as elsewhere, over its inability to cut public
expenditure in the west.
Economists suggest one reason why the Bundesbank, having nudged official
rates up by half a percentage point at the beginning of this year, has so
far resisted responding to the D-Mark's slippage by a further tightening. As
the risk premium of holding D-Marks is seen to increase, the authorities can
fall into the trap of initiating a defensive move that merely keeps the
D-Mark constant - with a much heftier move being necessary to restore a
previous rate. Unlike in February, where the industrialised nations were
prepared to intervene in support of the dollar, there is no such consensus
for the reverse action.
One by-product of Germany's domestic problems has been a reduction in the
influence of the D-Mark within the EMS. At the turn of the year, the
strength of the currency was causing tension within the system, and the rate
rise at the beginning of February unleashed a storm of international protest
at what was seen to be an unneighbourly move given the opposite trend to
lower interest rates elsewhere.
In spite of that move, however, countries including Spain and Britain have
been able to continue lowering their official rates as the D-mark has
slipped for reasons other than those connected with pure interest rate
differentials. If Germany sees that as undesirable, its neighbours on the
whole do not.
In sum, the foreign exchange's preoccupation with the mounting burdens of
unification - ignoring both the continued strong growth in the western part
of the economy and the undiminished long-term prospects - are no more
logical than last year's gravity defying optimism. The mood can swing as
quickly again.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (6): Dollar sent on a
rollercoaster ride - Analysts feel the worst of the slump is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SAVED from falling too low by the world's central banks in February, only to
be stopped from rising too high by the same central banks four weeks later,
the dollar has been on a giddy rollercoaster ride over the past few months.
On February 11, the dollar hit a new all-time low against the D-Mark of
DM1.44. Seven weeks later it was up at DM1.70, its highest level for eight
months. It has hovered there ever since.
In that short burst - the strongest movement in the dollar since 1985 -
foreign investors bought the dollar for a whole host of reasons.
Financial markets expect the US economy to pull out of recession by
mid-year. In spite of rising unemployment and poor corporate profits, most
analysts feel that the worst of the slump is over, that consumer confidence
will rebound quickly after victory in the Gulf war, and that recovery is
around the corner.
This helped persuade overseas investors that dollar assets were a good buy.
Not only were they cheap, because of low US interest rates, but big gains in
US equity prices attracted a lot of new foreign money into the country.
Concern about political and economic chaos in the Soviet Union and its
former satellites, and the effect this has on European economic interests in
the region also favoured the dollar.
In Germany, the tensions of reunification - apparent in open discord between
government and Bundesbank, and in unrest among east Germans - turned
international investors away from the D-Mark towards the dollar.
Interest rate differentials, which have worked against the dollar for almost
a year, are beginning to swing the other way. The rapid cuts in US interest
rates, engineered by a Federal Reserve anxious to bring the economy out of
its dive as quickly as possible, appear to have run their course.
The spectre of inflation continues to hover over the US economy, and with
the Fed divided over the wisdom of further rate cuts, analysts expect US
borrowing costs to remain steady over the medium-term.
At the same time, the consensus among analysts is that as economic growth in
Germany and Japan slows, interest rates in those two countries will come
down, or at least go no higher. This would narrow the differential between
rates on US and European/Japanese assets, making US assets and dollars more
attractive. Inflation patterns should also work in the dollar's favour, with
medium-term trends pointing to lower US and higher German and Japanese
inflation. Real yield differentials, therefore, would also narrow.
Then there is the issue of purchasing power parity (PPP) and whether the
dollar is a cheap currency.
There is a rare unanimity among currency analysts on the dollar's PPP. The
theory of PPP is that the same basket of goods in two different countries
should have the same relative value, whichever currency is used to price the
basket. Based upon current valuations, the dollar looks cheap in terms of
its PPP. Although estimates differ, most analysts believe the true value of
the dollar is close to DM2 and Y200, the rate which would make a basket of
goods in the US cost the same as in Germany and Japan. This means the dollar
has room to appreciate another 20 per cent against the D-Mark, and nearly 50
per cent against the Yen, before it is correctly valued.
The positive scenario for the dollar is, of course, no guarantee that the
currency will perform according to analysts' predictions.
The US economy could take far longer to come out of recession, with
employment and personal income growth - two key determinants of economic
growth - likely to remain weak. US interest rates, therefore, might have to
come down several more times for both economic and political reasons (1992
is presidential election year) while inflation concerns take a back seat.
Interest rates abroad may also rise. Both Germany and Japan are sensitive to
the inflationary threat and any sign of price pressures could lead to
tighter monetary policy.
Disagreement among the Group of Seven nations over exchange rate policy
could also damage the dollar. Although central bank intervention to aid the
currency when it dropped to DM1.44 in February was relatively successful,
subsequent attempts to stall its rise around the DM. 165 level proved less
effective.
Mr Joe Petri, managing director of government securities and foreign
exchange at Merrill Lynch in New York, explains why: 'The market was not so
sure that the US authorities were as uncomfortable with the dollar's rise as
the European central banks.'
The insouciance of the US monetary authorities in late March when the dollar
was roaring ahead made it clear that this was not an entirely unwelcome
development. Although an appreciating dollar makes US goods less competitive
abroad - and this matters to those who expect export growth to lead the
economy out of recession - it also keeps a lid on inflation, by making
imported goods cheaper.
Similarly, the central banks of Europe and Japan can hardly have been
overjoyed at the prospect of a stronger dollar, because of the negative
inflationary implications for their own economies. Germany in particular is
keen to prevent imported inflation from adding to an already worrying upward
trend in domestic prices.
The stronger dollar does, however, allow room for lower European interest
rates. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, must have privately welcomed
the opportunity the higher dollar gave him to cut credit costs in the UK
without worrying too much about the consequences for domestic inflation and
sterling.
There has been one politically embarrassing by-product of the recent rise in
the dollar; the fuss over the Dollars 51bn pledged by friendly foreign
powers to the US to help cover the cost of the Gulf war. Germany has already
said it would pay more Deutschemarks than it originally promised to make up
for the D-Mark's depreciation against the dollar. Japan, however, has so far
refused to pay any more than the initial pledge of Dollars 9bn, to the fury
of Americans everywhere.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (5): The search for common ground
 -Differences remain over economic and monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE end of this year, if all goes to plan, Europe should reach a broad
consensus on how to proceed towards the final phase of economic and monetary
union (Emu) around the end of the century.
But to reach this common view, officials from the 12 European Community
countries will have to close some large gaps in thinking on what the union
should eventually look like and the pace at which it is to be achieved.
In the third and final stage of Emu, according to the plans of much of
Europe, responsibility for pan-European monetary policy is due to be handled
by a single European central bank which would be independent of governments.
It would also administer a new, single currency.
In this form, Emu would fit in with the increased integration over the past
20 years of European commerce and industry. Advocates say it would follow on
logically from the idea of making Europe a single market place - the goal of
the EC's 1992 programme to eliminate trade barriers.
But beyond the rhetoric, a number of problems remain. The forum in which
these will be discussed is the EC's intergovernmental conference on Emu,
which started in Rome in December last year and which will continue
throughout 1991 in the shape of meetings roughly every two weeks between EC
officials. The main disagreements concern:
The detailed timetable for Emu. All 12 EC countries, except Britain, accept
the idea of a European central bank linked to existing national central
banks - which would also be politically independent and operate as branch
offices of the main central bank.
Some countries, led by France, want the new bank to be set up in the
so-called stage two of Emu, starting in 1994, though Germany favours waiting
until 1997. That would allow time for the economies of individual countries
to come closer together to the point when an all-embracing monetary policy
for the whole of Europe made sense. France fears, however, that much of the
momentum towards Emu could be lost if plans for a central bank are delayed.
The idea of a two-speed Europe. An argument which has gained much ground
over the past year is that those countries whose economic performances,
especially in the area of inflation, are reasonably similar could go ahead
almost immediately with a form of Emu, leaving other nations on the
periphery.
This point of view, expressed most forcibly by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president
of the German Bundesbank, would put Germany, France, the Benelux countries
and, possibly, Denmark in the 'inner core'. Britain, Spain, Greece,
Portugal, Eire and Italy would be on the outside.
Though many argue that this arrangement makes a great deal of sense, it has
been attacked on political grounds by the nations which under such a system
would see themselves as 'second class citizens', excluded from the benefits
of inner-core Emu membership.
The role of the Ecu. As an alternative to the notion of setting up a
European central bank in stage two, Britain has proposed a European Monetary
Fund (EMF), whose main task would be to administer a new, common European
currency, the hard Ecu. This would differ from the existing basket Ecu,
based on the main European currencies.
The UK's EMF/hard Ecu plan would provide Europe with experience of using a
common currency, in parallel with existing currencies, prior to any decision
about moving to a single financial unit. Britain has indicated that the EMF
could ultimately evolve into the European central bank envisaged by the
other EC nations.
Although much of the rest of Europe has its doubts about the practicality of
the hard Ecu, some countries, among them Spain, have appreciated the
usefulness of the UK proposals in providing a focal point for debate about
the speed with which Emu should come about. Germany, meanwhile, has come out
strongly against the hard Ecu and the EMF, though it favours 'hardening' the
existing Ecu to encourage the currency's use, perhaps by freezing its
composition.
Fiscal policy. Some believe that the idea of a pan-European central bank to
handle monetary policy needs to be accompanied by a centralised approach
throughout Europe towards tax treatment and intergovernmental transfers.
One fear is that, without a set of arrangements for channelling large
amounts of government cash from the richer parts of Europe to the poorer
regions, the single monetary bloc could lead to a rapid division between
Europe's 'haves' and 'have nots'.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago,
says: 'I don't think that people in Europe have realised the extent of the
the transfers which might be needed under Emu to avoid social disruption.'
He adds that once Emu has taken place, parts of countries such as Greece and
Spain with low incomes could gain from this kind of arrangement. It could be
modelled on the system in Canada, under which the relatively poor province
of Newfoundland receives large payments from central government funds.
Some see a cooling in enthusiasm for the concept of Emu, partly a result of
the economic slowdown that has affected Britain, France and Italy in
particular over the past year. There is also more of a mood of caution -
sparked largely by the problems which have emerged this year in bringing
together eastern and western Germany - about moving too quickly to an
economic union for the continent as a whole.
However, Mr Wolfgang Reinicke, a political economist at the Brookings
Institution in Washington, says that the pace of European integration at a
business level will push the discussion about economic union and make this
virtually unavoidable.
'Europe has almost reached the point of no return (in moving towards Emu),'
he says. 'But the way this is achieved may be less clear-cut than people
initially thought.'

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Unique status in the market
 -The Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European currency unit occupies a unique position in the foreign
exchange market, having neither legal tender status nor any certainty over
its future composition - let alone its future value. Yet nearly every major
bank has traders buying and selling the currency. The last official volume
figures relate to April 1989, when the Bank of England recorded an average
daily turnover of Dollars 4bn equivalent.
Volume of trading has now grown well beyond this level but remains below
that of the major currencies - perhaps one-tenth the volume of dollar or yen
trading, according to those active in the market.
Ecu bonds have become a favourite tool for borrowers and investors. Last
year, the value of Ecu bonds issued reached Ecu14bn (Dollars 17.5bn), making
the Ecu the fourth most popular currency after the dollar, sterling and yen.
This year the growth of Ecu bond issuance has been still more spectacular.
In the first quarter alone Dollars 17bn equivalent of new paper was issued,
boosted by large benchmark issues from sovereign borrowers, notably the UK,
Belgian and Italian governments.
Investors wanting to buy these bonds have to buy Ecus on the foreign
exchange market, often in exchange for non-Ecu currencies such as dollars or
yen. Equally, Ecus received as coupon payments are often sold in the market.
The basket nature of the Ecu might be expected to moderate its volatility
against currencies outside the European monetary system. To an extent, the
Ecu is indeed more stable than the underlying national currencies. However,
the D-Mark alone accounts for around 30 per cent of the Ecu basket.
Currencies informally linked to within 0.5 per cent of the D-Mark (the Dutch
guilder and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs) bring the total 'D-Mark bloc'
weighting up to 47 per cent of the Ecu basket.
For example, the D-Mark's rapid depreciation against the dollar during
February and March was mirrored in the Ecu. From Ecu0.70 in mid-February,
the dollar was valued at Ecu0.83 by the end of March.
Users of the Ecu also monitor its market value against a theoretical value.
Until recently the Ecu rarely drifted far from this theoretical value,
calculated by taking proportionate amounts of each of the European
currencies which make up the Ecu basket.
This was because many banks employed arbitrage traders ready to exploit
brief differences which open up between the theoretical value of the Ecu and
its quoted value on the foreign exchange markets.
However, the arbitrage trading relies on the assumption that the actual and
theoretical values of the Ecu will eventually converge. This is no longer
something that many firms are willing to take for granted.
Many believe that the Ecu basket will soon be reweighted, changing the Ecu's
composition and value. The Ecu's market valuation therefore reflects both
the current theoretical value and a range of possible future theoretical
values.
Recent expectations of a realignment within the Ecu currencies have tended
to push the Ecu's market value higher than its theoretical value  - as much
as 1 per cent higher.
This is a state of affairs which may shape the future development of the
Ecu. For example, some proposals for the future structure of the single
European currency have centred on a regular annual reweighting of the
currencies within the Ecu basket. On recent evidence this would leave the
foreign exchange market embroiled in a constant guessing game with the
proposed European central bank.
However, the popularity of the currency is clear from the performance of
Ecu-denominated financial instruments.
Just as the Ecu itself is overvalued against theoretical models, so Ecu
bonds are far more expensive than theoretical calculations suggest they
should be. For example, 10-year maturity large liquid Ecu bond issues are
currently yielding around 60 basis points less than the theoretical Ecu
yield curve - calculated from the national bond markets which make up the
Ecu basket.
Analysts explain the phenomena in terms of the political momentum towards
economic and monetary union. For the first time, it is argued, investors
seriously believe that the Ecu will become a single European currency.
However, the value of the Ecu, at least as expressed through the
international bond market, remains volatile. Ecu bond yields tend to rise
sharply when the political or economic outlook is clouded. For example, the
extent of economic dislocation in eastern Germany has push Ecu bond prices
down from the peak of the market in early February.
Volatility may be lessened with the advent of Ecu bond futures contracts,
which give investors the chance to hedge their positions.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange launched its contract
earlier this year. The Paris future exchange, the Matif, has had a contract
trading since October last year.
The thriving bond market and the growing foreign exchange market in Ecu have
led to the development of an interbank netting and settlement network -
another example of a developing financial infrastructure.
The clearing system was set up in 1986 and now has 45 participating banks.
Interbank payments are first netted through the SWIFT system and then
cleared through a special unit of the Bank for International Settlements in
Basle.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Trends point to increased
concentration of capacity - Growth of overall business has slowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange traders are supposed to thrive on volatility and crisis.
But the gyrations of the dollar, D-Mark and pound so far this year have done
little to dim the impression that the foreign exchange market is undergoing
considerable structural change.
According to Swiss Bank Corporation, last year was probably the most
difficult year for foreign exchange market operators in 10 years. Over the
past two years or so, there has been a steady trickle of smaller banks and
foreign branches of banks leaving the market.
Traders and analysts report that the growth of overall business has slowed.
When the industrial world's leading central banks next carry out a survey of
foreign exchange activity it is unlikely to confirm the trend reported by
the Bank for International Settlements in February last year.
The BIS survey, which is still the most up-to-date overview of global
foreign exchange activity, indicated that global turnover in the market more
than doubled to a staggering Dollars 650bn a day in the three years to April
1989.
It is likely that the market is still growing. But at the same time, the big
participants such as Citibank of the US, Barclays Bank of Britain, France's
Credit Lyonnais and the large German and Swiss banks are increasing their
business at a faster rate than the market, lifting their market share.
This gradual shift of power to the big battalions is largely a reflection of
two interwoven trends.
Since 1987, there has been a decline in overall exchange rate volatility,
which has limited business volume and trading opportunities.
More recently, banks have become far more cautious and loss averse.
In marked contrast with the 1970s and early 1980s, the major industrialised
countries now care about their exchange rates. Although domestic economic
policies differ, all countries share a determination to defeat inflation.
Moreover, the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and an increasing
number of smaller developed nations are prepared to intervene in the market
to influence exchange rates. Although intervention is not always successful
in the face of fundamental currency movements, it is a factor that markets
cannot afford to ignore. The rapid switch of official attitudes towards the
dollar earlier this year highlights this constraint on foreign exchange
market activity.
In mid-February, the G7 was intervening to support the dollar as it fell to
new all time lows against the D-Mark. Four weeks later, the Bundesbank, the
US Federal Reserve and a host of smaller central banks were acting to
restrain the dollar's rise.
Such factors have taken much of the fizz out of a market that once seemed to
exemplify speculative excess. According to Mr Nick Douch, senior manager for
corporate services at Barclays Bank's global treasury department in London,
'the aim for most participants these days is to maximise the number of days
in which they can make a profit' rather than aim for outright speculative
gains.
Alongside external constraints are pressures for caution inside banks that
largely reflect the spread of the 'Basle mentality' in international
banking. Since July 1988, when the central bankers of the world's leading
industrial countries agreed on minimum capital adequacy ratios for
international banks, awareness of credit and counterparty risk has grown.
Recession in the English-speaking world, with its trail of bad debts and the
downgrading of banks by rating agencies, has greatly increased the premium
placed on prudence in international banking. The effect on the foreign
exchange market has been a reduction in the number of banks that are
attractive business partners, making liquidity tighter.
These conditions have already deterred some banks from acting as market
makers and made life harder for the big banks still quoting rates in a wide
variety of currencies.
A market maker must be prepared deal both with an increasing number of
counterparties seeking prices and cope with large blocks of currency that
are suddenly put up for sale. One result of the declining liquidity in the
market has been a sharp increase in day-to-day exchange rate volatility,
which poses a far more difficult management task than medium term
volatility.
Bankers cite how Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, has reportedly
switched as much as Dollars 2bn at a time from one currency to another in
the course of aggressive management of its foreign currency reserves. A
handful of US fund managers and Japanese corporations are also major movers
of the market. In these circumstances, the shrinkage in the number of market
making banks has created problems for some when they need to get out of
positions.
However, there is a positive side to the concentration of market making
capacity in fewer hands.
The big operators have superior information. 'Unless you are a big bank, you
have no idea what is happening to currencies,' one trader observed recently.
Mr Chris Deuters, Citibank's head of foreign exchange and derivatives in
Europe agrees: 'If you don't have access to the end user, your view of the
market will be severely limited', he says.
The vital importance of information in a market where trading decisions are
taken in a split second cannot be over-emphasised. It helps explain why
today's large foreign exchange players are more than just interbank trading
operations, which thrived in the volatile trading conditions of the 1970s
and early 1980s.
Those banks with an extensive customer franchise were in a far better
position to handle the dollar's sharp rise in the six weeks following the
Gulf war because they had an early insight into activity of the
international institutions that moved long-term portfolio capital into the
US at the time.
According to Barclay's Mr Nick Douch, looking after the customer is now a
'number one priority' for foreign exchange departments. There has been an
'enormous shift of emphasis' towards customer based business in the last 2
to 2 1/2 years, he says.
At Citibank's London offices, Mr Julian Simmonds, the head of foreign
exchange sales and trading agrees. 'Any bank can have a marvellously
successful year, but very few have growing but stable profits. For that you
need the customer franchise', he says.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Qualified success of ERM -
Europe's exchange rate mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the more successful European innovations of the last 15 years is the
exchange rate mechanism, set up in 1979 as a way of regulating the main west
European currencies. Keeping the currencies within agreed limits against
each other, it was argued, would encourage monetary stability, so reducing
inflationary pressures. The mechanism would also aid commerce and industry
by minimising exchange rate fluctuations.
Twelve years on, the general consensus is that the system has achieved most
of its aims. 'The ERM has been remarkably successful', says Mr Jim O'Neill,
head of financial markets research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London.
In the case of the pound, which joined the system only last October, that
statement needs to be qualified. Economists are divided over the extent to
which the external discipline of the ERM will improve UK economic
performance - particularly in inflation, where Britain's record over the
past 20 years has been far from satisfactory.
All but two of the 12 European Community member states (the exceptions are
Greece and Portugal) participate in the mechanism. That means the ERM
embraces nine currencies - the D-Mark, the French franc, the peseta, the
guilder, the Belgian/Luxembourg franc, the Danish krone, the punt and the
pound.
The pound, the last currency to join the system, and the peseta are allowed
to fluctuate against the others by up to 6 per cent about an agreed central
rate: for the other currencies, the permitted margin is 2.25 per cent.
In the early days of the system, realignments tocentral ERM rates were
relatively frequent. Over recent years, however, the system has been more
stable; the last full-scale realignment was in 1987.
Co-ordination is left largely to officials at individual nations' central
banks. These people talk to each other roughly three times a day.
Their discussions will cover day-to-day issues such as the need for small
changes in interest rates. Another topic is the degree to which countries
may need to intervene in financial markets to influence the value of
specific currencies by buying or selling.
Such operations are put in the hands of specialist foreign exchange
departments of each central bank. Given the size of the world foreign
exchange market, there is no way that the outside world can find out about
specific dealings in currencies by the banks - unless these bodies broadcast
their intentions with a view to influencing the market.
Highly public currency interventions by the ERM nations' central banks have
been a feature of the first few months of this year, as the individual
countries have sought to influence the value of the dollar.
More far-reaching decisions about the workings of the ERM, such as
significant realignments, are left to meetings of EC finance ministers and
central bank governors.
One of the chief virtues of the ERM, according to itsadmirers, concerns the
way individual currencies within the mechanism are pegged to the
low-inflation characteristics of the D-Mark, the mechanism's most powerful
member.
That forces the other ERM nations to adopt strict monetary policies that
should lead them to levels of price stability similar to Germany's. The ERM
medicine has certainly worked over the past decade for the Netherlands,
Belgium and France, which today can boast inflation records not far removed
from Germany's.
UK government ministers, meanwhile, are hoping the same will happen over the
next few years for Britain, although public opinion has yet to be won overto
the the ERM.
A group of monetarist economists, led by Sir Alan Walters, the former
economic adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, is waging guerrilla war against
Britain's membership of ERM.
The group wrote to The Times in February saying that Britain's membership of
the ERM meant it had to institute inappropriately high interest rates which
could push the country into deep recession.
For all the general interest by the ERM nations in wanting the D-Mark to
stay strong so as to reinforce the disciplinary impact of the system, some
signs have emerged in recent weeks of a certain satisfaction in the rest of
Europe about the weakness in the D-Mark.
The D-Mark has lost ground dramatically, mainly against the dollar but also
against a number of European currencies, as fears gripped markets about the
possibly negative consequences for the global economy of German unity.
The D-Mark's fall from grace may lead to a slackening, at least for the time
being, in the way the ERM reinforces anti-inflationary characteristics
aspects among the other countries.
But the monetary authorities in France and Britain have had good cause to
smile, on the grounds that the weakness in the currency has given them far
more scope within the system to cut interest rates and so restore growth.
One problem for many of the ERM nations in recent months has concerned the
Spanish peseta, the strongest currency in the grid. The attraction to
international investors of the currency has correspondingly weakened demand
for some of the other currencies, and has made life particularly difficult
for the monetary authorities in France - whose franc is the weakest currency
in the system.
Could the ERM act as a forerunner to a grand world system of linked exchange
rates?
A world exchange rate system, connecting the main European currencies with
the yen and the dollar, would follow from the increased co-operation on an
economic and monetary level among the world's main industrial powers since
the 1970s. It would also underline the degree to which the world economy is
becoming increasingly integrated as a result of the way that large business
operations plan their operations.

FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1): Adjusting to a new climate -
The dollar's sharp rise since February and the weakness of the D-Mark have
shown once again how the foreign exchange market is good for surprises. But
the market is experiencing changes which could mean that its boom years are
over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LIKE much of the financial world, the foreign exchange markets are going
through a difficult adjustment to the far more sober business climate of the
1990s after the excesses of the opulent eighties.
Overall profits are thought to have fallen in the sector last year, exposing
excess capacity and forcing some smaller operators to quit the market.
Even the dollar pyrotechnics of this year's first quarter have given the
market little solace. The dollar's sharp fall against the D-Mark to new all
time lows of around DM1.443 in mid-February and its subsequent 18 per cent
rise in the seven weeks before Easter caught the market unprepared and so
ill-placed to convert the turnaround into profit.
The dollar's sudden surge was instructive, however. It largely reflected a
one-off shift in investor sentiment in favour of the US after the Gulf war.
Coming after a lengthy period in which the impact of interest rates on
interbank trading had been the dominant influence on exchange rate
movements, the dollar's remarkable rise was a timely reminder to foreign
exchange traders that they ignore underlying investor sentiment, the
purchasing power of currencies and economic and geo-political fundamentals
at their peril.
'It was a classic case of the interbank market and genuine financial flows
finding themselves at loggerheads', comments Mr Paul Chertkow, chief
currency strategist with Citibank in London.
The dollar surge began only days after the official discount rates in
Germany and the US 'crossed over'. On January 31, the Bundesbank raised its
discount rate by one half percentage point to 6.5 per cent and its more
important lombard emergency funding rate by the same amount to 9 per cent.
The following day, the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 6 per
cent from 6.5 per cent.
On past experience, those rate changes would have pointed to continued
dollar weakness. But such considerations took no account of the animal
spirits aroused by US-led victory in the Gulf and a growing perception among
long term investors, such as pension funds, that the US had become a land of
cheap buying opportunities after a protracted dollar fall.
These factors combined with a growing understanding of Germany's
difficulties absorbing eastern Germany to release a flow of foreign
portfolio capital in the direction of the US.
That mood swing showed that the foreign exchange markets are always good for
surprises. Not only interbank traders were caught out. The chartists, who
try to assess future exchange rate trends on the strength of currency
movements, were also wrong footed.
But on the whole, the past two years have been remarkable for the relative
stability of currencies in the face of striking geo-political change.
In the early 1970s, the western world entered a protracted economic crisis
with the unleashing of inflationary pressures world-wide, the first oil
crisis and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.
The result was a bonanza for foreign exchange traders as countries pursued
'beggar thy neighbour' economic and trade policies and currencies entered a
decade and a half of wild fluctuation.
Nearly 20 years later, the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, the
mounting economic and political problems of the Soviet Union, the end of the
1980s boom in the industrial world and the outbreak of war in the Gulf might
have been expected to create similar shock waves in the West's currency
markets.
This was not the case. By the time the iron curtain fell, the West had got
its act together. All industrialised countries today pursue broadly similar
economic policies that give priority to the combatting of inflation and
encouragement of private enterprise rather than the pursuit of economic
growth and full employment as ends in themselves. These lessons are now
being adopted by the newly emergent democracies of eastern Europe and in
much of the developing world.
In the European Community, economic convergence has contributed to
remarkable stability in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System since the last significant parity realignment more than four years
ago. Sterling, having joined the system's wider 6 per cent fluctuation band
last October, has rarely moved beyond 2.25 per cent either side of its
DM2.95 central rate.
Economic policy co-ordination, as practised by the US, Japan, Germany,
France, Italy, Britain and Canada in the Group of Seven, has emerged as a
key factor influencing the foreign exchange markets. Since September 1985,
the big industrialised countries have attempted to influence exchange rate
movements through co-ordinated currency intervention, backed by frequent
private discussions among G7 finance ministers and central bankers on
economic policy issues.
There is little doubt that the central banks have become progressively more
adept in their efforts to influence currency movements. The G7 attempt to
stabilise currencies through the so-called Louvre Accord of February 1987
involved massive intervention and the acceptance of distortions in financial
markets that may have helped trigger the global stock market crash later
that year.
Since then the G7 have learned to be more pragmatic, seeking to curb wild
currency fluctuations rather than defend target zones for currencies. As a
result, relatively small scale intervention by the central banks managed
first to brake the dollar's fall in February and then to induce a pause in
its rise around Easter.
G7 intervention is most effective when it reflects the clear political will
of all members to steer currencies. Such determination has been less
apparent as the dollar has risen.
But changes in the internatiuonal banking industry have meant that the
markets have punished the G7 less harshly than in the past for signs of
disarray. Banks have become more risk averse in all their activities,
including foreign exchange, reflecting their need to maintain strict capital
adequacy standards. This safety-first trend has been enhanced by losses in
the wake of falling stock market values in Japan and recession in the
Anglo-Saxon countries.
Attitudes and conditions have changed rapidly. The foreign exchange business
was hugely profitable between the Plaza Agreement of September 1985, when
the US, Japan, Germany, Britain and France agreed on joint action to depress
the then overvalued dollar, and the 1987 Louvre Accord to stabilise
currencies. 'There was a one way bet on the dollar and people built up their
foreign exchange operations because it was easy money,' says Mr Michael
Burton, heaf of corporate sales in the treasury department of the Hongkong
Bank in London.
In their gloomier moments, many market participants now wonder whether the
foreign exchanges will ever recapture the speculative fervour and sparkling
profits of the 1970s and early 1980s.
Traders and economists now talk of a market which seems to have its boom
years behind it and where activity is becoming increasingly concentrated
among a few large banks.
On the plus side, the liberalisation of eastern Europe may mean that
currencies such as the Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and Romanian lei will
be fully convertible and actively traded in centres such as London,
Frankfurt, Tokyo, New York and Singapore in a few years' time.
But the drive for economic and monetary union in Europe could mean the
disappearance of west European currencies if and when the European Community
adopts a single currency and central bank.
Add to this the incipient tendency for other parts of the world to move in
the direction of regional economic groupings such as the free trade area
being negotiated between the US, Canada and Mexico, and it is easy to see
why banks active in foreign exchange are increasingly seeking the stability
provided by a solid customer base.

FT  29 APR 91 / UN accord likely over W Sahara referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOLUTION to the conflict over the status of the former Spanish colony of
Western Sahara, which has pitted Morocco against the Polisario Liberation
Front, appears to be in sight, reports Francis Ghiles.
The UN Security Council is expected to agree today to proposals for a
referendum, drawn up by Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general.
Both parties to the conflict - especially, it seems, Polisario and its main
ally Algeria - have made recent concessions.
Under the plan, Morocco would cut its troops by two thirds, to 65,000,
within 11 weeks of a ceasefire. All remaining Moroccan troops would be
confined to defensive positions along the protective wall Morocco has built
to defend itself from Polisario guerrilla attacks. Polisario's estimated
7,000 fighters would also be confined to camps around the main refugee
centre south of Tindouf, in south western Algeria.
The existing Moroccan administration will however remain, contrary to
Polisario's initial wishes. Considerations of cost strongly militated
against the UN a wholesale takeover of taking over the administration of the
territory by the UN before during the run-up to a referendum.
An election commission would decide who is eligible to vote in the
referendum. To those names included in the census conducted by the former
colonial power just before it relinquished control of the territory and
which estimated the Saharawi population to be just short of 74,000 would be
added people from the Sidi Ifni region which Spain returned to Morocco in
1969 and those born in Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania who could bring proof
of the Saharan origin. That, ironically enough includes the Polisario
leader, Mohammed Abdelaziz, who was born in Marrakesh and whose father still
lives there.
King Hassan has accepted the idea of a referendum but made it clear that the
result could only 'ratify' what most Moroccans strongly feel is theirs
historically. His prestige would suffer a considerable blow were the outcome
of the vote to be a call for independence. His opposition, frustrated by
having no share in running Morocco, has systematically been more 'royaliste
que le roi.'
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid for his part has gone to great lengths
to rebuild links with Algeria's his eastern neighbour, notably by
re-establishing diplomatic ties, broken off in 1976, three years ago. But
the outcome of the first-ever free elections in North Africa, due next July
in Algeria, could bring to power people far less willing to compromise.
Furthermore, King Hassan and his Algerian counterpart know that the pipeline
due to carry natural gas to Spain across northern Morocco and the Straits of
Gibraltar will only get the final go-ahead if the two big north African
countries settle the status of the Western Sahara once and for all.
Finally, were the long festering dispute to be settled, the Maghreb
countries would be in a better bargaining position with the EC with whom
they share so many links. Instead of engaging in quarrels which leave most
Europeans indifferent and buying weapons with money better used in civilian
projects, they would for once have shown they were capable of doing
something constructive.
With turmoil likely to continue in the Middle East, that would at least
leave the Maghreb al Aqsa (and of the setting sun) as one part of the Arab
world with no major disputes.

FT  27 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON derivative markets ended quietly with dealers still anticipating
further falls in UK shares. Over the past week, the June FT-SE 100 index
contract has fallen 72 points as the buyers who had driven the market higher
during the first three weeks of April lost their appetite for shares.
The futures market has consistently traded this week below the theoretical
level which brokers estimate takes account of futures dividend payments and
the cost of finance.
With a bearish outlook for UK equities, the futures market has dragged the
stock market lower. Yesterday, June FT-SE closed 11 points easier at 2,472.
But it remained at a premium of just 19 points to the spot FT-SE index,
compared with the 30 point fair value premium.
The futures market initially attempted to move higher but with a scarcity of
buyers the rally soon ran out of steam. The belief that Wall Street would
open lower and disappointing US economic statistics pushed prices easier and
the market closed just above the low of the day.
In the traded options market, dealing was sluggish with just 17,900
contracts changing hands, against 28,409 in the previous day, which made it
one of the quietest sessions so far this year.

FT  27 APR 91 / No, the Brits are not bored by the bard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE THE Prince of Wales so loudly interrupted, I was contemplating
writing an article about why we have so much Shakespeare rather than so
little. It is true that Prince Charles was speaking this week about
Shakespeare in the schools, not Shakespeare in the theatre, but even there
he may be on dubious ground.
The Prince recalls that he was made to study Julius Caesar for O-level at
Gordonstoun, and that the experience left him largely unmoved. Like another
Prince of Wales - Prince Hal in King Henry IV - he was in good, if diverse,
company.
Tony Benn, who went to a rather more academic school, notes in his diaries
how he first saw Hamlet. 'Sunday 25 May 1980: Later I switched on the
television and Hamlet was on. I have never seen it before - what an odd
thing to admit at the age of 55] But like many people I was forced to read
it at school and that put me off for a long time.' Benn's comment is to the
point: 'A remarkable play,' he wrote.
The late Sir Anthony Quayle had an even more dispiriting experience at
Rugby. He records in his autobiography how a visit to the school by a
touring company performing Richard II almost put him off the the theatre for
life. Perhaps like Prince Charles and Mr Benn, Quayle was a late developer.
It may be said that none of them went to the sort of schools that the Prince
was talking about. But if you do not respond to Shakespeare when you are
taught at Gordonstoun, Westminster or Rugby, how do you expect the poor
people at the comprehensives to fare? Why Tony Benn failed to appreciate
Hamlet at an early age may be worth a psychological study in its own right.
The evidence suggests that there is a good deal of Shakespeare around. If
anyone doubts it, go to the Lyric Hammersmith next week where the English
Shakespeare company is putting on excerpts from the history plays specially
for schools. The ESC exists as a touring company, taking Shakespeare all
round the country - and sometimes further.
Then look at the amount of the Bard being played in full. In the last few
weeks more than half the plays that I have reviewed have been Shakespeare.
In a single week, the ESC brought Coriolanus and The Winter's Tale to London
while the RSC was reviving Much Ado About Nothing at the Barbican. A
spectacular modern dress production of Timon of Athens has probably saved
the financial skin of the Young Vic.
Nor have the productions been confined to big names and big companies. There
was another highly enjoyable, modern dress production of The Winter's Tale
playing a few miles away at a pub in Richmond. Two separate productions of
Antony and Cleopatra opened almost simultaneously in London and Birmingham
this month; a third, all-black production is opening in London shortly.
There has just been a new Hamlet in Bristol, let alone the RSC's new season
at Stratford.
One could go on: suffice it say that even when the playwright's name is not
there, the influence is pervasive. I went to see a West African play the
other day, billed as third world feminist. It was impossible to stop being
reminded of Macbeth.
So my original thought was not to complain that there is too much
Shakespeare - there can never be that - but to wonder what has happened to
everything else. The truth is that there are very few good modern plays
being written. Even the latest hit at the National, Black Snow, is based on
a Russian novel written around 1936. The alternative is to go for foreign
plays, but the trouble is that they still tend to turn an English audience
away. Shakespeare fills the gap.
Why is he so popular? Partly he is so full of infinite variety; partly
because he has given so much to the English language. There is the story of
the old lady who - like Mr Benn - saw Hamlet for the first time and remarked
that it was a good play, but too full of quotations.
It was not always so. Only well into the 18th century did Shakespeare come
to be regarded as indisputably greater than his contemporaries. He was not a
scholar and classicist like Ben Jonson. Shakespeare went to Stratford
grammar school and probably could not remember whether he had any O-levels.
With Shakespeare there is always room for re-interpretation. The new
production of Twelfth Night that opened in Stratford this week was generally
praised by the Financial Times and attacked by other newspapers. Even those
who disliked it disagreed about Sir Andrew Aguecheek: one critic said he was
the single redeeming feature; another thought he was the worst Sir Andrew he
had ever seen. Michael Bogdanov, who directs for the ESC, produced a
wonderful Winter's Tale and an execrable Coriolanus, set in Eastern Europe
almost side by side.
But that is what Shakespeare is about. He allows people to read into his
texts what they will. Nigel Lawson is convinced that he was a Tory, drawing
on evidence from Troilus and Cressida. Bogdanov clearly sees him as a left
wing revolutionary, Prince Charles as a constitutional monarchist.
Of his essential Englishness there can be no doubt. Take the gravedigger's
line to Hamlet. The Prince has been sent to England because he was mad: 'He
shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there .
. . there the men are as mad as he.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: How Perpetual profits from a fresh
outlook - The Fund Managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST FUND managers work in air conditioned offices to the sound of traffic
and sirens. Not so at Perpetual Investment in Henley, Berkshire, where the
managers sit by open windows, listening to the occasional chug of a passing
pleasure boat or a quack from a duck on the river Thames. Something in the
air may be doing the managers good, because Perpetual's unit trusts have an
enviable short-term performance record.
Founder and chairman Martin Arbib is puzzled why, given its record,
Perpetual has not got more than the current Pounds 400m under management.
One explanation is that Perpetual has put relatively few resources into
marketing compared with its competitors. Perpetual's independent status,
short life and comparative lack of City connections has meant that it has
had to compete on performance alone.
Perpetual's story goes back to September 1974, when Martin Arbib, a
chartered accountant, launched the first fund just before the stock market
recovered from the 1973-4 crash. In the early 1970s, Arbib had run a small
number of portfolios for friends, making money even during the crash. In
response to his friends' requests, he set up his own independent pension
fund and unit trust company.
Although it was listed on the stock exchange in 1987, Arbib remains the
dominant shareholder. Perpetual is currently trying to build up its pension
business, but its name has been made in unit trusts.
Some of Perpetual's managers are regarded as demanding clients - Arbib is
reputed to terrify certain stockbrokers. In the flesh, he is friendly and
down to earth, proud owner of Snurge, the St Leger-winning racehorse.
Each fund's investment objective is to achieve performance in the top
quartile (best 25 per cent), although the second quartile may be acceptable
for more cyclical funds, such as Worldwide Recovery and International
Emerging Companies.
As the table shows, the funds have certainly lived up to this target over
three years, with eight out of nine producing above average performances and
six in the top quartile. Both the funds with 10 year performance records are
in the top quartile over that longer period, as are three of the four funds
with seven year records.
The five-year figures are less impressive. Only one of the seven funds
established before 1985 is in the top quartile, and four have below average
performances.
Why do most of Perpetual's figures look so good? Since it is all down to the
fund managers, Arbib may be right that it is the misery of the city'.
Managers only travel up to London when absolutely necessary; plenty of
companies and brokers come to Henley, which is conveniently close to
Heathrow airport.
An obsession with performance has led to the development of a sophisticated
performance measuring computer system, which enables funds to be broken down
and analysed minutely. It is possible to monitor a junior manager who is
starting out by managing a regional section of an international fund. It is
also possible to see whether managers are doing as well managing a section
of one of the international funds as their own.
Perpetual's managers work in regional teams, with a total of 11 in the
investment department. There is a formal monthly asset allocation meeting,
but managers are pretty autonomous. The method tends to be 'bottom up', but
the approach varies.
For instance, Scott McGlashan, who is in charge of the Far East, takes an
idiosyncratic approach to the Japanese market, which he says, tends to be
based on speculative pushes by the big broking houses.
'All I look for is individual shares with reasonable growth prospects and a
strong balance sheet whose price earnings ratio is two thirds of the market.
I look at ten-year records to identify strong management in times of
weakness. I don't spend more than two weeks a year in Japan as I've found
diminishing returns in visiting companies.'
He also uses warrants and options extensively to protect against falls in
the market.
Bob Yerbury, in charge of the North American funds, tends to look more at
sector allocation, and attributes strong performance recently to a heavy
weighting in financials in 1989 up until the crash of the savings and loans
market, and energy stocks last summer. Recently he has been buying stocks
geared to the economic cycle. Sharp selling, he says, has also helped.
For the UK funds, Stephen Whittaker tends to pick stocks rather than
sectors, and likes to be fully invested even when the market is falling.
This year he has switched his investment policy away from holding large,
stable industrials and defensive stocks in sectors like electricity, water
and food, to buying smaller, undervalued companies. He acquired 22 new
holdings on one day in January.
The UK holdings in the PEP Growth &amp; Income fund, for which he is also
responsible, tend to be more conservative than in the UK Growth fund,
although last year, British Aerospace and British Steel were core companies
of both.
High income, which is the higher yielding fund (7 per cent), includes both
convertibles and overseas stocks, and has performed better recently than the
older Income fund.
The difference appears to be one of management. Since Whittaker took over
the fund last October, performance has improved, and capital, rather than a
rising dividend will remain the priority.
Bill Murfett, who is responsible for European investment, favours technical
analysis to spot undervalued markets and shares. He also tries to be as
liquid as possible and thus tends to hold several blue chips. Last year,
this did not pay off too well as, he believes, much of the strongest
performance came from second and third line stocks. The fund's record is
better over three years.
With fewer than half Perpetual's funds having seven-year records, it has yet
to be seen whether the group can produce long term performance across a wide
range of funds. But if the group can keep up the record of the past three
years, it will deserve to be taken very seriously.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Currency funds: for the bold only -
How can you profit from the dollar's strength?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar has taken many people by surprise this year by the speed with
which it has risen on the international currency markets. Many investors
must be wishing that they had shifted funds into the US currency in January.
It is possible to back your hunches in the foreign exchange markets by
investing in an offshore currency fund. The average dollar fund earned 10.26
per cent, offer-to-offer, in March alone and 12.35 per cent over three
months, according to Finstat.
There are two main types of currency fund: a managed fund, where the manager
picks and chooses which of the world's major currencies he or she expects to
do well, and a single currency fund, which simply invests in short term
deposits of the currency concerned. It is then up to the investor to pick
the right unit.
These funds can be offered in two forms. Accumulation, or roll-up, funds
were extremely popular in the days when it was possible to use them to
convert income into capital gains - and make a tax benefit. The Inland
Revenue has put a stop to the practice but it is still possible, if the
income is not repatriated, to postpone the date when tax is paid.
Distributor funds, in contrast, pay out their income gross and this makes
them attractive to non-taxpayers such as non-working wives.
The reward from a currency fund comes in two ways. The manager invests the
fund in interest-bearing deposits to earn income. The return varies
depending on the level of interest rates in the country concerned. The Old
Court Spanish peseta fund, for example, is currently yielding 13.2 per cent;
the Singapore dollar fund is yielding just 3.48 per cent.
Capital gain arises if the currency or currencies selected rise in value
against the pound. The danger, of course, is that the currencies fall
against the pound and the investor loses money.
The charges depend on the type of fund that you choose. Managed funds carry
an initial charge, slightly lower than on a unit trust. The Old Court (N M
Rothschild) initial charge on the managed funds is 3 per cent and the charge
on the Guinness Flight managed fund is to be increased from 4 to 5 per cent,
from April 30.
Single currency funds normally carry no initial charge. Both sets of funds
have annual management charges, 0.5 per cent in the case of Guinness Flight
as from April 30, 1 per cent in the Old Court range.
Minimum investments vary with the Rothschild funds setting no minimum at all
and Guinness Flight about to raise its minimum to Pounds 5,000.
Among managed funds, Guinness Flight International Managed Currency is top
over seven and ten years, achieving growth (offer-to-offer with income
reinvested) of 131.6 per cent and 351.6 per cent respectively. But to show
the risks involved in this area, the worst performing fund - Forexfund -
actually lost 11.1 per cent over seven years.
Of the single currency funds, four of the top five over three years were
Australian dollar based, with the best performing being Lloyds
International, which returned 70.5 per cent. The same fund was the best over
five years, with a 81 per cent return, although one or two sterling-based
funds were not far behind.
It paid to be adventurous in 1984, since the two best funds over seven years
are in Italian lira (124.9 per cent) and Danish kroner (119.3 per cent).
Both are part of the Old Court range.
Old Court funds also take top billing over ten years, with the Italian lira
(304.9 per cent), Canadian dollar (257.9 per cent) and French franc (226.6
per cent) in first, second and third place respectively.
To put this into perspective, the average UK general unit trust returned
398.3 per cent over the last ten years - and indeed the average UK general
trust beat the best currency fund over seven years as well. This merely
illustrates the oft-repeated investment belief that equities offer the best
returns over the long term.
On the other hand, it is quite surprising to find how few funds have
actually lost money over longer periods. Ten managed funds are down in price
over one year - including two which have fallen by 26.6 per cent. That is
the kind of fall that can easily occur with a conventional unit trust, but
it might be a different story if there was a sharp rise in sterling against
other currencies.
The other kind of risk is much more difficult to quantify. By being
offshore, the funds do not qualify for the UK's compensation scheme,
although some will be backed by local investor protection plans. Much may
depend on the safety of the company concerned and it is perhaps unsurprising
that the blue-blooded N M Rothschild is the largest in this field.
This is not, therefore, an area in which the small investor should
speculate. But if you are gloomy about the prospects for sterling, or if
perhaps you have a regular need to use one currency, such a fund might be
worth considering.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capital Gains Tax and you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has now published its March indexation table for those
wishing to calculate their capital gains tax liability.
The table shows the allowance which investors can make for inflation on
assets sold in March. To calculate your liability, multiply the original
cost of your shares by the figure shown for the month in which you bought
them. Then subtract that indexed sum from the amount you received when you
sold the shares.
For example, supposing you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in March 1983,
which are worth Pounds 12,000 now. Without indexation, your gain would be
Pounds 7,000, above the 1990-91 capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,000
(the 1991-92 allowance has been increased to Pounds 5,500).
However using the table, you multiply Pounds 5,000 by the March 1983 figure
of 1.581 to reach Pounds 7,905. Your indexed gain is just Pounds 4,095
(Pounds 12,000 minus Pounds 7,905), well below the CGT allowance.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Hidden expenses of life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT, pensions correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHEN YOU buy a life policy there are two important factors
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the underlying investment performance that the life company will achieve and
the expenses it will incur.
It is far from easy for potential investors, and independent advisers, to
judge the likely future investment performance from a company. Past
performance trends are a guide, but far from infallible.
However, it is easier for the investor to get a clearer guide to the level
of expenses and their effect on the ultimate return if presented in a format
that he can understand - namely an illustration, in money terms, of the
maturity or cash-in value at the end of the investment period.
Yet the various regulatory bodies have banned the use of such illustrations.
Life companies and independent advisers have to provide all benefit
illustrations on the basis and assumptions laid down by Lautro (Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). Thus every life company
produces the same illustrative figure for the same contract. It does not
distinguish high and low expense life companies.
The argument put forward by Lautro to justify its decision is that contracts
should not be sold solely on the basis of an illustration - a practice that
was widespread in pre-financial services days and led to considerable abuse.
However, the danger to the public of using standard illustrations is that
they may feel that there is no expense difference between life companies -
an impression that the high-expense companies have not contradicted.
Investors are given details of a life company's expenses. But under
Securities and Investments Board disclosure rules the details are given:
within the cooling off period after the contract has been bought;
as a percentage deduction from the investment return.
So the investor is given information in an opaque form after he has bought
the contract, and then faces the hassle of cancelling the contract if he
does not like the expense deduction.
Even if he could understand the significance of the yield figure, which is
unlikely, it only relates to that particular contract with the life company,
thus conveying no indication as to the level of expenses against other life
companies.
However, the April issue of Money Management* reviewed the past performance
of unit-linked endowment contracts and included a table of projected
illustrations on an 'own charges' basis.
It provides a wealth of information which enables individuals and advisers
to sort out the low-charge sheep from the high-charge goats and all those in
between.
The first point shown by the tables is just how much easier it is to assess
the expense effect from monetary figures rather than yields. For example, it
shows that for a 10-year term, the average payout is reduced by 17 to 18 per
cent by expenses, while for 25 years the reduction is around 25 per cent.
Second, it highlights that investor returns can vary significantly solely
because of differences in expenses.
Most of the life assurance industry argues that the investment return is all
important, implying that expenses are incidental to the overall return. The
companies arguing that expenses are important are lone voices crying in the
wilderness.
The table shows that the longer the period to cash-in, the greater the
significance of investment performance.
But how many contracts are kept in force for 25 years before being
cashed-in? And the tables show that even over 25 years, the influence of
expenses is far from negligible.
So investors and advisers need to classify life companies according to their
perceived investment potential and their expense level.
Finally, the tables highlight that the Lautro illustration basis is useless
in that the expense assumptions are lower than the expenses currently
charged by virtually every life company. Only London Life can match Lautro
on expenses.
Thus potential investors are being given higher illustrative values than are
justified by the current life company charges - a situation that Lautro
should remedy immediately.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Frock coats and flush customers - The
rich world of private banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISILLUSIONMENT with high street banks and the derisory interest rates on
current accounts might tempt wealthier clients into the arms of small
private banks.
It should be stressed that you usually need to be very wealthy for joining a
private bank to make any sense - the charges, detailed below, are often far
higher than any you will pay in the high street.
Some newer banks, however, offer a different service. For example, Robert
Fleming, a long-established merchant bank, now offers a high interest cheque
account. The interest rates tend to outstrip the competition, but for the
best rates you will need quite a high net income.
Smith &amp; Williamson, which started offering banking in 1970, having grown out
of a Glasgow accountancy practice, offers a different specialist service.
The banking is free while in credit but there is no interest on current
accounts. Their special service comes from the assistance on tax which they
can integrate with the service.
The small banks which most people associate with 'private banking' grew out
of goldsmithery in the City of London and remain exclusive, sometimes
insisting on references from existing customers before you may join. These
include C Hoare, famed for its close links with the legal profession and
still independent; Child &amp; Co, the oldest bank in England, now a trading
name of the Royal Bank of Scotland; and Coutts, the largest and most
expensive, now a subsidiary of NatWest.
These banks differ surprisingly in character. For example, if it matters to
you that your bank manager does not have a beard, then Coutts &amp; Co may have
the answer. All its male staff, from the chief executive down to the office
boys, are required to be clean-shaven. They must also wear frock coats and
waistcoats while they are in the office.
Coutts finds that its customers value this adherence to tradition, although
none of its competitors goes to the same extreme of wearing its history on
its frock coat sleeve.
Hoare, like Coutts and Child, refers to its main banking hall as the 'Shop'.
The porters who guide you around the hall still wear a uniform of
swallow-tail coats with brass buttons.
A typical perk is the narrative account, on offer from Coutts, Hoare, Smith
&amp; Williamson and Adam and available for an extra charge from Child. These
list all the people who paid money into your account and all the people to
whom your cheques have been paid. Many find this useful.
Adam goes a step further and offers personal profit and loss accounts,
showing what you spent during the year, or during the month, on food, or
education, or taxation. This may well prove to be a boon come the end of the
tax year.
Personal banking from a specially assigned banker who will usually only have
around 200 accounts to supervise is the other big 'plus'. The manager with
whom you deal can be expected to have a broad view of your finances and to
be in a position to guide you to other financial services.
If you dislike financial hassle, there are attractions in this kind of
service, rather than talking to a number of different middlemen.
There are some tangible fringe benefits, in the form of invitations to
dinner and, in the case of Coutts, concerts in the central garden court.
Coutts also offers genuine leather cheque book and credit card holders.
Whether you really think they are worth paying for is another matter.
These banks do not make it easy for you to forget their heritage. Hoare's
previous clients include Samuel Pepys, Jane Austen, and Lord Byron. Its
traditional strengths lie in serving the legal profession - the inns and the
High Court are both near its main branch in Fleet Street.
Coutts can counter, first and foremost, with the royal family, who have been
faithful customers since the time of George III. Their line-up continues
with the actors Keen and Kemble, Pitt the Younger and Pitt the Elder, the
Duke of Wellington, Charles Dickens and Lord Tennyson.
Child &amp; Co then wades in with clients from an earlier generation - Oliver
Cromwell and Dean Swift. It also has traditionally close links with racing,
and with Oxford University.
All this information comes straight from the banks' promotional literature.
For some reason, the main high street clearing banks completely omit the
names of previous clients in their advertising.
Coutts has by far the most glamorous office, at the head of the Strand.
However, the spacious mix of the marble garden court, with goldfish ponds
and plenteous plants, mixes oddly with the Victorian dress of the
attendants. The overall impression is of a modern City office, not unlike
the Snowdon aviary, peopled by the cast of a Dickens novel.
Hoare's premises look more Victorian - a small office is reached through a
corridor where guns for use against Napoleon are on display and four top
hats stand ready in the main shop. Child's office is open-plan, and looks
more like a modern high street bank, although show cases display documents
from the bank's early history, and ten guns acquired at the time of the
Gordon (a Coutts customer) riots against Catholics are also in the middle of
the hall.
However, not all the banks are ancient, or exclusively the preserve of 'old
money'.
Adam &amp; Co was established in Edinburgh six years ago and aims for more
entrepreneurial spirits. While the older banks cater for the nobility,
Adam's typical client is someone who has just sold his share in a company,
or floated it on the Unlisted Securities Market.
If tradition and status appeal to you, then some of the old established
names may seem attractive. But if you want value for money, you will need to
shop around.
Adam &amp; Co. Independent company, offering standard private banking services,
including clever itemised accounts. New business usually comes from
references. Branches in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, with access to Visa
cash machine network (for which charges may be levied). Average balance of
Pounds 1,000 must be maintained to avoid charges of 50p per entry to the
account. Interest accrues daily on balances in excess of Pounds 2,000, with
maximum interest available on balances of more than Pounds 10,000. Students
receive free banking in credit. (Tel: 031-225-8484
Child &amp; Co. Use of Royal Bank of Scotland branch network (also access to
Lloyds, Barclays and Bank of Scotland machines). One branch, in Fleet
Street, London. Minimum balance of Pounds 750 to avoid charges  - otherwise
45p per statement entry, plus Pounds 5 administration fee per quarter.
Interest, tied to money market rates, is available on Premium Account
(minimum balance Pounds 2,500). Optional narrative accounts available, for a
fee. Virtually all new business comes from recommendations. (071 -
353-4080).
Coutts &amp; Co. Use of National Westminster branch network (providing access to
Midland cash machines). Four separate branches in its main office in the
Strand, plus branches in Fleet Street, Bath, Bristol, Eton and Winchester.
You get a narrative account, plus fringe benefits, such as leather holders
for cheque books, bank cards and statements. Minimum average balance of
Pounds 3,000 to avoid charges of Pounds 30 per quarter plus 75p per entry.
(071-753-1000).
Robert Fleming A different animal, backed by a merchant bank. Provided you
keep a high balance, it offers a high interest rate on cheque accounts. For
the highest paying Premier Account, customers must be owner-occupiers with a
gross income of Pounds 40,000 per annum. Minimum balance to avoid charges of
Pounds 5 per month is Pounds 1,000, but 11.07 per cent gross interest rates
are available on balances of Pounds 5,000 or more. You receive a Visa Gold
card and Pounds 250 cheque guarantee. Telephone banking is offered.
(0708-766966).
C. Hoare &amp; Co. The oldest independent bank, with only two branches, both in
London. Provides multifunction Visa cards, for use as cheque guarantee and
cash machine cards (without interest being added). A family company, with
unlimited liability. References from current customers required before an
account can be opened. Minimum balance of Pounds 750 to avoid charges of
Pounds 3 per quarter plus 35p per entry. Free banking for students and
under-25s. (071-353-4522).
Smith &amp; Williamson. Has been offering personal banking since 1970 and has
unlimited liability. It is not a competitor of clearing banks, but scores
through the accounting services it can combine with banking. Cheque
accounts, with narrative statements, are free while in credit, but interest
is not available. Charges may be levied on cheques for small amounts.
Branches in London, Bournemouth, Salisbury, Guildford, Dorchester and
Blandford. (071-637-5377).

FT  27 APR 91 / Love and death in the city of lost hopes: It is two years
since tanks crushed the Peking rebellion. In the heady days before the
uprising Peter Ellingsen fell in love with a young student - but the thugs
in China's security forces had other ideas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
YOU GET USED to the scrutiny after a while, though faces and lenses
constantly watching never seem normal. 'The guards are for your protection,'
an official explained shortly after I arrived. I am not sure what I, a
journalist, expected of Peking in the early summer of 1988, but once past
the ugly buildings, the huge motorways and the vast emptiness of Tiananmen
Square, I found a spirit of remarkable buoyancy. With the reform process in
full swing, there was a sense of expectation among the young.
A week after arriving, I found myself sitting on the cluttered floor of a
tiny dormitory in a co-ed art college, talking about Western music with
students I had met at an exhibition. They were not afraid to speak out.
There were predictions of China loosening up, becoming richer and freer and
turning its back on the strictures of the past.
As the autumn of 1988 turned into the winter of 1989, Peking was full of
hope and fun. Rock and roll parties were staged in Ritan Park and many
intellectuals, emboldened by the moderate policies of Zhao Ziyang, the
Communist party boss, began to agitate for the release of political
prisoners, in particular the freeing of Wei Jingsheng, who was going insane
while serving 15 years in prison for his part in the 'Democracy Wall'
movement in 1979.
Writers and academics gathered in JJ's, a tiny bar favoured by Peking's
in-crowd, to frame a petition calling for Wei's release. Their action was to
set the scene for seven weeks of student demonstrations and the eventual
storming of Peking by tanks and heavily-armed troops who slaughtered an
estimated 1,000 people.
But for me there was a personal sequel, as important in its own way as the
Big Event. The woman I was to marry was one of the hundreds of thousands of
students who gathered peacefully in Tiananmen Square in those heady days of
spring 1989.
Jin Yan, a musician, with no real knowledge of politics like so many other
young people, joined in the festival atmosphere, innocent of the past and
with no sense of the terrible denouement to come. She was not in the square
when the tanks rolled in early on the morning of June 4 and because she
played no active role in the demonstrations she was not on any hit list when
the post-massacre purge began.
But that hardly mattered. In the murderous days after June 4, as soldiers
toting AK47s stalked around the city, firing at people on street corners and
in their homes and shoving gun barrels in the faces of drinkers in bars,
order was turned on its head. To 'liberate' the capital, they were going to
crush it, and they did, at one stage murdering a handful of young men whose
only crime was to be found standing beside the Peking Hotel.
Some days after soldiers cleared Tiananmen Square I had to run for my life
when troops of the Peoples' Liberation Army opened fire close to the Peking
Hotel. One man had a revolver put to his head because he did not stop his
truck quickly enough at a road block. Children were hit by stray shots and
people everywhere were beaten by rifle butts and hauled from their homes
into detention.
Attempting to maintain contact with Jin Yan meant a series of nervous,
late-night phone calls and anxious meetings in hotel lobbies. We were
followed and our conversations, I believe, were monitored.
Even two months later, when apparent order had been restored, our effort
simply to marry was enough for her to be treated like a criminal. It was not
a political persecution - unless that term is used to cover the humiliation
that befalls anyone in China - and I suspect that it had little to do with
party order. But under a repressive state apparatus there is no refuge.
Everyone is a target.
In this small episode, no one was beaten, jailed or tortured, but the
security forces have many other less obvious means to destroy dignity and
hope. In a nation without an independent system of law, just sharing a meal
at my apartment was enough for Jin Yan to be taken by the compound security
guards - they said for a one-hour 'interview' - and treated as a criminal.
It was about 10pm when the two guards demanded that she accompany them to a
staff building at one end of the compound, but despite their assurances, by
midnight she had still not returned.
Waiting in the August chill, I became increasingly worried and decided to
enter the building - which was out of bounds to foreigners - and
systematically search each room. Opening one upper floor door I glimpsed a
wall of TV monitors, the outlet for the closed circuit cameras around the
compound and in its lifts, and was rudely ordered to leave. When I demanded
to know what had happened to Jin Yan, there were smirks from the security
guards and a curt demand that I go home.
'Go to bed,' a sullen security guard said. 'She has been taken home, there's
nothing to worry about.' 'Are you absolutely certain?' I asked. 'How did she
get home, and what about her bicycle?' 'We have driven her home,' he
answered, 'it is nothing to do with you.' When I protested that this was my
fiancee they were talking about, they gave me a blank look. 'She is
Chinese,' they said. 'You are a foreigner.'
Shaking with anger, I scanned the faces of the small crowd that had gathered
in the room to enjoy my distress. They were clearly relishing the reversal
of roles. No longer the foreigner, envied for his passport and its benefits,
I was just another body sinking under the dead weight of bureaucracy. I
rushed out, found her bicycle still standing where she had left it, and
raced across town to collect Jin Yan's parents, returning to the building
shortly after 1am.
With a deference ordinary Chinese are conditioned to show even in the face
of the most banal authority, her parents politely asked after their daughter
and were arrogantly told the same story. I did not believe it, and when her
mother recognised Jin Yan's bag lying on a side table and we realised that
she was still in the building, I felt a surge of anger and frustration that
must be commonplace among the Chinese who are routinely lied to and
deceived.
The discovery bought denials and threats from the most vocal of the security
guards, a corpulent man with a bloated, red face and eyes that showed he
savoured the joys of petty power. We glared at each other as he stood, arms
folded, at the top of the concrete stairs.
Two diplomats from the Australian Embassy arrived at around 2 am, but still
the charade went on. 'This concerns a Chinese, you have nothing to do with
it,' the crimson-faced guard told Colin Heseltine, the Embassy Minister.
'This man is an Australian citizen, but he is engaged to the girl,'
Heseltine argued. We had no alternative but to wait until Jin Yan was
finally released around 3.30am, after more than five hours of interrogation.
Despite a complaint being lodged there was no apology, nor any explanation.
Jin Yan had told her inquisitors of our impending marriage and had been
derided. 'He'll never marry you,' they sneered. 'Why are you seeing a
foreigner. What do you do together. What does he say?' were among the more
polite questions.
In the post-Tiananmen atmosphere any local dealing with a foreigner,
especially a 'spy', as all correspondents are alleged to be, was regarded as
suspicious and presented a chance for humiliation, a favourite pastime of
Chinese officials. Yet she had broken no law.
Worse was to come. We were followed by plain-clothes security, our car tyres
were slashed, people close to us were harassed. Finally, in order for us to
to marry, Jin Yan had to leave her university shortly before she was to
graduate.
After a holiday in February 1990, when I thought it was all over, I had
another altercation with three of the compound's guards, led by our
red-faced friend. I had driven past the armed police sentry, along the
discoloured snow leading into the compound's garage, when the three blocked
our way, ignoring signals to move.
They glared and shouted belligerently, saying I was a journalist, not an
envoy, and enjoyed no diplomatic privilege. 'You want to leave China,' the
red-faced one bellowed, adding that, married or not, Jin Yan was Chinese and
might have problems departing. Their anger was driven partly by the loss of
face suffered because we, contrary to their best efforts, were still
together. Disregarding the threats we walked away.
At least now we were married and had a way out. For most Chinese the
bullying by all levels of authority cannot be avoided. As we sat in our
apartment, I sensed a little of what it must be like for the Chinese to live
under this state of siege, with no appeal against injustice and no dignity
or status, save that conferred by proximity to power.
I double-bolted the door that night, half expecting the security men to
attempt a jackbooted entrance. As I looked out on to Chang An, Peking's
Avenue of Eternal Peace, where eight months before I counted more than 60
tanks crawling along, guns blazing, China, the police state, seemed like a
disease crawling across my skin.
Despite the lies of Peking, 'stability' has not been restored in China. Just
because people are not protesting does not mean that they are without
grievances. Instead of leaving their critical faculties at the airport,
visiting politicians would be well advised to forgo their five-star hotels
and sense the frustration in the streets.
In the southern city of Kunming, for example, I glimpsed a piece of theatre
that says more about how resentful and alienated people are, and how few
options they have, than could ever emerge from a VIP banquet.
A young peasant boy and an office worker had collided on their bicycles and
were haggling about who was at fault. There was no solution, just a release
of tension and entertainment for the crowd. Remonstrations went on for more
than an hour, but no one was inclined to compromise or to exchange personal
details so as to settle differences later.
It seemed a huge and draining waste of time, until I realised that this was
a cathartic release and that the office worker's bike was a fancy model
which would have cost more to fix than the young peasant could afford. No
one wished to lose face, so they kept traffic waiting while they battled
away. Many of the more than 100 onlookers were unemployed, or
under-employed, something else the government does not like to talk about,
although the total number of unemployed is now more than 100m and a force
for widespread discontent.
In the crowd, I noticed a young man locking his arm around his girlfriend. I
had seen such grappling before and it had nothing to do with sex. The grip
was too desperate and public to be play. As the dusty, difficult,
no-prospects world he knew rolled by, he was clinging to what was probably
was his only valuable 'possession', which is how many Chinese boys think of
their girlfriends. In a rigidly controlled society, with its limited
chances, she was one of the only icons of hope he could aspire to.
If they are lucky, they will stay together and have some sort of shield
against China's callousness, although as people stop believing in anything,
including the party, divorce is increasing and families, the traditional
mainstay, are being put under pressure.
As I was about to leave Peking, a Foreign Ministry official handed me a
plate as a memento, saying that, though the dish was light, the sentiment it
carried was heavy. It was a thoughtful gesture, and while I am not sure what
his words meant, if they were to do with the burden that the Chinese
continue to carry under communism, then the gift is not only weighty but
fired with more sadness that either or us could know.

FT  27 APR 91 / Fraud office probes lending scheme: Banks and mortgage
groups may have lost Pounds 30m through Castlegate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office is investigating the possible loss of up to Pounds
30m on loans made by banks and mortgage lenders through Castlegate Group, a
consumer finance company based in Reading, Berkshire. The company went into
creditors' voluntary liquidation last December.
National Home Loans, the mortgage company, said yesterday that it had
written off Pounds 3.5m in funds provided to Castlegate for second mortgages
and consumer finance.
Other lenders involved include National Westminster Bank and an unidentified
Scottish bank which is believed to have lent more than Pounds 10m through
Castlegate.
Mr Kevin Milner, chief executive of National Home Loans, declined to give
details of how his company came to lose money through Castlegate.
'We have been advised by the Serious Fraud Office not to discuss the
matter,' he said.
Mr Michael Radford, senior partner at Radford, Sons and Co, the Southampton
firm acting as liquidator for Castlegate, said: 'Things are an awful mess.
Nobody has got any idea at all of the overall position of the group. One can
do the figures until the cows come home and reach different conclusions each
time.'
Mr Radford said his work as liquidator had been hampered by the fact that
the police had removed most of the group's records.
Castlegate offered consumer finance and guaranteed-return investments.
It told companies that participated in its lending schemes that all advances
to borrowers were fully secured by mortgages on homes.
The schemes broke down when valuations on the properties proved to be
inflated and four small companies working with Castlegate were forced into
administrative receivership during October and November.
That triggered Castlegate's eventual collapse.

FT  27 APR 91 / Threat of rail strikes over 7% wage offer: Main BR union
leaders decide to ballot members while Aslef talks go to arbitration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a series of national rail strikes, similar to those two years
ago, grew yesterday when leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union
(RMT) decided to ballot members in British Rail over a 7 per cent pay offer.
At the same time, BR accepted a request from the Aslef rail drivers' union
to go to arbitration. The unions split over their tactics in spite of
efforts by their leaders to reach a common strategy in opposing the BR
offer.
The RMT's national executive decided to hold an industrial action ballot of
the union's 60,000 members in BR. Leaders of the union will meet next week
to decide the timing and form of action, but are likely to consider 24-hour
strikes.
Aslef, which represents about 16,000 British Rail train drivers, asked BR to
accept arbitration at the Railway Staffs National Tribunal. The three-person
tribunal recommends a settlement which has been largely accepted in the
past.
Although arbitration could provide a means of settling the dispute, any
ruling would not be binding on the RMT. The union said it had rejected
arbitration because BR had not met recommended awards in full in the past.
The dispute coincides with one at London Underground over 1,005 proposed job
cuts.
The RMT is expected to announce on Monday that its 12,000 members on London
Underground have voted for a series of 24-hour strikes on that issue.
The simultaneous disputes on British Rail and London Underground echo
disruption in the summer of 1989 when there was a series of one-day strikes
on both networks. British Rail then raised a 7 per cent offer to 8.8 per
cent after an arbitration award from the tribunal.
BR said yesterday that it was glad Aslef had 'taken a responsible course'
and would not disrupt services. It added that it was 'dismayed' the RMT had
decided to ballot members, in spite of knowing that Aslef was seeking
arbitration.
The third union which has rejected the BR 7 per cent offer, the TSSA white
collar union, will meet on Tuesday to discuss what action it will take.
TSSA members have already voted in favour of industrial action over London
Underground cuts.
Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef general secretary, said the Aslef executive had
decided to seek arbitration 'because we could have come in for criticism if
we had not'.
British Rail raised an initial 6.5 per cent pay offer earlier this week, but
said it could not afford more money.
The board's external financing limit has been raised by Pounds 320m because
of a fall in revenue.

FT  27 APR 91 / Higher band considered for council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT acknow-ledged yesterday that it may make changes to elements
of its proposed council tax which could lead to higher bills for the
wealthiest households.
The Department of the Environment has asked valuation officers at the Inland
Revenue to look at extending the number of bands from seven to nine -
including an extra category for properties worth more than Pounds 200,000.
There may also be relief for the least wealthy families. Mr Michael
Heseltine, environment secretary, last night confirmed the statistical
exercise was taking place but said it would be wrong to assume it was 'an
instruction to ministers' to change the seven-band system.
At the same time, officials confirmed that Mr Heseltine is to review how the
system will work for the 5,500 residents in the City of London.
That could mean changes to take account of the City's small population and
high property values.
The disclosures - just four days after Mr Heseltine published his proposals
 -followed the publication by the Labour party of leaked documents from the
National Valuation Office.
These set out details of a valuation exercise, planned for completion by May
10, across England and Wales.
Whitehall officials insist a system with seven bands remains the
government's 'prefered option' but admit that changes could follow the
current consultation exercise promised by Mr Heseltine.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said the
government's 'hidden agenda' suggested 'they need a fallback position
because they expect the existing proposal to be attacked for its essential
unfairness'.
According to the leaked documents, valuation officers have been asked to
look at a system with a new band for properties in England worth up to
Pounds 30,000. They also envisage a band for properties worth Pounds 200,000
or more.
That would insert another band above the Pounds 160,000 or more upper band
set out on Tuesday.
Mr Blunkett said valuation officers had been asked to conduct the survey in
complete secrecy, keeping no records and making no contact with the
occupiers of the properties being valued.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, last night wrote to the prime minster asking
when 'we shall have the definitive Conservative alternative to the poll
tax?'

FT  27 APR 91 / Rolls-Royce and BMW venture to develop aero engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW Rolls-Royce, the recently founded joint venture, plans to spend DM1bn
(Pounds 338m) by 1996 developing a family of aircraft engines aimed at the
regional airliner market, and may build a factory in eastern Germany.
Mr Albert Schneider, chairman of BMWRR, said yesterday a new plant -
accounting for part of the DM1bn investment - would be built to manufacture
the engines, whose core prototype, the BR700, is due to be developed by
1993.
A decision on the site would be taken by the middle of this year, and BMWRR
was likely to choose eastern Germany. Rolls-Royce is thought initially to
have favoured a British site. BMWRR has been negotiating with Treuhand, the
German privatisation agency, to build an aerospace factory in the state of
Brandenburg, which surrounds the city of Berlin.
Mr Schneider said: 'The launch of the BR700 core is a major step for the new
joint venture company and will help strengthen the European aero-engine
industry.' The new factory will provide about 1,000 jobs.
BMWRR, founded as an autonomous joint venture last July, has one factory at
Oberursel, near Frankfurt, producing small aircraft engines. This will be
expanded and also produce parts for the new engines.
Mr Schneider said the company aims for annual sales of DM1bn by the year
2000, with the new engines accounting for about 60 per cent of sales.
It faces stiff competition in the emerging regional airline market -
estimated to be worth about Dollars 50bn (Pounds 29bn) in the next 20 years
 -from Daimler Benz, which has linked its jet engine subsidiary
Motoren-und-Turbinen Union with Pratt and Whitney, the jet engine unit of
United Technologies Corporation, the US high technology company.

FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases on rekindled
inflationary fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
DATA INCLUDED in first quarter gross national product statistics rekindled
infla-tionary fears and left share prices weaker yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.66 at 2,912.38. The
broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also marginally lower, down 0.23 at
379.02. The Nasdaq composite index of over the counter stocks fell 1.39 to
494.69.
New York SE turnover was light at 154m shares, and declining stocks
outdistanced advancing stocks by 866 to 657.
Shares opened lower after the government reported a 2.8 per cent decline in
first quarter GNP.
The figure was lower than average expectations, and the accompanying release
of a rise in the first quarter GNP implicit deflator - an alternative
measure of inflation which tracks domestically-generated price rises - to
5.5 per cent surprised analysts.
The figure suggests inflation remains a problem in the US, even though
economic activity has slowed significantly over the past year. Any sign of
inflationary pressures in the economy strengthens the case against further
interest rate cuts.
General Cinema rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 23 and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
(HBJ) fell Dollars  1/16 to Dollars after General Cinema announced it was
terminating its tender offer for HBJ bonds in the wake of the failure to
agree terms with HBJ bondholders. The termination of the tender offer
threatens the completion of the Dollars 1.4bn merger between the two groups.
Aetna, the big life insurance company, dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44
after reporting a fall in first quarter earnings to Dollars 1.25 a share,
against Dollars 1.61 a share a year earlier.
Mobil, which earlier this week unveiled a big rise in three month profits,
announced it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 7 1/2 cents to 80
cents a share. The news eventually lifted the shares Dollars  1/8 to Dollars
68 5/8 .
Disney eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 114 7/8 in brisk trading on news of a
fall in fiscal second quarter profits to 95 cents a share. The fig-ure was
at the low end of estimates, and compared with the Dollars 1.29 a share a
year ago.
On the over the counter market Pacific Healthcare jumped Dollars 5 1/2 to
Dollars 32 1/2 after the company said it expected second quarter profits of
between 50 cents and 60 cents a share, a forecast well above expectations.
Recognition Equipment fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 after cancelling
its proposed debt exchange offer because it could not agree terms with the
company's bondholders.
Canada
SHARE PRICES in Toronto bounced back from a small loss at the opening to end
flat for the second straight session.
The composite index finished up 4.78 points to close at 3,497.22 and take a
slim 1-point rise on the week. Advancers beat losers 261 to 252, and volume
of 23.7m shares was below yesterday's 25.3m.
Mining and consumer products were slightly lower, while consumer products,
energy, financial services and in-dustrial products all ended steady.
Noranda reported a slide in first-quarter net to CDollars 15m from CDollars
59m.

FT  27 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Trading account ends on sombre note
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER official warning against optimism on domestic interest rates and
disappointing GNP figures from the US left UK shares unsupported as the two
week equity trading account came to its close yesterday. The popping of
champagne corks in the offices of one leading UK marketmaking firm
apparently celebrated the end of its unusual financial year rather than any
specific view on the stock market.
The new trading account in equities extends for three weeks and covers the
period of the local elections in the UK; these are expected to test the
popularity of Britain's governing Conservative party.
The market yesterday repeated the trend of recent trading sessions by edging
forward from a slow start but quickly running out of support. Equities were
on the downside for most of the session and extended their losses when Wall
Street responded negatively in early trading to news of a drop in US GNP
over the first quarter of the year.
London managed a modest rally as Wall Street steadied to show a fall of only
3 Dow points as the UK market went home for the weekend. The final reading
put the FT-SE Index at 2,471.3, a net 10.8 down on the day. Seaq trading
volume increased to 536.5m shares from Thursday's 463.8m but the higher
turnover reflected increased inter-market business.
The stock market has fallen by just over 54 FT-SE points, or about 2 per
cent, over the two week equity account which closed last night. Most of the
fall came this week as the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of
British Industries warned of a deepening economic recession.
The Bank of England's signal to the London money markets that interest rates
should stay at 12 per cent for the present was no great surprise for the
equity market which has resigned itself to waiting for some time for any
further good news on the interest rate front.
Government bonds, which had been easier throughout the session, fell in late
dealings following the US data on gnp and inflation. Longer dated bonds
ended with losses ranging to about  3/8 of a point.
The trickle of equity rights issues, which is draining away institutional
cash holdings, continued, although yesterday's calls were modest; Guinness
Mahon, the merchant bank called for Pounds 49.3m and McAlpine, the
construction group, for Pounds 38.8m.
A poor interim statement from Guinness Mahon did little to lift the gloom
which has descended over the UK corporate sector this week as the evidence
of recessionary pressures has strengthened. Equity strategists, while still
optimistic for the end of the year, predict that shares may move sluggishly
over the second quarter of 1991.
After the substantial improvement seen in February and March, trading volume
has fallen away sharply and is struggling to maintain last year's average
daily levels.

FT  27 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Property sector lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Land Securities led most of the property sector lower after pessimistic
forecasts on property prices were published by Richard Ellis, the chartered
surveyor, and as BZW told clients to switch out of many sector leaders.
Richard Ellis forecast that for the 12 months to the end of January 1992,
the index of all property prices would fall 12 per cent. Offices would be
the hardest hit, down 22 per cent, and shops, 5 per cent lower, would be
least troubled. Rents would also suffer across the board.
BZW said investors should avoid companies heavily exposed to office
property. As well as Land Securities, down 14 to 515p, the broker identified
MEPC, 8 off at 524p, Greycoat, 2 easier at 338p and Great Portland Estates,
6 lower at 220p.
Trafalgar firm
Trafalgar House stood out among the FT-SE stocks, being bought ahead of the
interim results, due on May 8. One brokerage was a keen buyer earlier in the
week after upgrading the stock and was joined yesterday by another equally
determined house. Both were believed to be assuming that payment of the 8.8p
per share interim dividend would be maintained, leaving the stock on a
generous yield.
There was also talk of attractive break-up values if the group did decide to
hive off two of its three main trading divisions. These consist of property
investment, construction and engineering, and shipping and hotels. Against
the wider market, the shares rose 8 to 254p on turnover of 3.6m.
Composites lower
Composite insurers were weaker after a securities house lowered its profits
forecasts for most of the big stocks in the sector. Increased competition
among composites has gradually eroded profitability. The effect of this
started to be felt in first quarter and by the year end County NatWest is
forecasting that some of the leaders will report losses.
County has cut its 1991 forecast for Commercial Union to zero from a
previous estimate of a Pounds 50m profit; a loss of Pounds 95m against no
profits is expected by General Accident; while Royal Insurance is forecast
to make a Pounds 90m loss against Pounds 25m previously. CU closed 9 lower
at 499p, General Accident eased 5 to 519p and Royal Insurance slipped 10 to
432p.
McAlpine cash call
Another rights issue found the building sector distinctly edgy. The deluge
of cash calls, 16 so far this year, continued when Alfred McAlpine called
for Pounds 38.8m to reduce borrowings of around Pounds 80m.
The shares dipped amid claims that the proposed funding was 'a mercy call'
but Mr Graeme Odgers, recently-appointed chief executive, denied this,
saying 'there is too much money going out of the group by way of interest
payments'.
Analysts tended to agree with both his views and strategy, They stressed,
however, the benefits were not going to come through quickly and thought the
shares in the meantime could be caught up in the sector's weakness. They
fell 28 yesterday to 258p.
The rights issue will strengthen McAlpine's ties with Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez. The French group is buying some of the rights entitlement of the
McAlpine Family Trusts and will emerge with a shareholding of 12 per cent.
BTR bucked the market trend with a rise of 3 to 384p. Smith New Court
recommended the stock, saying that the company's good margins at the bottom
of the recession bode well for profits in any recovery.
There was no stopping Maxwell Communication, up 10 to 237p. US securities
house Goldman Sachs remained a determined buyer of the stock in spite of a
profits warning from the company during the week.
The Water Package bounced as Smith New Court said the recent fall was
overdone. 'Even a disastrous result for the government in next week's local
elections is in the price,' said Mr Steven Doe at Smith. The Labour Party
has said it would renationalise the water companies, although Mr Doe belives
that such would be the regulatory controls on other privatised industries
that water would not have a singularly high political risk. The package was
more than Pounds 100 better at one point and ended at Pounds 2955, up Pounds
85 on the day.
Individual water stocks followed suit. The best performer was Thames, 8
higher at 306p.
In a quiet oil and gas sector, the only busy trading was in British Gas. The
shares eased 3 1/2 to 244 1/2 p as 7m changed hands. Analysts are to attend
a presentation on Monday to hear the long-awaited results of a review of
British Gas pricing by the government regulatory body Ofgas.
The talk yesterday was that the new formula would specify that price rises
should be kept to Retail Prices Index minus 5, compared with the current
figure of RPI-2. There could also be firmer controls over how much British
Gas could pass on higher gas costs to customers. 'This would be a tighter
regime than expected,' said Mr Steve Turner of Smith New Court.
Volume in diversified engineer Dowty rose to an unusually high 3.3m shares.
SG Warburg was a persistent bidder of the stock. The price ended unchanged
at 184p.
Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank in which the Bank of Yokohama has a 65 per
cent stake, was unchanged at 45p after it made a Pounds 49.3m rights issue.
A cash call had been anticipated. The market was not troubled by the
announcement of a Pounds 35m interim loss against a profit of Pounds 2m last
time. The shares were buoyed by the Bank of Yokohama's decision to supply a
Pounds 30m bridging loan to strengthen its capital base.
National Home Loans weakened following a fall in interim profits to Pounds
10.1m from Pounds 15.6m last time and on the announcement that it had made a
provision of Pounds 3.5m in its accounts against allegedly fraudulent
activity at one of its consumer finance subsidiaries. The shares were 5
lower at 129p but a positive statement from Mr John Darby, the chairman,
pushed NHL back to 133p, down a penny on the day.
British Airways rose 4 to 168p as 3.2m changed hands on US buying following
the recent rally in North American airline stocks. Anecdotal evidence of
increased passenger demand also buoyed the shares.
Albert Fisher added 4 at 121p after a series of presentations to Scottish
institutions.
Funding worries again beset ECC, the industrials materials group. Despite
the assurances given earlier this week that a rights issue was not a
consideration, the stock closed 8 down at 412p.
Y J Lovell was subdued by advice not to take up the new nil-paid shares
resulting from the rights issue. BZW told clients the cash call coupled with
a second batch of above and below the line write-offs in property and
waterside residential developments within the past 10 months was certainly
asking a lot of Lovell's already long-suffering shareholders. The shares
made no attempt to regain Thursday's sharp fall and closed easier at 143p,
for a two-day loss of 35.
John Mowlem was quoted ex the rights issue at 280p with the new nil-paid
shares at 16p premium, after having opened at 28p premium. Graham Wood
dipped 12 to 90p as the market became unreceptive to small sales.
A sell recommendation in a weekly investment magazine left property and
motor distribution company Wyndham 11 down at 7p.

<TEXT>
PUMA, the German sports shoe company owned by Aritmos of Sweden, returned to
profit in the first quarter of 1991 after several years in the red caused
mainly by a disastrous US performance.
'The turnround is here,' said Mr Hans Woitschatzke, chief executive
(pictured below).
Puma had hoped this would be achieved in 1990, but was hit by supply
problems in the Far East and made a loss of DM8.9m (Dollars 5.2m), against
one of DM2.6m in 1989.
Shoe production in the Far East was partly shifted from Taiwan and South
Korea to lower-cost Indonesia. However, organisational and logistical
problems there, as well as a fire in the Philippines factory, forced Puma to
pay DM10m in air freight costs to keep dealers supplied.
With these difficulties largely solved, Puma earned a first-quarter net
profit in 1991 of DM6.8m, against a loss of DM3.6m last time. Turnover rose
by 30 per cent to DM162m, with most of the increase coming in Germany.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A THREAT to the completion of a scheme of arrangement for Bond Corporation
Holdings was lifted yesterday when the liquidator of a creditor dropped
legal action against a Bond Corp subsidiary.
Mr Richard England, the liquidator to JN Taylor Holdings, said he had
decided to withdraw an action for the winding up of Bond Corp Finance, which
could have blocked progress on the scheme of arrangement.
Mr England agreed earlier this month to suspend the action in return for
access to the books of Bond Corp, but had retained the option of winding up
Bond Corp Finance in pursuit of debts of around ADollars 180m (USDollars
138.4m).
The withdrawal of the winding-up action means Bond Corp officials can go
ahead with final details of the scheme of arrangement, which is intended to
provide a partial return to creditors through a debt-for-equity swap.
Mr Kim McGrath, Bond Corp's executive director, said he was 'very pleased'
by Mr England's decision, and urged other creditors to support the scheme of
arrangement.
'It is certainly in their best interests. While there is still a
highly-charged emotional context in relation to Bond Corp, it is the
sensible thing to do,' he said.
Bond Corporation's European bondholders are due to meet in London and Geneva
next month to discuss the scheme of arrangement.

VALEO, France's leading producer of car components, yesterday predicted that
output at Japanese-owned car plants in Britain could rise to around 1m
vehicles annually by the end of the decade.
Mr Noel Goutard, chairman, said Nissan, Honda, and Toyota, the three
Japanese car makers with assembly plants in the UK, had the capacity to
double by the year 2000 their own forecast of around 500,000 vehicles by
1995.
This compares with Japanese car makers' forecast for UK production of
300,000 vehicles in 1992.
Valeo, which has invested heavily in Britain over the past four years, is
aiming to double its UK turnover by 1995, with Japanese car makers providing
the main growth in demand.
The French group makes security systems, clutches, climate controls and
wipers at four UK plants, to which it is about to add a fifth.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Cinema, the holding company whose interests include retailing and
entertainment, has terminated its tender offer for the publicly-held debt of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the troubled US publishing and insurance group.
It seems unlikely the Dollars 1.4bn bid by General Cinema for Harcourt will
now proceed. Harcourt Brace junk bonds fell on Wall Street after the
announcement, while the shares slipped Dollars  1/16 to Dollars .
The offer was conditional on a successful tender offer by the bidder for at
least 90 per cent of the five outstanding public debt issues. but despite
several months of negotiations with bondholders, no agreement between
General Cinema and the investors over the terms proved possible.
The Massachusetts-based General Cinema has walked away from deals in the
past - it last year dropped an offer to buy in a minority stake in Neiman
Marcus, the US retailer, after stockholder resistance to the terms - and
said yesterday that it was 'moving on to other acquisition possibilities'.
Harcourt Brace, meanwhile, said it 'must now consider all its available
alternatives'.
The company made a net loss of Dollars 80.9m in 1990.

PROCTER &amp; Gamble's high-profile dispute with the US Food and Drug
Administration over the labelling of its Citrus Hill orange juice as 'fresh'
has ended in victory for the federal authorities.
P&amp;G, a large consumer products manufacturer, said yesterday that it would
delete the word 'fresh' from its Citrus Hill Fresh Choice label from the
middle of next month.
The company still maintains that its labelling was not inaccurate, but said
that consumers and retailers had become thoroughly confused.
Food-labelling has become a highly-politicised matter in the US, and the FDA
gave the first indications of a new, and tougher, stance earlier this week
when it seized stocks of Citrus Hill.
P&amp;G said yesterday that the seized stock - which was originally destined for
a supermarket customer - had been moved to another warehouse and would
probably be donated to a foodbank.
It declined to say how much the episode had cost the company.

<TEXT>
AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, the largest investor-owned insurance company in the
US, added a further Dollars 52m to reserves for bad real estate loans and
investments in the first quarter of 1991.
As a result, net realised losses for the quarter totalled Dollars 16m, with
the Dollars 52m provision being partially offset by Dollars 36m of realised
capital gains.
This compared with net realised gains of Dollars 20m in the first quarter of
1990, and contributed to a sharp fall in Aetna's first-quarter profits, from
Dollars 180m to Dollars 137m after tax.
Aetna added Dollars 224m to reserves in the fourth quarter of 1990. It said
this brought loan reserves to 'an appropriate level'.
At the end of 1990 total real estate write-downs and reserves for mortgage
loans amounted to Dollars 550m.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the US investment bank, is withdrawing from the business of
processing American depositary receipts (ADRs) of South Africa companies.
The decision is a victory for US anti-apartheid campaigners, and a big blow
to South African businesses which rely on ADRs as a means of access to US
investors. In the past year two big US banks, Chemical Bank and Security
Pacific, have stopped processing South African ADRs.
JP Morgan said ADR activity had become increasingly viewed in a negative
light and that its decision to withdraw was in deference to 'sincere and
strongly held views on a uniquely sensitive issue'. The bank said it had
responded to the views of its shareholders and clients, especially local
municipalities and states.
The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), which has played
a prominent role in condemning US banks for promoting US investment in South
African companies, expressed delight at JP Morgan's decision. It said: 'This
sends a powerful signal to South African businesses and the government at a
crucial time in their negotiations with the country's black leadership.'
The ACTWU also called upon the US banks that still issue South African ADRs
to follow JP Morgan's example, citing Citicorp and the Bank of New York as
remaining issuers. Neither bank would comment.
ADRs are baskets of foreign company shares held in custody by US banks. They
are designed to make it easy for US investors to buy equity in overseas
companies. Most South African ADRs, and all those handled by JP Morgan, are
'unsponsored', which means the bank has no commercial relationship with the
South African companies, and only acts as a depositary for the ADRs.
JP Morgan is the biggest processor of unsponsored South African ADRs.
According to the ACTWU, the bank acts as a depositary for over 50 South
African companies.

FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 39m rights issue will give Lyonnaise
12% of McAlpine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Alfred McAlpine, the construction and house building
group, fell by almost a tenth yesterday after the company announced a
1-for-2 rights issue to raise Pounds 38.8m.
As a result of the issue Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, one of Europe's biggest
construction companies, would increase its stake in McAlpine from 6 per cent
to 12 per cent.
Mr Graeme Odgers, McAlpine's chief executive, said the two companies had
previously agreed that Lyonnaise could increase its share holding to 12 per
cent. He had been assured that the French group had no intention of making a
bid for McAlpine.
Lyonnaise will increase its stake by buying the bulk of the new shares
issued to the McAlpine family trust by the rights.
The family's stake in the business would fall from 25.6 per cent to 19.5 per
cent.
It was the second day running that a cash call from a construction company
had been poorly received by the stock market.
On Thursday the share price of YJ Lovell fell by 18.5 per cent to 145p
following the announcement of a 2-for-5 rights issue to raise Pounds 30m.
Yesterday Lovell's share price fell further to 143p, only 13p more than the
offer price for the new shares.
Alfred McAlpine's share price fell from 286p to 258p. The company is
offering one new share at 225p for every two already owned. This would give
a theoretical ex-rights price of 265p - 8p more than last night's closing
price.
Institutional investors may have become disenchanted with the volume of
paper which has been issued by construction, building materials and property
companies. These have sought to raise more than Pounds 1bn, accounting for a
third of all rights issues since the beginning of January.
Mr Odgers said the company needed the money to reduce its high level of
borrowing and to strengthen its UK house building and contracting
businesses. It would also be looking to invest in its US contracting and
building materials operations.
Group borrowings were averaging Pounds 80m, equivalent to more than 60 per
cent of shareholders funds.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to the end of October fell by 61 per cent
to Pounds 9.2m. The group has reorganised its businesses, reduced its
workforce by 8 per cent and strengthened its management following the
appointment of Mr Odgers.

FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Guinness Mahon shows Pounds 36m loss -
Pounds 49m rights issue will lift group asset base to Pounds 94m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS MAHON Holdings, the merchant banking group, yesterday confirmed
plans for a Pounds 49.3m rights issue following disclosure of midway losses
of Pounds 35.5m mainly due to provision against bad debts. The Bank of
Yokohama, which owns 65 per cent of the company, will effectively underwrite
the issue and tighten management control.
The issue will be on the basis of seven for four at a price of 44p. The
shares closed last night unchanged at 45p.
Bank of Yokohama will take up its entitlement, and will also sub-underwrite
the balance, which is being underwritten by Schroder Wagg and Lehman
Brothers International. The Japanese bank will advance Guinness Mahon a
Pounds 30m bridging loan so that its capital ratios remain in order until
the rights issue proceeds are received. The issue will raise the group's net
assets from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 93.6m.
Details of the capital-raising were accompanied by changes in the top
management structure and group strategy.
Mr Geoffrey Bell, the executive chairman, will move to a non-executive role.
Mr David Potter, who runs the merchant bank, will become chief executive of
the group and chairman of the merchant bank. Bank of Yokohama's
representation on the 12-person board will rise from three to four with the
appointment as a non-executive director of Mr Takaaki Shinozaki. He will
also become deputy chairman of the merchant bank.
More Yokohama executives will also join Guinness Mahon's management, and
will play a larger part in credit and lending decisions. Several executives
have left the group, and a number of new appointments were announced
yesterday.
Mr Bell said the group's strategy would be refocused away from corporate
lending towards fee-earning services, particularly in the corporate finance
area. Asset management and securities trading, both of which are benefiting
from the recent upturn in the stock market, would also be developed. Leasing
activities would be closed down.
However Mr Bell warned that it might be necessary to make further loan loss
provisions, and the bank was unlikely to return to profitability for some
time because loans were not earning interest.
'The next stages in the development of GMH will be very challenging and the
need to succeed is paramount,' said Mr Bell.
The results for the six months ending March 31 showed a loss of Pounds
35.5m, mainly because of a bad debt provision of Pounds 30m. The leasing
division, which concentrated on smaller computing service and printing
companies, needed a provision of Pounds 7m. The property book required
provisions of Pounds 3m, as did the Irish subsidiary, and the shipping book.
There were also provisions of Pounds 10m against two large corporate names,
one of which is believed to be Polly Peck.
Non-merchant banking activities made a loss of Pounds 492,000.
In the first six months of last year, there was a net profit of Pounds 2m.
No interim dividend is to be paid (0.8p)- a total of 1.45p was paid last
time.
Mr Ken-ichi Ozawa, deputy chairman of GMH, said the Bank of Yokohama had
confidence in the new management team and its ability to overcome 'this
difficult situation'. He said he believed the group could 'regain its
position and reputation as an important force in UK merchant banking
capitalising on its Japanese connections.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Turn and turn again: The Gorbachev balancing act goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We are making such a large turn that it is beyond anyone's dreams. No other
people has experienced what has happened to us.' - Mikhail Gorbachev, speech
in Khabarovsk, April 15 1991.
The Soviet people have been told in the past week that their country is
indeed making yet another 'large turn'. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet
president, has signed a statement with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president and the leaders of eight other republics which commits them all to
supporting order, ending strikes and the pursuit of an anti-crisis plan. The
signing of this statement greatly helped Mr Gorbachev to defuse attacks from
his hard-line critics at the party Central Committee plenum: his resignation
offer completed their collapse.
The world's greatest political acrobat, who has been on his knees in recent
months, showed that he was merely crouching to take another gravity-defying
bound.
At the same plenum, Mr Valentin Pavlov, the squat, close-cropped bruiser who
is his prime minister, said he was keen to form a 'more broadly-based'
government composed of representatives from the republics and other
non-communist political movements 'on the basis of compromise, law and order
and democracy'. The party instantly professed itself overjoyed at the
prospect of diluting its 73-year-old monopoly on power.
Logically, this is momentous: it constitutes a series of events as important
as any that have occurred in the six increasingly lean years of perestroika.
In Moscow, however, rats are being smelled. Why has Mr Yeltsin signed a
statement that promises repressive measures against the strikers he has
backed? Why has Mr Gorbachev, who said at the beginning of the year that the
preservation of the Union was his 'sacred task', apparently promised
independence to those republics which want it? Why is Mr Pavlov now so
accommodating after saying on Monday that coalition governments were 'not my
business' - and what terms is he offering, and to whom?
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the clever young economist who was the Russian
government's deputy premier, says that the Soviet Union faces, all at once,
movements and transformations which in other countries had taken centuries
or at least decades. These were, first, the creation of a civil society;
second, a series of liberation movements, freeing themselves from empire;
and third, the restructuring of the economy. Taken together, these added up
not to a crisis but to a profound and unprecedentedly radical
transformation.
Can these vast, diverse movements be handled through political institutions:
or is an explosion, sooner or later, inevitable?
The main institutional medium adopted by the Gorbachev-Pavlov government for
attempting the transformation is its anti-crisis plan. As presented, rather
fragmentarily, by Mr Pavlov, it is a middle course between two 'extremes':
doing nothing (certainly an extreme course in today's Soviet Union) and
adopting a plan of the type adumbrated by Mr Yavlinsky and Professor
Stanislav Shatalin last year, and known as the '500-day programme'. He
claims the first would see a drop in production of 20 per cent and a total
of 13m-18m unemployed; the second a drop in production of one third and more
than 30m unemployed. Mr Pavlov's plan would mean production falling by about
13 per cent, and unemployment rising by less (he does not say how much). Its
claim to effectiveness is thus that it is the best of a string of bad
options.
Its main provisions, shrouded in ambiguity, are
to stop inflation by controlling the money supply and cutting subsidies;
to recover the revenues stripped from the union budget by the refusal of the
republics to hand over their agreed contributions. All decisions taken by
republican governments which run counter to this will be suspended;
to stimulate enterprises by reducing profit taxes and allowing the retention
of hard currency where the profits are invested in the production of
consumer goods;
to encourage foreign investment through the granting of concessions,
allowing the repatriation of profits in hard currency;
to conclude an agreement between government, management and labour on wages
which would tie wage rises to increased production and productivity;
to 'destatise' medium and large enterprises by transforming them into
shareholding companies (with shares held initially by the Union and
republican governments)
to 'privatise' small businesses and shops as soon as possible.
For the influential critics on the liberal wing the programme is largely
seen as a sham. Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the former presidential economic
adviser, says it is 'a ruse to convince our western partners that we are
going to abide by the ideas of a market economy'. The leadership, he said,
had plans neither to control inflation nor the military industrial complex,
a 'monster whose appetites need to be cut back'.
Professor Anders Aslund, the knowledgeable director of the Stockholm
Institute of Soviet and East European Economy, told an IMF/World Bank forum
in Washington on Thursday that the plan did not address the root issues - a
budget deficit of between 15 and 20 per cent and the explosion of wages and
loss of monetary control. 'It is really difficult to imagine a worse policy
than the Soviet government currently pursues,' he said, forecasting an
'authoritarian stabilisation' later this year.
To these and similar critiques, Mr Pavlov and his followers increasingly
stress the Russian-ness of the raw material with which they are working. In
their view Russian-ness - seven decades of communism after centuries of a
pre-capitalist, serf-owning militarised society - means everything must be
taken slowly and carefully. This could be sensible - or a mere
rationalisation for inertia or, worse, for a party bureaucracy and hierarchy
which refuses to change.
Yet the political underpinning for a still undefined stabilisation seems to
be slotting into place. Mr Yeltsin, justifying his volte-face to his own
supporters on Thursday, talked of new freedoms for the republics and a
Gorbachev resigned to accepting that they would determine the shape of the
union treaty (and the union constitution), not the centre. The statement
also holds out the prospect of new union elections by the end of the year:
the tantalising prospect is, does this include an election of the union
president?
It is fearsomely fragile. The economy continues to plunge. The government is
unpopular, and will have to effect a really radical change in its
membership. This could perhaps resemble that which followed the round table
talks in Poland two years ago, after which (the lesson has been well learned
here) the communists dropped from real power like a stone. The Baltic
republics, with Georgia, Moldavia and Armenia do not want to join the new
union. The hardliners may have missed taking Mr Gorbachev's head, but they
live to growl, and perhaps strike, another day.
For the moment, a 'large turn' is official policy once more. How far will it
get this time round?

FT  27 APR 91 / Tarmac proposes Pounds 200m development for Cardiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC has put forward a Pounds 200m scheme to South Glamorgan County
Council for redeveloping a site linking the commercial and shopping centre
of Cardiff with its docklands waterfront.
The proposed project falls underthe urban development corporation set up
four years ago to regenerate 2,700 acres of Cardiff Bay. The Bay project is
the largest urban redevelopment being undertaken in Europe after London's
Docklands.
Mr Sam Pickstock, chairman of Tarmac Atlantic Wharf Developments, said in
Cardiff yesterday the scheme would go ahead even if the proposed Pounds 125m
barrage across the entrance to Cardiff Bay was not built.
The private bill to promote the barrage, which is seen as crucial to the
development, collapsed in parliament last week. The government has since
said it will sponsor a new bill of its own to get the measure on the statute
book.
Mr Peter Mathias, director of Holder, Mathias, Alcock, the Cardiff
architects which designed the scheme, said the centrepiece was a crescent
based on London's Regent Street.
Tarmac was the first developer to operate in Cardiff, arriving three years
before the government set up an urban development corporation in 1987. It
has spent more than Pounds 50m and committed another Pounds 25m on houses,
commercial building and site clearance.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Time to invest: South Africa's President FW de Klerk told British
businessmen yesterday that his country was ready politically and
economically to restore full trading links with the world.
He urged the 300 executives at the Confederation of British Industry to be
part of the fundamental changes taking place in South Africa
'We want you to profit by what is happening,' he said.
He offered the prospect of expansion to investors already in his country and
invited others to share in 'the new South Africa'.
Mr de Klerk was invited by the CBI to address members at the end of his
week-long tour of European countries, during which he sought to encourage
trade and investment and end remaining sanctions.
'The time is now, if we really wish to capitalise on the window of
opportunity history has given us,' he said. 'Now is the time to invest in
reform.'
The audience sought assurances that South Africa would remain stable and
viable as it transformed to a multi-party and multiracial system of
government.
The president said all parties realised there would have to be a strong
economy offering jobs and prosperity for everyone.
He accepted that South Africa faced a lack of skilled labour and said it
would welcome immigrants with appropriate training to help economic
progress.

FT  27 APR 91 / Brooke says talks will 'see off terrorists'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE taking part in talks next week about the future of Ireland will 'see
off the terrorists', Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said
yesterday.
British and Irish ministers met in London yesterday under the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement before round-table talks involving both governments
and the province's political parties start in Belfast on Tuesday.
They set July 16 for their next conference under the agreement - leaving 11
weeks for talks, during which the agreement will effectively be suspended.
Unionist leaders yesterday insisted that the Republic of Ireland's
constitutional claim on the province had to be removed before a 'normal
relationship' was possible between the two parts of the island.
Mr Brooke expressed qualified optimism about the talks which may forge a new
Anglo-Irish pact. He said there was a 'purposefulness' shared by all the
participants. Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, was more upbeat.
Agreement has still to be reached on the venue for later stages of the
talks, when discussions will widen to cover relations between north and
south Ireland and between London and Dublin.

FT  27 APR 91 / Standard Chartered staff given 5.5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the British-based international bank, is to award its
2,000 clerical staff a pay increase of 5.5 per cent on basic pay and
allowances from April 1.
An additional one-off unconsolidated payment of 2 per cent will be paid next
month to compensate staff for the fact that Christmas bonuses will not be
paid after this year.
The increase is among the lowest in the banking sector, although pay
increases generally have been below inflation.
Earlier this month National Westminster Bank told its employees it was
imposing a 7.5 per cent pay increase, in spite of strong opposition from
Bifu, the financial services union, which is organising a strike ballot in
pursuit of an improved offer. Members of the NatWest Staff Association voted
in favour of the offer.
Lloyds Bank is to raise staff salaries by only 5 per cent. Barclays Bank,
the first of the big four clearing banks to settle on pay, agreed a package
worth more than 7 per cent while a 6.75 per cent offer at Trustee Savings
Bank has been rejected by Bifu.
Bifu said yesterday that the pay award from Standard Chartered had been
accepted by its negotiators and would be formally ratified after
consultations with members.

FT  27 APR 91 / Tax debate dominates election battles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour and Conservative parties are banking on winning the debate over
the replacement for the poll tax as electioneering for the Monmouth
by-election begins and the council campaign enters its final days.
The cost to households of the government's proposed 'council tax' and
Labour's 'fair rates' yesterday dominated clashes as the council campaign
intensified ahead of polling next Thursday.
Meanwhile, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, launched the Conservatives'
campaign to retain the Monmouth constituency on May 16 with figures showing
how the council tax would affect its voters.
The party is defending a majority of 9,350 against strong campaigning from
Labour and the Liberal Democrats. All three parties are anxious to make a
good start in the campaign that will influence Mr John Major's choice of a
general election date.
Labour, which believes it has already established itself as the main
challenger to the Tories, sent Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, to
campaign. The Liberal Democrats fielded Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader.
In 1987 Labour came second, but the former Alliance parties were less than
2,000 behind. The present contest was caused by the death of Sir John
Stradling Thomas, a former deputy chief whip.
Mr Hunt said the average Monmouth household would pay Pounds 194 under the
Tory proposals compared with a rates bill of Pounds 453 under Labour's.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, retal-iated by claiming the
Tories were favouring a scheme in which the average house-hold would be
'surcharged' to subsidise the wealthy and single-person households. Labour's
proposals, he insisted, would cost the average household Pounds 67 less than
the council tax.
The Liberal Democrats will this weekend list councils on which the party
expects to take control next week.

FT  27 APR 91 / Many companies seek leave to build wind farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has a strong application list from companies wanting to build
wind farms to supply electricity as an alternative source of power.
Together their schemes would generate twice as much electricity as Mr John
Wakeham, energy secretary, envisaged for this year's applications.
Wind farms consist of collections of turbines powered by the wind.
Electricity is produced when the wind turns blades connected to a generator.
Among the bidders are PowerGen and National Power, the privatised power
companies, which rely primarily on fossil fuels. The largest is the Wind
Energy Group, a company jointly owned by Taylor Woodrow Construction and
British Aerospace.
Companies have recently finished bidding for inclusion in the 1991 tranche
of the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). Under this system,
renewable-energy projects - such as wind power - and nuclear projects are
supported by a levy on the power industry.
Mr Wakeham said he expected between 60MW and 120MW to be included in the
NFFO round this year. The bids submitted have topped 250MW. That is
equivalent to about 800 wind turbines compared with about 40 at present in
operation in England and Wales.
The Wind Energy Group has applied for 90MW involving 300 turbines on 14
sites.

FT  27 APR 91 / British Gas close to price formula deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS must announce details on Monday of its review of prices it
charges 17m domestic customers for gas, or face another clash with the
Office of Gas Supply, its regulator.
Ofgas said yesterday it would make public its own proposals for the new
tariff formula to cover gas prices for the next five years. Ofgas added,
however, that Mr James McKinnon, its director-general, had not yet agreed a
new formula with British Gas.
British Gas has scheduled an announcement for midday on Monday when it must
announce its response to Mr McKinnon's price proposals or face having the
issue turned over to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full
inquiry.
Ofgas said it hoped agreement could be reached on Monday morning.
The regulator previously set the end of the month as a deadline for British
Gas to reply to Ofgas's suggestions for a new pricing formula - the result
of an 11-month review.
Under the present formula, British Gas raises gas prices to domestic
consumers by the rate of inflation less an efficiency clawback of 2
percentage points. The company is also allowed to pass on the full cost of
North Sea gas price rises to end-users.
The regulator is likely to push for an increase in the efficiency factor to
3 or 4 percentage points.
Many analysts believe that would give the company an incentive to cut
staffing levels and trim costs.
Ms Irene Himona, of London broker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull,
believes that on the basis of British Gas's profit forecasts for the next
five years, an increase in the efficiency factor to 4 percentage points
would halve the company's earnings-per-share growth from a rate of 9.5 per
cent to 4.5 per cent.
Mr McKinnon has also hinted that he would like to cut the level of costs
that the company can pass to consumers. So in future, the amount of North
Sea gas price rises that can be passed on may be cut from 100 per cent to 75
per cent.
The new pricing formula may also include performance standards for British
Gas. Since the company is a monopoly supplier to the domestic market, Ofgas
believes it must force British Gas to set public standards of service.

FT  27 APR 91 / Lessons in economics for private schools: The uncertainties
behind an apparently thriving independent sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to Mr David Woodhead, director of the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis), 'The independent school sector is thriving.'
Such confidence masks an uncertain time for the sector after its prosperity
in the 1980s.
The number of pupils at independent schools is up again (to 7.5 per cent of
the school-age population), but the national total masks a marked decline in
boarding numbers. Behind the figures, the breeze of competition is blowing
harder than it ever did in the 1980s, fanned by the declining numbers of
school-age children.
The sector remains strongest at the post-16 level: a fifth of all sixth
formers attend private schools. Recent growth has been particularly marked
at the lower end of the spectrum, with the number of pupils aged three to
six up by some 5 per cent on last year.
Many independent city and suburban day schools are flourishing. The leading
London day schools have some five suitable applicants for each place.
For boarding schools, however, the halcyon days are over, their numbers down
another 3 per cent on last year. Mr Woodhead blames 'antique stereotypes'
and 'changes in social custom', and Isis plans an autumn campaign to raise
the profile of the boarding sector.
Weekly and fortnightly boarding has helped to slow the trend. 'It is an
attractive formula,' says Mr Anthony Hart, headmaster of Cranleigh in
Surrey. 'You get all the advantages of a boarding life, but the children
don't lose contact with their families.' Even so, weekly boarding accounts
for barely one in ten of all boarders.
It is not only boarding schools that look to the future with some anxiety.
The recession is a pressing concern for them all. With annual fees averaging
Pounds 3,600 (Pounds 6,700 for boarders), up 12.5 per cent on last year,
many existing parents are hard pressed to keep up with the cost.
If the leading day schools are largely unscathed, their lesser brethren are
struggling to fill places. Introduction of co-education and on-site prep
schools are common responses among secondary schools.
The headmaster of Colfe's school in south London, which has done both,
comments: 'We need to get people at seven, 11 and 16; and there is no doubt
that times are hard for many of our parents.'
Competition between such schools is getting tougher. In a recent survey of
independent heads, four out of five anticipated greater competition, while
two thirds expected to spend more time and money promoting themselves. They
may even need to compete seriously with state schools again, if opting-out
and the national curriculum live up to ministerial hopes. 'Whereas in the
1980s independent schools were in competition with each other,' Mr Woodhead
says, 'they will have to start competing with a maintained sector offering
increasing choice and variety, and able to market itself effectively.'
The assisted-places scheme now pays part or all of the fees of 30,151 pupils
(6.4 per cent), yet it is far from being a source of relief for the less
successful schools. Most assisted places are to be found in the big city day
schools, and the likes of Haberdashers' Aske's, Dulwich College, and
Stockport and Newcastle Grammars, all significant beneficiaries of the
scheme, could comfortably fill their places without it.
The independent sector is making efforts to bridge the state/private divide.
Mr Arthur Hearnden, general secretary of the Independent School Joint
Council, is pioneering work-experience and teacher-training schemes spanning
the two sectors and has had a warm reception from the Department of
Education.
Finances apart, curriculum reform is a prime concern. Most independent heads
are suspicious of A-level reform. 'People talk about the gold standard,' Mr
Martin Rogers, headmaster of King Edward's Birmingham says, 'but A-levels
have long come off gold. We need a new exam that really stretches the most
able pupils.'
Yet for most independent heads, keeping the school full is the main
preoccupation. With good reason: more than half of all 'private' pupils are
located in the south-east. Independent schools no longer have the region's
traditional immunity from recession to help them, or even the left-wing
Inner London Education Authority as an unwitting accomplice.

FT  27 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: County stake shocked managers, jury
told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR managers at County NatWest reacted with shock and anger when they
first learned of the size of the bank's holding in Blue Arrow and the
resultant loss after the 1987 stock market crash, an Old Bailey jury heard
yesterday.
Mr John Owen, treasurer of NatWest Investment Bank, told the court he
attended a management meeting on December 17 held before County announced
that it owned a disclosable 9.5 per cent stake in Blue Arrow which led to a
loss of Pounds 49m.
The general reaction to the draft announcement being discussed was shock and
anger, he told Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, prosecuting.
'Shock at the extent of the losses and the implications for the firm as a
whole. Anger at the lack of general notice that many people felt they had
had. 'It had clearly been unexpected to some. The scale of the losses in
particular and the residual shareholding was much larger than many realised,
he said.'
Ms Christine Downton, the chief executive of County NatWest Investment
Management, was very angry at the implications for the reputation of her
division, he said. He later told Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a
County director and one of the defendants, it would have been 'improper' for
Ms Downton to have been told before of the holding, agreeing that that would
have breached a 'Chinese wall' within the County organisation.
Mr Owen agreed that he knew of the holdings taken by County, County NatWest
Securities and Union Bank of Switzerland, but was unaware the UBS stake was
covered by an indemnity from County.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result
of the Pounds 837m rights issue.
After the issue, NWIB faced a total risk of almost Pounds 160m.
Mr Owen organised an options hedge to protect against a fall in the share
price. That covered Pounds 83m of the risk and realised a Pounds 90m profit,
he said.
The trial continues on Monday.

FT  27 APR 91 / Merchant bank goes into administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent

<TEXT>
EDINGTON, the five-year-old merchant banking arm of Henry Cooke, the
Manchester-based financial services group, went into administration
yesterday to safeguard Pounds 20m of depositors' funds after a run of
withdrawals by local authorities.
Mr David Adams, chief executive of the Henry Cooke Group, blamed the
difficulties of Chancery, the London financial services group, which went
into administration in February. 'Local authorities have about Pounds 26m
frozen in Chancery and their advisers have been telling them to be very wary
of smaller banks,' he said.
The result was that local authorities, which temporarily withdraw funds at
the end of their financial year to balance their own books, have not been
putting them back on deposit shortly afterwards, as before. Up to Pounds 15m
was involved and that caused liquidity shortages.
'The bank's balance sheet remains strong,' Mr Adams added. 'Our action has
been taken with the full knowledge of the Bank of England. By going into
administration, we can ensure an orderly winding down and all depositors
will get their money back.'
The action also protects the more important Henry Cooke Lumsden (HCL)
stockbroking arm of the group. Both HCL and Edington are wholly owned by the
group, in which Refuge Assurance has a 20 per cent stake.
HCL, one of the biggest stockbrokers outside London, has 27,000 clients and
about Pounds 1bn under management. It survived the 1987 crash with only 5
per cent cuts in staff. It now employs about 220 people in Manchester, Leeds
and London.
Edington has had a bad debt arising from a fraud in the past two years, but
Mr Adams said that had been well contained. It resulted in changes in
Edington's senior management, however, including the departure of Mr Angus
Scrimgeour, its co-founder.
Chancery had a similar type of deposit book to Edington, attracting local
authorities and some corporate funds.
Lending activities were different and Chancery suffered in the recession in
property markets. Edington was involved in the relatively low-risk,
low-priced and well spread northern merger and acquisition market, as well
as regional lending for corporate expansion.
Edington's loans will now be managed by the administrator. The process of
winding down is thought unlikely to take less than two years.

FT  27 APR 91 / Manchester goes for gold: The costs of launching a bid for
the games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER has joined the billionaire bidding game that will preface the
millennial Olympics. The British Olympic Association in London this week
unanimously backed the city's bid to stage the games in the year 2000.
Should Manchester win, the rewards could be substantial.
An independent study last year put the economic benefit of the north-west of
England holding the Olympics at Pounds 2bn of direct and indirect
investment; 50,000 jobs; a Pounds 500m boost to the UK balance of payments;
and an increase in government tax receipts of about Pounds 160m.
The host city will be chosen by the International Olympic Committee in
September 1993. Manchester's rivals are expected to include Berlin, Peking,
Sydney, Milan, Brasilia and Belgrade.
National Westminster Bank was quick to pledge Pounds 100,000 to back
Manchester's efforts. Now Mr Bob Scott, chairman of the bid committee, is
drawing up a list of leading businesses in the north-west that he hopes will
give a total of Pounds 3m to back the games campaign. Capital costs of up to
Pounds 500m for stadia and facilities will not be involved at this stage.
Mr Scott, a former theatrical impresario who conceived and ran Manchester's
unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics, said yesterday: 'I am quite
puritanical about this. We do not need to spend a lot of money and if Pounds
3m is not enough, I would even question whether it would be worth it.'
Atlanta, which last year beat Manchester and four other cities for the 1996
prize, spent Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.7m) on its bid, most of it provided by
business in the state of Georgia. Manchester started off last time by
raising Pounds 2m and then had to go back to sponsors for another Pounds 1m
to keep going.
The mood among north-west business leaders this time is bullish.
'Everyone is going to take things much more seriously. We have had our
rehearsal and now we know better what to do,' said Mr Mel Harding, of the
Manchester Financial and Professional Forum, which represents the city's
financial industry.
The bid, with the Duke of Westminster acting as president, is in
Manchester's name because the Olympics are always awarded to a particular
city, but it will cover the north-west region, with someevents staged in
Cheshire, Lancashire and Merseyside.
The last attempt did more to unite the region than anything anyone can
remember. Rivalry is more normal, especially between Liverpool and
Manchester. 'It was a hell of a good thing for all of us,' Mr Jeremy Weston,
managing director of Barlows, a Chester-based investment group, said
yesterday.
He added: 'Everyone knows that a nine-year economic benefit will flow if we
can succeed. Since this would have a wider impact than on just the region
alone, we must also ensure that this becomes seen nationally as the British
bid, with full backing from everywhere.'
Mr Michael Potts, a partner of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte accountancy
firm in Liverpool, was more cautious. 'This is not a good climate in which
to start raising money. Times are hard and we may need to see the recession
further behind us before some companies will commit themselves.'
However, Mr Scott has drawn up a list of businesses he hopes will take the
longer view already shown by NatWest.
On the list will be large companies with head offices or substantial
interests in the north-west. It will almost certainly include ICI, Shell,
Coats Viyella, Manchester Ship Canal, Littlewoods, Royal Insurance, Granada
TV, Norweb, Manweb, North West Water, Manchester airport, Barclays, British
Nuclear Fuels, Greenall Whitley, Patterson Zochonis, GEC, Ford, General
Motors, the Co-operative Bank, Co-operative Insurance, Refuge Assurance,
Amec and Royal Bank of Scotland.
The bulk of those supported the bid last time and most accepted that it was
in itself good for business, so success was not too important. A much
clearer determination to win the right to host the games is now evident.
Mr Scott said Manchester City Council, led by Mr Graham Stringer, a Labour
moderate, had agreed to underwrite the games on the strength of an
assessment by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, that they would be
financially sound if the bid succeeded.
The two crucial factors were transport and the long-term viability of any
facilities that had to be built. 'We already have Britain's best regional
network of motorways, major roads and other transport, as well as the
fastest growing international airport in Europe,' Mr Scott said.
'Most of the stadia and other facilities are already planned and will be
built whether we get the games or not, so the financial questions have
already been answered for most of the capital costs. As for the games
themselves, they would certainly make a profit.'

NORTHERN Telecom, the Ulster telecommunications company, yesterday announced
205 redundancies at its Monkstown factory near Belfast. That brings to more
than 800 the number of job losses in Northern Ireland this week.
The company, a subsidiary of Northern Telecom Incorporated of Canada, makes
advanced transmission systems, terminals, telephone sets and fax machines.
It said the job cuts were necessary to enhance long-term business prospects.
'A number of the redundancies will reflect lower-than-forecast levels of
demand in some areas, symptomatic of the general economic climate.'
Northern Telecom was formerly STC (Northern Ireland). In February, STC made
350 temporary employees redundant at the Monkstown plant.
Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, said: 'Northern Telecom
(Incorporated of Canada) is a major multinational with an annual turnover of
close to CDollars 9bn (Pounds 4.58bn) and 62,000 employees. With the
telecommunications sector throughout Europe undergoing rapid and
far-reaching change, the company has been examining how the former STC
telecommunications operations might be restructured for the long term.'
Mr Needham said that under the new business structure, the company would
continue as a high-technology plant responsible for the manufacture and
development of new products.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON, beaten by Manchester in the contest for Britain's Olympics bid, had
hoped the games would have proved a fillip for development in Docklands and
a spur to transport and other spending.
The London Docklands Development Corporation yesterday played down the
significance of the Olympics in helping to regenerate London. The LDDC said
it had provided advice to the London Olympic Campaign but had begun meeting
the organisers only recently.
London's bid failed on several grounds, according to those at the selection
meeting.
Lack of preparation: two rival groups were making competing bids for London
until the end of January.
Hazy details: many aspects of the London bid reflected the lack of
preparation, with vague pledges for transport links and sports facilities
which were expected to be completed in time but could not be guaranteed
Lack of leadership: Sebastian Coe, the former Olympic medal winner who was
leading the team, admitted to the committee that his first priority was his
campaign for election as a Conservative MP.
Insufficient backing: there was lukewarm support from the London boroughs
and a refusal by the City of London to be titular head.

MR Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former Japanese prime minister, was yesterday
re-admitted to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, ending a two-year
banishment imposed for his involvement in the Recruit financial scandal.
Mr Nakasone's return will pave the way for other Recruit-tainted politicians
to make political come-backs, including Mr Noboru Takeshita, another former
prime minister who resigned from office at the height of the scandal in
1989. Mr Takeshita has retained great influence behind the scenes and is
widely thought to be considering campaigning for the prime ministership once
more, when Mr Toshiki Kaifu's term expires in October.
Mr Nakasone's recovery highlights the extraordinary flexibility of Japanese
politics, where policy and principle are less important than personal
ambition. Mr Nakasone was allowed back precisely because Mr Takeshita and
other senior figures involved in the Recruit affair feel his return will
improve their own prospects. One MP said LDP leaders had taken heart from
recent local elections in which the party had extended its lead over
opposition groups. This meant that 'people had forgotten about Recruit,' he
said.
Unlike Mr Takeshita, Mr Nakasone is no longer considered a candidate for
high office. He will not, for the time being at least, return to the
intra-party faction he headed, which has been taken over by his lieutenant,
Mr Michiyo Watanabe.
Mr Nakasone was never charged with any wrong-doing over Recruit but there
was widespread doubt over his role.

FT  27 APR 91 / World Bank rejects loans policy attack
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the World Bank yesterday outlined measures to counter US
criticism that the bank was not doing enough to help the private sector in
developing countries.
However, Mr Barber Conable, president of the bank rejected the notion that
it should have a specific target for private sector lending, as suggested by
the US.
He also said that support for direct lending to the private sector by the
bank, a controversial proposal also envisaged by the US, did not have strong
support from shareholders.
The US has suggested that the bank group direct 50 per cent of its lending
to the private sector by 1995 in negotiations over a capital increase for
the bank's private sector affiliate, the International Finance Corporation.
The IFC, which makes equity and debt investment direct to the private
sector, is seeking a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 760m) capital increase. Mr
Conable thought that at meetings over the next few days of finance ministers
in Washington, agreement could be achieved that an increase was needed.
Agreement over a figure would follow later, he said.
The measures to increase the bank's role in the private sector include
strengthening a private sector policy guidance committee, changing staff
guidelines to improve co-ordination between the Bank and IFC, and
incorporating the IFC into the development of private sector strategies for
borrowing countries.
Developing countries will face a shortage of official development finance
over the next decade, according to the World Bank's new chief economist.
Mr Lawrence Summers said a restoration of large transfers of development
money to third world countries was not in sight.
The World Bank group itself had transferred Dollars 9 per head of the
population (in 1991 dollars) to the developing world between 1975 and 1980.
Over the next five years, this figure would be Dollars 2. Those countries
not eligible to borrow from the Bank's soft loan affiliate would actually be
transferring money to the bank.
'Since there will not be much development money over the next decade, there
had better be a lot of good ideas,' he told a conference.
He said that improving the efficiency with which capital is used was more
important than the amount of transfers. Increasing productivity in
developing countries by a mere 0.2 per cent 'would do more for living
standards than an additional Dollars 100bn of capital.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Gorbachev to order crackdown on labour force: Stringent work
decree rounds off week of political success for Soviet leader
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Gorbachev ended a week of considerable political success with a
promise to the Supreme Soviet that he would soon sign a decree for a
'special, stringent regime of work and control' in the basic industries.
Appearing more relaxed and humorous than he has for months, the Soviet
president praised the patriotism of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
and the eight other republican leaders who signed a statement this week
expressing support for the anti-crisis plan, for a return of order and for
the conclusion of a union agreement.
Mr Yeltsin said he would today unveil a proposal which would allow the
thousands of strikers around the country to return to work 'in an elegant
manner'. Mr Yevgenny Arapov, deputy chairman of the Federation of
Independent Trade Unions, said Mr Yeltsin had discussed the joint statement
with the federation's leaders.
A one-hour strike called by the Federation and by the Democratic Russia
movement took place in parts of Russia - though not Moscow - yesterday.
However, the strike committee in Minsk, the Belorussian capital, suspended
action until May 21, when the republic's supreme Soviet reconvenes; and the
miners in Vorkuta called off the strikes in their area.
It now appears that Mr Gorbachev, and his prime minister, Mr Valentin
Pavlov, have managed to shore up the anti-crisis plan with a sufficiently
strong political base for an attempt to be made to implement it - though the
effect of a tough, sacrificial strategy on a people already enduring steep
price rises is incalculable.
In his speech to the Central Committee Plenum Mr Pavlov said the 10 per cent
drop in production and the Rs34bn budget shortfall in the first quarter of
the year had to be staunched by immediate, harsh measures. Republics would
be ordered to pay their budget contributions, special (undefined) regimes
would be instituted in basic industries, transport and banks, and strikes
would be banned.
At the same time, Mr Pavlov held out the prospect of a coalition government
(again undefined), and promised instant privatisation of small businesses
and 'destatisation' of medium and large enterprises by transforming them
into joint stock companies.
He appears to be winning grudging support from opponents and from western
observers. Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the former economic adviser to the president
who resigned when Mr Gorbachev refused to back a radical pro-market
strategy, wrote yesterday in Komsomolskaya Pravda that while the plan was
vague and probably inflationary,the agreement between the republican
presidents showed a possible consensus that 'the realistic way is to form a
new union from the republics that favour it and want to join it.'
A western diplomat said yesterday that the agreement showed that Mr
Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin were responding to a public mood which called for
practical results. He said he was 'not sanguine' that the anti-crisis plan
would work.

POLAND must raise import tariffs to protect domestic industry, Mr Andrzej
Zawislak, industry minister, told a Warsaw conference yesterday.
The statement marks the emergence of significant policy differences within
the government.
'No country has ever had as liberal an import policy as we have at the
moment and something has to be done,' Mr Zawislak told a conference
organised by the Finance Institute, an academic body affiliated to the
Finance Ministry.
He also asked if the austere monetary policies agreed with the International
Monetary Fund by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister, should be
modified. 'Has this policy not passed the point when it is still useful?' he
asked. 'I don't have an answer to that yet.'
The minister's remarks run counter to Mr Balcerowicz's economic policies,
which aim to force state companies to become efficient through external
competition and tight credit controls.
Industrial sales in the first quarter were 3.5 per cent lower than at the
same time in 1990. Mr Zawislak was speaking a few days after the government
bowed to pressure from farmers, angry about imports of food subsidised by
the EC, and increased food tariffs by an average of 10 per cent.
Mr Zawislak told the conference: 'The invisible hand is taking out the wrong
firms; the best companies, not the worst ones are being ruined.'
High interest rates had cut access to credit for modernisation, while
companies which had invested recently in new plant were having to pay a tax
on assets to the budget.
The stable exchange rate was also hurting export earnings as domestic costs
rose.
The Swiss Bank Corporation is planning to launch a fund next month worth
around Dollars 100m (Pounds 59m) designed to invest in Poland's
privatisation programme.
The Poland Fund is to be managed by Polish Investment Partners, a subsidiary
of the Polish Investment Company, in which the SBC holds a 23 per cent
share.

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S three largest semiconductor makers - Siemens of Germany, Philips of
the Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, the Italian/French group - are talking
about closer collaboration, including the possible joint financing of a
research centre in Grenoble.
The talks follow a call earlier in the week by Mr Pasquale Pistorio,
president of SGS-Thomson, for the creation of at least one world-scale
producer out of the three major semiconductor makers, all of which make
losses.
European chip executives say a merger of the three has not yet been
discussed in any depth. SGS-Thomson talked to Siemens last year about
merging their semiconductor activities but the German company rejected the
idea.
The three companies are talking, however, about collaborative research which
would go beyond the work being done by the Joint European Submicron Silicon
(Jessi) initiative.
Jessi, Europe's largest semiconductor programme, attempts to strengthen
European chip-making skills rather than producing products.
The three companies are discussing joint research which would result in new
semiconductor products, either through a widening of Jessi's brief or by
setting up a new programme.
Among the ideas being looked at is the joint financing by the three of a
common research centre in Grenoble. SGS-Thomson makes chips in Grenoble.
Mr Pistorio said at a conference in Brussels last Tuesday that the Ecu3.8bn
(Pounds 2.62bn) that Jessi planned to spend on semiconductor research in the
1990s was 'inadequate in size and spread over too many players'. Mr Pistorio
said it would cost double this 'to build a viable European world challenger'
by the end of the decade.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC research commissioner, agreed with Mr
Pistorio that 'the time has come to reach a critical mass' in European
semiconductor production.
Their comments follow a meeting last weekend in France between EC officials,
including Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and European
electronics executives.
The industrialists called for measures to assist the industry beyond a plan
presented by Brussels last month to channel more research money into
demand-creating infrastructure projects.
The competition directorate of Sir Leon Brittan, who did not attend last
weekend's meeting in France, has said it will scrutinise any plan by the
semiconductor makers to develop their joint research beyond Jessi.
A key factor in assessing the competitive impact of any European
restructuring will be the openness of the EC market to imports from outside.
At present, the EC charges 14 per cent import duties on imports of
semiconductors, compared to 4.9 per cent on the finished products
incorporating them.

FT  27 APR 91 / Fall in US output indicates recession is growing worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL US output fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter
of this year, confirming a worsening of the recession since Christmas, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The fall in inflation-adjusted gross national product was larger than many
economists expected and will provide further ammunition for the White House,
which is pressing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
Earlier this week, news of a 6 per cent decline in durable goods orders last
month dampened hopes of an early recovery from recession. Most forecasters,
however, still expect the recession to bottom out sometime during the
summer.
The 2.8 per cent annual rate of decline in real GNP in the first quarter
follows an annual rate of decline of 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of
last year. Two successive quarterly declines in GNP - the conventional
yardstick of a recession - were last registered during the 1981-82 downturn.
This week, the National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of prominent
American economists, formally dated the onset of recession to last July.
It said the business cycle peak of that month ended an expansion lasting 92
months, the longest since the 1960s and the second longest since 1854.
The bureau's pronouncements carry considerable weight. However, its timing
of the onset of recession clashes with that of the White House and Federal
Reserve. Both have argued that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August - and the
subsequent rise in oil prices and collapse of consumer confidence -
triggered the recession.
The first-quarter figures indicate that the profile of the recession is
changing. Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about two thirds
of economic activity, declined at an annual rate of only 1.4 per cent,
compared with 3.4 per cent in the final quarter of last year.
But the positive impact of this slowing in the decline of consumption was
offset by a sharp downturn in capital spending and a stalling of export
growth.
Non-residential fixed investment declined at an annual rate of 14 per cent
in the first quarter compared with growth of 0.1 per cent in the fourth
quarter of last year.

FT  27 APR 91 / Sanctions warning to Japan: Construction, intellectual
property worry Washington

<TEXT>
THE Bush Administration yesterday warned Japan it would impose sanctions for
its failure to open its public construction market and gave China, India and
Thailand six to nine months to improve their protection of intellectual
property before also facing trade curbs.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said the US would bar Japanese
companies from all federal government construction projects unless agreement
was reached in 30 days to improve access for US companies wishing to enter
the Japanese construction market.
Japanese companies have been making on average about Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds
1.4bn) a year for projects in the US market. US companies have won contracts
worth only Dollars 200m since 1988.
Mrs Hills identified China, India and Thailand under the Special 301
provision of the 1988 trade law as 'Priority Foreign Countries'. These are
countries whose failure to enforce laws protecting patents, copyrights,
trademarks or software is deemed to be 'the most onerous and egregious.'
Under Special 301, the trade representative may impose sanctions after six
to nine months of negotiations. Mrs Hills said the sanctions would be
'matched with the results' of the losses incurred by US companies.
In another action, Mrs Hills cited Norway for discrimination against US
companies in its government procurement practices.
She has requested consultations with Norway, who she said has violated the
Gatt procurement code by excluding US suppliers from the procurement of an
electronic toll collection system for the city of Trondheim.
She also cited the EC - and Germany, France and Italy separately - for
discriminatory practices in procuring heavy electrical equipment or
telecommunications equipment. She noted that US and EC negotiators recently
agreed to set December 1991 as a target date for 'substantial completion' of
an expanded Gatt Procurement Code.
Thus she will wait until January 1992 to review the European procurement
practices.

United Nations agencies had moved 'regrettably' slowly to help Kurds fleeing

Mr Kouchner is preparing proposals for EC member states to work together on

FT  27 APR 91 / Bush optimistic on Middle East peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday expressed optimism about peace prospects in
the Middle East although 'some sticky problems remain.'
'We're going to continue to try to bring peace to that troubled corner of
the world,' the president said.'
Mr Bush refused to elaborate on the cause for his optimism.
The president said he had telephoned Mr James Baker, the secretary of state,
who yesterday cut short his talks in Israel after hearing of his mother's
death.
Mr Baker's trip was interrupted at a key moment in his latest Middle East
mission as he sought to nudge Israel into regional peace talks.
However, his two weeks of roving diplomacy have produced two
accomplishments: Egypt's agreement to participate in a peace conference and
a Soviet pledge to play co-host.
News of his mother's death reached Mr Baker while he was meeting Israel's
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, on his second trip to Israel in a week. He
had arrived in Israel on Thursday night from the Soviet Union. He also met
leaders in Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the week.
Both Israel and the US are anxious to give the impression that the peace
process is still alive, despite disagreements between them. Israeli Foreign
Ministry officials said the two countries reached agreement on five issues,
including the co-sponsorship of the conference by the Soviet Union.
But two key issues that have yet to be resolved are Palestinian
representation at the conference and a possible role for the United Nations.
Israel rejects the participation of Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed
East Jerusalem and opposes a role for the UN in the conference, as demanded
by Arab states such as Syria.
Both Israel and the US see the regional peace conference as a means of
laying the groundwork for bilateral talks between Israel and Arab states and
between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israeli officials said Moscow's co-sponsorship of the peace conference was
dependent on the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Israel.
The other points agreed on, according to Israeli officials, were that Europe
would play a yet to be defined role in the peace conference; the conference
would not have the authority to reach or impose decisions; Israel would have
veto power over the conference reconvening to hear progress reports; and the
conference could be used to discuss other regional issues such as water,
development and arms cuts.
Because of his departure, Mr Baker was unable to meet defence minister Moshe
Arens and prominent Palestinians.

FT  27 APR 91 / Joint ventures gleam amid economic gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN joint ventures, a tiny and embattled part of the Soviet economy, are
growing strongly in spite of the surrounding collapse of the state sector.
Figures published by the State Statistics Committee show that the production
of all joint ventures increased nearly fivefold from 1989 to 1990, to reach
a value of Rs4.3bn (Pounds 1.37bn at the commercial exchange rate).
Industrial production by joint ventures quadrupled, to reach Rs2.3bn.
This is a tiny niche in an economy whose gross output (net material product)
was estimated last year at over Rs1,600bn.
Nevertheless, the rate of growth and the areas occupied by the joint
ventures - usually services and high technology - are pushing the sector
from negligible proportions into the category of small-but-important.
The total capitalisation of joint ventures last year was estimated at Rs7bn,
with the foreign partners owning 38 per cent of the total.
The committee's figures show the modest size of most of these enterprises -
64 per cent are capitalised at below Rs1m, with 90 per cent below Rs5m.
Some 2,905 joint ventures are now registered, of which only around one
third, 1,027, are operating. They employ 103,700 workers.
Almost half of the value of output, Rs428m, is in industrial production, of
which Rs199m was accounted for by information technology and spare parts.
Trade and catering accounted for Rs103m, and research and development Rs79m.

FT  27 APR 91 / Reed slims stake in BSkyB venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED INTERNATIONAL, one of the big five backers of British Sky Broadcasting,
said yesterday that it would not invest any more money in the satellite
television venture.
As a result Mr Ian Irvine, Reed deputy chief executive, resigned as both
chairman and a director of BSkyB. He will be replaced as chairman by Mr
Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, publishers of the Financial
Times.
The decision by Reed, which has committed more than Pounds 180m in equity,
loans and guarantees to BSkyB, was revealed to a BSkyB board meeting.
Reed's 10 per cent stake in BSkyB will now be diluted to around 4 per cent
and the company said last night it would write down at least its equity
stake in the venture - Pounds 34m net of tax.
Mr Peter Davis, Reed's chairman and chief executive, said last night he was
confident about the long-term potential for satellite television in the UK
and the viability of BSkyB. 'However, the board does not wish to increase
its investment further in BSkyB as we prefer to invest in our core
publishing and information businesses where we have more direct management
control.'
The issue came to a head over plans to raise a further Pounds 200m for the
venture following last November's merger of British Satellite Broadcasting
and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television.
The four main BSB shareholders - Granada, Pearson, publishers of the
Financial Times, Chargeurs and Reed - were expected to put up about Pounds
100m with Mr Murdoch being responsible for the other half.
The Reed board decision not to go ahead was unanimous. Granada will put up
its original share of the Pounds 100m package and Pearson and Chargeurs will
take up the slack left by Reed. The Pearson and Chargeurs stake will rise to
around 15 per cent each.
Agreement on the Pounds 200m package - Mr Murdoch will put up his share in a
mixture of cash and value such as film rights - is expected to be completed
at the beginning of next week.
Reed's decision was partly motivated by fears that the current fund-raising
of Pounds 200m might not be enough to see the venture through to
profitability.
The decision not to participate in further funding was taken in spite of the
fact that Mr Davis and Mr Irvine were instrumental in bringing BSB and Sky
together for what turned out to be successful merger talks.
In fact, Reed may have encouraged the merger in order to safeguard the
future of its Pounds 130m in guarantees and a Pounds 17m loan.
The Reed decision comes at a time when satellite dish sales are rising.
Market research carried out for Satellite TV Finance, a specialist FT
newsletter, also suggests that 54 per cent of subscribers to the old Sky
Movie channel will also buy BSB's Movie channel.

FT  27 APR 91 / PM faces growing pressure over NHS funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, will meet leaders of the medical
profession at Chequers today amid a new and mounting storm about the
adequacy of National Health Service funding.
The prime minister came under pressure from the British Medical Association
yesterday to change the agenda of the meeting - called to examine means of
improving health standards - and concentrate instead on ways of increasing
NHS finance. This followed an announcement on Thursday that Guy's hospital
in London, one of the first to become a self-governing trust under this
month's health reforms, is preparing to shed hundreds of jobs.
In Bradford, Dr Mark Baker, chief executive of another self-governing trust,
said 300 jobs could be lost over the next three years in a programme to save
Pounds 7m.
'The severe cuts at Guy's hospital expose alarmingly the worsening financial
state of the NHS,' said Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the BMA council.
He said it had taken only 26 days for the NHS reforms, launched on April 1
with what the government described as a smooth take-off, to hit turbulence.
Earlier this week Mr Major rejected a request from the BMA for a meeting to
discuss finance, saying the difficulty of the NHS was not one of
insufficient resources. The BMA council will consider its response to the
refusal on Wednesday.
Managers at Guy's want to shed at least 600 jobs to clear a Pounds 6.8m
deficit and release a further Pounds 6m for service developments.
Opposition MPs and union leaders reacted angrily to the news yesterday. The
issue was raised in the Commons with Ms Harriet Harriet Harman, shadow
health minister, demanding a government statement.
'The government has said that if Guy's opted out it would solve its
financial problems but they have only got worse. Now it's time for the
government to step in and solve a problem of their own creation,' she said.
Renewed controversy over funding so early in the life of the reformed NHS
will be unwelcome for the government - particularly as the most senior
managers at Guy's were until recently working in the Department of Health on
the introduction of the reforms.
But Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, said in an independent
radio interview that decisions like those at Guy's were for managers to
make.
Unless hospitals made savings in some areas they would not have money to
invest in new things.
The BMA said the need for cutbacks at Guy's showed that the hospital had
been unable to negotiate the funding contracts on which its application for
self-governing status - under which it manages its own day-to-day affairs -
was based, leaving it with a serious shortfall in income.
Mr Peter Griffiths, the hospital's chief executive, said his ambition was
for Guy's to have the best-paid staff in the NHS. But this could be achieved
only by having fewer employees and improved efficiency. He was hopeful that
the health service unions would negotiate on the proposals.

FT  27 APR 91 / UN may start taking over Kurdish camps within days

<TEXT>
THE United Nations may start taking over Kurdish refugee camps in northern
Iraq from allied troops within days, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN
secretary general, said yesterday.
But President George Bush said US troops would stay in northern Iraq as long
as they were needed to guard Kurdish refugee camps. Western diplomats say it
could take weeks to complete a UN takeover.
'We intend to take over as soon as possible,' Mr Perez de Cuellar told
reporters. 'We are working on it. It is a question of days.'
Mr Bush, speaking separately at a brief news conference, agreed that the UN
had a key role to play and said he did not want US troops 'hauled into some
conflict that's been going on for years'.
But US soldiers would 'stay there as long as it takes to make sure these
refugees are getting taken care of, and not a minute longer'.
He said he hoped President Saddam Hussein had learned a lesson about the
consequences of aggression, but he still wanted 'somebody with a little more
compassion as president of Iraq'. Until then, there would be no
normalisation of US-Iraq relations.
'His people don't like him, and it's only terror that's keeping him in
power,' Mr Bush said. 'But history has a way of taking care of tyrants.'
UN officials said yesterday that the death rate among Kurdish refugees
pouring into Iran had risen to nearly 2,000 a day, but many Kurds are still
fearful of returning home to Iraq following last month's failed uprising
against Mr Saddam.
Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has offered sanctuary to Iraqis on the Iraq-Kuwait
border who fear the loss of US protection as American troops withdraw.
US military aircraft will fly about 500 refugees a day from the southern
Iraqi town of Safwan to a camp at the Saudi town of Rafha. It could hold as
many as 20,000 refugees as well as thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war
reluctant to go home.
Mr Saddam and his ministers have opened negotiations with Kurdish guerrillas
and announced plans for nationwide political reforms since the allied
victory over Iraq in Kuwait.
Yesterday Mr Saddam lifted a ban on foreign travel, and his ruling
Revolutionary Command Council announced the disbanding of the 1m-strong
'popular army', a militia of teenagers and elderly men. He also appointed
Gen Hussein Kamel, the defence minister who is his son-in-law, to repair
Iraq's telephone network.
Mr Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish guerrilla leader who announced an agreement
in principle on Kurdish autonomy after a meeting with Mr Saddam this week,
was quoted as saying yesterday that negotiations had only just begun.

FT  27 APR 91 / Bush to call in G7 ministers: Germany comes under renewed US
pressure to cut interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush will call finance ministers and central bank governors
at tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in Washington into the White House to
press the case for lower interest rates.
In particular he is expected to increase pressure on Germany to cut its
rates and so help boost the world economy.
But Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, said in a speech in
Washington yesterday that German monetary policy would remain tight for the
time being to mop up excess liquidity which had been created by the economic
and monetary union of the two Germanys.
Repeated US demands for an easing of German monetary policy and the refusal
of the finance ministry in Bonn or the Bundesbank in Frankfurt to alter
their stance will make the G7 meeting difficult. If anything, the
differences on monetary policy and growth between the US and Germany have
widened in recent weeks.
In Bonn late on Thursday, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said
Germany was not prepared to lower rates and added that the US should not
seek to end its recession through inflation.
At the same time, a US Treasury official in Washington said European
pre-occupations with combating inflation appeared passe in view of the
problems facing the world economy since the political liberalisation of
eastern Europe and the Gulf war.
The US believes that Europe has failed to understand the implications of a
huge demand for finance from the Soviet Middle East. In these circumstances
it is feared high real interest rates threaten the world economy and
political stability. The US wants stronger global economic growth and is
concerned that growth in Europe is slowing and that there is no clear
evidence of recovery in the US, Britain and Canada.
The US Treasury official suggested that the time may have come for the G7
countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - to
shift their aims from achieving non-inflationary growth to achieving growth
with low inflation.
For its part, Germany will underline that it is performing an service for
the world economy through its financial support for the Soviet Union and
eastern Europe. Mr Waigel said in Bonn that Germany had earmarked DM25bn
(Pounds 8.3bn) for this purpose.
Mr Pohl said Germany's trading partners would benefit substantially from the
country's unification.
Strong growth in western Germany would be welcomed by countries in
recession, while a 'drastic decrease' in Germany's trade surplus provided an
important growth stimulus for Germany's trading partners, he said.
Mr Pohl said it was difficult to understand complaints that Germany was
draining global savings to finance union. Instead of blaming Germany, there
should be a sustained effort by all deficit countries to improve national
savings and bring about early implementation of agreed plans to boost the
financial resources of the International Monetary Fund.

FT  27 APR 91 / An evolving certainty that God cannot exist: Richard
Dawkins, the controversial biologist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING IN the intensity, the high seriousness, of Richard Dawkins's gaze
proclaims that in an earlier age he would have been a priest, or perhaps a
philosopher. The impression is strengthened by the delicacy with which each
word steps through the minefield of incorrect ideas.
Instead, he became a biologist at Oxford University, a champion of Darwinian
natural selection and later something of a hate figure among factions of the
Left. His two best-known books, The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker,
achieved huge popular success in explaining how Darwin's original ideas have
been refined by later research and how the modern theory can explain
apparent paradoxes such as self sacrifice and altruism in many species, the
'uselessness' of the peacock's tail or the amazing complexities of bats'
'radar'.
Such marvels of nature, which captured Darwin's imagination and attracted
generations of later biologists to the science, were for Dawkins, however,
beside the main point. 'It was not an interest in bird watching or bug
hunting, I am, in a way, sorry to say. It was a philosophical interest. I
have always been intrigued by questions of existence: why we are here; what
we are for; what is the ultimate purpose of everything?
'I suppose I was a deeply religious person in the sense of being interested
in religious questions, but I became deeply anti-religious in the sense of
the sort of answer one gave to those questions.'
Dawkins was at the Royal Institution in London to discuss next year's
Christmas Lectures for Young People, which he has agreed to deliver. He
leaned forward - as if to be sure that he was understood - across the old
desk that used to belong to Michael Faraday. The leather couch, the big
brass microscope and the soft gloom of the great 19th century physicist's
study all contributed to his passionate sincerity of purpose.
So wherein lies the magic, the secret of life, which so compelled him and
whose contemplation led Dawkins to conclude that God does not exist?
'The wonder that struck me and still strikes me is the wonder of complexity,
the improbability of it all, the fact that it is there at all. The essential
feature of life from my point of view is that it is statistically
improbable; and that is by definition difficult to explain. If anyone said
to you that the atoms of a watch or a telephone have come into the way they
are by chance, you would laugh and say 'don't be so stupid.'
'So we are seeking an explanation of how you can get from something that is
easy to explain - by definition something simple - to something that is
difficult to explain - something complicated.
'That is precisely what Darwinian theory does. It starts off with simplicity
and shows how you can move from the simple (the easy to explain) to the
complex (the difficult to explain) by gradual degrees and stages, without
demanding a leap of belief. Every step could come about by reasonable
transformations, never violating the laws of physics.
'For anything complicated to spring into being spontaneously, this principle
would have to violated.
'Now, the thing about a creator God is that he violates that principle. If
you are going to say that in the beginning there was a creator who thought
up the laws of physics and set everything in motion and created us, then he
has to be the complex improbable being of exactly the same type as you are
trying to explain, so you are defeating the whole exercise.'
In The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins says that if he had lived before 1859, when
Darwin published The Origin of the Species, he would have believed in The
Creator, as the best theory going. Does it follow that after 1859 any
biologist is a fool to believe in God?
'I daren't say that because some of my best friends are Christians. But let
me think . . . most of my colleagues would say there may be a God, but we
can't possibly know, that this is a separate question on which science has
nothing to say; that religion has its own world of discourse; that the two
don't meet and have nothing to say to each other.
'I don't feel that. I think agnosticism is, as nearly as one can say,
refutable.' But are there no counter argument which he respects?
'None that I think is good. People say, for example: God isn't complex, he
is exceedingly simple. In which case I would say God is not doing the job he
is supposed to do. More especially, if God is just one of the relationships
of physics, he has absolutely nothing to do with forgiveness of sins or
virgin birth. All the intricate complexity of theology, you're then
admitting, is so much eye-wash, because you are reducing God to something as
simple as a physical constant.'
But perhaps Dawkins's high certainty results from his being expert in a
branch of science whose central mystery has been solved. In physics, where
recent discoveries appear repugnant to common sense, some scientists - Roger
Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind, for example - seem imbued with a more
primitive sense of wonder.
'Quantum theory (which describes the behaviour of elementary particles) is
profoundly awe-inspiring because it is against common sense. The human brain
doesn't seem to be able to get to grips with the idea of a particle being in
two places at once.
'But a deity is a remarkably simple concept, a very naive childish concept.
In physics there is a profound mystery which we still do not understand,
unlike the case of biology, which we do understand; but what on earth makes
you think that that mystery is going to be removed by a deity? If it is ever
removed, it is going to be removed by something a lot more sophisticated.'
Does he feel that the vigour of his views has made him a hate figure in
certain quarters? . . . Well, seen as an extremist, perhaps?
'Let's stick with the phrase 'hate figure'. You raised it in the context of
religion; I think I am not at all a hate figure in religious circles.
'However, among a minority of intellectuals on the Left, I have become
associated with hate ideas - genetic determinism and reductionism - which to
them are sinister because they carry all sorts of political baggage, leading
in extreme cases to talk of Hitler, gas chambers and emotive stuff like
that.'
In The Selfish Gene, Dawkins argued that all living things are 'survival
machines' built to designs passed through generations by self-replicating
genes. Natural selection represents a no-holds-barred competition for
survival between genes. The characteristics of plants and animals (but not
human culture) are the result of this 'selfish' struggle between genes: only
the fittest survive.
'Some organs of the extreme fascist Right, some racists, have mistakenly
quoted my ideas. It all stems from a popular myth that if something - for
example, aggression or homosexuality - is genetically controlled you are
stuck with it and can't escape from it. No amount of education or social
workers will help; people are going to want and need to fight in just the
same way that they want and need to eat. That is a false myth, but you can
see that if you were a fascist or a left wing intellectual who believed it
you would seize upon what I write for different reasons.'
But don't people also dislike the Dawkins message because it is bleak,
uncompromising and destroys illusions?
'First, if the news is bad let's hear it. A lot of people don't understand
that. There are some unpleasant truths we need to know. Second, the news is
not that bleak: the selfish gene programs individuals to be altruistic in
order to favour the selfish interest of the gene itself. Third, human
behaviour does not have to be governed by genetic determinism. We can do all
sorts of things like give money to Oxfam which have nothing to do with
selfish genes, but a lot to do with culture. This is a completely different
process which in the looser sense is evolutionary. That gets us right away
from the message of the selfish gene as far as humans are concerned.'
Yet, don't some find the tough-minded Dawkins style of delivering this
message rather off putting - for example the way Hugh Montefiore, former
Bishop of Birmingham, was ridiculed for not understanding why polar bears
are white? Wasn't Darwin more gentle?
'I am gentle with individuals, but I am not the kind of liberal who thinks
if there are two points of view, the truth must lie somewhere between them.
We should not mince words nor give the time of day to a point of view that
is clearly wrong . . . But I could be persuaded that tactically this is not
the best way to do things . . . '
Still, wasn't it arrogant to come down so heavily on the university debater
who argued the case for creation without believing it?
'I felt aggrieved at being brought along to advocate a case which I
passionately believed in, only to discover other people were there
exercising their advocacy muscle.'
But why such passion? Surely, it is only the arguments that count.
'Passion is too strong a word . . . I suppose I do care about the really
fundamental truths about the universe: we spent centuries fighting our way
out of ignorance and superstition. I suppose I am passionate about that.'

IT PROBABLY won't surprise you that on Thursday I was called back to see the
sports minister, following my bumptious prediction nine days ago that
London, rather than Manchester, was bound to win the go-ahead to mount
Britain's bid to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000.
'Bit of a wrong steer, wasn't it?' said the sports minister crossly, blowing
his whistle and firing his starter's gun. 'Just a teensy bit addled, your
notion that London was home and dry and that Manchester - 'provincial,' you
called it - was too dire a place to win the nod in this week's vote by the
British Olympic Association?'
I still haven't caught the man's name. But I am confident that he is the
sports minister, given that on Thursday he was wearing another range of
vestments and accessories, among them a boxer's head-guard, a hockey club
blazer, tennis shorts, running shoes and an archer's quiver (containing, I
chanced to notice, two wickedly barbed arrows).
As before, the minister was attended by his political secretary, a
fresh-faced youth who looks like, but is not, a founding member of the
Bruges group.
'If you are going to be our Olympic consultant and receive from us Pounds
300 daily in return for guiding us through the minefield of the full-scale
bidding process in September 1993,' said the minister, 'then we want our
money's worth - not some yuppified drawly-pawly about the shocking
commercialism of the modern-day Olympics; or how the Games of 2000 will be
an opportunity for the planet to revert to paganism; or telling us the
number of Games you have personally attended; or regaling us with reasons
why London was favourite to win the UK vote just because you, in all your
splendour, had never visited Manchester because you've been too busy
island-hopping in the eastern Caribbean and hadn't actually realised that in
this day and age Manchester is served by motorways - yes, actually has
motorways, plus a prize-winning airport - and that the pushy Duke of
Westminster was in fact a racing certainty to win the bid for Manchester and
thus blow your predictions clear out of the water. Anyway, I saw you
described this week as the FT's racing correspondent. Is that what you
really do?'
'Minister,' I replied. 'You mustn't believe everything you read in Private
Eye. It makes things up, you know. Plucks them from the air. Puts words in
people's mouths. My tasks at the FT are in truth wide-ranging. Because I am
cheerful and energetic I write on many topics. Racing is one of them, albeit
a minor one. Ditto the Olympics. You name it, I write it - cheerfully, with
vigour, and with fashionable intellectualism. In sentences short or long,
depending on requirements. As for my prediction that London, not Manchester,
would win this week's vote - well, we all have our off-days.
'Anyway,' I added, 'for Pounds 300 a day you are buying my advice. Rudery is
more expensive. I can be insulted, but the cost is prohibitive. Ask those
who've tried.'
'All right,' said the minister, reloading his starter's gun and signalling
to his political secretary - 'Hurry up, Julian: please stop dithering' - to
pour more coffee.
'No doubt your remarks last week about the government apply just as forcibly
to Manchester as to London,' said the sports minister. 'The government has
got to get its finger out. No more wobbling. Billions more on
infrastructure. Support Manchester to the hilt and make the Games of 2000 an
opportunity for national resurrection. So . . . who have we got to watch?
Who is going to want the Olympics even more desperately than Manchester?'
I said: 'We can forget Peking. Can you imagine what it would be like if the
marathon runners lined up and the communists simply shot them? Or if the
Chinese called out the tanks the moment some running-dog weightlifter was
caught taking drugs? Those boys need their medicines. What weightlifters do
is so intrinsically silly that they have to be high.
'We can also forget Milan. Ditto Brasilia. Also Belgrade. Which leaves
Sydney and Berlin - wonderful cities, formidable rivals, money no object.
They're the ones to beat. But Manchester is wily. Also determined. It will
more than punch its weight. Study their documentation and you will see it
stated that 'Manchester is the city where Mr Rolls and Mr Royce met and
decided to build cars; the atom was first split; the first commercial
computer was developed; flash photography was first used; the first British
plane flew.' Did you know those things?'
'No,' said the sports minister. 'Like you, I've never been to Manchester.
We're at the start of our learning curve. Julian, ring Intercity. We want
three first-class tickets - sleepers, if necessary, it's probably quite far,
God knows how we get there. Ring the Duke of Westminster. Tell him we'll
join him for tea. Then we'll fly to Berlin, then on to Sydney, returning via
Brasilia. If a job's worth doing, it is worth doing properly.'
And again, he fired his starter's gun.

SOME TIME ago I wrote a grumpy column about my non-winning premium bonds,
saying that I believed that the authorities thought me dead and had removed
my numbers from the ones they feed each month to their computer. How wrong I
was. This week I received a gaily-hued cheque from National Savings to the
tune of Pounds 50, in respect of bond number 1GP 319934.
I half expected a jaunty note from the chief of National Savings to the
effect that their computer was back to normal after some mid-life crisis and
that I could anticipate a steady stream of cheques - but you cannot ask for
everything. In the meantime, to the hundreds of readers who wrote to me with
pathetic tales about non-winning premium bonds, I can only say - Tough.

<TEXT>
A FEW years ago, when I used to cover Opec conferences for the Financial
Times, a bizarre event took place at one of the Geneva price-fixing meetings
of the cartel. We, the journalists, said we would not attend the opening
press conference, a threat which threw into confusion the bureaucrats who
ran the show. They were aware that the absence of notebooks and cameras at
the event would make them very unpopular with their political masters, whose
vanity was legion.
This dire threat was issued because one of our number, Youssef Ibrahim, of
the Wall Street Journal, had been refused accreditation to that Opec
conference. Ibrahim had written a front-page piece, which among other things
detailed with scrupulous accuracy the rates charged, not just by the oil
producers, but also by the international hookers who, in many cases employed
by some of the less well-known oil trading companies, flew in to offer their
personal services to the delegations from the Arab world and elsewhere.
Before you become horrified, I should point out that these were the days of
the Dollars 30 barrel of oil, and one high-fixed price provokes another.
Anyway, the sheikhs and emirs were not amused by these revelations and were
particularly furious that a fellow Arab should have let the home side down
by revealing the seamy side of Opec. So Youssef was kicked out. And after
some debate, we, his colleagues, said - between teeth grinding with jealousy
at Youssef's excellent cover story - 'none of us will attend your oil price
fixing opening ceremony.' After some arguments in camera the Arabs let their
brother back into the fold, and we duly followed.
Later that day, I remember being hailed by an executive of a very well-known
oil company, a man who once had the distinction and courage to deliver a
suitcase full of banknotes to the kidnappers of one of his colleagues and
who was, therefore, greatly admired by all the journalists. This man was
much amused by the episode. 'Dominic,' he said, 'you journalists are such
strange people. Here you are, doing a lousy job for not much money; one of
your deadly rivals is blackballed, and, instead of rejoicing at his
misfortune and exploiting it, you stand by him.
'I can assure you,' he said, 'that if my company was booted out of an oil
province, our rivals would not hesitate to make the most of our misfortune,
however unfairly we might have been treated.' (This, of course, explains why
Opec beat the western oil companies, but that is another story.)
I was startled by his remarks, simply because I had never heard anyone
praise journalists before, nor have I ever since.
This episode came to my mind yesterday morning, when reading in the FT of
the deaths of two FT journalists, Alan Harper, a staff photographer, and
David Thomas, natural resources editor, whose car was engulfed by flames on
a road in the oilfields of southern Kuwait on Wednesday.
In opinion polls, journalists regularly come bottom of the list of
most-admired people. But I am old-fashioned enough to regard the profession
as an admirable one, and those who exemplify its highest quality - the
disinterested seeking out of the truth - I regard with as much respect as I
do the most honoured and begonged public servant. David Thomas, whom I knew
slightly, was of that category of writer. What the journalists at the Opec
conference a few years ago were saying is that they would put their own
career interests and expediency behind a greater ideal, which was that the
truth, however unappealing it, or its purveyor, is, should not be censored.
David Thomas's last piece, a feature on the nuclear industry five years
after the Chernobyl disaster, makes the point. We would all have been better
off if, five years ago, journalists had been able to tell the truth about
that incident, rather than be dictated to by scarcely disinterested nuclear
scientists over here and Soviet politicians over there.
I am sorry if this sounds merely sentimental, but David Thomas was an
honourable exponent of an honourable profession, and his death should be as
much a matter of public grieving as that of any British soldier doing his
duty in the Gulf.

<DATELINE>
   IN 1922 Samuel Courtauld fell in love with a Cezanne landscape
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the rest, as they say, is history. At about the same time, an impecunious
Foreign Office employee called David Scott bought Sophie Anderson's 'No Walk
Today'. It shows a little girl in an ostrich-feather hat. She gazes
wistfully out from the parlour window at a 'monkey's wedding' afternoon of
sunshine and raindrops. Clearly, she cannot understand why in the world They
have decreed it is too wet for a walk.
In the 1920's, there could not have been a type of painting more
unfashionable with collectors. However, David Scott (1887-1987) was, quite
literally, a born Victorian. Throughout his long life, he stayed true to the
kind of paintings admired in his childhood. Sunshine and Shadow, now on view
at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh (until June 2), is the
first chance for the public to enjoy a uniquely personal collection of
mid-Victorian genre paintings. It surely cannot be our last chance. If this
enthralling exhibition does not reach London - at the very least - then it
will be a crying shame.
Apart from landscapes by Samuel Boyce and William Dyce, most of the 30
paintings explore the quintessential aim of the mid-Victorian artist; to
tell a story. Like a typical early-19th century novel, Sunshine and Shadow
has a moral; narrative paintings do not yield their secrets to the casual
glance. In fact, as I watched Edinburgh visitors hover and debate in front
of paintings like Thomas Faed's 'The Soldier's Return' or Thomas Roberts's
'The Discovery', it was clear quite how naturally people respond to these
once-derided paintings. Read through the comments book at the end of the
show, and the appreciative remarks far outweigh protests about 'kitsch' and
'sentimental twaddle'.
Of course, a title like 'The Discovery' is, quite frankly, a come-on.
Moreover, like all the best genre painters, Roberts knew how to attract the
viewer by strong contrasts of light and shadow, and accents of brilliant
colour. (These paintings are fresh from restoration by the Hamilton Kerr
Institute in Cambridge, so you see them at their brightest.) If, on the way
to the gallery, you stop among the Dutch 17th-century paintings and look at
the paintings by Jan Steen and Pieter de Hooch, the education of the
19th-century genre painter becomes abundantly clear.
So what is the discovery in Roberts's painting? A flood of sunlight pours
into a bedroom, lighting up the central figure of a girl in bed. She must be
ill, or the light would have woken her, and her hair looks as if it might be
damp from a feverish sleep. A young woman in outdoor dress is bending to
look at the locket around the sleeper's neck. Whose picture does the locket
contain? Her lover's, some have thought. But why, then, does the discoverer
looks so composed? Furthermore, the painting has a happy feel, with the
butterfly landing on the pot of rosebuds on the windowsill. Once the invalid
is nursed back to health, should we not imagine the last page of the novel
will see her at the altar?
Scott evidently loved to puzzle over his collection. You should not miss his
humorous, quizzical comments. Rather oddly, they are not included in the
catalogue, but can be found on a table. (He favoured the view that the
painting showed a mistress who had discovered the guilty love of her
servant-girl.)
Maybe there is a deliberate ambiguity in a painting like this. 'Letting the
public make up its own mind' has these days become the fashionable rhetoric
for exhibition organisers. Usually, this turns out to be populist pandering,
and the art-historians know exactly what they are trying to prove. Sunshine
and Shadow is rather different; there are genuine puzzles, and any visitor's
guess may be as good as the next.
We have printed here the most genuinely mysterious of Scott's pictures. He
believed he had identified it as James Lobley's 'The Squire and the
Gamekeeper', or 'The Demurrer'. Curator Lindsay Errington, however, writes
that Lobley 'had nothing to do with it.' Is the episode one from a novel,
the stage, or even a radical political comment? It certainly seems to show
an effete - or is he merely bookish? - squire confronted by an angry
gamekeeper who waves a turnip under his nose. Scott thought that the
landlord had spent too long at his books. Maybe the painting is a warning
about the evils of too much attention to the theory of land-management - one
of the tomes has 'Theory' in the title.
Someone, surely, will be able to decipher the meaning of the master, the
man, and the turnip, even if it defeated David Scott. If so, he would love
to have known. These days, there is no shortage of grand exhbitions, with
catalogues which eulogise the wealthy collectors of 20th-century art. Here
is a very different and moving exhibition, about a collector who never lost
his curiosity, nor his desire to share, with others.

IMAGINE THIS: Napoleon holed up in an Italian taverna with Ellen Terry. Shaw
did, and the fantasy supplied the third of his plays pleasant, The Man of
Destiny. Now imagine Napoleon holed up in an Italian taverna with Kate
O'Mara, and you have the measure of the Merriman Theatre Company's revival,
which brings this new actors' ensemble Battersea's Latchmere Theatre for the
second time.
It would seem churlish, given the provenance of what Shaw himself dubbed a
'perfectly idiotic play', to moan that it was being treated as a vehicle.
O'Mara makes a glamorous Strange Lady and shows a shapely pair of legs in
male disguise, but does she have to grasp her bosoms every time pain or fear
are mentioned? Looking down the cast list, the penny drops that there is no
director to advise on the nuances of flirtation. Hence the absence of
nuances.
One can appreciate the appeal to actors of collective direction, but for the
audience the result is too often a cacophony of egos. Shaw holds his own
better than most - indeed, after ploughing his pompous and detailed
introductory exposition on the political merits of Napoleon, one is left in
little doubt about whose ego is the biggest. The comedy itself is a little
something he rushed off in 1896 on the subject of courage, class and
colonialism, with a nice part thrown in for his favourite actress.
It takes place in an Italian inn, where Napoleon is holed up awaiting
despatches containing intelligence about the next stage in his offensive
against the Austrians. They saucily turn up in the bodice of a lady
traveller who, in male disguise, tricked them out of his bonehead of a
lieutenant. The rest is a game of hide and seek, with bouts of buffoonery
and one vintage piece of Shavian oratory when the young Corsican general,
zealously played by Richard Willis, becomes a mouthpiece for an Irish
radical's view of the English.
Nicholas Blane's blubbery, Italianate inn-keeper and Robert Richmond's
lip-licking military twit are cliches held on fitfully amusing monotone. Not
much subtlety is asked for, and no subtlety is offered.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STING'S RESIDENCY at Hammersmith Odeon this week is the latest stop on a
tour across two continents to promote his new album, The Soul Cages (A &amp; M
396 405-2). That in itself is a bit of a surprise, for so much of his
travelling recently has been concerned with much more universal issues.
Sting deep in the Amazon basin befriending the Amerindians might have been a
publicity stunt, but the images from the Amnesty tour, of Sting singing
'They dance alone' in the Santiago football stadium with the mothers of the
disappeared, were much harder to dismiss as self-promotion.
Yet as the album suggests and the concert on Thursday confirmed, his
concerns are currently much closer to home - not a mention of human rights
or saving the rainforests, and instead a distinct emphasis upon the
brand-new songs which evoke his Tyneside childhood, right alongside material
dating back to his Police beginnings.
No Sting appearance would be complete, I suppose, without 'Roxanne' and
'Message in a Bottle', but even so it was curious to find a singer who has
developed and so intricately expanded his song writing harking back with
such insistence - he also included 'King of Pain', and the wonderfully
obsessive 'Every Breath you Take' from the early 1980s - while making only
token selections from each of his first two solo albums, one of those,
'Fragile', as a beautifully poised encore. And just what were we to make of
his moderately wild version of 'Purple Haze', complete with convincing
ersatz Hendrix guitar from Dominic Millar, or of Bill Withers' 'Ain't no
Sunshine'? The roots he's after at the moment seem to be as much musical as
nostalgic.
It matters only because Sting is one of the most prodigiously talented of
current rock musicians, a vocalist of significant range and technical skill
and a songwriter of increasing sophistication, whose previous albums worried
away at the edges of jazz and rock and several kinds of fusion. The band for
the current tour still includes the jazz saxophonist Branford Marsalis, but
his limpid playing is now buried much more deeply in the arrangements. There
is none of the duetting of voice and sax that carried so much charge in the
last two albums and instead the keyboards of David Sancious (of
Springsteen's E-Street Band) are more prominent, and the looser moments now
hard-edged rather than poetic.
The tracks from The Soul Cages are all concerned with going back, with
recovering childhood memories, especially of the sea, and repaying familial
debts. They're more intricately structured than before, less instantly
accessible, though the modulations are as telling as ever, the melodic lines
insidiously memorable. Yet Sting appears to be torn between the need to
indulge the adulation of his fans and the compulsion to explore the limits
of his own music; somebody who can write songs as fine as 'Mad about You'
and 'The Wild Wild Sea' in the new collection really does not need to
manipulate an audience like he does simply to convince himself that they
still love him so much.

<TEXT>
TOM STOPPARD'S In the Native State (Radio 3, Sunday) is about the relations
between the British and the Indians. In 1930, his heroine, Flora Crewe
(Felicity Kendal), an English radical poet, is lecturing in India (she was
told to go 'somewhere warm' to improve her lungs). Sixty years later are
published the letters she wrote to Nell Swan, her younger sister, in London,
and Nell (Peggy Ashcroft) entertains the son of the Indian painter Nirad Das
(Sam Dastor) whose portrait of Flora adorns the wrapper of her book. But Das
had done another painting of Flora, a nude. He kept quiet about this, and it
was not seen until his son gave it to Nell Swan.
On this simple framework, Stoppard has hung an engaging variety of
indicators. Flora is easily beguiled. David, the Resident's Junior Political
Agent, guides her in social and political affairs - for example, his Indian
ICS colleague, liked and admired, may not come into the Club. The women,
David thinks, won't 'muck in' with the Indians. The Resident's literary talk
is 'How is Alfred Housman?', though Flora has tales about Wells and Squire.
The friendly Rajah believes independence will be bad for the native states,
like his own Jummapur. There is informed talk about Indian erotic art, about
Rajput writing, the rift between the Hindus and the Moslems, the Salt Tax,
the banned Theosophical Society.
There is talk too about Flora's life, her sittings for Modigliani, her
affaires, but the source for this is in the footnotes we're read from the
Collected Letters. (The poems quoted are awful; yet Nell wants the word
'poet' engraved on her dead sister's headstone - for India never cured her
chest.) We hear from Emily Eden's Up the Country, casually worked in, her
account of the Victorian ball of 1839, her reflection that 'I sometimes
wonder why they do not cut all our heads off.' There's no real theme in the
play beyond this correlation of English and Indian convictions with their
behaviour, but it is done with a skill that transmutes the politics into
romance. I shall read it when my local bookshops pull their fingers out, and
hear John Tydeman's able production when it's repeated on June 4.
Two programmes on Radio 4, presented by Andrea Adams on consecutive
Thursdays, deal with the problem of Bullying at Work. This may sound
trivial, but they say that 1.3bn hours' work per annum are lost through
'occupational stress'. This week's programme, An Abuse of Power, was
presented mostly through five victims. Jane, who complained to the Royal
College of Nursing because she was rebuked for 'bleach-blond' hair, should
swop experiences with a Guardsman. Teacher Jill lamented because she was
deprived, first of her desk, then of her favourite class; teacher Keith
hated the 'sudden flare-ups' of his head. Francis, a parish worker, resented
his vicar's letters in square white envelopes (though we were not told what
those letters said).
Perhaps I am lucky, I have usually got on with my superiors. If I say that
these five seem a second-class lot, it may be because I can't visualise
their suffering. To me, they sound like people who want life to run on their
own chosen lines and resent the imposition of any other. To some degree my
feelings are reproduced in next Thursday's programme, Whose Fault is it
Anyway? Here are the expert voices of psychotherapists and personnel
managers (though a reformed bully gets a turn, and I didn't like him much).
One psycho view is that victims of bullying may have themselves to blame -
they enjoy being victims, just my conclusion from the first programme. The
BBC has an organised anti-harrass scheme, we were told. I wonder how Jill,
Ann, Francis, Jane and Keith got on under director Cathy Drysdale?
Make a note of Colcoughs, 'an everyday story of Potteries folk', Wednesdays
on BBC Radio Stoke, repeated Sundays. Presented with Stoke-on-Trent City
Council and North Staffordshire Health Authority, it is almost exactly like
The Archers. Bound to win.

WHO SAYS that the market for Contemporary Art is in deep, deep trouble?
Listen to this for Christie's description of what it is selling New York
next week: 'A pantheon of the greatest Abstract Expressionist and Pop
artists represented by museum-quality works, many coming from distinguished
private collections. Reflecting a market trend, the traditional evening sale
of Contemporary Art now includes a broader range of artists and estimates to
accommodate a wider group of collectors.' Let's be honest, Christie's has
style.
At its big sale of Contemporary Art in New York this time last year, it sold
11 works for more than Dollars 1m and established record prices at auction
for ten different artists. Next week if it is lucky, it will manage to get
five paintings over the Dollars 1m mark and of those, only two - a Twombly
and a Kline - are likely to make more than a couple of million. And what of
records? Franz Kline's 'West Brand' is its main hope with an estimate of
Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m. If that goes past Dollars 2.86m which is the record
for Kline, then it will have one record.
Among this year's 'broader range' are many such works including an
attractive Motherwell of 1975, 'Pas de Deux, no 3', which is estimated at
Dollars 70,000-Dollars 90,000; it belongs to John Kluge, who is also selling
a Jackson Pollock (estimated Dollars 3-Dollars 500,000) and a Richard Linder
(estimate Dollars 1-Dollars 150,000).
With the free-fall in prices for works by Contemporary artists, some names
have held up better than others. Franz Kline is one of them; de Kooning,
Philip Guston and Cy Twombly are others. Christie's, taking care not to
flood the market, has one example by all these painters next week. One other
major painting on offer at Christie's is 'Bait' - a coloured silkscreen with
oil on canvas by Robert Rauschenberg (estimate Dollars 1.8-Dollars 2.5m).
The market's feelings about Rauschenberg are uncertain. Sotheby's had a
major painting by him in its sale last November. Although that sale was not
a success - 56 per cent of the lots were bought in and works by many big
names were left on the block - the Rauschenberg did sell. It brought Dollars
3.08m, but that was a good Dollars 1m less than the present estimate of
Dollars 4-Dollars 5m. Nevertheless, Rauschenberg is the main hope at
Sotheby's again next week. An important mixed media and collage on canvas,
'Rebus', that dates from 1955 is estimated at Dollars 4-Dollars 6m. This was
sold at the Victor Ganz sale in November 1988 when it was bought by the
Swedish collector, Hans Thulin, for a hefty Dollars 6.33m - a record for
Rauschenberg that still remains. It is estimated at a lower Dollars
4-Dollars 6m in next week's sale and it is being sold 'By order of the
Creditor' of a Scandinavian Private Collector: Mr Thulin one presumes.
This is not the sort of deal the auction houses like. It spells out in
easily understood Wall Street terms exactly what has happened to the market:
has Rauschenberg gone up or down? Whether the Rauschenberg in question is
good, bad or indifferent is neither here nor there; it was never acquired
for that reason.
After Rauschenberg, the next most important paintings at Sotheby's - at
least the most expensive - are two works by Twombly. These come from the
Saatchi Collection and their sale is part of a discreet dispersal process of
works from that collection which has caused ripples in the market over the
past year. Saatchi is also selling a Philip Guston of 1976 (estimated
Dollars 700,000-Dollars 750,000) as well as pictures by other artists.
These are all 'hot' names and many people have a vested interest in seeing
that prices for their work hold up. They, as much as 'the wider group of
collectors' whom Christie's is expecting are the ones who may be bidding
next week and for very good reason. If we see new records - or even high
prices - for new names, expect to see more of those artists in auctions next
Fall. Don't ask who is selling and never ask who is buying but beware:
today's market for Contemporary Art is for specialists - and not necessarily
art specialists.

FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Strings and trumpets - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUGH Caroline Mathilde, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies' new work for the Royal
Danish Ballet, has yet to reach Britain, two other big, recent pieces are
available on a Collins Classics CD (11812). His Trumpet Concerto for the
redoubtable John Wallace was commissioned and premiered by the Philharmonia,
but here the composer conducts the Scottish National Orchestra; for his
Symphony no. 4 he has the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Confident
performances; eminently serious pieces, both of them - somewhat tantalising
and elusive, too.
The Concerto is more overtly dramatic. There is a long, sombre orchestral
introduction before the soloist enters with a florid recitative and the
tempo increases sharply; after a violent climax there is a soft, ambiguous
close. In the central Adagio molto the trumpet does St. Francis' sermon to
the birds - the musical ideas of the whole Concerto are connected with a
chamber opera-in-progress on the Saint - before he is joined in meditation
by a solo horn, to striking effect. A concise final Presto allows him a
crackling virtuoso display. Throughout, there are fraught pronouncements on
timpani, and generous doses of excited string-tremolo.
Nonetheless, by comparison with Maxwell Davies' lovely Ave Maris Stella and
Image, Reflection, Shadow - respectively from 1975 and 1982, and now
re-released (on Unicorn-Kanchana UKCD 2038) in the riveting Fires of London
accounts - the new Trumpet Concerto and still more the Fourth Symphony have
surprisingly 'traditional' surface manners. Of course the plainchant-based
material is constantly rotated and transformed in the individual Davies way,
and tonality has little to do with that; but the literal diction is
reassuringly old-fashioned - and therefore tantalising, because the real
musical argument is strictly modern.
Instead of neo-Expressionism and wilful fantasy, there are square-cut
phrases with a lot of even notes (sometimes recalling Messiaen's hieratic
formulas), ruminative wind solos, curving duets in parallel lines, thumping
little rhythmic cells and bright, familiar splashes of fanfares. One almost
thinks: 'Sinfonia Academica'] Yet there is enough symphonic muscle in each
work to grip the attention. Time will have to tell what that amounts to:
whether the sacrifice of the fresh, immediate colours and fluidity of Ave
Maris Stella and Image . . . serves the purposes of a still richer musical
construction. Maybe the Francis opera, when it's done, will help to
illuminate the new, shock-free Davies style.
Volume 3 of the Unicorn-Kanchana survey of Elizabeth Maconchy's 13 string
quartets completes the cycle splendidly (DKP 9082). For these last five
works the performers are the Mistry Quartet, who maintain the level already
set by the Hanson and Bingham ensembles, and enjoy the bonus of the new
expressive depth in the late quartets. Nos. 10 and 11 are notably poignant,
without the least relaxation of Maconchy's astringent economy.
The whole set is an authentic British contribution to 20th-century music:
the modest triumph of a born quartet-composer. Though her scale seems almost
miniature (the Maconchy norm is 12 to 15 minutes per quartet), the laconic
density, the energy and the rigorously sharp point of every piece brook no
argument. It is wonderfully bracing, gutsy stuff to hear, and the new
candour of feeling in the latest quartets establishes the series as a real,
maturing cycle - greatly rewarding to follow, all the way from spikey,
narrow-gauge early brilliance to generously sculpted utterance and dramatic
polyphony.
One of Debussy's closest contemporaries, Gabriel Pierne is honoured by the
veteran pianist Jean Hubeau (on Musifrance 2292-45525-2) with the Quatuor
Viotti in his mature Quintet op. 41, transparently indebted to Ravel's Trio
but seductive and even elevated in its own way. There is also his op. 36
Violin Sonata (with Olivier Charlier), which stands in the same honourable
relation to Faure's First Sonata. Less warmly, I commend the same
performers' accounts of Vierne's late Quintet and earlier Violin Sonata
(Musifrance 2292-45524-2) - worthily constructed period-exhibits of honest,
late Romantic feeling.
With some of the leading French wind-players, the pianist Pascal Roge has
recorded most of Poulenc's piano-and-wind music in faultless style (Decca
421 581-2): the three late solo sonatas, the Trio and the Sextet. They miss
nothing except, perhaps, a touch of cheerful vulgarity here and there
(surely the Sextet invites that?) - but the whole programme is a civilised
pleasure. The same can be said of Roge's new solo-piano Poulenc collection
(Decca 425 862-2, which includes all the Nocturnes, the charming Theme varie
and a great deal more. Together with his previous collection (417 438-2),
Roge offers here virtually all the Poulenc that's worth playing, and he
outclasses all competitors.
Any pianist might hesitate before going into competition with the venerable
Firkusny readings of Janacek's noble sets and cycles, but Mikhail Rudy
brings no less sympathetic insight to them (EMI CDC 7 54094 2). His extra
touch of bravura sets the pieces in a slightly different light (Firkusny is
always 'inward', as if playing for himself alone), but it remains as
haunting as ever: music like no one else's.
Finally, two greatly deserving, under-played sonatas, by Balakirev and by
Henri Dutilleux, get intelligent performances from the American pianist
Donna Amato (Olympia OCD 354). More virtuoso dash would bring out the best
of the Balakirev; but both works are worth discovering - and if this
recording inspires some competitors with steelier fingers, so much the
better.

FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Struggle of the sexes - The Berghaus treatment of
'Ariane' in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY evening at the Chatelet had all the hallmarks of a classic Paris
opening-night scandale: end-of-act thunderclaps of booing interspersed with
equally forceful cheers, with the booers eventually triumphant during the
final curtain calls. To the critic of Le Figaro the whole show was
'parfaitement detestable'; to the Cassandras in the audience who believe
that opera as a theatrical medium is being ruined by the excesses of the
modern producer, the evening will have supplied plenty of confirmatory
evidence.
The opera chosen for revival was Dukas's Ariane et Barbe-bleue. It is one of
the key items in the French-music cycle that is the principal preoccupation
of the season's musical programme at the Chatelet, since it is an
early-20th-century French landmark - much loved by its devotees, a
semi-rarity in the last few decades (not staged in Paris for 16 years),
recently re-discovered in Amsterdam, Geneva and Leeds.
But the choice of production team for the revival seemed to guarantee
controversy, being headed by Ruth Berghaus, actress, choreographer, widow of
the composer Dessau, veteran of the Berliner Ensemble, and exponent since
the 1970s of a mode of psycho-surrealist opera production that all over
Europe has won her fanatical admirers and detractors in equal proportion.
(In Britain we know her work only from the 1984 Welsh National Don
Giovanni.)
For her an opera's text is a blank canvas: she creates on stage the
associations that it summons into her head, not the events invented by the
librettist and set by the composer. Ariane, whose allegorical narrative
Maeterlinck placed in the depths of an ancient castle penetrated by the
determination of its light-bringing heroine, is here a Freudian fantasy set
(by designers Hans-Dieter Schaal and Marie-Luise Strandt) among the
roof-tops - all dream-world white - of a modern city, Paris presumably.
The action takes place on, beside and around chimneys, roof doorways,
staircases, gutters; at those points in Act 1 when Ariadne (in huge frizzed
wig and Nehru suit) and the Nurse (dressed, according to Le Figaro, 'en
mauvais garcon', in tights and bowler) uncover the secrets of the locked
doors, apertures fly open and dancers in coloured tights wriggle out. The
connection between the opera's leading role and the Ariadne of Greek
mythology is forged by a line of trailing cord, at times electrified like
the lights on a Christmas tree.
Bluebeard in a natty three-piece arrives stage right on a huge speedboat,
the wives ensconced within like chattels; this is a moment of enormous
theatrical frisson. In Act 3, when the women have temporarily freed
themselves, we find this symbol of male potency laid on its side - but at
the end, as they opt to return to Bluebeard and familiar servitude rather
than departing with Ariadne to follow a life of feminist freedom, the wives
crawl back into the boat, and Ariadne and the Nurse march off to explore
horizons, and rooftops, new.
In short, and leaving undescribed a thousand fascinating production details,
Dukas's and Maeterlinck's opera is here mined for its 'deep structure'; and
it is this - the symbolic struggle of male and female - that we see staged
at the Chatelet, filtered through the Berghaus subconscious. I found it all
wonderfully rich and substantial, magically beautiful to look at, endlessly
absorbing: even where I failed to catch the significance of this or that
moment, I was swept along by Berghaus's immense powers of stagecraft, and by
the feeling I had that this was, however maddening, a serious enterprise,
deeply considered, by no means either 'fashionable' or intentionally
iconoclastic.
There is, of course, much to be said against it. Berghaus's is a dangerously
in-group method of opera-staging. You might almost call it meta-production:
you need to have the libretto under your belt in advance, not to mention
your well-sharpened tools of Freudian dream-interpretation, otherwise you
get left very much on the peripheries of the theatrical unfolding. This
Ariane was not an integration of words and music, not a unification of pit
and stage; the ineluctable build-up and achievement of climaxes that Opera
North audiences will have learnt to regard as one of the work's prime
glories was not to be had here.
Even though after a lumpy first act the Orchestre Philharmonique (and,
hidden from view, the Choeur) de Radio France performed extremely well under
Eliahu Inbal, the music and the staging seemed discrete entities, to be
experienced as it were on different artistic planes. Directness of verbal
communication from the lips of the singers was not the first source of
revelation.
As it happens, the opera was most eloquently and - apart from the rich-toned
but word-muffled Nurse of Nadine Denize - clearly sung. Gabriel Bacquier
was, as one might expect, effortlessly authoritative with Bluebeard's few
lines; the wives, led by the Selysette of the excellent mezzo Hanna Schaer,
were well contrasted.
The opera's leading role was taken by the new white hope of French opera,
Francoise Pollet. She was perhaps ill-advised to tackle this Everest of
French dramatic-soprano roles, being soft-grained in her timbre and
sometimes strained at climaxes; but her musical manner and delivery are so
ravishingly fresh and responsive that I was glad she had done, and full of
admiration for her willingness to appear in so unflattering a garb and
head-dress. Indeed, she and all the cast gave the impression of full
commitment to Berghaus. This is not the way I want to encounter Ariane in
particular, or opera in general, very often; on its own terms it was
unforgettable.

FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Devolution grinds to a halt - The latest developments
in the arts world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT LOOKS as if the proposed great shake up for the UK arts world, the drive
towards devolution, much loved by the last Arts Minister but one, Mr Richard
Luce, is being laid gently to rest. The current Minister, Mr Tim Renton,
obviously has doubts as to whether control of the subsidy purse strings
should be taken away from the Arts Council in London and handled by new
Regional Arts Boards. He is not proving the soft touch the arts
Establishment anticipated, and is currently wagging his finger furiously at
everyone in sight.
This week he asked Mr Anthony Everitt, the secretary general of the Council,
to save another Pounds 1m on devolution and pretty sharply too  - by May 17.
The Arts Council is cutting its staff by 50, down to 130, but, although two
Regional Arts Associations are to disappear under restructuring, staffing of
the new RAB's is set to rise by 15, to 370. Now the hard pressed chief
executives of the RABs, torn that way and this by Ministerial changes, will
find the supposedly weakened London Central forcing them to shed staff.
And, despite the intentions of Luce, the RAB's do not seem to be getting
their administrative hands on the bigger companies. Last December the Arts
Council forwarded to Renton a list with the names of over 90 companies
ear-marked, often against their will, for devolution, and including such
heavies as the four London orchestras, the Royal Court, the ICA, the CBSO,
and the Royal Exchange Manchester. It was expected that he would rubber
stamp it. Instead he quickly ordered the Council to rethink. The first group
of 28 companies devolved this week covers pretty minor bodies, with the
exception of Aldeburgh.
With no second list now expected until October 1992, when a very different
Arts Minister might be settling in, it looks as if the devolution bandwaggon
hardly rolled beyond the suburbs of London.
One bandwaggon which has definitely halted is Upstart, the theatrical
production company, which has gone into liquidation. It was started three
years ago with a substantial Pounds 150,000 contribution from the Arts
Council. Business interests were expected to match this sum.
The decision dismayed established touring groups, like Compass, which relied
on Council money for their survival, and purists who thought the Arts
Council should not get involved with playing the theatrical angel.
Upstart's ventures, however well intentioned, never struck gold. It always
seemed to be trying to square commercial acumen with a social conscience and
it discovered there just was not an audience in the provinces for black
musicals like Mass Carib or childrens plays like Pied Piper.
It came to grief over another mix of religion and Mammon, Children of Eden,
a musical based on the Book of Genesis, which closed prematurely on April
6th, not bringing drama to an overlooked provincial town, but, ironically
given the company's remit, in the West End. Like an Upstart musical, the
Arts Council is looking on the bright side and counting the sixty weeks of
regional touring it got for its money.
Mr Jeremy Isaacs, boss at Covent Garden, has finally pleased his critics. He
is starting to pension off the Royal Opera chorus, which, with an average
age approaching 50 and at least a dozen stalwarts over 65, has long been in
the critical firing line.
They could just about get on stage without zimmer frames, but anything at
all mobile was left to the legs of specially recruited supernumeraries.
Apart from their static posturing the main problem was the voices and the
fact that the Covent Garden repertoire has recently been boosted with
Russian works, like Prince Igor and Boris Godunov, which stretched their
verbal learning powers beyond the limit. There were reports that they were
behind the beat in Prince Igor because they were reading their lines off
monitors.
Now chorus numbers are being reduced from 72 to 60, with freelances summoned
up for the mammoth productions. Mr Isaacs has been slow to act through human
kindness. The ROH pension scheme was rudimentary in the extreme and only now
can these faithful servants be retired to some comfort.
Mr Guy Wilson, Keeper of the Royal Armouries, expects to know within the
next month whether his plan to lead his unrivalled collection of arms and
armour out of its 900 year home at the Tower of London and into a purpose
built museum in a regional city will come true.
The Royal Armouries has felt increasingly inhibited in the Tower even though
it inhabits some of the finest remains, including the White Tower. It wants
its own identity and space to show more of its collection. It will not
denude the Tower: it can afford to leave many treasures behind, including a
set of Henry VIII's armour (it owns four), but it is considering offers from
progressive cities who, in the wake of the success of Glasgow and
Birmingham, see the economic opportunities in the devolution of major arts
organisations from London. Leeds, stung by the success of neighbouring
Bradford in developing a heritage reputation, is currently the favourite
home for the new Pounds 30m museum.
The problem, of course, is money. If the Government comes up with a useful
gratuity Wilson hopes that the local authority, and an appeal to business
friends, will do the rest.

FIVE O'CLOCK ANGEL Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St Just, 1948-1982
Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 407 pages
AT A party given by John Gielgud in June 1948 Maria Britneva noticed a young
man wearing one red and one blue sock. Since everyone was ignoring him and
he looked vulnerable, she invited him round for a meal with her family.
There he met members of the White Russian colony in London, including 'Larky
Boy' and 'Klop the Bug' (father of Peter Ustinov). A few days afterwards he
disappeared, and in July Maria started receiving letters from Paris
addressed to 'Darling Maria' and signed 'Love - Tenn.'
Yes, folks, you've guessed. The young man (he was actually 37 at the time)
was none other than the famous playwright, Tennessee Williams, who, having
taken Broadway by storm with A Streetcar Named Desire, had come to London
for the British premiere of The Glass Menagerie - John Gielgud directing,
Binkie Beaumont producing. The fact that Williams was staying in a suite at
the Ritz does not dim the brightness of Maria's story. She might be a little
naive, but she is a genuine 100 per cent brick.
But who exactly is she, you may ask? A glance at Donald Spoto's biography of
Williams reveals three brief entries. In the first, she is described as 'a
young Russo-English aspiring actress . . . a woman of strong loyalty and
vitality.' In the second, her name is inscribed on a plaque at Williams's
summer-house Key West, along with six others. In the third, her antagonism
to Tallulah Bankhead is noted, with Tennessee 'licking his lips' at the
prospect of a fight.
To read Williams's letters to Maria, knowing what was actually happening in
his life, comes as something of a shock. Until, of course, one reminds
oneself that this was not a love affair, nor was ever meant to be. Tennessee
bathed in Maria's unstinted devotion and sent her letters full of the kind
of detail that he knew she would enjoy. Among his myriad lovers and
hangers-on, Maria stood like a rock - a rock that was all the more necessary
because of his impossible behaviour and the bitchery of his friends.
Where Harold Acton saw 'a petty, taciturn moustached little man without any
obvious distinction,' Maria acknowledged only her soul-mate, whose blue eyes
she had gazed into at John Gielgud's party. When asked what he would like
most in life, Williams once replied, 'To be handsome.' Maria did not care
whether he was handsome or ugly. She accepted him completely, seeing only
good where others saw bad. She had been struck by lightning and is still in
that state long after his death. To the consternation of those who thought
of themselves as his nearest and dearest, he rewarded her by making her
co-trustee of his will.
And so we have the St Just letters. The change in Maria's name is accounted
for by the fact that, although she was for a long time in love with James
Laughlin, she finally married Peter, the ailing son of the banker, Edward
Grenfell, who had taken the title of St Just and bought himself a Palladian
mansion. By Peter, she had two daughters, and, since she was the offspring
of Russian aristocrats, fell into her new role with gusto, playing with
'Froggy Footman' (the dog) in the country and dispensing champagne and
badinage in Belgravia.
Tennessee knew exactly how to pitch his letters to her. Discussion of stage
craft, technique or plot motivation were not called for. He turned on the
gossip like a tap. The justification for the publication of these letters is
Maria's burning - and altogether honourable - desire to prove that Tennessee
Williams is the greatest playwright of the century. Unfortunately, you do
not achieve this purpose by printing chitchat - enjoyable though it is,
coming from the great man himself - nor by reproducing letters to the
Swedish Ambassador wondering why 'the most distinguished dramatist writing
in English' has not been nominated for the Nobel Prize, signed 'The Lady St
Just.'
And who, pray - we return to our question - exactly is the Lady St Just? She
is simply the best friend Tennessee Williams ever had, that's who she is. Or
is she?

View at Narni by Camille Corot - taken from Corot in Italy: Open-Air
Painting and the Classical-Landscape Tradition by Peter Galassi (Yale Pounds
35, 258 pages, 284 illustrated in colour and black and white).
This picture was exhibited at the Salon of 1827 and is one of his most
striking Italian landscapes, painted nine or ten months after arriving in
Rome. It was once owned by Degas and is now in the National Gallery, London.
Mr Galassi argues not only that Corot's open-air studies point forward to
Impressionism but also that they marked the culmination of the earlier
classical landscape tradition.
A major Corot exhibition is to be held in Manchester City Art Gallery from
May 18-June 30, to be accompanied by another book - Corot and the Art of
Landscape by Michael Clarke (British Museum Press Pounds 19.95, 160 pages
with 135 colour and black and white illustrations).
This book provides an Anglo-Saxon perspective on the artist, examining
Corot's life and work, and his influence on a generation of painters after
him.

U AND I by Nicholson Baker Granta Pounds 12.99, 179 pages
SO MANY novels are written, but so many more are stillborn, sabotaged by
laziness or rejected by perfectionism. Many hopeful novelists are muzzled by
the fear of unintentional plagiarism: to the fragile ego of the unpublished
writer, the faintest sense of literary indebtedness can seem like imitation,
and chapter two is abandoned in despair.
Nicholson Baker circumvents the problem of literary indebtedness in this,
his third novel, by taking it as his subject. His last book, Room
Temperature (an extended prose-poem of love to his wife disguised as a
sequence of witty meanderings which occurred to him while he was feeding his
baby) showed that he could saucily confound the expectations of critics and
readers. Now, U and I, 'a true story', and a portrait of the artist as an
idolater and imitator of John Updike, again defies easy categorisation.
We gather that Baker has read little of Updike, despite his preoccupation of
13 years. Nevertheless, he is informed about his idol's life and feeds us a
miscellany of details. He eagerly identifies parallels between Updike's
condition and his own and is appropriately abject during two brief
encounters. Updike first fired Baker's literary ambitions; yet now,
paradoxically, his example often intimidates him into silence. But those
unable to share Baker's view of his inspiration's 'brilliance and longevity'
will be pleased to hear that this book is primarily an idiosyncratic
literary compendium.
As he digresses, from the evils of the thesaurus, to literary gossip, to the
trespasses of critics, Baker's neurotic tone fluctuates between mock-apology
and po-faced irony. He is garrulous about literary reputations, and amusing
when reminding us that they are often based on misquotation. He extols the
novel as the greatest literary form; and his flamboyantly long sentences and
arcane vocabulary indicate that he is testing the form's possibilities. His
judgment is not infallible, however: suggestions of homophobia disappoint,
particularly when they later involve him in the placatory but ambitious
claim that 'most good novelists have been women or homosexuals'.
There is also the occasional suspicion that this is mere legerdemain. Can
Baker really be as badly read as he claims? Are his gaucheness and modesty
genuine, or merely clever opportunism artfully disguised? And what of his
desire to outwit critics? After all, autobiography disguised as literary
manual is not new, but his references to Cyril Connolly's Enemies of Promise
carefully pre-empt accusations of imitation. On balance, however, he charms
and amuses us into forgiveness: if this is trickery, it is nothing if not
brazen and entertaining. But it will be interesting to see what he attempts
next; and also to see how, if at all, Updike responds.

THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA: VOL VII Edited by Leslie Bethell
Cambridge University Press Pounds 70, 800 pages
BRITISH INTEREST in Latin America when compared with other regions has been
minimal during recent years. Yet by a perverse paradox a British publishing
house and a British editor are in the process of producing the finest
complete history of the region.
The Cambridge University Press' ten volume History of Latin America, edited
by Professor Leslie Bethell, is now within sight of completion. Taking as
its starting point the colonisation of the Americas, the series should be
complete in time for for next year's 500th anniversary of the 'discovery' of
the Americas.
The monumental undertaking was begun back in 1976 and the publication of Vol
VII confirms the consistency and dispassionate readability of the previous
volumes. This in itself is a tribute to Professor Bethel, who continues to
direct the project although he has become director of the Latin American
Institute at London University. It also confirms the value of having one
scholar as the editor even though the project covers so many countries
spanning such a long period of history.
Each volume consists of a collection of essays either on individual
countries or on themes, with a particularly welcome emphasis on aspects of
culture. This is complemented by a section at the end of each volume with a
chapter by chapter series of excellent bibliographical essays which direct
the reader with authority where to pursue the subject in greater detail.
The previous five volumes published have covered the region from the time of
colonial conquest up to 1930s. The remainder (including Vol VI which appears
shortly) will extend up to the end of the 1980; while the final volume (Vol
X) will be an updated and expanded version of the existing bibiographical
essays.
The present Vol VII covers Mexico, Central America and the Spanish
Caribbean. This is a tumultuous period embracing the consolidation of the
Mexican revolution, Sandino in Nicaragua, the effects of the depression on
the commodity-based economies of Central America, the rise of Panamian
nationalism, the Cuban revolution, the Sandinista revolution, civil war in
El Salvador and the effects of the debt crisis in Mexico. Local
historiography perhaps not surprisingly tends to treat such episodes in
terms of heroes and villains. But the balance here is kept by five British
authors, five North American and three Latin American.
The authors have made their essays as up to date as possible. Such immediacy
is well-intentioned; but on occasions this makes them seem a little
breathless and uncertain in their final conclusions. Academics do not like
being seen to be wrong and contemporary events in Latin America move with
extraordinary speed. Arguably, when these essays were written there was not
quite the same sense of perspective regarding the collapse of Soviet power,
the advent of more democratic government in Latin America and the move
towards generalised acceptance of market-oriented economies.
This is a pity because with the benefit of hindsight, the end of the 1980s
and the Reagan administration clearly marked a watershed in the development
of Latin America and US policy towards the region with the collapse - the
most remarkable development being Mexico reversing its long-held prejudices
towards the US and agreeing to become part of a North American Free Trade
Area.
Of the two Mexican essays, the surest touch concerns the Cardenas presidency
which highlights the improvised nature of much of his reform including the
oil nationalisation. The overview of Central America during the 1930s draws
an elegant broad brush, making a telling point that where there is a rise in
wealth in societies with great social inequalities, there is the reverse of
a trickle down effect - it creates even greater disparities.
Finally, it is a pleasure to see Victor Bulmer-Thomas, one of the leading
authorities on Central America, compressing almost 60 years of Nicaraguan
history into only 50 pages. With all the recent attention devoted to
Nicaragua, historians may well note this gives the space and perspective the
Sandinista Revolution deserves.

BENJAMIN CONSTANT AND THE POST-REVOLUTIONARY MIND by Biancamaria Fontana
Yale Pounds 20, 165 pages
BENJAMIN Constant was 22 in 1789 when the mob stormed the Bastille. After a
whirlwind, scapegrace youth he had come to rest in Brunswick where he was
employed at the Duke's court in the sinecure of gentleman-in-ordinary. In
1794 he met Germaine de Stael, then aged 27, the daughter of Louis XVI's
finance minister, Necker. She had a mind as penetrating as Constant's, and
as great a sexual charisma in spite of not being beautiful. Her personal
dominance over eminent men and women was legendary; the influence of her
salon was unrivalled.
Some writers on Constant have suggested that the effect of his literary
collaboration, turning eventually into a stormy love-affair, with Mme de
Stael, was to transform his outlook from that of an 18th century rationalist
 -he was educated at the University of Edinburgh in the days of Adam Smith -
into that of a 19th century romantic. Geoffrey Scott's The Portrait of
Zelide (1925), still a most readable piece of Strachey-like writing,
dramatised their encounter in this light. The later biography of De Stael,
JC Herold's Mistress to an Age (1953), also highly readable, corrected that
view to some extent and is indispensable for a full understanding of their
careers.
Zelide (as she called herself in a self-portrait) was Constant's first
female mentor. Known after her marriage as Belle de Charriere, older than
Constant by 27 years, she was a lively, striking, high-minded Dutch
aristocrat who had isolated herself in the country at Colombier in
Switzerland with her mediocre Swiss husband.
Whether or not she and Constant - a Swiss of French Protestant origin - were
lovers has never been established. Sainte-Beuve thought they were; the
editor of her papers thought they were not. At any rate, Zelide became in
her maturity a quietist who practised restraint and and control over the
passions; Germaine de Stael was a political activist who never feared
enthusiasm and involvement. Apart from her writings and her attacks on
Napoleon, she was a courageous 'scarlet pimpernel' during the Terror.
'He (Constant) could not serve two goddesses,' wrote Scott, 'he had chosen
the false mysticism of Germany (de Stael): the doors of the temple of reason
were shut and the altar of Colombier would never be rekindled.' This
excellent new book, Benjamin Constant and the Post-Revolutionary Mind, shows
that Constant never really abandoned reason for false mysticism. By applying
reason to the main problems confronting French society in the
post-revolutionary period, he identified many issues that are still
unresolved today. He entered the debate, begun by the Philosophes of the
Enlightenment, about the general will; he approved of Godwin's Enquiry
Concerning Political Justice and tried to bring it to the attention of the
French public; he took issue with Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in
France. 'There are as many absurdities as lines in this famous book,' he
told Zelide.
Biancamaria Fontana, formerly a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, has
previously edited an edition of Constant's political writings, and is an
admirable elucidator of his political thought in his numerous letters, books
and pamphlets during the period after the fall of Robespierre and throughout
the Napoleonic period. Constant had the insight to see the new force that
had now come into French politics - the classe intermediaire. These middling
rank people were (he said) 'the strength of the nation' and they
participated 'with full rights into the maintenance of national interests;
they are no longer the object of an insolent condescension on the part of a
proud caste. There is no longer privilege, no longer political monopoly.'
In his search for a new model for society Constant addressed such problems
as the composition of elected assemblies, the extension of the right to vote
based on ownership of property, the need for limits on the power of the
administration. He identified the emergence of public opinion as a salutary
check on the despotism of the state. This activity as a political
philosopher was combined with his pet project, a history of religion. It was
still incomplete when he died at the age of 63 even though several volumes
had been published. Fontana combs this work for Constant's further
perceptions about the nature of society.
In her chapter on the one book by Constant still read and universally
enjoyed, the novel Adolphe (the paperback Penguin English translation of it
by Leonard Tancock is first-rate), Fontana relates it to the themes she has
extracted from these political writings. On the surface the novel appears to
be one of the most a-political of all fictional works. Its confessional hero
(based closely on Constant himself in his wild oats phase) and the heroine
(a composite portrait with traits taken from many of his loves) are
completely self-absorbed in an internal landscape of the heart. Yet even two
such narcissists as Adolphe and Ellenore are subject to the surrounding
social pressures.
Fontana has done us all a valuable service in reconstructing the argument
from unfamiliar material scattered inaccessibly among Constant's fugitive
writings. If only her proof-reader had been rigorous. There are too many
misprints in the text for a book of this calibre.

THE QUIET RISE OF JOHN MAJOR by Edward Pearce Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds
14.99, 177 pages
THIS IS the first quick-fire interim biography of Mr John Major to have
appeared on my desk for review. Two more are due out this spring. Mr Pearce
and/or his publishers are to be congratulated for working so fast. They may
have scooped the pool, for in truth there is not so much to say about the
subject that one book any longer than this short one is needed, let alone
three. Even recapitulations of the events surrounding the fall of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, in which one of the expected new tomes aims to excel, are
becoming a drag on the market. Enough is enough. Mr Major may become a good
prime minister, possibly an excellent one, but it is far too early to say.
For the moment he is the quintessence of ordinariness made momentarily
interesting by his sudden emergence in the top political job. That is all.
Thus limited in what he can hope to achieve, Mr Pearce has done better than
you might expect. He writes well; he is therefore an agreeable read. His
little excursions about the nature of preferment inside the Conservative
party, or the true function of the whips' office, are both necessary to an
understanding his subject and a possibly useful addition to the reader's
store of knowledge.
As might be expected, there is not one drop of Kitty Kelley vitriol in these
pages. Indeed, there are no seriously adverse comments upon Mr Major. Mr
Pearce's tone is too matter-of-fact to be derided as hagiography; against
that it lacks the overlay of informed criticism necessary to a rounded
picture. Perhaps a posthumous biography will provide one. For now, the basic
facts will have to do.
Most of them are familiar. Mr Major is rare if not unique among British
prime ministers in the degree of economic hardship he endured as a child. He
really knows unemployment from the perspective of the dole queue. He has
brains, talent, and drive, although in the case of the first two qualities,
not necessarily in excess. Mr Pearce suggests that had the prime minister's
lower middle-class family not fallen upon hard times he might have made it
to Oxbridge; as it is he is an autodidact with a retentive memory and a
quick grasp of new material put before him.
His outstanding quality, whose origins are unclear, is his ability to get
along with people, to be liked even by his political and other opponents. A
Lambeth housing director, the late Harry Simpson, was an early mentor and
tutor in the ways of winning friends and influencing the opposition. Mr
Major is quoted as saying that 'he would take people who were totally
opposed to his view, he would analyse their outlook, and the first thing he
did was to understand their argument and why they made it. From that
perspective you can dismantle it unless of course you get a better
understanding and realize they may be right.' The prime minister's
predecessor did not attend the Simpson school of public service, but then
perhaps she might not have achieved as much as she did if she had.
Combined with a willingness to master the detail of briefs, Mr Major's
studied emollience worked well. It enabled an extremely ambitious
politician, who was not averse to using all the normal political tricks, to
rise from nowhere four years ago to prime minister today. Of the two
important posts Mr Major held along the way, Mr Pearce is defensive about
the brief spell as foreign secretary and rather at sea about the year as
chancellor of the exchequer.
As to the question, what is the real Mr Major like, this book gives the
answer, which is that there is no answer. Even the prime minister cannot
know it. Fate has only just picked up the clay. It is kneading it, taking
its time in shaping it. We will know what the prime minister is like when
office has fully formed him.

THE FALL OF THE BRITISH MONARCHIES, 1637-1642 by Conrad Russell Clarendon
Press, Oxford Pounds 40, 550 pages
CONRAD RUSSELL has something new to offer us in his approach to the too
well-trampled ground of the Civil War and Puritan Revolution. England was
only part of the problem, and the whole ghastly story has been seen too much
in terms of simply England. 'England in 1637 was a country in working order,
and was not on the edge of revolution.' Then how did it come about?
The three kingdoms were fundamentally diverse. Yet in the 17th century
people thought that diversity meant anarchy. The most inflammable source of
diversity was religion. Rulers thought that the cure was to impose
uniformity. We still have these problems with us to day. Look at Russia, the
Middle East, Northern Ireland.
Hindsight tells us that it was utterly impossible to impose uniformity in
the three kingdoms - any more than it had been in the Netherlands. In
England the majority held with the Anglican Church; in Scotland with the
Presbyterians; in Ireland with the Catholics.
Charles 1's attempt to achieve a measure of religious uniformity with
England in Scotland produced a rebellion which he had not the means to
suppress. So it was the Scots who triggered off civil war, and their
intervention which turned the scales in England. Then they attempted to
impose Presbyterian uniformity upon England] This was just as hopeless as
Charles 1's attempt in Scotland. People rarely learn from political
experience. It is an ironical, sad reflection upon human affairs that some
sort of unity was eventually achieved by Cromwell only by force. And then it
was against the majority in all three countries]
Mr Russell's book gives one more to think about than any of the scores of
books on the subject, mostly pro-Parliament, if not pro-Puritan. Russell is
more fair to Charles 1, thinks he was not more 'duplicitous' than
politicians are apt to be. As one reads one thinks of France in 1789, or
Russia today - and Catherine the Great said that Russia was 'ungovernable'.
Charles 1 found, or made, his kingdoms ungovernable. And one is impressed -
as Churchill was - by the intractable complexity of the situation. Russell's
book adds up to the old traditional view that it was the religious
animosities that made it so. The Puritan hatred of Laud was well nigh
insane. A leading MP speaks of the 'wicked tenets' of his Arminianism. This
was because the poor Archbishop believed in free will, and regarded
Calvinist Predestination, condemning the bulk of mankind to eternal
damnation, as abhorrent to his soul.
Of course he and Charles were more tolerant than they were, and more
sympathetic to the Catholics in Ireland than they could possibly be to
destructive Covenanters. A civilised man, Laud had been shocked by the
devastation of the cathedrals in Scotland: he called it 'Deformation, not
Reformation'. Puritans wanted to carry it further. A cultivated man, Charles
wanted to restore the noble fabric of St. Andrews. Civil war merely carried
destruction further all round.
The conflicts of the time have their consequences today. The last words of
the book read: 'As for Ulster, already in 1641 the crucible of the British
problem, that is a place where the issue of this process is yet in the
future.' Borne in upon one is the conclusion that human affairs, perhaps
especially political, are often very silly. Especially in time of
revolution, confusion, chaos.

TYRES DO not go down often now but when they do, it is easy not to know
about it until too late.
In a modern car with power steering, gradual leakage of air because of a
puncture is almost undetectable on a motorway. But the tyre is steadily
getting hotter and eventually it may blow out. Or, when you leave the
motorway on a curving slip road with a tyre grossly under-inflated, you
might lose control.
If drivers knew immediately a tyre was losing pressure, they could stop at
the next service area, go to an off-motorway garage or at least find
somewhere safer than the hard shoulder on which to change the wheel.
Deflation warning systems do exist; Porsche has one on the 928. The company
uses tiny, air pressure sensitive transmitters inside the tyre. When the
pressure falls, they send a signal to a receiver in the car and a warning is
flashed to the driver.
However, these cost too much to be practical for all but the most expensive
cars. At least, they have until now, but a bright idea by development
engineers at Sumitomo Rubber Europe BV may change that.
Sumitomo Rubber, which makes Dunlop tyres in Europe, has evolved a much
simpler and potentially cheaper deflation warning system. Ingeniously, it
uses hardware already in place on any car fitted with electronically
controlled anti-lock brakes or a traction control system.
Anti-lock (ABS) systems detect when a car's wheels are rotating at different
speeds under braking. Any wheel that is about to lock up and skid has its
brake released until the tyre grips again. Then the brake is reapplied.
This brakes on, brakes off cycle takes place many times a second if need be.
Traction control systems work in the same way, except they prevent wheelspin
being caused by too much engine power overcoming tyre grip.
Sumitomo uses the ABS brakes computer to detect a puncture by monitoring the
rolling radius of all four tyres on a car. When a tyre's inflation pressure
decreases, so does the rolling radius. As the tyre gets smaller, the wheel
turns faster. The computer passes the information to the Sumitomo system
which tells the driver he has a puncture.
The method has been tried before but the problem is that a 10 per cent
pressure loss reduces the tyre's radius by only 0.1 per cent, which can also
be caused by the car accelerating or cornering. Sumitomo has found a way of
making the computer understand when the tyre's shrinkage is caused by a
puncture and prevent it from giving a warning when it is due to normal
driving forces.
Before Sumitomo took over its tyre making business, Dunlop had a lot of
experience with its clever but commercially unsuccessful Denovo run-flat
tyre.
Motorists and car makers have made it clear that although they know all
about the theoretical benefits of specialised run-flat tyres, they won't put
up with their complication and expense.
The Sumitomo deflation warning system (DWS) is essentially a software
package that can be used either by its own computer or the one that operates
the anti-lock brakes.
Systems like Porsche's that use air pressure sensitive transmitters cost
several hundred pounds. It is too early for Sumitomo to put a price on its
own system, but it would clearly be much less. Low enough, in fact, for it
to be a practical optional extra for any car with ABS brakes.
Car makers in the US, Japan and Europe have the Sumitomo system under
evaluation. Sumitomo will not say when the system is likely to appear on
cars. But its safety potential seems so great it may not be long before DWS
joins ABS and TCS (traction control system) on the list of standard
equipment for up-market cars.

<TEXT>
AUDI COULD hardly have picked a better moment to launch its new executive
saloon, the 100, on the British company car market. At a time when money is
tight, it can point to its car prices rising by less than the rate of
inflation in the last year. Although the new ones cost about 7 per cent more
than the outgoing models, the price now includes ABS anti-lock brakes as
standard. So, too, is Procon-Ten, Audi's unique crash protection system. It
pulls the steering wheel away from the driver and tightens the front seat
belts in an impact severe enough to shift the engine backwards.
Three of the cars - the 100 2.0E with manual or automatic transmission (both
due in the UK in June) and the 100 2.3E manual - are priced below the Pounds
19,250 tax break figure. First to go on sale - they will be in UK
dealerships on May 8 - are the 133 horsepower 5-cylinder 2.3E and the 174
horsepower 2.8E (pictured), which has a brand new, narrow angle V6 engine.
Having sampled two of the new 100s, an automatic with front-wheel drive and
a manual gearbox quattro, I rate them attractive alternatives to class
rivals such as Mercedes 190, 200 and 230 and the BMW 320 and 325. Coming in
September are Avant estate car versions, automatics with quattro
transmissions and a super-economy direct-injection turbo-diesel.

WARM WEATHER, sunshine and the beginning of a new cricket season. It was too
good to be true. To make the most of it before April wind and hailstorms
closed in, I travelled south, to Kent. There I talked to Derek Underwood,
England's most subtle and devastating Test bowler of the late 1960s and 70s,
now a salesman of artificial grass surfaces for cricket pitches.
He gave me his views on England's forthcoming series with the West Indies,
the team arrives early next month thirsty for battle and blood. He gave me
an expert's views. A bowler's views.
Underwood is the same reticent figure now that he was in his playing days,
with the air of one who is constantly thinking, never divulging. No wonder
batsmen found him hard to play - he looks hard to play. That was one of his
most effective weapons, as he believes it should be of every bowler. 'Always
be planning something new. Cricket is only about 40 per cent ability; it's
60 per cent mental approach.'
No-one who saw any of Underwood's most ingenious spells of bowling, such as
the classic masterpiece on the last day of the 1968 Oval Test against the
Australians, when he took 7-50 to win the match and save the series, could
dare doubt him.
Underwood was a slow medium-pace left-arm, round-the-wicket merchant of
menace. As England's bowling at the moment is short of fast, medium, slow
and spin bowling, he has no doubt that it must make menace it strength. 'If
I was about to start a series against the West Indies, I would be discussing
and thinking about their batting, analysing it, getting some strategies
worked out.'
I asked if there were any weak links who might merit extra careful study? As
cautious as he is shrewd, Underwood gave a guarded reply. 'Gordon Greenidge,
I suppose. A wonderful batsman, but by now he must be a bit slower than he
was.'
Greenidge's recent form has looked a little on the weak side. If he and
Desmond Haynes maintain their tradition of opening the West Indian batting
this summer, England must concentrate on dislodging him early, before the
partnership develops into a match-winning one, like the 298 he and Haynes
rattled up in their last Test against England, at Antigua a year ago.
Sometimes, if the West Indian batsmen fall into a downward slide, they lose
patience and are almost as liable to collapse as England - witness their
first Test against Pakistan last November.
If England can get an early breakthrough, they need to keep the tactical
initiative, bowling with great thought and aggression to Viv Richards, the
West Indies captain and Underwood's second (and more surprising) choice as a
vulnerable West Indian batsman. Underwood thinks Richards has so much
natural talent that 'he may have become just a little bit arrogant now,'
resentful of setbacks, perhaps better at staging a brilliant individual
stand of defiance than leading a team fightback.
This is brave thinking, and Underwood admitted with a wry smile that
'Richards is always a danger and likely to score at least one, probably two
hundreds in five Tests.' But he has his weaknesses: 'The old game is a great
leveller.' England would be glad if fate chose to level out Test match
fortune for them this summer, but if psychologically powered bowling is to
be their main means of helping this happen, they need to arrange its use
clearly. English fast bowling at the moment is limited to Devon Malcolm, a
strike bowler of occasionally demonic form, who needs a partner in pace at
the other end.
Angus Fraser is not a pace bowler and it is misguided to try and use him as
one. England would do better to give Martin Bicknell credit for taking more
wickets last season than any other English bowler of fair pace except Neil
Foster of Essex (ineligible since going on the unofficial 1989-90 tour of
South Africa), Tim Munton of Warwickshire and Steve Watkin of
Glamorganshire. If Bicknell does open the English bowling with Malcolm, he
should do so not for one game but for the whole series, come what may - a
vote of confidence such as few English players receive nowadays.
Fraser should be used in the vital, difficult, fast-medium slot where he
belongs, to take over from opening spells of speed. If he survives the
intensive training and practice demanded by modern English cricket's fitness
regime, he and Munton can generate enough refinements of length and movement
to make them an effective fast-medium pair. Such a pair would be a great
boost to English resources this summer - containing, frustrating and
trapping West Indian batsmen keen to cut loose.
It is not an easy task. West Indian batsmen have not looked seriously
uncertain in English Test matches for over 20 years. The last time the West
Indies lost a series in England was in 1969, when Gary Sobers' great side of
the 1960s had broken up, morale had sunk and the corpus of 70s and 80s West
Indian skill, which is now in its twilight years, had not yet been
established.
Presumably the main body of this summer's West Indian batting line-up, after
the opening pair, will be drawn from Gus Logie, Brian Lara, Ritchie
Richardson, Carlyle Best, Carl Hooper, Jeff Dujon and Viv Richards, who
comes in anything from No 5 to No 7. Not an encouraging batting target for
bowlers.
Underwood says all England need do is convince themselves that they will win
and, if that proves too much, give the impression that they believe they
will win. After all, England won the first Test in the West Indies early in
1990, having lost 14 of their previous 15 Test matches in the West Indies.
Nothing is impossible.
Richardson has never yet managed to do his sparkling best in England; Dujon
is said to be less nifty than of old behind the stumps, and, if only
England's captain and selectors will take up their most exciting chance, few
of the West Indian batsmen are used to playing high-class spin bowling in
English conditions.
Naturally, Underwood has clear ideas about this subject and they are ideas
with appeal to anyone who finds the remorseles monopoly of speed in West
Indies bowling claustrophobic. 'We need a specialist spinner, a canny one
prepared to really use the ball, bowl it up and give it air. We should play
Richard Illingworth. And a slow bowler who uses flight, if only there was
one - Phil Tufnell, I suppose.'
Now that would be real attack. Surprise is such an asset in attack and a
battery of slow, guileful bowlers, undaunted by lifeless pitches or
blistering batsmen, would be a surprise response to the one-track Caribbean
bowling assault.
England have nothing to lose. They can't do worse than they did in the last
two blackwashes at home. They might as well set to work on building an
attack against the odds. The first Test is the one that matters most.
England should go out to bowl in it armed with some unusual weapons, aiming
to unsettle the batsmen.
I had to end by asking Underwood if England would beat the West Indies. He
was careful, if not grim. 'They've got their work cut out,' he said.

FT  27 APR 91 / Sport: Indulging in memoraborgia - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE start it was Mission Impossible. Whoever he had played in the first
round in Monte Carlo on Tuesday, Bjorn Borg would have lost. Yet I take no
pleasure from having forecast the defeat of the former world champion at the
hands of the 26-year-old Spaniard, Jordi Arrese, who has never been ranked
higher than 28.
After all, it was not difficult to see that a man of 34 who has not played a
tennis match for eight years and is using a wooden tennis racket cannot
expect to compete on level terms with a tournament-tough pro wielding a
graphite frame. The fact that Bjorn, in his prime, was arguably the greatest
match player ever counts for nothing.
During Borg's eight-year absence the game's equipment has improved. So have
the players. They are bigger, fitter and faster than tennis players have
ever been. Thanks to modern technology men like Agassi, Sampras and
Ivanisevic can hit the ball much harder than ever before. This makes for
more excitement on slower courts but shortens the rallies and diminishes the
spectacle on fast surfaces.
The men's game has become more physical, less subtle, though the women's
game has benefited by making winners easier and reducing tedious rallies.
I can understand why Bjorn is attempting a come-back, and believe him when
he says it has nothing to do with money. His complicated private life has
certainly not brought much happiness. How natural, then, that he should seek
that elusive commodity in the arena where he was once supreme. Revealingly,
he said this week how great it felt to walk out to a tumultuous welcome and
to perform again for his public.
What Bjorn will discover, however, is that it is not much fun losing. He
never had much practice at that. Yet if he were prepared to set his sights a
bit lower he would discover a world of opportunity. Today's 35-and-over
circuit is growing fast and although the prizemoney is relatively modest,
men like Stan Smith, Bob Lutz, Ilie Nastase, Roger Taylor and John Lloyd
enjoy themselves and provide wonderful entertainment. Whatever Bjorn decides
to do, I, for one, hope that he opts for the junior veterans' tour next
year.
Anyway, his reappearance offers me the excuse to indulge in a little
memoraborgia:
Nice 1971 - Lennart Bergelin shouting his head off. This is a crisis. Unless
the 14-year-old Borg can be dragged off the practice court to join the rest
of the Swedish junior team in the bus, they will all miss their dinner.
Wimbledon 1972 - Bjorn wins the junior event by recovering from 2-5 in the
final set to beat Britain's Buster Mottram 7-5. In these columns I wrote: '.
. . clearly the Swedish boy is a match player of some class but, from the
way he hits the ball, he is unlikely to be of much account on grass.' At the
time, everyone agreed]
Wimbledon final 1976 - Wondering how Bjorn could serve as well as he was
doing against Nastase when he was having to apply a cold spray to a damaged
stomach muscle at each change of ends. His serve, not his groundstrokes, was
the cornerstone of this first of five Wimbledon successes.
Wimbledon final 1980 - Marvelling at the quality of Bjorn's serving in the
final set of a memorable final against John McEnroe who had saved five match
points in winning the 4th set tie-break 18-16. Borg wins Wimbledon for the
last time: 1-6 7-5 6-3 6-7 8-6.
It was a fitting climax to a glorious career. That is how I shall remember
him.

FT  27 APR 91 / Despatches: Jews who seek a German safe haven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IDA WEIZMAN, from Vinkovtsy in the Ukraine, shrugged her frail shoulders
when asked why she had come to Germany along with nearly 4,000 other Soviet
Jews since last year. Hesitatingly, her husband Josef spoke instead,
explaining that oddly he was 'less afraid in Germany than in the Ukraine.'
His wife nodded. Germany was a 'civilised country' with a sense of guilt,
she said softly. It was a remarkable utterance coming from a woman with her
searing experience. In 1941, at the age of 12, she was herded with her
family into the ghetto of Vinkovtsy by the Nazis. Rescued by a Ukrainian
woman who kept her hidden under straw, she did not emerge until the Soviet
Army returned in 1944. Her father and brother were both murdered by the
Nazis.
Both Ida and Josef Weizman said they feared an outbreak of pogroms in the
Ukraine. They had ruled out Israel as a future home because their health was
poor.
Although most emigrating Soviet Jews would prefer to go to Israel, hundreds
arrive in Germany each week and nearly 3,000 last year, raising the
prospect, unthinkable only a short time ago, of a flowering of Jewish life
in the nation responsible for Auschwitz.
The economic motive is powerful among Soviet Jews planning to emigrate to
Germany. But it is inseparable from fears that anti-semitism, always present
in Soviet society, will become virulent as the disintegration of the Soviet
economy accelerates.
Most Jews admit they did relatively well in the Soviet Union, with many
belonging to the intelligentsia and some operating in the black market.
Disparaging remarks about Jews are increasingly heard in the lengthening
food queues as well as in the metro and buses. Instinctively, the Jews feel
that the overt anti-semitism of the ultra-nationalist Pamyat movement is
falling on increasingly fertile ground.
Most of those emigrating are in the prime of life and highly skilled. 'We
are getting the cream of Soviet Jewish intelligentsia,' says Matthias Jahr,
head of the Advisory Office for Jewish Emigrants. Engineers, computer
specialists and doctors were more likely to find adequate employment in the
German economy than anywhere else. They did not want to end up as manual
labourers in Israel.
Difficulties have been caused, however by the fact that many Russians have
been arriving in Berlin with forged papers declaring them to be Jews. Among
Soviet Jews this was jocularly referred to as 'capitulation.'
Boris Wolisson, 49, a balding computer programmer from Kharkov in the
Ukraine, came to Berlin last year with his grown-up son and non-Jewish
former wife.
'I feel more Russian than Jewish, otherwise I would have gone to Israel,' he
explained, waiting outside the Advisory Office. Like most Soviet Jews he was
not religious. He said his son, a talented biophysicist, was one of the main
reasons he had come to Germany. The young man's career outlook in the Soviet
Union had been bleak but he now had a chance of getting a coveted a research
position in Berlin.
A Jewish woman who came to Berlin 20 years ago waited at the Advisory Office
with her newly-arrived brother from Leningrad, an engineer, and his family.
Her brother said that his nine-year-old daughter had been subjected to
massive anti-semitism at school from children who were echoing remarks heard
at home. Symptomatically, none of the teachers intervened to stop the
harrassment.
This and worsening economic conditions had made them leave everything behind
them including a one-family house and car - a good life by Soviet standards.
'It is like a contagious disease, one family that emigrates triggers off the
decision by another family to do the same,' his sister explained. She avowed
to having adapted to life in Germany like a 'fish to water.' Her two
children, who were 14 and four years old when she came, now felt themselves
to be Germans more than anything else. Some German politicians sense the
unique opportunity to inject a vigorous new element into the tiny, ageing
Jewish community in Germany of some 30,000 survivors. Others, however,
suspiciously view the Soviet Jews as the vanguard of a horde of destitute
Russians and other easterners preparing to descend on Germany.
Thus the German authorities have displayed a somewhat ambivalent attitude
towards the Soviet Jews. Invited by East Germany, which ceased to exist last
October 3, they were officially 'tolerated' by the Bonn Government, that is,
allowed to stay for an indefinite time. At first no more than 1,000 Jews
were to be allowed in but this suggested limit was sharply criticised by
Heinz Galinski, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. The
irrascible Galinski, himself a survivor of Auschwitz and other camps,
regards the rejuvenation of the Jewish community in Germany as a question of
its very 'survival.'
Wolfgang Schauble, the German Interior Minister, promised that entry for
Soviet Jews would be handled 'generously' but could not exceed a 'tolerable'
limit. No exact figure was given but 10,000 a year was suggested as a
reasonable number. Israel, and some Jewish organisations in the US,
expressed concern over the number of Soviet Jews arriving in Germany
although it was minute compared with the 185,000 who came to Israel last
year. Ironically, problems also arose with a considerable number of Russians
who turned up in Berlin with forged papers declaring them to be Jews.
The Soviet Jews bring with them a remarkable reservoir of goodwill. The
German government this month ruled that Soviet Jews who wanted to emigrate
to Germany could no longer come as tourists but would need visas from the
German Embassy in Moscow. Lutz Voss, an official of the Berlin Interior
Department, said it was unclear whether the number of Jews to be allowed in
will be unrestricted but that no evident limit had been set by the Bonn
government. The Jews are to be treated as refugees and distributed among the
Lander (states). No Jews would be accepted as refugees once they had gone to
Israel he noted, an apparent concession to Israeli concerns.
A Soviet Jewess who was among the first Russian Jews to emigrate to Germany
instead of Israel in the early 1980s, waited patiently with her
newly-arrived brother from Leningrad, an engineer, his wife and daughter.
Like many of the Soviet Jews they live in east Germany in a former hostel
for Vietnamese workers but are eager to settle in Berlin.
The Soviet Jews have expunged as far as possible the Nazi era from their
memories. Before the Nazis, Germany represented everything which was
progressive to many Russians and Russian Jews alike.
'Germany is a democratic country,' Boris Kaplan, an engineer, remarked. He
came from Lwow in the Ukraine with his wife and son. They left out of fear
of Pamyat, the nationalist and anti-semitic movement. He said of Germany:
'The people like Jews and we like the Germans.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Food: Mussels with pulling power - A dish to nourish on
chilly spring days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I USED to catch an occasional but lurid glimpse of the news as told in
papers other than the Financial Times. My source was the fishmonger. Mussels
were sold by the pint then. Dripping with seaweed, heavily barnacled, they
were measured in metal scoops and the shovelfuls were wrapped in layers of
newspaper to mop up the wetness as you carried them home.
Back in my kitchen I tipped the molluscs into the sink and left them to soak
and feed on the handful of oatmeal I gave them, rather as though they were
goldfish in a tank. Then I settled down to review the soggy Page Three
statistics and the amazing feats at the vicarage as revealed to Our Special
Reporter, salacious titbits that added to the savour of feasting on mussels.
A decade before that I used to buy mussels in a Mediterranean cove from
local boys I saw with knives in their teeth swimming out to the banks where
mollusc colonies flourished and where rocks were hedgehog-thick with sea
urchins. They brought the seafood back, drippingly fresh, in string bags
fashioned from old fishing nets, and we ate it for lunch within the hour,
with only a squeeze of lemon.
The waters there were wonderfully limpid and terrible tales about pollution
had not been told then. I dare say it is a different story today.
Now the mussels I buy are often farmed rather than wild. No longer swathed
in seaweed or barnacle encrusted, they are thin shelled and graded by size.
Now they are sold by the pound or in kilo bags made of perforated polythene.
Less romantic, less exciting, but the mussels are still very much alive
alive-o.
The deliciousness and the extraordinary good value remain and there is less
work for the cook. It doesn't take long to bath and barber mussels now. No
massive scrubbing is necessary, no lengthy de-bearding session, and some say
that the flesh of farmed mussels is plumper, sweeter and more succulent than
wild.
The recipe which follows is a cross between a soup and a stew, a first and
main course rolled into one, my favourite sort of food for informal
entertaining.
Mussels need to be cooked just before eating but all the preparatory work
can be done ahead. The cooking of the mussels is swift, then you can sit
down, relax and enjoy the meal with the rest of the party. This is food to
eat out of doors if you can or in the halfway house of a conservatory where
you can feel the warmth of an April sun but be spared the bite of the wind.
Serve the stew steaming hot and hand round a bowl of aioli (a mildly rather
than extravagantly garlicky version is best with this dish I think) so that
dollops of it can be stirred into the stew to enrich it to individual taste.
Have a loaf of good bread on hand, bottles of crisp chilled wine, finger
bowls and napkins big enough to use as bibs. A salad and cheese is as much
as anyone will want to eat afterwards.
MUSSEL, FENNEL AND POTATO STEW (serves 4-6)
5 lb mussels; 3 bulbs of Florentine fennel; 1 1/4 lb waxy potatoes; 1 onion;
1 1/2 pt fish stock; 2 long curls of thinly pared orange peel; 1 teaspoon
lightly toasted and bruised fennel seeds; a good pinch of saffron; 1 bay
leaf; 2-3 tablespoons chopped parsley; a little olive oil; a glass of dry
white wine (or very dry cider or apple juice); a splash of Pernod
(optional).
Trim the fennel reserving all the feathery fronds. Put the trimmings into a
stockpot. Add the orange peel, fennel seeds, bay leaf and stock. Simmer for
about 30 minutes. Strain and fast-boil until reduced to a scant  3/4 pt
richly flavoured liquid - remember that the potatoes will mute the flavour
later.
Chop the onion and soften it in a little oil in a stewpan. Cut a half of one
of the fennel bulbs into fine dice and reserve these little pieces with the
feathery fronds. Cut the remaining fennel into wedges or chunks. Turn up the
heat under the stewpan. Sear the fennel briefly, remove and reserve it
separately.
Draw the stewpan away from the heat. Clean the potatoes, peel them if you
like, and cut into chunks. Add them to the stewpan, stirring to coat with
oil and so prevent discolouration. Cover and set aside.
Clean the mussels in several changes of cold salted water, scrubbing
barnacles and tugging away beards as necessary. Discard any mussels that
have damaged shells or that continue to gape when firmly tapped.
Choose a large shallow pan in which to cook the mussels - if the mussels are
thinly spread over the source of heat they will have a better chance of
cooking and opening in unison. Pour the wine into it. (Everything up to this
stage can be done well ahead.)
Shortly before you want to serve the stew, stir the saffron into the
stewpan. Pour on the stock (and the Pernod if using it) and bring quickly to
the boil. Cover and simmer for about 5 minutes. Add the wedges of fennel and
cook for a few minutes more until the vegetables are cooked through.
While the vegetables are cooking, bring the wine to the boil. Add the
mussels, cover and cook over high heat, shaking the pan now and again, until
the molluscs open.
Discard any mussels that remain obstinately closed after cooking. Transfer
the rest complete with their wide-mouthed shells to a warmed soup tureen,
adding the cooked vegetables and the chopped fennel and parsley between
layers.
Strain the mussel cooking liquor through damp buttermuslin into the stewpan.
Bring the combined liquids to simmering point, check and adjust seasoning.
Pour the steaming fragrant liquid over the stew and serve.

FT  27 APR 91 / Food: A refuge of good cooking - Nicholas Lander with the
first article of an occasional series by Weekend FT writers on eating out in
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER

<TEXT>
EVEN FOR those who know France well the city of Albi in the south-west seems
to hold a certain fascination. Its macabre history during the 12th and 13th
centuries, brought home every time you look at the imposing cathedral, the
extraordinary museum with so many rooms devoted to Albi's most famous son,
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and its position above the River Tarn, all leave
a lasting impression.
Places to stay in Albi include the Hostellerie St Aubine (Tel: 63.54.04.04)
and the Hotel Altea (63.47.66.66). Just behind the museum there are two good
restaurants, the Bateau Ivre (63.38.08.06)for fish and, virtually next door,
L'Esprit du Vin (63.54.60.44) where a thoughtful proprietor offers a
suitable wine to be served by the glass with each of his dishes. But, for
culinary gems, one has to travel outside the city.
Fifteen kilometres south is the small town of Relmont where a chicken and
garlic market is held every Wednesday. Close to the colonnaded centre is the
Hotel Noel (63.55.52.80) which has been in the same family for the past five
generations - although recently a son-in-law took over at the kitchen
stoves.
There are eight bedrooms and a delightful terrace; the dining room is
charming. With an open log fire, and lovingly polished panelling, the room
proudly displays the accoutrements assembled from having served good food
for so long.
The cooking does not disappoint. Foie gras sauteed with capers and apples, a
delicious line-caught sea-bass fresh from the Mediterranean with a lovely
bearnaise sauce and an excellent rendition of the classic veal kidneys in a
seed mustard sauce were served under the beady eye of a very attentive
maitress d'. Fixed price menus range from FFr120 to FFr220.
Some 25 km north west of Albi is the almost dizzily placed town of Cordes.
Named after the Spanish city of Cordoba, the hilltop stronghold was a Cathar
refuge during the early 13th century. So impregnable is its natural
position, the story goes, that French troops sent from Paris to put down the
heretics took one look at Cordes and turned back. Even today, in spite of
the advantage of a car, the summit of the town with its narrow cobbled
streets can be difficult to navigate.
Since 1980, however, when Yves Thuries bought the Hotel du Grand Ecuyer and
began to build his personal empire, Cordes has undergone a culinary
invasion. Over the past decade Thuries has also acquired the Hostellerie du
Vieux Cordes (63.56.00.12) close by, has his own patisserie and set up a
publishing house for his cookery books. In the process he has become a town
councillor and the biggest employer in Cordes.
Born in nearby Gaillac, Thuries began his apprenticeship as a patissier at
the age of 14 and for the next 20 years worked his way around France under
the auspices of the Compagnons du Tour de France which encourages such
apprentices. Now a Compagnon himself he wears its badge, an earring in his
left ear, with pride as well as other fashion pointers such as trousers
rolled to the calf, white stockings, and a chef's jacket with the tricolore
around the neck.
In 1976 - the same year as Michel Roux, who runs the Waterside Inn at Bray
in Berkshire - Thuries became a Meilleur Ouvrier de France. This
competition, established in 1924, is held every three or four years (it has
been introduced into Great Britain) to find the best culinary craftsmen in
the country. Thuries distinguished himself by becoming the only French chef
to achieve the necessary standards in more than one discipline - as
traiteur/patissier and confiseur/glacier. Once qualified Thuries turned his
attention to Cordes. From March 1 to November 1 every year he runs his
hotels; from November to March he writes. He will shortly be producing his
tenth book, a culinary encyclopedia.
He has spent a great deal of time and money on the Grand Ecuyer filling it
with suits of armour and 18th century carriages and fitting out the bedrooms
in great comfort overlooking the lush countryside. He has acquired a
wide-ranging and reasonably-priced wine cellar and, with the advantage of
being the largest employer in town, a thoughtful staff with a particularly
knowledgeable sommelier.
Thuries's food bears the stamp of a man who has been at the stoves a long
time. There are five fixed price menus ranging from FFr180 to FFr360 and we
chose what was billed as a four-course dinner with four desserts at FFr320.
What we had not counted on was Thuries's passion for, and skill with,
patisserie.
Before the first course there were three deliveries of amuses-gueules,
including a small portion of a fish terrine, then a lobster bisque served in
a minute copper pot. One main course, two slices of foie gras served hot
inside very delicate pancakes with a port sauce, was stunning. But it was
really only after the cheese that the meal began.
In my innocence I had imagined that the dessert would comprise one large
plate with a small portion of each. Instead four desserts followed in
sequence and each was better than its predecessor: a black and white ice
cream with a mango puree and chocolate sticks, a roulade of chocolate with a
wonderful pea green pistachio sauce, a hot orange souffle with a caramel
sauce and finally three different sorbets.
If their aim was to clean the palate the intention was undone by the arrival
of two lots of petits fours', fruit-based with the desserts and
chocolate-based with the coffee. On the bed at night a chocolate truffle
waited for us in vain.
Hotel du Grand Ecuyer, Cordes, 81170 France. Tel: 63.56.01.03. Fax:
63.56.16.99. 12 bedrooms from FFr 600.

FT  27 APR 91 / Wine: Stops at all stations - A port railway, the ideal gift
for the drinking man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I've never made a table - I'd love to have a go,' said the artist over a
pint in a pub in London's St James's.
IT ended the yearning, which began in my teens, to own a port railway; for
within a few months Richard Grasby delivered a round oaken dining table
complete with the 'railway' on which the decanters coast.
Port railways were something we speculated about as impecunious youngsters
learning the art and craft of imbibing. No-one I knew then had ever seen
one, much less owned one. Just how rare they are can be judged from how
little space they are given in The Book of Wine Antiques (Robin Butler and
Gillian Walkling, Antique Collectors Club, 1986) which has four pictures of
wine wagons but none at all of table-top railways for liquor. The authors
say only that 'wagons enjoyed very short popularity at the beginning of the
19th century.'
In fact, I had pretty well given up hope of ever finding a port railway
when, on a visit to Churchill College, Cambridge, in the late 1970s I saw my
first.
It happened like this. The Master, then Sir William Hawthorne, the inventive
engineer, was showing me around the college, including the Lodge where he
lived. He said he had something he thought might particularly interest me.
He told me how Brendan Bracken, who died in 1959, had willed an
idiosyncratic collection of furniture to the trustees of the fund for the
proposed Churchill College. It was just enough to furnish the dining room of
the Lodge.
Bracken had been Sir Winston Churchill's friend and colleague in Cabinet
during the Second World War, and was also publisher of the post-war
Financial Times.
Bracken had explained his intentions regarding the furniture in a letter to
a friend: 'In distant times the comforts and dignity of the Masters' Lodges
encouraged all sorts of useful people to seek their hospitality. And so I
hope the Churchill College will not only be acclaimed as a house of
learning, but also as one of discerning hospitality.'
Centrepiece of Bracken's dining suite is a round mahogany table, early 19th
century, 5 ft in diameter, seating eight comfortably. It has a moulded
border and stands on a carved, tulip-shaped plinth.
What the Master really wanted to show me was the port railway, also carved
from mahogany. This is a circular track of six segments which lock together,
rather like those Hornby train sets we used to get at Christmas, to form a
railway with wooden rails 5 in apart, lying 3 in from the edge of the table.
Once the ladies had left, the butler would assemble this track.
On the wooden rails rides a curved coaster or wine tray, long enough to
carry three or four decanters. The coaster, of polished mahogany, has six
wooden wheels.
If it has a fault, this graceful aid to good living appears to crowd
inconveniently close to the diner, who must reach across the track to find
his glass. But it has been beautifully wrought to allow the liquor to coast
smoothly in response to the gentlest push.
The Master related how once he had produced it to entertain a Soviet
engineer at the Lodge - 'to give him an idea how the capitalists live,' he
chuckled. His guest evinced not the slightest surprise.
I was much more appreciative than the Russian, but no nearer my ambition of
owning such a toy, for the antique was clearly not the Master's to sell. It
had been left by Bracken in perpetuity to the Lodge. Its essential
simplicity set me thinking, however, of having one made if only I could find
a sympathetic craftsman.
Richard Grasby and I had met in the cause of making educational aids; he as
artist with special flair for presenting technical complexities in bold yet
simple graphics. Might it be possible to avoid the complexity of a separate
track by grooving the table? I inquired.
Grasby seized the suggestion and was off to his studio in Bedchester,
Dorset, to experiment. Within days he was back to say that he believed, from
trials with a little wooden model of one axle, we might manage with just a
single groove to guide the coaster.
He designed a round table 5 ft in diameter with a single circular groove 9
in from the edge, supported by a central pillar of splayed legs. Like
Bracken's table, it seats eight.
The table top is cut from four planks of prime English oak, 1 1/2 in thick.
From the offcuts he fashioned the legs. Their central pillar is decorated
with carved wooden wheels that match the wheels of the coaster.
The wine coaster is a curved oaken tray about 15 in in length with eight
boxwood wheels which run on brass spindles in brass bearings. Only the inner
wheels are flanged for the groove. Grasby has left enough slack in the
coaster's suspension to produce a slight rattle, evocative of a rail train,
as the port railway carries decanters from glass to glass.
The essential simplicity of his scheme is also the saving grace of this
splendid piece of self-indulgence. Once the tablecloth is removed the
railway is ready, needing no butler to lay the track. If my wife had a worry
it was that the groove might clog with crumbs, giving the port a rough ride.
I am pleased to report that such is the care the artist lavished on carving
and waxing his unique work, that it circulates without even the hint of a
hiccup.

FT  27 APR 91 / Wine: The wine lake starts to overflow - Why severe frosts
in Bordeaux are not too much cause for concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER BIG vintage this year would have a disastrous effect on the Bordeaux
trade, so last weekend's severe frost will have had a good short term
effect. However, curtailed stocks for a year or so will not affect the
current trend towards overproduction.
AFTER three abundant vintages in France, concern is growing that there is
too much wine and the yields are too high. There has always been too much
vin de table in the Midi but now there is apprehension about some of the
appellation controlee wines that account for 20-25 per cent of total French
production.
This applies particularly in Bordeaux, the biggest appellation controlee
region, and in Burgundy, where world demand for white wines has encouraged
over-production.
AC wines are controlled from the vineyards upwards, with specified grapes,
minimum alcoholic strengths and maximum yields per hectare. Apart from
generic wines such as Bordeaux Rouge or Bourgogne Blanc, or large
one-appellation districts such as Alsace or Muscadet, they tend to be based
on communes rather than single estates. So, the appellations for Ch Latour
and Montrachet are only Pauillac and Puligny, which can be pretty basic
wines.
The system began in 1935 with the foundation of the Institut National des
appellations d'Origine (INAO) which has designated, defined and generally
improved the quality of the wines under its control. Among the superior ACs,
however, the authorised maximum yields increasingly were challenged; and as
viticultural skills rose and the techniques of vinication developed rapidly,
there was good reason to have more flexible regulations, according to the
quality of each vintage.
In 1974, the INAO introduced a new system giving each AC a basic maximum
yield per ha (rendement de base). This can be varied up or down by the
committee (syndicat) of the growers in each appellation, which meets shortly
before the vintage and forwards its views for the INAO's approval. This is
known as the rendement annuel. Not surprisingly, demands for reductions have
been far fewer than for increases and the growers have, on the whole, got
their way.
Yet, on top of this the INAO allowed a further level of yield - a 'ceiling',
generally of 20 per cent (plafond limite de classement) subject to tasting.
But if wine fails at this maximum, the grower's whole crop can be
declassified and sent for distillation or vinegar.
Theoretically, this plafond limite de classement is allowed only 'in an
exceptional year when quality and quantity conicides'. This concession was,
however, launched in the prolific but distinctly poor vintage of 1974 -
something that did not inspire confidence in the INAO's judgment. Now,
ceilings are created practically everywhere every year. Not long ago,
Pauillac obtained one of 70 hl per ha, a level at which quality can be
affected only negatively.
Then, in 1983, there was a nation-wide shake up of appellations and most of
Bordeaux's 57 different varieties were substantially increased in yield:
Bordeaux Rouge from 50 to 55 hl, Bordeaux Blanc from 50 to 65, Pauillac from
40 to 45. But St Emilion was unaltered at 45 and Pomerol moved up only from
40 to 42.
With 1988, 1989 and now 1990 on the books, Bordeaux has a marketing problem.
For 1989's record claret production has been followed by another record 4.9m
hl of AC red wine. Although 200-250 chateaux have international reputations
that provide them with important sales abroad, only about 10 per cent of
these have no selling worries.
Bernard Mallet, president of the growers' syndicate of the Cote de Bourg and
proprietor of the respected Ch Haut-Macao, warned recently: 'With a global
production of six million we are moving towards serious mishaps . . .We must
keep down the production, being very strict on planting: no more new
planting rights for five years, and restricted transfer of rights.'
On the crucial matter of limiting yields, Mallet said the rendement de base
of each appellation should be applied strictly. He also proposed restrictive
conditions on individual applications for an increased percentage, such as
limiting to 1 per cent the addition of wine by means of chaptalisation
(sugaring of the must) instead of the 2 per cent allowed normally.
These outspoken remarks reflect the views of many and they back up what
Hubert Mussotte, the influential head of the Comite Interprofessionel's
statistical department, wrote last June before that year's record harvest:
'The acknowledged fall in the sales of the red wines deserves particular
attention. Is it the forerunner of a serious crisis, because of the
imbalance created by the increase in vineyard area and crops faced by
stagnation in consumption?'
About 400,000 hl of last year's generic AC red Bordeaux has been blocked
from sale in a reserve qualitative of those wines that exceeded a certain
yield: in the case of Bordeaux Rouge, above 45 hl per ha; and 40 hl of Medoc
and Graves. This is done to stabilise prices, and the wines will be released
before this year's vintage, but it demonstrates the size of the local 'wine
lake'.
This is confirmed by Peter Sichel, chairman of the Union des Grands Crus,
principal shareholder of Ch Palmer and owner of Ch d'Angludet, in his new
annual Vintage and Market Report. No fewer than 393,000 hl of wine, nearly
all red, were eliminated from the 1990 crop totals because they exceeded the
ceiling of 61 hl, and were sent for distillation.
Since the last vintage, trade has been very quiet in Bordeaux at all levels,
and, apart from the normal sales of basic wines consumed quickly, there has
been little forward interest in the undoubtedly excellent 1990 superior
appellations. Exports have been poor in important but recession-hit markets
like the UK and US, yet sales abroad are crucial to Bordeaux. In 1989 these
approached 2m hl in volume and FFr 5bn in value.
The UK was then (and could still be when the 1990 statistics come out)
Bordeaux's biggest customer: sales of 320m hl, worth FFr 700m. Moreover,
although US imports from Bordeaux have been falling fast since 1986, the
average price paid per bottle is the highest in the world and it is the
biggest buyer of classed-growth clarets.
Now, with large unsold or unconsumed stocks in both countries, the recession
and a low dollar-franc exchange rate, en primeur buyers of the 1990 clarets
are hardly likely to be encouraged.

FT  27 APR 91 / Minding Your Own Business: When the good life goes bad -
John Taylor of the Rural Development Commission tells Nick Garnett that
fledgling businesses in England's countryside and small towns are in poor
health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY WERE, in a way, the opposite of the Not-In-My-Back-Yard syndrome.
During the 1980s, thousands of businesses made an exodus from the grime of
the conurbations to villages and market towns, setting up offices and
workshops right in their own backyards. Converting bedrooms into
workstations and setting up companies in converted barns next to their new
rural homes were goals for many keen to marry the making of money with the
good life.
This migration has pushed up the number of companies in the countryside. The
Rural Development Commission has just conducted a survey of the health of
tiny businesses in England's countryside and small towns. It estimates that
in England 300,000 to half a million businesses employing less than 50
pockmark villages and towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants.
The Commission, an arm of the Environment Department, says operating in
rural areas still offers considerable advantages over large towns and
cities. But it acknowledges that during recession companies in the
countryside endure headaches over and above low orders, slow cash flow, late
payments and pressure from banks which now bedevil the small business
venture. As a result, more of the Commission's Pounds 38m yearly budget is
now directed at helping them survive the recession.
'I think there are three or four specific problems that rural businesses
face,' says John Taylor, the Commission's operations director.
'First, the client base tends to be much narrower in rural areas than in
urban areas. It is not so easy in the midst of rural Herefordshire to go and
find more customers during a recession. I think it is a lot easier if you
are in the middle of, say, Birmingham. Geographical position definitely
causes difficulties.'
Second, says Taylor, there is the issue of being what the Commission refers
to as a singleton business. 'That means that in that locality there is no
other similar business doing what that company does. If you were a bank
manager in Leicester you might have on your stocks scores of clothing firms,
small, medium and large ones. You will have a view and feel for that
industry. If you're a bank manager in the middle of a rural county, then you
might have only one clothing firm that you deal with. The bank manager's
expertise may well be in lending to the agricultural community rather than
to industry.'
Does that mean that Taylor thinks rural businesses sometimes do not receive
as sensible advice from banks as they do in urban areas? 'Well conceivably
that is the case. That's a supposition on our part, but I think our
customers are saying that they are not getting very sympathetic treatment.
The bank in a city would see it as a sector problem rather than the
difficulty of one individual company.'
The Commission's survey of 6,000 of the 30,000 companies on its register
indicated that those in the north-west and west Midlands were especially
anxious about bank support. In the east Midlands and East Anglia, the
Commission says businesses complained particularly about the Midland Bank
regularly reducing overdraft limits.
Then there is the issue of rustic loneliness. 'Companies are more isolated
from advice institutions which tend to be not as well represented in rural
areas,' Taylor argues. 'There just isn't the sort of range of support
mechanisms that you find in large towns and cities. That includes the banks
and small firms advisory services as well as local employer groupings, the
CBI, chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies.' Some small businesses
might be as much as 50 miles from their bank manager which they retained
when they left a city.
What is also often missing, says Taylor, is peer group support from other
recession-hit businesses. This conjures up a compelling picture of isolated
companies maybe 20 miles away from small colonies of other hard-pressed
entrepreneurs. 'In recession, people actually feel frightened. Loneliness
becomes terror. There just isn't this long-standing tradition of peer group
support.'
Finally, some of the benefits of working in rural areas have turned into
handicaps during the recession. The opportunity of establishing a stable
workforce has always been one of the prime attractions of operating outside
cities.
'That has tended to work against them during the recession,' says Taylor.
'Low labour turnover has forced them into making more and therefore costly
redundancies than they would otherwise have had.'
Rural business premises, attractive because of their generally lower cost,
often prove even more difficult to sell than urban properties when a company
runs into the buffers. Taylor also argues that many small countryside
businesses have really been caught in the neck by the uniform business rate.
This is especially so for many of the more established service ventures such
as shops whose profit margins already tend to be narrow.
Taylor says most of the advantages of running ventures in rural communities,
such as lower property costs, cheaper rents and a more relaxing lifestyle
remain. The drift to the countryside will continue. Moreover, recessionary
pressures are not felt everywhere. In parts of the north, rural businesses
are doing better than their southern counterparts. Nevertheless, the
Commission has felt compelled to issue a checklist of good business practice
in the form of a pamphlet called Surviving the Recession, something it
perhaps should have done earlier. Its 80 advisers around England are also
providing more direct advice through seminars and company visits. The rural
idyll is still alive. But it has endured a bit of a battering.

FT  27 APR 91 / Minding Your Own Business: A hard lesson follows the soft
sell - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CONWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS AN account of an experiment to test after sales service in the
computing world. It is an almost unremitting tale of woe. It is also, alas,
not an especially rare experience in this area from which small business
computer users, who are buying equipment themselves rather than employing
special consultants, can usefully take note to avoid suffering similar
frustration and annoyance.
The saga begins at the end of November last year when, needing some extra
equipment for a computer, I placed an order with a specialist company for
the goods. The add-on duly arrived but proved not be working properly.
This, in itself, was not a terrible event. Electronic goods can become
temperamental when shunted through the postal process and are normally
promptly replaced. Less reasonable, however, was the fact that the gadget
had arrived together with a sheet of paper detailing several facilities
which were featured in the manual but NOT implemented in the model I had
received. In fact I, and presumably every one else who had placed a similar
order, had been sent a pre-production unit for the full price of the
advertised item.
For a computer journalist this was no real problem. A quick call to the
company's public relations company would certainly have produced immediate
apologies and the required product. But, on the basis that this is not a
route open to most users, I decided to proceed more conventionally,
returning the goods and requesting both a fully working model and an
explanation.
An initial telephone query to the company had resulted in the claim that
most customers would not mind (which translates as 'would not notice') the
missing features and anyone who did could always send it back for
replacement. My letter (recorded delivery) pointed out that to expect the
recipients of substandard goods to go to the added expense of having to post
them back in order to get what they had paid for was adding insult to
injury.
It was a detailed and courteous letter from an unsatisfied customer. Over a
month later it had received no reply. A telephone call to the managing
director (still as from an aggrieved customer) established that he was in a
meeting from which he would never emerge and that it was necessary to speak
to an official who expressed shocked surprise that I had not received a
reply to my original letter. Their computer showed, he said, that the reply
was sent out on December 28.
I was impressed, and said so. After all my letter, although dated several
days earlier, had not been posted until December 29 as the recorded delivery
slip confirmed. Asked to read out this prophetic reply, the employee was
somehow unable to bring it to his screen. But at least I was promised that
the replacement peripheral would be sent to me, 'next Friday or Monday.'
Several Fridays and Mondays duly arrived. The goods, however, did not.
Suppressing the temptation to end the experiment, I wrote again to the
invisible managing director requiring, within a week, the return of my
property plus reasonable compensation for the expense incurred through
postage and telephone costs, lost interest on my money over some three
months and the amount of time spent trying to sort out the situation.
Ten days later, silence having continued to prevail, I received another
telephone call, this time from the company's public relations firm. They
knew nothing of the problem, having called to ask me if I was interested in
a new computer program. At this point my resolve weakened and I revealed
all. The result was predictably rapid. The vanished add-on arrived by
courier the next morning. A week later came a deeply apologetic letter from
the managing director together with some software in lieu of compensation.
The names of the guilty parties have been left out of this sorry saga
because it is a small company, producing some admirable products, which fell
victim to a common problem of success in the computing industry. The sheer
volume of that success took the management's eye off the ball  - ie the
service given to customers - while it developed its range. In an industry
this competitive, that can be a fatal error and, in its own interests, the
company's undertakings to correct the situation immediately are almost
certain to be carried out.
But others will continue to make the same mistakes and buyers must beware.
Computer goods must meet the same standards as other consumer products, and
unless you agree in advance to buy a product with some features missing, you
have been short-changed if that is what you get. If the company will not
either refund your money or replace the goods immediately, do not follow my
example and allow correspondence to drag on indefinitely. Report the matter
to the local Trading Standards Office - always a good way of getting a quick
response from an otherwise sluggish business. If the problem is particularly
bad, write and tell me about it for an occasional forum here on the kind of
pitfalls smaller customers encounter in this area.

FT  27 APR 91 / Property: Why it pays to join the new Elizabethans - Why
modern housing is currently a bargain in terms of price and quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSH OUT and buy an Elizabethan property now and you will be well insulated
from draughts, have electricity points galore and also get the nearest thing
to a cost-price building that you will see this side of the end of the
century. You may even meet the builder as he hands over a mortgage discount,
a straight cash saving, or throws in the fixtures and fittings at no extra
cost.
It has to be an Elizabeth the Second property, of course. Homes built during
the reign of the present Queen's ancestral namesake come with built-in
draughts and cost a great deal more to buy and run. New homes, on the other
hand, are now bargains.
'Greenfield' developments in areas without existing housing have become
sufficiently rare to underpin the generality that housebuilders have to
compete against a massive overhang of available but unsold used local
property. Their three main options are to compete on grounds of quality,
ease of purchase or price.
At the start of the housing recession it was the last two competitive
options that attracted the builders' attention. They did not have a lot of
choice with their existing stock other than to promote as innovative a mix
of special offers on price and ease of purchase deals as they could. Those
builders that have stayed in business have had to deal with the switch from
the sellers' market of pre-1988, when pretty well everything that could be
built could be sold, to the subsequent buyer-famine.
In the past 18 months we have seen every inducement to buy, from free cars
in the garage to the 50-50 part paid now, part paid later deals, as well as
every conceivable variation on the theme of 'soft' purchase loan finance.
Render all these sales options down to their basics and they represents
price discounts in different packaging. But it has been packaging with a
purpose, since each offer has been designed to appeal to each builder's
target market.
This price war has tended to overshadow the extent to which new homes have
been sold in competition with older properties in terms of quality. Yet the
quality of a new home does now show through to sale values.
'Newness' justifies a premium value in most consumer markets and you might
well assume that new housing would cost more than old. But in a market in
which old normally means 'first to the best sites' and where age acquires
the benefit of vintage status, there is nothing automatic about this
premium.
There is some truth to the argument that housebuilders have no choice but to
sell their output at a premium to nearby used homes. The builders cannot pay
1960s wages or buy building materials at 1970s prices, and even though
residential development site costs have fallen by as much as 50 per cent
from the peak of the market, inflation does impose its own floor on
builders' pricing policy. But the prime factor in retaining a premium for
new homes has been the building industry's efforts to turn out a
progressively better standard of property.
The housebuilding industry is constantly awarding itself prizes for the best
sites, best homes, best designs, best security systems, best insulation,
best landscaped houses and flats. But it is an incestuous congratulatory
system. As an industry, builders still have a poor public image.
The folk memory of row-upon-row of estate boxes slicing through the
countryside will take generations to overcome. And the low rate of
demolition of old houses - fewer than 20,000 last year - means that the the
cheap and uncheerful mass market housing of the 1960s and 70s is hanging
around much longer than anyone expected to embarrass the builder. Only in
Britain could a national house price index such as the Nationwide's
seriously describe its price category for 'modern' housing in terms of
properties built 'post-1944.'
It is tough to win buyers on grounds of quality against the background of a
predominantly old housing stock where 'modern' means middle-aged and 'new'
means being plastered with 'special offer' signs. Yet the Halifax Building
Society's house price index suggests that despite builders' discounts, new
homes have retained their price premium over old across the UK.
Setting average against average on the Halifax price guide, buyers of new
homes pay Pounds 72,830 for their property while the average existing home
sells for Pounds 62,117. That is a national average premium of 17 per cent,
which is down on but not that far below the average new-to-old premium
maintained throughout the 1980s.
The Nationwide's figures draw on a sample suggesting average new home prices
of Pounds 61,462 against Pounds 54,176 for older homes and Pounds 57,671 as
a national average for all homes, which implies that the current premium for
'newness' is nearer 6 per cent.
If you look closer at the Nationwide's figures they suggest that their
broadly defined 'modern' homes now sell for more than the average new one.
That would accord with the logical assumption that housebuilders must come
top of any list of 'realistic' vendors in today's market.
Add that all up and it makes a persuasive case for buying a new home,
especially in those parts of the UK where building work has been cut back
more than average. In the entire 600 sq mile area of Greater London only
9,080 new homes were started last year, less than half the mid-1980s average
and 17 per cent down on the already sharply reduced totals for 1989.
The point is even more clearly illustrated by the figures for completions.
No more than 12,440 new homes were added to the London housing stock last
year, 25 per cent down on the 1989 total. That shows the housebuilders'
final competitive approach. While price discounts, ease of payment plans and
arguments in favour of new quality over old help to draw buyers to completed
new homes, the ultimate price control is supply. And as that dries up, so
will the bargains.

FT  27 APR 91 / Property: Mr Ridley's rectory - How an MP created a country
idyll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1959 the newly adopted Conservative Party candidate for the Cirencester
and Tewkesbury Division of Gloucestershire recalls being 'bear-led around
the constituency and being introduced to everyone. We were visiting Naunton
and I saw this house; it was empty and I asked who owned it and if it was
for sale.'
The Old Rectory in this Cotswolds village had been empty for four years and
was in dire need of repair. 'The roof was falling in and the garden was
untouched, but I did get to meet the owner and, in the end, he let me buy
it.'
Thirty years on and Right Honourable Nicholas Ridley PC MP, one-time
Treasury Minister, Minister of Transport and former Secretary of State for
the Environment, is planning to move back to the north of England. In the
years taking him from hopeful parliamentary candidate to outspoken national
figure, Ridley and his family have steadily restored The Old Rectory and
transformed its acre of garden.
'The River Windrush runs along one side of the garden. The land is part of
the flood plain of the river so you could dig a channel to let the river in
 -and, hopefully, out - and create running water gardens.' Having never
tackled a garden before the move, 30 years of channel-digging, planting and
pruning have turned the bare acre into a lively, part-formally terraced,
part-wild setting for the house complete with three distinct water gardens.
No self-respecting Grade II Listed Queen Anne rectory could be without a
croquet lawn. In this case - or so the Naunton villagers insist - The Old
Rectory's copper beech and wisteria-framed grass can claim literary status
as the template for the croquet lawn in Alice in Wonderland. 'Other places
do lay claim to being the garden that Lewis Carroll had in mind,' says
Ridley, 'but we do know that Carroll - Cannon Dodgeson - visited the rectory
when the Reverend Litton was here . . . and it is the ideal croquet lawn.'
The materials of the area dictated against any Churchillian brick laying.
But Cotswold stone proved no bar to a resourceful homeowner with a
dilapidated house with all the converted zeal of a born-again gardener. The
stone walled grounds and stone terracing, up to full formal arch standard,
bear witness to Ridley's claim to have acquired the masons' art.
As for the six-bedroom house, that has been a progressive restoration job
carried out as the family could afford the work.
'We did have to do an enormous amount of work and it cost a great deal more
to restore the house than to buy it in the first place. I think that we
finished the last of the outbuildings around six to ten years ago, and the
house as a whole is in good condition now.'
The rectory is too large for the Ridleys these days, and as he is not to
stand for the seat at the next general election he plans to find a smaller
house and a larger garden in the north, possibly in Cumbria.
Patrick Ramsey of sale agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) will be
aiming to agree a reserve asking price for The Old Rectory at a final
planning meeting this weekend. The odds are on a guide price not that far
short of Pounds 1m. 'We really don't know at the moment,' says Ridley, 'but
we are under no pressure to sell. We'll see what happens.'

FT  27 APR 91 / How To Spend It: A respected chair man - A workshop that
concentrates on quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS

<DATELINE>
   YOU won't find any of Neville Neal's chairs in Harrods or Selfridges
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or indeed any other store, large or small, metropolitan or provincial.
The only way to view the chairs, made in the Arts and Crafts tradition to
the designs of Ernest Gimson, is to take a trip to Neal's workshop.
There, on any weekday or Saturday morning, you will find him at work at the
bench used by Gimson up to his death in 1919, creating perfect pieces of
work using exactly the same methods he was taught when he started as a
14-year-old 52 years ago.
The workshop is a downbeat affair, housed in a former shop in the all-brick
village of Stockton in what was formerly the rural industrial belt of south
Warwickshire, where the claylands used to sprout huge brickworks and the
limestone underneath gave rise to the original Rugby Portland cement
quarries.
Inside however, Neville Neal's workshop is full of sweet smelling newly-cut
ash in all the shapes and sizes needed for Neal and his 40-year-old son
Lawrence to assemble into some 20 variants of hand-made Gimson-designed
chairs and stools. On the walls, beside the frames of partly-completed
chairs, hang many of the original tools.
Edward Gardiner, who learned the craft of chairmaking from Gimson in the
village of Sapperton near Cirencester, intended to continue the tradition
when he moved his timber importing business to Warwickshire just before the
First World War.
After a break of six years or so he was persuaded to take up the craft again
in 1920 and he continued making rush seated chairs in the village of Priors
Marston, six miles from Stockton, until his death in 1958. Neville Neal
became apprenticed to Gardiner when he left school in 1938 and took over the
business on Gardiner's death.
Followers of the Arts and Crafts tradition will be familiar with the story
of how Gimson, originally an architect, and his collaborators, the Barnsley
brothers, put their artistic theories, largely derived from Ruskin and
Morris, into practice at Sapperton.
They trained local men to turn out a range of exquisitely made furniture. It
followed the Arts and Crafts ideals of being functional yet good to look at,
but not so good that the owner would be afraid to use it daily, and not
excessively expensive to buy.
Ladderback and spindleback dining chairs made with the Neville Neal stamp
are in a direct line of Arts and Crafts movement work that stretches right
back to William Morris. They are all made in the spirit of Morris's belief
that we should have in our houses nothing that we do not 'know to be useful
or believe to be beautiful.'
There is little chance of automating production in the Neal workshop because
of the painstaking processes of working timber and rush. While Neville Neal
is happy to make batches of up to 50 in the same style he is more at home
with just four or six - or even one-offs, like the three-seater bench he
made for an American artist last year. It was the first he had made (and
might well be the last) and cost the customer Pounds 750.
The Neal chairs come in eight main styles and cost from Pounds 106 to Pounds
122 each. Rockers and carvers cost more, and children's chairs and stools
less. The waiting list is about nine months from the date of order.
Neville Neal also works in oak. Chairs in this wood cost slightly more than
the ash ones, neither are they as good, in his view. 'Oak is more brittle.
If we get a chair back for repair it is more often than not an oak one. Ash
is virtually unbreakable,' he said.
It takes about five hours to make the rush seat of a chair. All the work is
done by the Neals using rushes they have gathered themselves in the summer
months from the banks of the Warwickshire Avon or the nearby river Leam.
The rushes come free. 'No money passes hands between us and the landowner -
just the occasional chair,' Lawrence said.
Lawrence has been working with his father since leaving school in 1966 but,
if his father, now 66, retires he will be happy to carry on the tradition,
making chairs in the same place and in much the same way.
'It's not really possible to mechanise or update the production process very
much, however much money one might have to spend,' Lawrence said. 'Our
chairs are essentially hand-wrought individual items, and of course the
quality has to be absolutely right.'
Lawrence is hopeful that one of his two sons, aged three and 10, will become
the third generation to carry on the tradition.

IF YOU HAVE tried to order custom-made curtains recently you will know that
they command the kind of prices that once attached to family heirlooms.
Apart from the cost of the fabric, curtain-making has come to be regarded as
a contemporary art-form with swags and drapes, buttons and bows all being
invested with a certain esoteric mystique.
If you can't pay such prices, what other options are there? Well, you could
try making them yourself - KLC, 5 Blythe Mews, Blythe Road, London W14 tel:
071-602-8592 remember, runs excellent classes - or you could buy them
second-hand.
Fashionable interior decorators have been buying second-hand curtains for
years - usually from grand houses in the grandest of grand fabrics  - not
because their clients couldn't afford new ones but because they preferred
them old and slightly faded. All the auction houses regularly hold sales of
old textiles but it is a haphazard business hoping for something suitable to
turn up.
A much more regular source of second-hand curtains, some grand, some not so
grand, is The Curtain Exchange, which was started by Liz Meston, Juliana
Galvin and Jackie Horsford. What is available on a given day depends on what
customers have brought in but it could be anything from cheerful gingham to
chintzy Colefax &amp; Fowler. Most looked to be professionally made - some are
curtains that didn't fit in to new colour schemes or didn't fit into a new
house, others were designers or decorators' 'mistakes' and yet more came
from show flats and exhibitions. The prices seemed a fraction of the
newly-made price.
Those who want to sell their own cast-offs can take them along in person or,
if within a reasonable distance, the shops will collect. If The Curtain
Exchange agrees to sell them the client gets 40 per cent of the selling
price once they are sold.
There are three shops: 133, Stephendale Road, London SW6 (Tel:
071-731-8316); 19 Stone Street, Boxford. Nr. Colchester, Essex CO6 5NR.
(Tel: 0787-211065); and Townsend, Poulshot, Nr. Devizes, Wilts. SN1 OSD.
(Tel: 0380-828008).
The Egyptian Hall in London's Mansion House is about to be closed for four
years for a make-over, but on Wednesday May 1 there is a last opportunity to
see it when there is a May Day Fair in aid of the Cancer Relief Macmillan
Fund. The tickets cost Pounds 20 per person which includes a salmon, salad
and wine lunch if you choose the first reception (11 am to 3.30 pm) or
canapes, a whisky tasting and wine if you choose the evening session (5.30
pm to 8.00 pm).
It's also a chance to buy presents (splendid men's shirts, foods, women's
clothing) from a big selection of attractive stalls - anything from a water
colour to a piece of antique jewellery.
The Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund helps care for and support people with
cancer, primarily by funding Macmillan nurses to look after patients either
at home or in special units.
For tickets, ring Henrietta Gordon Lennox on 071-352-3291.

AS THE recession deepens and times get harder the art world gets friendlier
and friendlier. This week another exceptionally user-friendly art gallery -
The Art Collection - opened in London, aiming to tap into that huge market
that has hundreds rather than thousands of pounds to spend.
But whereas most user-friendly galleries sell the work of living
contemporary artists, The Art Collection has spotted a niche for those who
want nice quality decorative art of all periods. As Piers Watson, one of the
founder/directors, put it: 'We want to be the Waterstone's of the art world.
We will stay open until 7.30 three nights a week and hope that people will
drop in on a fairly regular basis to check on what we have.'
He and his partner, Nicholas Hely-Hutchinson, both refugees from the City
who at last have been able to turn to their first loves, pictures, have
started up under a Business Expansion Scheme and firmly believe that there
is a market for the sort of pictures they have to sell.
'Nothing in the gallery will be over Pounds 1,250 and we aim to make sure
that at least two-thirds will be less than Pounds 400. All will be nicely
framed. We are not marketing it as investment art - we aim to sell an
eclectic selection of nice pictures that are good value. We won't be
specialising exclusively in any particular medium or period but hope to have
a complete range from Old Master drawings to Victorian watercolours.
Eventually we will also have a small collection of contemporary work as
well.'
The partners have found it a good time to be buying - 'Though we think the
selection is possibly less large than in boom times, we are finding that in
our price range we can buy things that we wouldn't have been able to afford
a year ago. We are getting better value for our money.'
The gallery is at 3 - 5 Elystan Street, London SW3 3NT and is open from 9.30
am six days a week, closing at 6 pm on Mondays and Fridays, at 1.30 pm on
Saturdays and at 7.30 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

FT  27 APR 91 / How To Spend It: The heavy mob's out to hook more cooks - Le
Creuset makes pots and pans that delight serious chefs and Yuppies alike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT comes to cookware there is hardly a more blue chip name than Le
Creuset. Le Creuset may be heavy to lift, its bright colours not too subtle,
its shapes unchanged for generations, but it comes with that priceless thing
 -an unshakeable image.
For generations of housewives, particularly those whose cooking years were
launched by the evocative prose of Elizabeth David, proper food only came in
Le Creuset dishes. What other cooking pot was so perfect for transforming a
tough piece of beef into a Provencale daube rich with wine and herbs and
'redolent of the deep South'? What other gratin dish so beautifully nurtured
a gratin dauphinoise into that delicious combination of crisp topping and
rich mush, what saute pan so combined functional sturdiness with deep
aesthetic satisfaction?
And what other cookware seemed to put one so instantly in touch with an
authentic traditional cuisine, making one believe that food and culture were
so entwined that only a philistine could neglect it?
You might think that any cookware so strongly linked with such specific
imagery might have trouble surviving in these no-cook workaholic days. You'd
be wrong. Yuppies may not cook but they know a good thing when they see it
and Le Creuset is the nearest the kitchen offers to a designer accessory.
Even those who don't do much more than open a clingfilm-wrapped packet like
to tip it into a comforting traditional dish and when it comes to looking
traditional Le Creuset is in a class of its own. In the world of cast-iron
nobody else can really touch it - The Danish firm of Copco produces a good
small range but it, like its British rival Victor Castwares, lacks that
inestimable advantage of a heritage rooted in French bourgeous cuisine.
As for those who still do cook, the mood seems to be turning again to the
robust bourgeois dishes that nouvelle cuisine so spurned - things like
pot-au-feu, gigot d'agneau farci, country terrines - all of which are, of
course, perfectly partnered by Le Creuset ware. All this is good news for
the company, which last week announced profits up from Pounds 2.67m in 1989
to Pounds 3.1m in 1990.
But for all that, nouvelle cuisine must have given them a bit of a scare for
the company has been looking at ways and means of injecting 'a little
momentum into the product without losing the magic . . . developing new
products which would fit alongside the things we already do well.'
It has not escaped its notice that the 90s are a health-preoccupied decade
with too much fat playing the role of chief villain. Perfectly in tune with
both modern fads and the Le Creuset existing range is the new enamelled
stainless steel steamer which fits the middle ranges of their existing round
casserole dishes - just the thing for producing the crisp, healthy steamed
vegetables that foodies fancy today. In white only, prices range from Pounds
11.45 for one to fit the 3 1/3 pint casserole to Pounds 14.95 to fit the 7
1/2 pint model. More than one steamer can be stacked over the same saucepan
to separate different flavours but cook in the same way at the same time.
The casseroles themselves start at Pounds 20.25.
Less aesthetically pleasing than the traditional cast-iron but as attractive
as such things can be - given the functional parameters - is a collection of
earthenware dishes aimed at the no-cook generation whose chief utensil is
the microwave. There are ramekins and glass-lidded casserole dishes and
plain oval, rectangular and square dishes. Price start at Pounds 2.65 for
the ramekins and go up to Pounds 18.95 for the largest lidded round
casserole.
Finally, for the green generation there are three splendid enamelled steel
non-electric kettles. They can be used on any hob but Aga owners
particularly would love them. Sketched here is Zen, fat-bodied and
welcoming, it comes in the white, red and black of the traditional cast-iron
ware. Most good cookshops, in particular the Elizabeth David Cookshops which
always keeps the complete range, and good department stores sell Le Creuset.
For those who are not entirely familiar with the existing range it is worth
pointing out that the ridged grill pans are the best domestic tool for
producing that highly fashionable foodie item, char-grilled vegetables
California-style. The ridges give the appetising grill scars and seal in the
flavours. Le Creuset offers two - a round 9 in grill and an oblong meat
grill while its company stable-mate, Le Cousances (its history is even older
and stretches back to 1553) has a square grillomat.

FT  27 APR 91 / Gardening: Flowers with undergraduate habits - The great
beauty of fritillary time in Oxfordshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS time to be sowing hardy annuals directly into the garden, to be
planting gladioli and be spending loads of money on the lawn. I had intended
to write on the latest advice from two experts about seed-sowing, to suggest
plants of the easy Agrostemma, sown now as annual pot-plants, and to remind
you about hardy violas. Nature has overtaken my intention.
This week marks one of those sights which does not recur often, like the
exceptional flowers on the magnolias in the sunshine of the last two years.
It is fritillary time in Oxfordshire. It looks as if the flowers will hold
their best until Sunday, if you want to let Mother Nature bowl you over with
the best sight in the country.
Fritillaries have weird flowers of chequered purple which hang like bells or
the diceboxes from which they take their Latin name. They are sombre, subtle
and exquisitely varied. I have always believed that best fritillaries live
in the heart of Oxford in Magdalen College's Addison's Meadow by the river
Cherwell, where the public can visit them between 2.30 and 6.15 in the
afternoon. There have been rival claims from meadows upstream on the river
Thames, protests from Gloucestershire, and mutterings in Wales. From time to
time, a bypass or a builder threatens one of the few old fritillary meadows
somewhere else, and people then protest that it is one of the finest
habitats in England. Perhaps it is, but it is not the greatest. While most
other wildflowers have been uprooted or ploughed into oblivion, Magdalen's
have turned round since 1980 and multiplied. They have now left the
challengers standing.
Admittedly, the setting is special, the central meadow of the walk where
Joseph Addison reflected on landscape gardening in the early 18th century
and began to rebel against the formal style. From these reflections, a new
movement was to begin in English landscape gardening, which led to the
natural style, Capability Brown and our greatest export, the natural English
park. While Addison reflected on the natural beauty of the College's trees,
there must have been fritillaries in the meadow beyond him. He never
mentions them, perhaps because they were still a common sight, perhaps
because he was like me. Twenty years ago, I remember walking hopefully in
Addison's footsteps and being pleased to find two small clumps of
fritillaries in flower by the edge of the raised walk. It never occurred to
me to look sideways through the trees into the meadow where they grew in
thousands.
Perhaps Addison never looked closely: nowadays, he could hardly miss them.
In the 1980s, Magdalen changed the meadow's management. The grass was no
longer turned over to pasture in early summer: it was left to grow
undisturbed until later in the calendar, when it was made available to new
browsers, the College's famous herd of deer from the deer park. At the same
time, the meadow was fenced off, impeding the undergraduates, who had a
tradition of romantic, medieval pastimes in the long grass.
Probably, the fritillaries responded more to the inclusion of the deer than
to the exclusion of their younger visitors. The change of routine has led to
a vivid lesson in ecology. The fritillaries could seed in peace; the deer do
not harm bulbs which have died down; their manure must have helped and
perhaps there is magic in their hoofprints.
As a result, the fritillaries have begun to multiply, not in tens or
twenties but by the 10,000. The further you walk, the thicker they become
behind their protective fence of netting. Perhaps England was once like
this, with a million flowers in the meadows before anyone drained them and
used the plough. This weekend, this old grassland has become a pointilliste
landscape of purple and white, best seen in a gentle breeze. On their
grey-green stems, the fritillaries then swing sociably together, as if they
are engaged in secret conversation. They like the damp, the deer, the peace
of ages, and the grass which has not been disturbed for centuries.
Nature, of course, is a fickle mistress. The fritillaries, which multiply in
this Oxford meadow, refused stubbornly to multiply in my own Oxford patch of
rough grass. Success, too, brings its own complications. It is not so much
that the fritillaries have undergraduate habits and intermingle freely: the
basic Magdalen type is a dark, sombre maroon, but there are whites and
purples, too, and therefore some wonderful half-castes, white with purple
stripes or pale mauve with marbled white backgrounds.
Nurserymen would sell these variations at ever-higher prices. The problem,
rather, is that something has started to eat the flowers. Like a perfect
market, nature corrects her imbalance. The meadow changes its grazing;
fritillaries then multiply; something (the books give no clue) then starts
to eat the feast of fritillaries.
Does anybody know the culprits? They cannot, I think, be famished
undergraduates, reluctant to take out a student loan. They are probably not
the other residents, the pheasants, which look contented in the Oxford sun.
In 1629, the herbalist, John Parkinson, believed that the fritillary had
entered England from France: a fellow-herbalist was supposed to have
introduced it, from the fields round Orleans. Like Addison, he must have
overlooked it on the Thames at home: the flowers were surely old British
natives.
'The chief or only use of it,' Parkinson wisely concluded, 'is to be an
ornament for the Gardens of curious lovers of delight.'
Fritillaries multiply in grass or lightly shaded woodland which is damp or
in an area of heavy rainfall. If they like you, they will run wild and last
for centuries: they are happy with lime, heavy soil, and are even worth a
gamble in a damp, shaded patch of London. If they fail, you know the answer:
put away the lawn-mower and send for venison on the hoof.

FT  27 APR 91 / My wife, life and France: The difference between the French
and the English and their most mysterious ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first two or three years we were married, I thought I knew my wife.
There is nothing for plumbing the mysteries of the soul like negotiating
one's way through married life. Now, a decade later, I realise I may have
plumbed the top quarter. Could it be because I am Anglo-Saxon and she is
French?
At the end of dinner, is dessert followed by cheese or cheese by dessert?
When a man is visiting his wife's family at the weekend, does he, by way of
greeting his father-in-law, simply say hello, or embrace him and kiss both
whiskery cheeks? Just where, if you think you have a temperature, do you
place your thermometer? These are some of the thousand daily questions, the
lighter commerce of a vie-a-deux, that mark Anglo-French alliances.
This is small beer, you say. People who live either side of London's
Marylebone Road have different ways of doing things. So they may. But I know
an Englishman, married into a clan of perfectly modern and charming
Parisians, who swears that English perfidy and the battle of Agincourt are
verbally held against him each time he tries to break with accepted family
tradition.
This is not personal tic, the expression of individual character. Nor is it
family, background, money or class. This is history, a thousand years of
skirmishing, sometimes bitter, sometimes light-hearted, between Gaul and
Anglo. Politics, sex, food, manners, the exchange rate mechanism; no matter
how you cut the gateau, these are two groups of people who see the world
very differently.
Three days after I arrived in France in 1979, for what was supposed to be a
short Christmas holiday, the slim French woman I had met on holiday the year
before took me to her family's Christmas dinner. Held every year at her
uncle's farmhouse in the hills of the Vaucluse in Provence, it is a
traditional affair that reunites every blood relative for 100 miles around,
from Colette, who dabbles in left-wing politics in Marseille, to
Jean-Jacques, who grows tomatoes outside Avignon.
It was a splendid gathering, a tribal celebration at which a family of 25
sat down to a long, cloth-covered table and, for four hours, talked and
feasted on food the likes of which I had never seen before. There were
small, bright red crayfish, salads garnished with truffles sniffed out of
the earth by a neighbour's spaniel, wild boar shot in the nearby hills,
small thrushes neatly trussed in butcher's string, wines from the vineyard
behind the house.
Throughout there was talk - village gossip, the price of artichokes, hunting
stories, wine lore, advice on goat's cheese, reminiscences of other
Christmasses, hard times, the war. And throughout I was speechless, largely
because I had a dozen words of French at easy command, but also because I
was overcome; here was a whole universe of traditions, rituals, habits and
gestures vastly different from my own.
Understanding nothing, I was fascinated.
More than 10 years later, I am still fascinated. My French is better, and I
stayed beyond the Christmas holiday: I am now part of that family. But I am
not sure I understand a great deal more. France remains what it was for me
that day, a heady mixture of tribal traditions, an exotic affair.
Every year, and on both sides of the English channel, there are thick books
published about the French, their national identity and what makes them so
different from the English. Some are affectionate. Others, behind a catty,
chauvinist sort of humour, hide a mistrust of all things French. All,
however, agree that there is a great deal more separating the English and
the French than the channel.
English opinion, both historical and tabloid, has it that the French are
full of themselves. It is one thing to drink their wine but can you, as the
Americans say, do business with them? They are arrogant, duplicitous and
over-conscious of national glory. One moment they are blaming the English
for burning Joan of Arc. The next they are trying to make Jacques Delors
president of an emasculated Europe. Never, runs this conventional wisdom,
turn your back on a Frenchman.
There are entire theories, complete pub-lunch arguments elaborated as to why
the French should be such a problem bunch. I like the popular one that
places the whole long relationship in the Freudian category of problems. It
runs something like this:
Intellectually, aesthetically or in any question of the heart, the French
believe themselves unparalleled. They pride themselves on philosophical
thought and fancy themselves as good car designers, too. With women and la
Patrie, no emotional depth can be too excessive. In matters of taste, style
and panache, they will brook no questions. France may have lost battles and
colonies, but honour is intact and the mission civilatrice proceeds apace.
Paris, as far as the French are aware, is the centre of the universe.
France's perception of itself, the theory runs, is really due to a massive
inferiority complex. If the French are continually crowing their
superiority, if they seek national greatness and dignity in Napoleons and de
Gaulles, it is because they are a people whose roots lie deep in a rural
peasant culture. Even the French, in their insecure heart of hearts, know
this is true: 'What is France, I ask you? A rooster on a dung heap. Take
away the dung and the rooster dies.' If Jean Cocteau could say it, who are
the English to argue?
There is, of course, an additional, unstated argument implicit in this line
of thought: the English have no need for strutting, intellectual posturing,
sexual bravado, rude displays of individualism or any other kinds of
unbecoming behaviour - they just quietly get on with being what they are,
superior.
All this, as far as I am can make out, is intellectual flim-flammery. The
English who compose these complex theories, write these erudite books, form
public opinion, do so from farmhouses in Normandy and flats in Paris, where
they have escaped to enjoy life. They enjoy the frog's-legs and baby quails
that the offending French peasant culture produced; they enjoy French women,
French coffee, French painting, French sophistication, French intellectual
curiosity and freedom. Unbound, away from English tradition, they enjoy
French life. Moan as they may about the nasty French, the English keep
coming back for more.
France is indeed a place of different values, manners, and attitudes. And
there are things that foreigners in France are quite genuinely upset by or
see no need for.
Try living with French bureaucracy - post office, electricity board,
telephone company, or any other state organ; petty officialdom has never
been more obstructive.
Have an impatient Citroen XM scream up to your rear bumper at 160
kms-an-hour on the autoroute, flash its lights, then sit on you until you
move over; this is not just rude, it is lethal.
Write the most ordinary of business letters and you might find that the
concluding 'yours sincerely' salutation - 'Veuillez agreer, cher Monsieur,
l'assurance de mes sentiments distingues' - is almost as long as the text.
French social formalities can make easy chores preposterous.
A hundred things like this make Englishmen fume. I have spent entire
evenings listening to dinner-time diatribes against the French. The raving
goes on, however, as cassolette d'escargots forestiere aux asperges sauvages
rapidly disappears down English throats. Sworn blood enmity for life is one
thing; dinner on the bay overlooking Villefranche is another.
I have given up trying to wholly understand the teller at the Credit
Lyonais, the garagiste down the street, or Jacques Delors. These days, when
one functionary in the town hall tells me I cannot have my work permit until
I have my residence card, and another at the police commisariat tells me I
cannot have my residence card before I am granted my work permit, I merely
sigh.
I give, in fact, a Gallic shrug. I may have to wait until another Christmas
dinner passes before the town hall and the commisariat sort out the problem.
In the meantime there are a hundred other, more agreeable mysteries that
need fathoming.
The first is my wife.

FT  27 APR 91 / Gardening: Time to take out the tubers - Why Arthur Hellyer
has been ferreting about in his loft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU dug up dahlia tubers last autumn and stored them for the winter in a
dry, frost-proof place you should be thinking now about starting them into
growth again.
My own went into the loft, which is well boarded. The loft gets sufficient
warmth from the hot water system to keep out frost but not so much as to
shrivel the tubers and that is ideal.
Most of the tubers will go straight back into the garden where they are to
flower this summer. This is not ideal because it is such a big change of
environment and there are hungry slugs and snails waiting to eat the dahlia
shoots. However, as a rule a good sprinkling of slug pellets in each
planting hole and also on the surface when planting is completed will look
after these enemies, and a covering of at least two inches of mixed soil and
either peat or compost will give adequate protection from the short-duration
frosts that are all we are likely to get now.
Nevertheless, it is safer to start dahlia tubers in soil-filled boxes or
large pots in a greenhouse or shelter of some kind where they can be
watched, watered and protected until early June, by which time they should
be growing strongly and no further danger from frost should remain.
If the old roots are large they can, with advantage, be split into several
pieces provided each piece has one or more tubers and also one or more
pieces of last year's stems, since the new growth buds are around the base
of these.
One of the advantages of starting tubers under cover is that these growth
buds can be kept under observation and, if a lot start to grow, just the
best four or five per plant kept and the rest rubbed out. As these shoots
lengthen they will branch and by the time flowers begin to appear in July
each plant will be sufficiently bushy to make a fine display which will
continue until stopped by frost. Yet these are niceties which can be
dispensed with, for dahlias are among the easiest of plants to grow given
sunshine and plenty of moisture to sustain their ample stems and flowers.
There is no limit to the number of years that dahlias can be grown on in
this way and I can think of no other sub-tropical plant that can be grown
with so little trouble and expense. I must have had some of my dahlia tubers
for at least 20 years and yet they show no signs of decline and I scarcely
have to spray them except, maybe, against greenflies for which there is an
aphicide named Rapid (it contains perimicarb) which has the merit of being
specific to members of the aphis family (greenflies, blackflies, etc) and so
extremely unlikely to affect anything else in the garden.
There are three possible ways of starting with dahlias: with seed, cuttings
or small tubers. Most of the seed that is sold is of bedding varieties bred
for their modest 2 to 2 1/2 ft height and single, semi-double or double
flowers of moderate size. They are so easily and cheaply raised from seed
and their tubers are often so unreliable about surviving the winter in store
that it is usual to re-sew them each spring and discard them at the end of
the flowering season.
Cuttings are now used mainly for the best varieties, those grown by dahlia
specialists many of whom exhibit them at flower shows. A few old tubers are
stored during the winter and are started growing in pots or beds of soil in
a greenhouse in March in a minimum temperature of 16`C (61`F).
The young shoots are then cut off with a sharp knife when 2 to 3 in long,
inserted as cuttings in small flower pots and rooted in a propagating frame
within the greenhouse. When rooted, the cuttings can be potted singly in 3
or 4 in diameter pots and gradually acclimatised for planting outdoors early
in June. Many varieties can be purchased in this way as young plants ready
to go straight into the garden.
This is the way favoured by many dahlia lovers because so many varieties are
available from specialist dahlia nurseries. However, garden centres usually
prefer to sell what are known as pot tubers, which are quite small tubers
grown from late cuttings and then packed dry in polythene bags.
These pot tubers can be sold dry in their bags at any time in the spring
and, according to precise time and convenience, can either be potted singly
in pots and started in a frost-proof greenhouse or on a sunny window-sill or
be planted direct outdoors where they are to flower.
You should wait until May to do this and even then you should put a couple
of inches of soil over them as protection from late frosts.
Dahlia tubers vary greatly in size and shape. Those that are long and thin
are easily broken off. The best for long life are those that are thick and
short-necked and packed into a compact cluster. They then give each other
protection and hang together for years. When deciding which dahlia varieties
to keep at the end of the season I always give this aspect of tuber shape
and character considerable thought.

FT  27 APR 91 / Travel: Where souls go astray - The hill-tribes of
north-west Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK BARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A map of the hill-tribes of south-east Asia looks a bit like the markings on
an exotic butterfly. Even the simplest code needs seven different colours to
differentiate between the major ethnic groups.
The tribes-people themselves view tourists with curiosity but not hostility.
This is not always true of their governments. Most independent travellers in
Laos, Burma, Vietnam and China are assumed to be spreading revolution and
dissent unless they can prove otherwise.
North-west Thailand is the one place where it is possible to visit the
hill-tribes, whether alone or in a group.
THERE WAS no question about it. The felled teak log at the end of an
exhausting uphill forest path had my name on it. I sat down on it and looked
through the thin, dry forest at the path ahead. It snaked around a steep
shoulder, but seemed at last to have finished the long, steady ascent.
Suddenly, bouncing cheerfully up the hill, came a young Lahu man. He was
wearing a broad smile and a stylish billowing black shirt, and was carrying
a bird gun with a long, thin barrel. He sat down, not for a rest but for a
cheerful conversation that in the absence of a common language soon fell
into a companionable silence.
Toiling up the hill in his wake were three women, using headbands to carry
heavy baskets. They unslung their loads and sat on the ground, politely
agreeing that it was no mean slope but showing no signs of weariness. Their
black jackets hung fastened in the customary way, with a single button under
the chin leaving the breasts largely exposed: a style designed to facilitate
breast-feeding.
I let the locals go ahead, somewhat stunned by this sudden rush of activity,
for I was deep in the hills near the Burmese border in the north-west of
Thailand and hadn't expected so many people.
Finally, I came to the village. Teak-framed houses stood in small gardens
fenced off with split-bamboo screens. Pigs, chickens and children played in
the yards and stopped and stared at what I thought was a white face. In fact
it was red. The curious came out on to the path and stared after me,
touching each other and giggling.
Although I was travelling in a group of eight, we had split into straggling
ones and twos by the time we arrived at the village. We were introduced to
the headman by our guide and shown the floor that was to be our bed.
Typically, the house we were staying in was built on stilts and was made
around a teak frame and floored with sheets of bamboo. Widely-spaced steps
gave pig-proof access to a wide veranda with views over the village and to
the mountains beyond.
As they returned from the fields, all the villagers stopped to look us over;
later, many returned for another look. With no television or radio, we were
entertainment. A meal was cooked for us by our guide, who chatted to the
locals and made us feel less like intruders.
Whatever the cultural achievements of the hill-tribes, cooking is not one of
them. Meat only creeps on to the menu as part of a religious ceremony: the
smell of the cooking is sacrificed to the gods and the tribes-people eat the
rest.
Some of the religious beliefs of the hill-tribes seem rather less sensible
and are often inextricably tied up with health care. Although prayer may
seem a reasonable cure for some ailments - stress or depression, for
instance - it cannot be expected to cure everything. But the local
witchdoctors do know of some ailments as yet unknown to western medical
science.
An example of this is soul loss. Workers in the fields suddenly notice a
sudden lassitude and a desire to lie down. Apparently this is not just a
reaction to the back-breaking lifestyle that limits their life expectancy to
the late 40s, but means that their souls have gone astray. Luckily, any
hill-tribe shaman (witchdoctor) has a personal method of tempting souls
back. In a complicated ceremony involving candles, split logs and a lot of
string, the Lahu tribes draw souls back from their holiday to be secured in
the body by small cloth wristlets.
If they are worried by their own spirits getting lost, they are even more
concerned about bad spirits getting into their villages. Apart from the
resident spirit living in what is usually the only cupboard in any
hill-tribe house, ghouls and ghosts are not welcome. Woven bamboo circles
are made as guards and each year exorcisms are held in every house.
The religious convictions vary depending according to the specific tribe,
but this is the least of their differences. Villages in adjacent valleys
often speak different languages, wear different clothes and have different
customs. There are seven main ethnic groups, which can be divided endlessly
by anthropologists.
These cultural differences were built up in southern China. All the
hill-tribes are traditionally nomadic, moving every three to 15 years to
exploit new pastures. Over the last 200 years word spread through China of
vast, untouched forest in the countries of south-east Asia, and gradually
the influx started. The easy-going Thais accepted their new neighbours on a
live-and-let-live basis but now, with growing population pressures, problems
are appearing.
Timber is a central issue. Thailand would either like to profit from its
timber, or conserve it. The hill-tribes are not likely to co-operate with
either of these aims. Partly this is because their religion tells them that
land is communal, but they also have their own plans for trees, which might
involve using them for housing or just burning them to clear the way for
fields.
As a result, calculated attempts at integration are starting. Thai teachers
now run the first local schools and it is this, rather than tourism, that is
starting to change the hill-tribes.
In any case, the interaction between tribesmen and tourists rarely exceeds
the occasional commercial transaction. For a start, the hill-tribes are
often shy. The world of large, hairy creatures with watches, cameras and
synthetic clothing is very foreign in rural north-west Thailand.
The hill-tribe villagers are not so unworldly as to think that their
visitors actually come from another planet. Of course they don't. Everyone
knows that the points of light in the sky are too far away. And too small.
After much discussion, many of them have decided that we come from the moon.
Hill-tribe villages on major roads are usually well accustomed to visitors.
To see how they lived their lives originally, it is necessary to get off the
beaten track, whether on foot, elephant or possibly a small rented
motorcycle.
There are good tours available which can be booked through established
agencies in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Song. As the
commercially-orientated Thais leap on to the tourism bandwagon, more and
more operators are starting up in the smaller towns and villages with each
season.
I saw the hill-tribes through Top Deck Travel, which has persuaded an
Australian expat, John Spies, to run reasonably energetic trekking tours. As
he happens to be one of the top anthropologists in the field, and knows the
land like the back of his hand, these tours are highly recommended. Most of
the other guides are Thai - perfectly satisfactory if their English is good,
though often it is not.
It is possible, but not easy, to travel on your own in this region, but
there is a danger of missing the significance of any ceremony or action.
Women, however, should not travel alone.
Top Deck Travel's 14-day north Thailand trek costs from Pounds 460
(excluding flights), and can be booked through the Adventure Travel Centre
in London, tel: 370-4555.

FT  27 APR 91 / Travel: Happy holidays in the Pigsty - The eclectic
properties on offer through the Landmark Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Pineapple is an elaborate summerhouse of two storeys built in 1761 for
the 29-year-old Earl of Dunmore (later Governor of New York and of
Virginia). Though classical and orthodox at ground level, it grows slowly
into something entirely vegetable; conventional architraves put out shoots
and end up as prickly leaves of stone. It is an eccentric work, but of
undoubted genius . . . every leaf is drained to prevent damage by frost.'
FOR SUCH an exotically quirky description to belong to a Scottish holiday
home (four beds and around Pounds 400 per week, depending on the season),
the Pineapple has to be out of the Landmark Trust handbook.
Sandwiched between The Pigsty ('an exercise in primitive, almost barbaric
classicism'), which is a twin-bedroomed Doric pigsty overlooking Robin
Hood's Bay, and Plas Uchaf, Clwyd (the 15th century ancestral home of the
Hughes of Gwerclas, descendants of Iorwerth, third son of Owain Brogyntyn),
the entry is typically, and lyrically, irresistible.
The Landmark Trust, brainchild of Sir John Smith, was founded to rescue
interesting but dilapidated buildings and let them for holidays. Some are
cottages and houses, some are castles and forts and some, like the
Sandringham Water Supply Tower (which sleeps four), are more functional. All
are unusual, carefully furnished and well equipped with information on local
history and geography.
Sometimes far flung, the properties always have a link, physical or
literary, with Britain. The trust has the lease on the third floor of Piazza
di Spagna in Rome, for example: 'These are not the rooms in which Keats died
on February 23 1821 - those are on the floor below and they are more in a
condition he would recognise.'
To run Lundy Island, which lies 12 miles off the North Devon coast and is
owned by the National Trust, the Landmark purchased a 300-ton supply ship,
MS Oldenburg ('carries 267 passengers in comfortable well appointed salons .
. . ').
I stayed with family and friends for a week in Clonque, a granite fort built
in the 1840s on a clump of rocks 300 yards off the uninhabited south-west
tip of the Channel island of Alderney. Originally designed to keep the
French out of the Channel islands, Fort Clonque was refortified by the Nazis
in 1940 and after years of neglect fell into the hands of the Landmark Trust
in 1966.
Its accommodation, fit for a party of 12 and described as the officers'
quarters, the soldiers' quarters, upper magazine and German bunker, is more
luxuriously furnished than those originally billeted there would have
enjoyed: it even has a piano.
But flickering gaslights, an open fire and heavy seas surging across the
causeway combine to give a romanticised idea of what it must have been like
to man the four batteries. And being cut off from Alderney by the tide twice
a day gives plenty of time for reflection.
It is the sort of setting for contemplation that the dedicated Landmark
'camper' relishes - and usually records at length in the log provided in
each of the properties. These campers tend to be fiercely dedicated to the
original aims of the trust as laid out by Sir John and can be prolific in
committing their thoughts to the log. It will be interesting to read their
reactions to the trust's plans for the future.
Twenty-five years and 200 revived historic buildings since its formation,
the trust now has to come to terms with its own landmark: the retirement of
Sir John Smith and the withdrawal of its principal benefactor, the Manifold
Trust, a grant-making charity created by him. If the Landmark is to continue
its good work it will have to look for new sources of funding which,
according to the trust's Rebecca Morgan, could mean opportunities for
company sponsorship.
There are a lot of good reasons for a company to sponsor the Landmark Trust,
she says - not least, to help 'fight the forces of destruction and make the
conservation of historic buildings a matter of public concern.'
Commercial sponsorship could seem like a sell-out to hard-core campers, but
the trust has an exacting, expensive rescue schedule ahead of it which
includes Naulakha, Rudyard Kipling's chalet home in the US ski resort of
Vermont.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Own up to school fee troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEADS OF some of the top fee-paying schools in the UK this week took a cue
from banks and building societies and urged hard-pressed parents to bring to
their attention any financial difficulties before they became acute.
They said that schools would often be able to help, though boys might
receive more assistance than girls.
The Independent Schools Information Service says that the number of pupils
receiving financial help from schools has doubled since 1982.
'If parents come to schools and explain, there can often be some
accommodation,' said Enid Castle, principal of Cheltenham Ladies College,
'We don't have the sort of endowment that enables us to help as much as some
boys' schools, but we do, from fee income, help where we can. If parents
fall into difficulties we assist.'
Castle said that at present 106 girls receive help in the form of
scholarships, bursaries or grants given by the College. About half of these
are actually on scholarships while the rest are being helped in cases of
financial need. Although she did not have an exact comparative figure,
Castle said her impression was that cases of financial need were about 25
per cent up on last year.
Geoffrey Parker, high master of Manchester Grammar School, said that the
school had a policy of taking suitably qualified boys regardless of ability
to pay the fees. About one quarter of his pupils are receiving assistance.
'Usually we are helping people in difficulty to the tune of about five or
six a year,' he said.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): What are my rights?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE recently received an increase in my company pension. The note
enclosed with this information states: 'The increase will be applied to that
part of the pension you receive from the company group pension and assurance
scheme which is in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension, as the latter
is already inflation-proofed from the state retirement age by the
government.'
I would appreciate it if you could explain to me what this means and how
much is the guaranteed minimum pension.
The term 'guaranteed minimum pension' is used to describe that part of your
company pension which replaces the pension you would have received from the
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme if you had not been contracted out.
This GMP is fully index-linked in line with the Retail Price Index and the
increases get paid by the state in the form of an addition to your state
pension.
This is the reason why your employer only needs to provide cost of living
increases for the balance of your company pension over and above GMP. This
is standard practice where pension increases are awarded.
Each person's GMP will vary according to the amount of state earnings
related pension that he or she would have achieved depending upon earnings,
age and the number of years in which contributions were paid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER starting employment with Bowaters in 1967 and being taken over by the
Meyer group, I had, by the time that I left Meyer International in 1987,
accumulated some 20 years benefits in the group pension scheme.
Although in a letter dated 1987 it was pointed out by Meyer that my various
'options' would be set out, nothing of this sort was ever provided. Not
until I started a top-up scheme with one of the major pension fund managers
was the matter of a transfer considered.
However, both my letters and those sent by the pension fund (the Sun Life of
Canada) meet with a deafening silence from Meyer.
It is now more than a year since I first started to investigate the question
with Meyer International. Can you advise if I have any means of applying
pressure in this affair? Do I start to pester the chairman, perhaps.
If you are unable to get any response from your former employer you can
approach the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS), 11 Belgrave
Road, London, SW1V 1RB. Tel: 071-233-8080.

<TEXT>
THERE IS little evidence of any let-up in the weight of selling by company
directors and purchasers are still few and far between.
Yet more selling in the insurance broking sector included the week's largest
single deal. Both the chairman and the chief executive of Lloyd Thompson
sold tranches of stock during the course of 1990, and chief executive Ken
Carter has just disposed of 35 per cent of his holding, realising more than
Pounds 2.2m. Like most insurance brokers, interim results revealed the
extent to which their business has remained relatively unaffected by
recession.
Shares in engineering group Metalrax remained virtually unchanged after the
sale of 1.2m shares by non-executive director Derek Coombs. The shares have
enjoyed an impressive recovery since the low point in January.
Wace Group, the pre-press services company, has seen two directors sell
580,000 shares between them, of which 100,000 were bought by another main
board director. The company has grown rapidly in a highly-fragmented
industry and directors may be reducing holdings built up after taking up
shares in last summer's rights issue.
Option related sales have been very evident, particularly among the
blue-chip stocks. Directors in Shell, Prudential Corporation, Cadbury
Schweppes and Guinness have all taken this opportunity to take profits on
their share options.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: How much is yours worth?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHAEL HESELTINE has ensured an outbreak of house price neurosis, because
of his linkage of the new Council Tax to seven distinct bands of property
value (details: Page III).
Top-of-the-range homeowners, in band seven, face paying two and a half times
the local tax rate of bottom band home owners. But as the Valuation Office
of the Inland Revenue supervises the price banding of the country's 22m
houses and flats, how many owners will cheer on learning that their home has
been slotted into one of the lower price bands?
Consider the horror for status conscious homeowners if the local valuer
gives them the benefit of the doubt and brands their home as a band five or
six when they have always thought of themselves as one of nature's band
sevens. A ticklish problem of etiquette that is not addressed in the
government's otherwise exhaustive consultation papers is whether socially
sensitive owners can appeal to have their valuation raised into line with
their affectations.
The home sale implications of the change are equally perplexing. Buyers pay
for status as much as accommodation. Now that the government has nailed the
national house price average for all to see, who wants to boast about moving
to a below average property?
Should vendors broadcast their existing price band and have prospective
buyers reach for a calculator and the nearest national house price index to
see what layer of averageness to bid? Alternatively, should they try to
present their home as a band or two above its station and trust that no-one
will ask how much council tax they are expected to pay?
Thanks to the changes which have left local taxes absorbing only a small
part of councils' total spending, this week's proposals are unlikely to have
any wider impact on property values.
Once the existing poll tax arrangements end in 1993, the current extra costs
of owning a second home will be reduced once more.
The council tax charge will be effectively halved by the allowance of two 25
per cent personal discounts. The arrangements for residential investment
properties have yet to be worked out in detail, but the proposal that
multi-occupied rental properties be brought within the scope of non-domestic
rates would bring the local tax charge onto a more realistic business basis.
Since all-student houses will get a 50 per cent discount, the temptation for
students to share accomodation will be all the greater. Otherwise, the only
fundamental question for housing values in the medium and long term is
whether, under the Councul Tax regime, individual boroughs and local
authorities will have the resources to maintain an adequate level of
services.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Financial retailing to be reviewed -
The two main methods of selling finance products are to be scrutinised by
SIB

<TEXT>
IF YOU do not know or understand what polarisation of the retailing of
financial products means, do not worry: few members of the British public
know much about this esoteric subject, even though it can be very important
when you take out an endowment mortgage contract or a personal pensions
plan.
Indeed, so low is public awareness that this week the Securities and
Investments Board, the body which supervises investor protection, decided to
undertake a review of investment retailing, three years after the current
regime was introduced as a result of the implementation of the Financial
Services Act.
High on the agenda will be the future, if any, of polarisation and of the
formulae for disclosures of commissions, early surrender values and other
important information which are imposed by the current retailing rules.
Polarisation is the name given to the division of retailers of financial
products into two camps.
Independent financial advisers (IFAs) must give unbiased advice on all the
competing products in the market place. Salesman or tied agents, on the
other hand, may only represent one company, and need only recommend the most
appropriate product from that company's range.
It is illegal for an IFA to have special links or contracts with individual
product providers. Equally, it is an offence for an Allied Dunbar salesman
to sell a policy from Standard Life or Sun Life even if it is demonstrably
better than anything from his own company's list.
The rigid rule applies right across the market, from one-man firms to mighty
financial institutions. For instance, National Westminster Bank is an IFA in
all its branches, whereas Barclays is tied to its own in-house life company.
Polarisation originally emerged as a concept around 1985 from a life
industry think tank called the Marketing of Investments Board Organising
Committee (Miboc), which was set up to pave the way for the Financial
Services Act.
Miboc attempted to reconcile powerful rivalries between direct marketing
companies with big salesforces, such as Allied Dunbar, and other life
companies, notably the big Scottish mutuals, which sold nearly all of their
policies through IFAs.
Many in the industry wanted to preserve the role of IFAs, which at that time
handled perhaps 60 per cent of the industry's business, but Miboc discovered
a legal problem. Under existing law, IFAs may have been acting illegally by
claiming to act as brokers on behalf of clients but at the same time failing
to disclose extra benefits such as volume-based bonuses and office expenses
paid to them by life companies. No cases had actually come to court, but the
new legislation would have to address the problem.
Polarisation was the solution. IFAs would have to give 'best advice' about
the most attractive products on the market, and could receive no
remuneration except commissions. These would be subject to a maximum
commissions agreement (MCA) to avoid possible bias if some life companies
paid over the top. Meanwhile, employed salesmen or self-employed
representatives could only sell the products of a single company.
The formula seemed neat to the Miboc men but it has been gradually falling
apart ever since. First, the direct-selling life companies went around
offering IFAs much higher commissions if they became tied agents. Many of
them duly switched. Then Sir Gordon Borrie at the Office of Fair Trading
successfully attacked the MCA as being a price-fixing arrangement against
the public interest. The MCA was scrapped and commission rates jumped by 20
or 30 per cent. That gave IFAs more money, but at the same time they were
told to disclose more about their income to clients.
It was the last straw for many of the banks and building societies which one
after another tied to single life offices (NatWest and Bradford and Bingley
Building Society are the only significant remaining exceptions). The Halifax
Building Society, for instance, tied to Standard Life after conducting
research among its customers which indicated that they were happy to rely on
Halifax's own name and reputation and attached little importance to
independent status.
The IFA share of the life and pensions market has therefore slumped, perhaps
to 40 per cent or less, and the specialist self-regulatory organisation
which supervises IFAs, called Fimbra, is in financial difficulties, partly
because of shrinking membership.
What is more, Sir Gordon Borrie is still on the warpath, this time insisting
that clearer disclosure of commissions should be made by IFAs to clients.
IFAs fear that this could put them at still more of a disadvantage compared
with salesmen and tied reps.
The Securities and Investments Board has therefore been forced to conclude
that the present framework is not serving, as originally intended, to
maintain a strong independent sector. It is coy about what it may decide to
do about it, but several possibilities will be on the agenda. They will
include:
A new multi-tied status which would give both small firms and big banks more
flexibility in building ranges of products without claiming to give full
market coverage.
A change in the balance of disclosures to clients so as to reduce or
eliminate the advantages currently enjoyed by salesmen over IFAs.
The improvement of disclosures on costs and investment returns so that
intermediaries, the technical press and consumer organisations can pinpoint
good and bad companies through the compilation of league tables.
This could all lead to a huge upheaval for the life industry and the various
regulatory bodies. According to SIB, a key principle behind the review is
that 'there should continue to be available high quality sources of
independent financial advice.'
And maybe the message is starting to get through to the public. Executives
at the Halifax, for example, say that there has recently been a slight
increase in the proportion of their customers who believe that independent
advice might have advantages.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pension chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST A year ago, the European Court of Justice, in the Barber judgment,
established the principle that company pension schemes have to provide equal
benefits for men and women.
However, it has not resulted in universal equality within all company
pension schemes. There is complete confusion over whether the judgment
brought in immediate equality for all, or whether employees would have to
wait 40 years before achieving full equality.
This week, the Department of Social Security announced that it was giving
financial backing to a test case - the wind-up of the Coloroll Group Pension
Schemes - that could resolve this confusion.
The problem arises because the court stated that the judgment would only
apply to pension entitlements after May 17 1990 - the date of the judgment.
The ambiguity concerns the various interpretations of entitlements.
It could mean that:
Employees would only have equality in respect of benefits earned after the
date of the judgment. Under this interpretation, inequalities would
gradually disappear over the next 40 years - the usual period needed to
acquire the maximum pension of two-thirds of earnings.
Full equality only applies to employees retiring after the date of the
judgment.
All benefit payments received after date of judgment must be on an equality
basis, including spouses' and dependants' pensions, irrespective of when the
pensioner retired.
The judges at the European Court had hardly finished delivering their
judgment before it became apparent that this ambiguity needed to be resolved
quickly.
Unfortunately, the obvious course of returning to the Court and asking the
judges for clarification is not available. Instead, a separate case  -
Coloroll - is needed to clarify the decision.
Coloroll went into administrative receivership on June 7, 1990 - a few weeks
after the Barber judgment. Two independent trustees were appointed with the
task of winding-up the various group schemes. Those trustees need to know
how the Barber judgment will apply in order to ascertain the correct
benefits for the scheme members.
So the trustees are applying to the High Court for directions and it is
almost certain that the High Court will refer the matter to the European
Court of Justice.
However, many employees and pensioners have not waited for clarification
from the European Court. They have initiated complaints of sexual
discrimination through local industrial tribunals and various chairmen are
putting their own interpretations on the Barber judgment.
The DSS talks of being able to get the hearings quickly. But that merely
means a couple of years (early 1993) rather than decades. It took 10 years
to get the Barber judgment - during which time Douglas Barber died.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Savings rates are cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS HAVE started to feel the impact of the last two base rate cuts, with
interest rates falling by around 1 per cent across a range of products.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has cut the rate on its London
Share Account by 0.95 per cent to 12.75 per cent gross (the minimum deposit
is Pounds 2,500). Rates on the Gold Account have fallen by 1 per cent and
range from 11.10 per cent to 5.5 per cent gross. The rate on the Flexi-Tessa
has also been cut by 1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, although the rate on the
Maxi-Tessa is unchanged.
Nationwide Anglia has cut its rates by an average 1.15 per cent gross. Rates
on the various accounts now vary as follows: FlexAccount (3.3 to 11 per
cent); Cashbuilder (9.8 to 12 per cent); Capitalbuilder (11.2 to 12.8 per
cent); Monthly Income (10.8 to 12.5 per cent); and the Prestige Bond (11.9
to 13.3 per cent.
Those wanting to guarantee their income, in the face of falling rates, may
be attracted by the Fixed Interest Deposit Account offered by AIB Bank. This
pays 10.75 per cent gross for five years and the minimum investment is
Pounds 5,000.
Further mortgage rate cuts were also announced this week, with the going
rate settling between 12.75 and 12.95 per cent. However, some borrowers will
have to wait until June 1 to see the benefit of lower rates.
Derbyshire Building Society is cutting its rate for existing borrowers to
12.85 per cent as from June 1. The Mortgage Corporation has reduced the
variable rate for new borrowers on its Purchase Plan mortgage to 12.49 per
cent, from 13.75 per cent. There is a fixed rate option of 11.99 per cent
for between one and five years.
National Westminster Bank is reducing its rate by 0.8 per cent to 12.95 per
cent. The rate will apply to new borrowers from May 1 and to existing
borrowers from June 1. Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society has cut its
rate for existing borrowers to 12.95 per cent, as from May 20. The cut will
also apply to borrowers on the annual review system. Royal Bank of Scotland
has cut its rate to 12.85 per cent, not 12.95 per cent as we reported last
week. United Bank of Kuwait has reduced its rate for existing borrowers by 1
percentage point to 12.75 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE SPOTLIGHT has gone off Retrovir, the anti-AIDS treatment, as far as
followers of Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group which manufactures it,
are concerned. The company is expected to say that profits from the drug
have been broadly flat when it unveils results for the half-year to March on
Thursday. Analysts will be looking for further signs that John Robb, the
recently appointed chairman, is adopting a more commercial approach to
running the company. Interim pre-tax profits should be no more than about
Pounds 5m up on last time's Pounds 164.1m.
The two Scottish clearing banks produce their results next Wednesday. Both
are expected to display the impact of the recession in the form of mounting
bad debts. Bank of Scotland's results will be for the year ending last
February. Analysts are forecasting a decline of as much as a quarter from
the previous year's Pounds 194m before tax. The Royal Bank of Scotland will
be producing interim results for the six months to March, and these will
show a similar fall.
When Evered Bardon, the quarry products group, announces its 1990 results on
Tuesday, it will be the last set of figures for the Evered group before the
merger with Bardon early this year. Even so, historic comparisons will be
difficult because of the rapid rate of acquisition in 1989 and early 1990.
Thanks to the purchases, pre-tax profit is expected to have risen to Pounds
43m to Pounds 44m, compared with Pounds 39m in 1989.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Council Tax is unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW WILL the new Council Tax affect you, if and when it finally rolls into
action? Some patterns can now be discerned through the fog of figures which
surround the tax, which will be introduced in 1993.
The sizeable reduction in bills compared with the poll tax which the
Conservatives are hoping for can be enforced, if the government provides
enough money from central funding. However, this would lead to continued
'gearing', where small differences between council spending and government
estimates lead to big variations in the tax levied.
The most important determinant of the new tax will be the value of your
home. In the words of environment minister Michael Heseltine: 'Properties in
England will each be allocated to one of seven bands. There will be no need
for precise valuations of every house or flat, nor need there be regular
general revaluations.'
These words are vague enough to show that there will be room for haggling in
the two years which remain before the earliest possible date for the
starting point of the tax, April 1993.
As it stands, every property will be assessed so that it can be given a
value relative to the average value of a property in the country as a whole.
This calculation will be done separately for England, Scotland and Wales -
in Wales your house will be banded relative to the average Welsh house
price, and so on.
Then, as with the poll tax, each council will set a level of charge for each
household. The proportion you have to pay will depend on the band your
property falls in. Only one bill will be sent to each house.
The following bands, based on the Department of the Environment's average
property value in England of Pounds 80,000 and a council tax of exactly
Pounds 400 per household, should carry a health warning in the light of the
government's miscalculations on the introduction of the poll tax. The
average figure was set by the DoE to be Pounds 278, and turned out, even
after 21 councils had been capped, to be Pounds 357.
Do not make definite plans on these figures, but at present the bands of
property values will be as follows:
Up to 50 per cent of average (Pounds 40,000): 67 per cent of council tax
(Pounds 267)
50-65 per cent (Pounds 52,000): 78 per cent of council tax (Pounds 311)
65-85 per cent (Pounds 68,000): 89 per cent of council tax (Pounds 356)
85-110 per cent (Pounds 88,000): full council tax paid (Pounds 400)
110-150 per cent (Pounds 120,000): 122 per cent paid (Pounds 490)
150-200 per cent: (Pounds 160,000)144 per cent of tax paid (Pounds 579)
More than 200 per cent: 167 per cent of tax paid (Pounds 668).
As the figures are set relative to averages for the whole country, not just
the local area, many districts in the south east will see most people paying
more than the standard council tax.
There is a personal element. These charges are made on the assumption of two
adults living in the dwelling. If you are the only adult in the property,
you will only pay 75 per cent of the council tax.
The rules on second homes are similar to those for the poll tax. You will
have to pay the flat council tax on any holiday home, but with a 50 per cent
discount. However, David Hunt, the Welsh Secretary, has asked for further
consultation and it is possible that holiday homes in Wales will not receive
the full 50 per cent discount.
Those on the lowest incomes will not have to pay anything. If there is only
one person above the income support line in a household, they will be taxed
as a single person. For students, the current plan is that a household of
full-time students (including student nurses, apprentices and YTS trainees)
would pay 50 per cent. If a student is the only or second adult in a
property, they will receive a 25 per cent discount.
It looks good if you share with several others in a northern inner city. If
you live on your own in a south east suburb, it is not such good news.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why Hercule Poirot is, of course,
right - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'POIROT,' I said, lowering my copy of the financial pages, 'I've been
thinking of investing in shares. The stock market is close to its all time
high at the moment and a fellow at my club gave me a few tips.'
The great Belgian detective, who was busy arranging his change in order of
coin size, looked up in irritation. 'Hastings,' he said, 'You are not using
your little grey cells. Why do you want to buy shares when their price is
high? Would you wait to buy one of your vintage cars until it is dear?
Shares, like anything else, should be bought when they are cheap.'
I had to put him right. Poirot thinks he is the authority on every subject
but this was an area where I felt that, because of my friends in the City, I
had the advantage. 'But my broker is very enthusiastic about the economic
recovery in 1992 . . .'
'Of course he is, Hastings. The markets have anticipated the recovery
already. All the good news is in the price.'
'So, I suppose you have all the answers,' I said, in an attempt at sarcasm.
My friend, vain as ever, ignored me.
'Do you not remember, mon ami, that most of my great cases have involved
nursery rhymes? Hickory Dickory Dock, One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, A Pocketful
of Rye . . .'
'That was Miss Marple,' I rashly pointed out.
'Nom d'un nom d'un nom,' cried Poirot, 'Do not mention that woman. She is
played by the remarkable Joan Hickson and who do I get? Someone with a
surname like raw fish.'
'It's Suchet, not sushi,' I pointed out.
'Do not interrupt me, Hastings. I was saying that there is a lot of
significance in nursery rhymes. In the stock market, the best known rhyme is
'Sell in May, and go away. Come back on St Leger day.' You should consider
it carefully.'
'Sounds like mumbo-jumbo to me,' I said.
'But listen to this, Hastings,' he replied. 'I asked Miss Lemon, our
efficient secretary, to run through the Datastream machine, the return on
the All-Share Index between May 1 and September 14 . . .'
'The date of this year's St Leger,' I said, having recently read the
Sporting Life.
'Exactly, Hastings. She produced the returns for every year back to 1965. In
20 of those 26 periods, the May-September period produced lower returns than
did the remainder of the year. Over the whole period, if you had invested in
the All-Share on May 1 and sold on September 14, you would have made a
capital return, on average, of just 0.6 per cent a year. Investing on
September 15 and selling on April 30 would have made you an average annual
capital gain of 11.8 per cent.'
'But why on earth should this be?' I asked.
Poirot took a reflective sip of his creme de menthe. 'I believe it relates
to your English love of le sport. Summer comes and you attend Ascot, Henley,
Wimbledon . . .'
'Lord's,' I added.
'I leave the details to you, Hastings. In any case, the men who buy the
shares are away from their offices, studying the silly points and the
backward short legs. The market drifts and prices fall. So you see,
Hastings, you should not be so eager to invest. Like so many private
investors, you jump in when prices rise. If they fall, you will be
disillusioned and sell at the bottom, losing much of your money. Your broker
is, as you say, leading you up the garden walk.'
I was too confused to correct his simile. 'So you are not keen on shares at
all?'
'You misrepresent me, mon ami,' said the detective, wandering over to the
mirror to check that his moustache was neat and tidy. 'Even I, Hercule
Poirot, cannot know for certain how shares will move in future. I was just
correcting your unscientific reasoning.'
He paused to straighten the angle of some papers on his desk. 'I have been a
very successful stock market investor over the years, Hastings. How else do
you think that I, who left the Belgian police force during the First World
War, have lived in such style for so long? It was not by investing in
vegetable marrow futures.'
'In 1945, I used the Pounds 1,000 fee from the Duke of Eboracum affair to
buy shares in the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. Had I reinvested the
income, they would now be worth over half a million pounds. As it is, the
dividends allow me to enjoy my few luxuries. Had I put the same amount into
one of the building societies of which you English are so fond, the same
amount, even with the income reinvested, would be worth only around Pounds
9,000.'
Poirot pointed an accusing finger at me, as he had at so many murderers in
the past. 'You must be patient, Hastings. Do not rush in to the stock market
on a whim. It is a long term business. Even if you had just matched the BZW
Equity Index over the last 46 years, your Pounds 1,000 would have turned
into Pounds 127,000.'
'Enough,' I cried, 'I submit. I will wait a while before buying shares, and
then I will take a long-term view.' I put down the financial pages and
picked up another paper. 'Now there must be some other sensible way for me
to invest. I wonder what's running in the 3.30 at Newmarket?'
The next moment, a pair of Poirot's moustache curlers flew narrowly past my
head.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: ICI's private army still keeps the
faith - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries is one company that retains a loyal army of
private shareholders in an age of institutional investment.
The 350,000 ICI shareholders - 40 per cent of whom own fewer than 250 shares
 -have seen a steady decline in the value of their holdings, relative to the
London market, since the shares hit Pounds 16 in 1987.
Yet there is no shortage of private individuals wanting to buy ICI stock.
Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman, told the annual general meeting yesterday
that the company had already received 30,000 inquiries about its corporate
Personal Equity Plan, announced in February.
The company in which they are planning to invest is still the largest
manufacturing group based in the UK, judged by turnover.
Sir John Harvey-Jones and then Sir Denys have led ICI through an enormous
restructuring exercise over the last decade - halving the UK workforce,
expanding rapidly overseas (particularly in the US) and shifting the balance
away from cyclical commodity chemicals.
But the combined strategy of 'globalisation' and concentration on more
specialised, higher added-value products has not had the desired effect of
insulating ICI from the impact of a recession. The 1990 pre-tax profits,
announced two months ago, were down 36 per cent at Pounds 977m, and the
result for the first three months of 1991, reported on Thursday, was a 52
per cent fall to Pounds 198m.
Stockbrokers' analysts had talked themselves into forecasting an even worse
outcome for the first quarter, so ICI shares managed to rise by 3p on
Thursday. But the chairman had little cheerful news about current trading at
yesterday's AGM: 'We are still in the grip of recession in many markets',
Sir Denys said. 'We do not yet see signs of the significant improvement in
demand which is essential for a sustained recovery.'
So analysts were reluctant to upgrade their profits forecasts for the whole
year. The consensus figure is still around Pounds 800m pre-tax for 1991.
The market believes that ICI's 55p dividend - giving the shares a 6.9 per
cent yield - will be safe unless there is a wholly unforeseen collapse in
trading. The company is extremely reluctant to risk repeating the damage its
reputation in the City suffered when it cut the dividend in the last
recession 10 years ago. And ICI's balance sheet is much stronger today than
it was in 1981.
Looking further ahead, most analysts see ICI profits recovering from the end
of this year, as the world economy picks up. BZW, for example, is going for
Pounds 1bn in 1992 and Pounds 1.2bn in 1993 (with Pounds 1.5bn as a 'best
case' outcome). But it is worth remembering, when looking at such forecasts,
that this time last year some people were expecting ICI to make Pounds 1.6bn
in 1991, rather than Pounds 800m.
Breaking ICI down into different business activities, it is clear that
pharmaceuticals prevented the group's performance last year from being a
complete disgrace. Drawing on the strength of the recession-proof medicines
market - and making the most of some innovative drugs of its own,
particularly for cancer and heart disease - ICI Pharmaceuticals contributed
47 per cent of the whole company's profits on just 11 per cent of its
turnover.
Although ICI has promising new drugs in the research and development
pipeline, the pharmaceuticals business is unlikely to grow as fast and as
profitably in the 1990s as it did in the 1980s. As a global player in the
pharmaceuticals industry, ICI may not be large enough on its own to compete
in the long run with giants such as SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo of the UK
or Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US. The company may therefore be
forced to form an alliance - possibly involving a merger - with another
pharmaceutical company; Upjohn of the US has been mentioned as a possible
partner.
Indeed, it is difficult to see any source of long-term growth that could
propel ICI into the 21st century as a larger and more profitable company in
relation to the world economy than it is today - though the board is, to its
credit, steadily increasing spending on research and development.
ICI Seeds is one business which the company is fond of quoting as a possible
multi-billion pound enterprise for the next century. This will use
biotechnology to create and sell new crops to the the world's farmers - for
example drought-resistant cereals with in-built pesticide genes to protect
themselves against attack by insects.
But even if ICI Seeds lives up to its highest hopes, it will not be able to
compensate for the continued decline in the group's industrial chemical
businesses. The outlook for plastics and petrochemicals, which still
represent 18 per cent of ICI turnover, is especially bleak, with worldwide
overcapacity in petrochemical facilities likely to persist for many years.

<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland is introducing an annual charge of Pounds 10 on its Classic
Visa and Mastercard credit cards. The charge will appear on statements
issued after July 5. The bank is softening the blow by reducing the interest
rate from 2.2 to 1.9 per cent a month, or 28.4 per cent a year. It is also
adding purchase protection insurance and two telephone helplines for home
and car owners.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Low-cost pensions firm suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors interested in the low cost fee-based pensions service, Discount
Pensions, offered by independent advisers Campbell Financial Services will
be perturbed to hear than the company was this week suspended from doing
investment business by Fimbra. The reason for the suspension is technical;
the company failed to demonstrate that it had the required financial
resources for its category.
The company sprung into prominence when it offered a cheap Pounds 199
service to arrange pensions using a Freephone number, at the expense of
in-depth advice and on-going service. But this novel move brought a sharp
reaction from other advisers, with the police being brought in to deal with
abusive telephone calls to the company.
A statement last night from chairman David Cramer stated that the companies
had been in discussion with Fimbra over its accounts. These were now being
recast to meet Fimbra's requirements. He expected the suspension to be
lifted shortly, but meanwhile the Freephone service has been suspended.
Since the company is not authorised to handle client's money, investors
should have made out any cheques to the life company and so there is no
concern over lost money.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gilts issue in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was strong demand for the five year gilts which the Bank of England
auctioned this week, much to the surprise of many gilt-edged market-makers.
In its first auction for nearly three years the Bank of England sold Pounds
1.2bn of 10 per cent Conversion stock due 1996. The stock is already
available in the market, but the Bank of England was keen to improve the
liquidity of the five-year stock.
The gilts market had not expected the auction to be such a success, given
general concern about possible oversupply. Many economists forecast that the
government will have a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of some Pounds
12bn this year and predict that the Bank of England will have to issue about
Pounds 1bn of new stock each month.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Retail sales show sharp monthly rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales raced upwards in March, according to government figures. This
might have been the first sign of the end of the recession, but many
analysts thought that it just showed that people were buying early to avoid
the rise in VAT at the end of the month.
Last month total sales volume rose by 3.7 per cent, according to provisional
estimates. This is the biggest monthly rise since June 1979  - the last time
VAT was increased - when sales increased by 6.9 per cent.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Ratners reaps rewards of honesty -
London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TOTAL CRAP' was how Gerald Ratner described his jewellery chain's products
in a speech on Tuesday. His address captured the next day's headlines.
Indeed, he achieved what may well be a unique feat: getting the conference
of the Institute of Directors on to the front page of the Sun newspaper.
Ratners' shares rose 10 per cent on the week, a striking testimony to the
power of truth in advertising. The rise - from 170p a week ago to 187p at
yesterday's close - was all the more marked because it came against a gently
falling market. (The FT-SE 100 index, which had closed the previous Friday
at 2520.1, ended yesterday at 2471.3.)
Perhaps we might expect to see other captains of industry offering similar
exaggerated honesty? Sir Allen Shepherd could come clean about the taste of
Burger King hamburgers, Rupert Murdoch about the contents of his newspapers,
and so on.
Alas, no such outburst of corporate self-deprecation seems likely - not
least because Ratners' shares moved despite, rather than because of, Gerald
Ratner's comments.
Since their peak in the summer of 1987, Ratners' shares had lost 70 per cent
of their value by January 1991, as doubts grew about the company's
aggressive expansion by acquisition, capped by the purchase last year of Kay
Jewelers, a big US rival.
More recently, the market has decided that Ratners has survived the retail
crunch in the UK and the US. After this week's excitement - which included
some lacklustre annual results - its shares have risen 64 per cent since the
middle of January, outperforming the sector by four fifths. They are still
half their 1987 value, however.
There is likely to be more excitement to come. UK retailing analysts are off
on Tuesday to see Ratners' US operations. Their views on whether Ratner can
achieve the same dominance in the US as in the UK will have a more marked
influence on the share price than any number of jokes from the chairman.
For investors with a wider horizon, the week's highlight came in the foreign
exchange market, where there was a further rapid strengthening in the
dollar's value against sterling. Since the middle of March the FT-SE index
has lost about 1 per cent, but the dollar has risen 10 1/2 per cent against
sterling. For the past month at any rate, a bundle of crumpled greenbacks
have outperformed the most carefully chosen portfolio of blue chips.
Insecure fund managers could take solace from the thought that the pound's
devaluation against the dollar would ease the strains of its inability to
devalue much against the D-Mark inside the ERM.
Such reassuring economic reflections were otherwise in short supply. ICI,
with heavy exposure both to the dollar and the D-Mark, produced results on
Thursday that reinforced the market's growing sense that the expected
recovery has not yet arrived.
The figures themselves were better than expected - a 52 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits on a 12 per cent drop in turnover - but the company said
there might still be some way to go before the bottom of the recession was
seen in two of its most cyclically sensitive businesses, petrochemicals and
plastics. ICI shares closed the week at 1060p, down 41p from the previous
Friday.
There was a brief flurry of economic enthusiasm on Tuesday, after Norman
Lamont, the Chancellor, held out hopes for a rapid fall in inflation (in a
speech to the Institute of Directors that was not reported on the front page
of the Sun). The FT-SE index briefly rose back above 2,500 on the news,
since optimists felt that this might prove a harbinger of lower interest
rates. But the enthusiasm did not last; all the signs continued to point, as
they have done for some weeks, towards a plateau in interest rates for the
moment.
The market's pessimism on this point was unmoved by US president George
Bush's heartfelt plea for lower world interest rates, made on television on
Thursday. It was also unaffected by the prospect that, at a series of G7,
IMF and World Bank meetings starting this weekend, the people responsible
for setting world interest rates would all be together in the same room,
thus available to be struck by a simultaneous craving for monetary easing.
Such cases of mass hysteria are not unknown, of course. Take the crazed
enthusiasm for making and accepting rights issues displayed by otherwise
entirely sober finance directors and investors. So far this year, there have
been Pounds 3.1bn worth of rights issues. In April alone, rights issues have
totalled just over Pounds 1bn, gobbling up cash at the rate of Pounds 50m a
day.
They seemed - until the last few days, at any rate - to have little effect
on the market. As the chart shows, the biggest rights issues of February and
March left the companies concerned performing nicely against their sectors
in the weeks that followed.
Still, there were signs this week that, for fund managers anyway, the game
is less amusing. Taylor Woodrow's Pounds 162m rights issue on Tuesday caused
a wave of froideur. Institutional investors murmured that if the company had
really needed the money, it would have made the announcement six weeks
before, at the time of its results.
The company's shares did not reflect this view, ending the week at 246p,
only 8p down. Later in the week, though, rights issues from Y J Lovell and
Alfred MacAlpine got rather worse receptions.
Finance directors, with the giddy insouciance typical of their breed, still
seemed determined to go on with the party. At this point in a
four-year-old's birthday celebration the wise parent starts putting the
glassware away for safety and moving the chair with the wobbly leg behind
the sofa. Since the stock market has many of the characteristics of such
occasions - including an exasperating credulity about magic tricks performed
with flags of all nations - wise investors might soon be following suit.

FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Everything in the garden is not so
rosy - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House was forced to issue a denial this week that President George
Bush had suffered a heart attack. A spokesman quickly allayed the fears of
financial markets by describing the scene in front of him: Bush enjoying a
stroll around the White House rose garden.
Anyone looking for similar comforting words on the health of the stock
market would have been disappointed. The first full week since the Dow broke
the 3,000 barrier proved anything but an enjoyable stroll around a rose
garden.
Under the weight of a wave of computerised sell programs and investor
profit-taking, the Dow, Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite
posted significant losses during the first four days of trading.
By midday yesterday, there was little sign of a recovery, with the leading
indices all marginally lower. Volume also declined sharply this week, down
20 per cent from the previous week's average to around 166m shares a day.
Confirmation of Wall Street's depressed mood could be seen in the market's
'breadth' - the difference between the number of shares that rise and fall
during each day. Declining stocks outnumbered rising stocks by the
substantial margin of three-to-one on Monday, and two-to-one on Thursday.
Yesterday, the margin was running at almost two-to-one by noon. The sense of
disappointment among dealers and investors was tangible all week -
disappointment at the failure of the Dow to hold above 3,000, but above all
at the Federal Reserve's refusal to cut interest rates.
Although the impressive rally in share prices since mid-January was fuelled
by a myriad of factors - the success in the Gulf war, hopes of an economic
turnaround, large infusions of individual and institutional liquidity - the
steady decline of US interest rates was always the most powerful force. The
perception that interest rates are now stuck at their present levels (6 per
cent for the fed funds and discount rates, 9 per cent for bank prime rates)
has struck the biggest blow to investor confidence. The Fed has gone out of
its way to signal its resolve to keep rates steady, regularly intervening in
the credit markets to push the fed funds rate back up to its 6 per cent
target.
If this message was not clear enough, comments from Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, hammered it home.
Greenspan was asked why the discount rate is higher now than it was in 1986,
a year when the economy was not in recession, and therefore not in need of
stimulation from low interest rates. His answer - inflation is much more of
a threat to the economy now than it was in 1986 - left the markets in doubt
as to where the Fed's priorities lie. The market could not even draw comfort
from economic news this week.
Figures released on Tuesday showed that factory orders for durable goods
during March fell by 6.2 per cent, a decline in excess of analysts'
forecasts. The next day the nation's car manufacturers unveiled
disappointing mid-April sales totals, again in defiance of expectations.
Then yesterday the latest quarterly gross national product figures provided
official confirmation of the existence of the recession.
Real GNP fell 2.8 per cent in the first three months of 1991, making it the
second consecutive quarter of negative growth and thus, by the only
measurement accepted by the US government, evidence of a full-blown
recession.
The GNP numbers were bad enough but not unexpected. What was worrying - and
it spells more bad news for stock prices - was the big jump in the GNP
implicit price deflator, a widely used alternative measure of inflation
which tracks domestically generated price rises. The deflator was 5.5 per
cent in the quarter, well up on the 2.8 per cent reported in the last
quarter of 1990. The only bright news of the week came from a smattering of
good quarterly figures. There was yet more cheer from Wall Street securities
houses, with Salomon and Morgan Stanley proudly displaying handsome
increases in first quarter income.
The nation's big oil producers also shone. The benefits of Occidental's
restructuring following the death of Armand Hammer, the former chairman,
began to show, with first quarter profit up 30 per cent. Mobil reported a 78
per cent rise in earnings to Dollars 710m, while Exxon announced a 75 per
cent improvement in profits to a whopping Dollars 2.2bn.
RJR Nabisco appears to have turned the corner at last, reporting its first
quarterly profit since it was taken over in a Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout
in early 1989. Admittedly, after-tax income was a meagre Dollars 5m on sales
of almost Dollars 3.5bn, but in the current climate the stock market has to
be thankful for such small mercies.

FT  27 APR 91 / Turning over the recovery tea-leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW FOR the tough part. Unemployment is soaring, there is only a very slow
and patchy deceleration in factory gate price rises and in pay settlements,
and industrial delegations are beginning to arrive in Whitehall pleading for
special treatment, if not yet quite threatening a bare knuckle fight.
Fortunately, companies are presenting a slightly more robust face to the
stock market. It looks as though the declared fall in industrial profits for
1990 will be no more than about 4 per cent, according to UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, albeit including a 10 per cent drop in the second half-year.
Meantime, dividends declared this year appear to be showing overall growth
of about 5 per cent, rather than the zero which some of the pessimists were
predicting back in the depths of the past winter. It suggests that listed
companies in general are reasonably happy about their prospects for
recovery.
Nevertheless as the economy heads towards its trough the political stakes
are being raised. Only now, nearly three years after Nigel Lawson began to
push up interest rates, to cope with a temporary 'blip' of rising prices, is
the government beginning to realise just how hard a task it will be to stuff
the inflationary genie back into its bottle. If it isn't hurting it isn't
working, somebody once said.
Industrialists like Robert Horton, chairman of BP, are starting to hit back
at the government's failure to control inflation. The government, for its
part, might argue that employers could do more to put their own house in
order, and that a 12 per cent rate of increase in unit labour costs output
might justify a more robust stance on pay, in the boardroom's executive
compensation committee as well as on the factory floor.
Still, it has long been common ground between employers and trade unions in
the UK that it is more appropriate in hard times to cut jobs rather than
pay. In these terms, you could rather cynically point to a record rate of
increase in unemployment, at over 100,000 a month, as a demonstration of the
improved responsiveness of modern British management.
But from the stock market's point of view there is an uncomfortable paradox:
this year's rises in share prices have been celebrating the expected
reduction in inflation and the imminent economic recovery, but on the
evidence of the reported figures the corporate squeeze may not have been
severe enough to have the desired effect. If it doesn't work, there may have
to be even more pain.
However, there are different ways of looking at the degree of resilience of
profits. Something like two-fifths of the profits of British listed
companies are earned by overseas subsidiaries, and although the weakness of
the dollar was a problem in 1990 its strength in 1991 (plus 15 per cent
against sterling so far) looks like coming to the rescue. As for the
domestic picture, the official statistics show a drop of about 2 per cent in
company trading profits last year.
The decline has been more dramatic in terms of the share of national income:
by the final quarter of 1990 profits represented only 11 per cent of GDP,
down from a 1988 peak of 15.4 per cent.
That is either an indication of how companies are being squeezed, or a hint
of the recovery potential. If, as a shareholder, you are confident that your
company is going to survive, and is unlikely to dilute your investment
excessively by jumping too enthusiastically on to the current rights issue
bandwagon, then you are not going to be particularly interested in how far
its profits may fall this year.
It is the potential a year or two out that is far more important. That is
why earnings downgradings by analysts, which caused so much panic last year,
have ceased to be of great concern in 1991.
ICI's first quarter profits, published on Thursday, may have been halved
compared with the same period last year, but they were sharply higher than
in the fourth quarter, and the share price went up. Somewhere down the road
company profits generally are going to rise substantially. But it could take
a while.
In 1982 profits only rallied modestly as the economy began to recover from
the deep recession of 1980 and 1981, and it was only in 1983 and 1984 that
substantial earnings gains were seen.
On that basis we may be a good two years away from a really healthy profits
upturn. And it is rather more anticipated in advance today, when the market
p/e is 13, than it was in 1981 when the p/e was more like 10 (and the
dividend yield was a percentage point or so higher, too).
It is going to be a nervous summer, as the politicians and industrialists
sift through the statistical tea-leaves looking for the recovery which the
Treasury's computer has promised us.
This week it began to look as though the upturn may begin in the wrong
places. Retail sales jumped in March, and the housing market flickered to
life as well, so that building society lending jumped sharply for the month,
while bank lending to the corporate sector was dead as a dodo.
Maybe we should not be too concerned about a transient VAT-beating flurry in
the shops, but any more persistent consumer-led economic recovery could put
serious pressure on the balance of payments, which is running at an annual
rate of Pounds 5 1/2 bn even in the depths of the recession. It was very
different in 1981, when there was a balance of payments surplus and sterling
was embarrassingly firm.
This time, if consumer demand were to be the main engine of the recovery
rather than the Treasury's projected 4 3/4 per cent rise in export volumes
over the next year, the government would find it impossible to continue its
delicate balancing act of edging down interest rates while maintaining
sterling in a healthy position in the European Monetary System.
Still, it all gives scope for interesting conversations when those
industrial delegations come round for tea.

FT  27 APR 91 / Japan faces trade sanctions by US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday announced trade sanctions against Japan for
its failure to open its domestic construction market to foreign contractors,
architects and engineers.
A spokesman for Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said the
administration would limit Japanese involvement in all areas of US
government-funded construction projects.
However, the sanctions will not come into effect for 30 days, during which
time the Japanese will have the opportunity to come to the bargaining table
with an acceptable proposal.
Japanese companies have been earning an average of about Dollars 2.4bn a
year (Pounds 1.42bn) for projects in the US market.
US companies have won only Dollars 200m in contracts in the Japanese market
since 1988, according to Senator Frank Murkowski, the leading Congressional
proponent of action in the construction dispute.
In 1989, Mrs Hills announced an official finding of unfair Japanese trade
practices in the public construction market. But she delayed sanctions on
the grounds that there had been some progress.
Last year, Senator Murkowski succeeded in getting Congress to require Mrs
Hills to impose sanctions if the Japanese market continued to be closed.
However, Mrs Hills yesterday was prepared to order even wider retaliation
than that ordered by Congress.
The US has sought to expand the 1988 Major Projects Agreement, under which
Japan promised to improve US company access to 14 big construction projects,
worth Dollars 18bn.
This year, US negotiators asked for access to all big construction projects
before backing down and agreeing to a finite, but extended list.

FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Water shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even after yesterday's bounce, the package of water shares has had a
miserable run of late. Since early February, it has underperformed the
market by 18 per cent. Ahead of next week's local elections, the
institutions have been increasingly preoccupied with political risks for the
sector. July's break-up of the package for trading purposes has persuaded
some investors to move into their preferred individual water company shares.
But the downward pressure may have gone too far. The package is on a
prospective yield of well over 6 per cent. At Thursday's low, shares in
South-West Water were yielding almost 9 per cent. That looks more than ample
compensation for a long-term political threat from a Labour party which
regards the curbing of other privatised companies as a higher priority. As
for the technical threat from the break-up of the package, there has been
less divergence between the companies than one might expect. The water
companies' robust profitability and dividend growth should be familiar
enough to investors by now. They are still not fully reflected in the price.

FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Rights issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharpness of the market reaction to rights issues from Alfred McAlpine
yesterday and YJ Lovell the day before suggests that investors are finally
tiring of cash calls from the construction sector. This is scarcely
surprising, given that a third of the Pounds 3bn raised in rights issues in
the year to date has come in construction and property. This, in turn,
raises the question of what is to be done with the money. Much depends on
how far one believes in the standard tale of imminent recovery and
consequent opportunities, as opposed to the suspicion that companies are
simply repairing their balance sheets while the going is good. If the
former, the price of building land and property is about to be bid up by
institutional cash at one remove. If the latter, the banks will get their
money back and will doubtless think twice about advancing fresh loans to
those sectors for some time.
One good argument for the latter theory is the illogicality of companies
using shareholders' cash to buy land and property if they genuinely believe
the upturn is at hand. The time to rely on equity is at the peak of the
cycle, when financial flexibility is going to be needed in the downturn. It
is precisely at the trough that companies should be gearing up again on
shareholders' behalf. But the question is one of a difference in timing. It
is in the nature of the equity market to rise well ahead of recovery. If
companies grab the cash accordingly, it need not follow that they agree with
the market's prognosis.
Carrying this argument to its conclusion might suggest a temporary
difficulty for the market as a whole. In itself, there is nothing wrong with
the market running ahead of the game. The difficulty is rather to do with
institutional cash flow. The obvious way to replace the cash drawn out of
institutional coffers by rights issues is for companies to make cash bids.
If investors are confident enough to advance the cash, companies are not yet
confident enough to spend it on takeovers. Rumours of the big bid from such
as BTR have been around for some time. It is getting to the point where the
market needs cash on the table.

FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Guinness Mahon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness Mahon must be grateful that the Bank of Yokohama's pockets are as
deep as its corporate strategy appears opaque. Otherwise, Guinness Mahon
would presumably be put up for sale or simply wound down. Its pre-rights net
assets of Pounds 44m could not support a future in banking. Adding Pounds
49m of rights proceeds by way of a Pounds 30m bridging loan will prolong the
agony. Nevertheless, it will be something of a one-off if Guinness Mahon
emerges in a few years as a successful merchant bank. The need for so much
new capital only emphasises the extent of the Bank of Yokohama's gamble when
it bought the bank in 1989. It is standing by its subsidiary on the grounds
that having gone this far, it is worth keeping a toehold provided that
losses and management are better controlled. How it will feel a year from
now is another matter.
As part of the rescue, Guinness Mahon will curtail its lending activity in
favour of corporate finance and fee income from asset management and
securities trading. This raises the question of why it needs much capital at
all. The latter activities contributed Pounds 2.2m profit in the last full
year and made up only a small part of this week's Pounds 35m interim losses.
Given the volatility of securities trading income in particular, any return
to dividend payment is likely to be a distant event. The bank has few
minority shareholders. As the Bank of Yokohama doubtless foresees, they have
little incentive to take up their rights.

FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: An uneasy calm in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,471.3 (-10.8)
In a faint but detectable way, the London equity market is showing symptoms
of disquiet. The FT-SE is a mere 3 per cent off its record of three weeks
ago and turnover is only modestly below its recent minimum of Pounds 1bn a
day. But there are at least three things on the market's mind: political
risk, the draining effect of rights issues and the worry that the recession
may be proving longer and deeper than is in the price.
It may be significant that Nomura, one of the most inveterate bulls of the
London market, is more sanguine than most on the economy and still draws a
bearish conclusion: consumer confidence will recover sharply, the balance of
payments will collapse and interest rates will be jacked up again to protect
the pound. That apart, there is no denying that the market is showing
ominous signs of churning. In the early part of the year, the recovery
sectors such as contracting and construction handsomely outperformed
defensive sectors like brewers and food retailers. In the past month, that
has gone into reverse.
There is also a dangerous complacency which says that whether or not the
market goes higher, it is not about to fall. But with interest rates still
at 12 per cent, the onus is on the fund manager to prove that equities will
do better than cash. A serious setback in equities remains hard to foresee.
It could still be a good time for hedging bets.

FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Michelin soars 8.9% on
favourable forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BOURSES ended the week on an easier note, as trading slowed ahead of
the May Day holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw frantic buying of Michelin, the tyre manufacturer, following a
favourable recommendation from a leading domestic broker. Trading in the
shares was temporarily suspended to restore order. Otherwise the market was
soft, as the CAC 40 index fell 2.34 to 1,774.67, down 0.9 per cent on the
week, in modest turnover of FFr1.5bn.
Michelin soared FFr7.50 or 8.9 per cent to FFr91.60 with an exceptional 1.6m
shares traded after Cheuvreux de Virieu, the stockbroking arm of Banque
Indosuez, issued bullish forecasts about the company. The tyremaker is
expected to keep its investment level at FFr3bn for several years and does
not plan any rights issue in the near future. Michelin also has plans for an
'ecological' tyre.
However, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez continued to fall after its disappointing
1990 results this week. The shares fell FFr22 or 3.7 per cent to FFr568 with
174,460 shares exchanged, the day's second most active issue.
Alcatel fell FFr3 to FFr573 in spite of news of a Singaporean order worth
SDollars 433m (Dollars 244m). Total, the oil company, fell back FFr14 to
FFr745 after its rise earlier in the week. L'Oreal, also stronger earlier in
the week, fell FFr8 to FFr550. Paribas lost FFr1.50 to FFr437. After the
market closed, its Belgian holding company Cobepa said it is to sell its
entire stake in Paribas for BFr4.3bn or FFr515 per share.
FRANKFURT congratulated itself as it closed the week as Europe's best
performing market. It needed only modest gains to achieve this, with the FAZ
index 1.2 per cent better over five days, and the DAX up by 1.5 per cent;
but on Monday, with the DAX down 1.7 per cent after the CDU's weekend
election losses, it was not expecting this conclusion.
Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, said yesterday that more
and more foreign brokers, particularly those in the UK, had become more
positive on Germany. In addition, he observed, the D-Mark had recovered
against the dollar after a slump on Monday and Tuesday.
Volume eased from DM7.8bn to DM6.8bn. After a period of sector rotation,
yesterday's gains were more individual. In banks, Dresdner rose DM6 to DM370
after a major buy recommendation from Morgan Stanley, which also increased
its weighting for the market in general this week.
In carmakers, BMW dropped by DM10 to DM568 as Volkswagen rose DM4.90 to
DM376. Capel favour Volkswagen as a mass producer for export markets; BMW is
seeing profit-taking after a notable rally. Elsewhere, Viag rose DM5.30 to
DM366.80 in contrast with other shares in the energy sector; there was a
suspicion that, with a rights issue in the pipeline, the shares might be
getting friendly support.
MILAN returned from its Liberation holiday in a glum mood. Forced selling
ahead of the April 30 settlement day and Olivetti's decision to omit an
ordinary dividend, announced after the close on Wednesday, weighed on share
values. The Comit index fell 6.28 or 1.1 per cent to 582.94, down 3.3 per
cent on the week, in thin volume.
Olivetti fell as low as L3,630 before closing officially at L3,705, down L64
or 1.7 per cent.
Similar dividend concerns depressed Fiat, which fell L106 or 2 per cent to
L5,245. Generali, the insurer which rose sharply the previous week,
continued its decline, closing L340 lower at L37,160.
Companies linked to the Mondadori publishing group bucked the weak trend on
hopes that the battle for control of Mondadori will be resolved soon.
L'Espresso, the magazine, added L600 to L19,600 and Cartiere di Ascoli, the
holding company, rose L255 to L4,055.
ZURICH ended with the Credit Suisse index down 3.1 on the day and 1.1 per
cent week at 551.1. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, recovered from
dividend cut and rights issue rumours after news of improved first quarter
results, the shares closing SFr40 higher at SFr2,070.
OSLO closed higher, and a cut in the Central Bank's overnight lending rate
after the close could boost prices on Monday. The all-share index rose 1.35
to 476.36 in turnover of NKr217m. Norsk Hydro, strong on Thursday after its
first quarter results, fell back NKr5 to NKr185.
MADRID was led lower by the construction sector. The general index ended
down 2.39 at 276.83, down 2 per cent on the week, in thin volume of Pta12bn.
ISTANBUL hit a three-month low, the market index closing 96.5 or 2.3 per
cent lower on the day, and 7.9 per cent down on the week at 4,037.85, on
pessimism about the economic outlook.

FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains ground on
bargain-hunting

Tokyo
SHARE prices rose for the first time in three days as bargain-hunting by
foreign investors and trust funds helped recoup morning losses, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 84.82 at 26,123.68, down 1.6 per cent on the
week, after a high of 26,256.04 and a low of 25,994.28. Buying by investment
trusts brought the index back above 26,000. Volume fell to 300m shares ahead
of the Golden Week holiday next week. The market will be closed on Monday.
Losers led gainers by 508 to 444 with 186 unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section issues rose 5.40 to 1,957.96 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell by 1.22 to 1,478.16.
Bargain-hunting by US pension funds pushed up big board issues. Nippon Steel
gained Y9 to Y473 and Hitachi added Y10 to Y1,200. Asahi Chemical, which
gained ground on Thursday on reports of a merger with Toyo Jozo, the liquor
and foods company, fell Y62 to Y788 on profit-taking. Toyo Jozo lost Y10 to
Y1,090.
Index-linked buying by arbitrageurs buoyed up foods and financials.
Ajinomoto rose Y40 to Y1,560 and Fuji Bank added Y70 to Y2,680.
Investors took profits on electricals which had recently been sought on
hopes of a recovery in the US economy. Sony fell Y150 to Y6,200 and Pioneer
Electronic lost Y70 to Y4,860.
Aoki, the construction company, gained Y18 to Y788 on individual interest.
Other contractors were also firm on short-term interest. NT&amp;T, the benchmark
of market sentiment, lost Y11,000 to Y941,000, falling below Y950,000 for
the first time since January.
The second section fell 24.95 to 3,312.43, but the OTC market gained 29.43
to 3,139.72, as investors focused on newly-listed issues. Horai, a dairy
producer, gained Y1,000 to Y6,000 and Tescon, a electronic parts maker,
added Y1,000 to Y8,000.
Speculative issues fell further on news that a speculator had gone bankrupt.
Nihon Nohyaku, the most active issue of the day, fell Y150 to Y2,100. The
issue had been popular recently on rumours of speculative interest.
Japan Steel Works gained Y25 to Y700 on individual buying. Traders said that
rumours that the company is raising funds through equity financing also
helped the issue.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 250.77 to 28,752.21 on volume of 22.1m
shares.
Roundup
A NUMBER of markets brightened up in the Pacific Basin yesterday, with
foreign buying, technical considerations and domestic financial economics
advanced as reasons for the main winners, in Hong Kong, Australia and Seoul.
HONG KONG saw turnover rise from HKDollars 1.17bn to HGKDollars 1.47bn as
the Hang Seng index closed 31.42 higher at 3,625.80, 1.1 per cent lower on
the week. Property shares posted sharp gains, traders attributing the upturn
partly to bargain-hunting, especially by foreign funds.
AUSTRALIA rose 1.3 per cent with industrials in the van. Overseas buying was
noted as the All Ordinaries index added 19.3 to 1,537.8, 1.1 per cent up on
the week.
Turnover was boosted by the exercise of April options, virtually trebling
from ADollars 241m to ADollars 712m.
SEOUL recovered after two days of decline, the composite index adding 7.93
to close at 634.29, 0.9 per cent higher on the week. There were hopes of
improved local liquidity, following corporate payments of Won1.4 trillion in
value added tax.
TAIWAN ended mixed on the day and usefully better on the week, the weighted
index closing 27.33 points and 3.5 per cent higher respectively at 5,941.15.
SINGAPORE had a similar tale to tell, the Straits Times Industrial index
closing 4.47 higher on the day, and 1.9 per cent better on the week at
1,558.41.
NEW ZEALAND firmed in moderate trading Friday, with foreign buying again
moving the market following the decline in domestic interest rates. The
Barclays index closed 9.75 or 0.7 per cent higher on the day, and 1.1 per
cent better on the week at 1,482.96. BANGKOK extended its losses, the SET
index falling 11.09 to 872.51, down 3.9 per cent on the week.

FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam forges ahead on the stronger
dollar - The bourse's recent rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR in April, Amsterdam has more than lived up to its reputation as one
of the most dollar-sensitive stock markets in the world. As the dollar has
gone from strength to strength, Dutch shares have forged ahead. The bourse
has not only hit several new highs for the year and risen nearly 20 per cent
since January 1; it also stands just 5 per cent below all-time highs reached
in the summer of 1989.
Despite these gains, most analysts are cautious about the outlook for the
market over the next few months. The dollar is the only clearly positive
factor propelling the Dutch market higher. For all the benefits derived from
the upward march of the US currency, the Amsterdam bourse - and the Dutch
economy generally - are crucially dependent on events closer to home in
neighbouring Germany, the Netherlands' biggest trading partner.
The increasing challenge of achieving German unification threatens to keep
Dutch interest rates high and may push them up even further, leading to an
almost inevitable correction in Dutch share prices. At the same time, the
Dutch government faces difficulties in meeting its own targets for reducing
the country's financing deficit, raising the prospect of political tension
within the ruling centre-left coalition.
'We continue to think that the recent market advance is discounting too much
good news,' Credit Suisse First Boston Nederland say in a recent report.
'Compared with the prevailing interest rates, shares look expensive.'
The dollar's decisive influence on Amsterdam is a reflection of the strong
international orientation of the bigger Dutch companies, many of which have
long outgrown their domestic market. Thanks to the rise of the dollar,
companies with significant turnover in the US or in the dollar zone will be
able to translate their foreign sales into a greater number of guilders.
For example, Aegon, the insurer, generates 35 per cent of its revenue in
North America, while Ahold, the supermarket group, rings up as much as half
of its turnover along the US east coast. Both these companies' shares
touched 12-month highs in April, as have defensive food and beverage stocks
such as Wessanen, Bols and Heineken and the chemical stocks Akzo and DSM.
Royal Dutch Petroleum and Unilever, which together account for half of
Amsterdam's market capitalisation, also stand to benefit from a firmer
dollar, and their share prices have climbed accordingly, briefly setting new
12-month highs this month before falling back slightly.
Overall, the CBS General Index, which reached a year's high of 201.5 on
Thursday, has risen 19.9 per cent in 1991. The index slipped 1.9 to 199.6
yesterday. Since mid-March alone, the gain has been 6.3 per cent. The
dollar's rise has proved equally remarkable, recovering from a post World
War Two low of Fl 1.64 in mid-February to Fl 1.98 this week. The general
index broke through 200 in mid-April, the first time it has done so since
July 1990 and putting it close to the August 1989 high of 210.5.
However, analysts caution that macro-economic conditions in the Netherlands
have altered greatly since the height of the 1989 boom, making the Amsterdam
bourse more vulnerable to a downward correction. Mr Fokko Tuin, an analyst
at Kempen &amp; Co in Amsterdam, notes that long-term interest rates are now 2
points higher than they were in the summer of 1989, Dutch economic growth
has slowed significantly and wage levels are rising, putting additional
pressure on corporate profits.
'From a historical point of view, share prices in Amsterdam are certainly
not cheap, although they are still not expensive compared with abroad,' he
says. He adds that because part of the recent rise was motivated by
expectations of lower interest rates in the second half of 1991, share
prices could fall later in the year if the forecast decline in interest
rates does not emerge.
Ms Nora Coers, an account manager at stockbrokers Theodoor Gilissen, says
there seems to be little room for further major rises, adding that a
correction, if it comes, could send the market 4 to 5 per cent lower.
Another cause for concern is the fact that many Dutch companies - currently
presenting their 1990 annual results and reports - are reluctant to make
profit predictions for 1991 because of the uncertainties ahead.
With only the firm dollar to sustain it in the short-term, Amsterdam's
recent rally can be explained in part,also, by two long-term factors which
provide underlying support to Dutch share prices, according to Mr Tuin.
Dutch institutional investors who, traditionally, have held only small share
portfolios compared with their Anglo-Saxon counterparts are gradually
expanding their share purchases.
Because they do not have the same currency considerations as foreign
institutions, Dutch pension funds and insurers tend to buy and hold on to
their share investments. Their perspective is more long-term than foreign
buyers, helping to explain the demand for shares of more cyclical companies
such as Hoogovens and DAF. Both companies expect a difficult 1991 before
seeing an improvement later in 1992.
Another factor lending support is the prospect of a gradual removal of the
anti-takeover defences erected by Dutch companies to ward off hostile
bidders. These defences, which are frequently blamed for low Dutch
price/earning ratios compared with other markets, are likely to be curbed in
future by new European Community regulations.

FT  27 APR 91 / Commodities (Week In The Markets): Tin could be poised for
bull run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN has been the outstanding performer in the base metals sector this week
and could now be poised at the start of a bull run, according to some
analysts.
Cash tin on the London Metal Exchange rose by Dollars 227.50 to Dollars
5,915 a tonne on Thursday after jumping Dollars 137.50 on Wednesday.
Yesterday the price retreated to Dollars 5,825 a tonne, leaving it Dollars
300 ahead on the week.
The main reason for the price rise is that more tin is being consumed than
is being produced, even though overall demand is not strong, according to
Stephen Briggs, analyst with Metals and Minerals Research Services. A clear
deficit is beginning to show in producers' stock figures, and LME stocks are
going down.
LME warehouse stocks on Thursday fell by 385 tonnes to 16,430 tonnes after
dropping by 415 tonnes on Monday. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett,
points out that, of the six base metals traded on the LME, only tin has
stocks lower now than at the end of last year.
'The stock overhang which has overshadowed the price is at last being
eroded,' he said this week, pointing out that many tin mines around the
globe - including mines in Brazil, Australia, the UK, Malaysia and Indonesia
 -have been forced to close by low prices.
Ord Minnett is expecting a general improvement in prices this year, but
points out that, whereas demand growth has its own momentum, supply cuts
'are transitory and cannot be relied upon.'
Mr Briggs is also cautious. While the market could be on the brink of a bull
run, 'it is unlikely to go mad when sentiment towards base metals as a whole
is so unfavourable,' he said.
However, the Economist Intelligence Unit this week forecast that the tin
price will rise by 50 per cent in the next 12 months - and it is less
optimistic than the Association of Tin Producing Countries. The EIU admits
there is 'high probability' that its forecasts could be wrong because 'at
some stage it will no longer be appropriate for consumers to keep stocks at
a bare minimum.
'No-one wants to anticipate that moment, but equally no-one wants to be left
out once it arrives. When prices do rise they will rise very sharply,' says
the EIU.
It is predicting an average price of Dollars 3.80 a lb in April-June next
year, compared with Dollars 2.53 in the first quarter of this year. It
forecasts primary tin production will fall by 12 per cent this year to
159,000 tonnes, with consumption sliding 2.7 per cent to 175,000 tonnes.
In the zinc market the backwardation, or premium for cash metal, collapsed
on Thursday, prompting widespread liquidation of positions and triggering
sell stops. The premium hit Dollars 240 a tonne on Tuesday last week,
narrowed to Dollars 32 last Friday then turned into a discount of Dollars 1.
Yesterday cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,148.30 a tonne, Dollars 53 down on
the week and at a discount of Dollars 8.50 to three-month metal.
Traders said that they had expected the backwardation to narrow once an
investment fund prominent in the market recently had manoeuvred out of its
short position. But they were taken by surprise by the suddenness of the
collapse.
The lead market moved into backwardation on Tuesday in the face of tight
supplies for May delivery. On Wednesday the cash premium was Pounds 6.50 a
tonne, but Thursday saw the tightness begin to ease. Yesterday cash lead
closed at Pounds 343.50 a tonne, up Pounds 5 on the week and at a discount
of Pounds 6 to three month metal.
A nervous shudder went through the bullion market on Thursday following gold
sales from the same Middle East source which upset prices last year. The
National Commercial Bank of Jeddah sold gold on behalf of clients in Saudi
Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East just before the morning price fixing
session in London. After a 50-minute 'fix' the gold price fell to Dollars
353 a troy ounce - the lowest level for nine months.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, said that if the
sales had come from the same source as last year, the longer term
implications are serious for the market. 'It will have an impact on
investors who will be less willing to get back into the market. It might
also influence producers who now might not be so willing to let the gold
price rise before selling forward.'
Gold closed in London yesterday at Dollars 353.85 a troy ounce, down Dollars
2.60 on the week.

FT  27 APR 91 / Money Markets: Bank lends at 12%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS little evidence of downward pressure on London interest rates
yesterday. Lack of economic data kept trading quiet, but the Bank of England
decided to underline the present rate structure by lending funds to the
money market at the bank base rate level of 12 per cent.
Three-month sterling interbank was quoted at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent,
compared with 11 13/16 -11 3/4 on Thursday, while 12-month money was
unchanged at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range on Liffe, with June delivery
remaining above technical support at 88.57. The contract opened unchanged at
88.64 and touched a low of 88.60 before closing at 88.62.
Apart from lending to the market, the authorities also deterred thoughts of
lower interest rates by not providing enough assistance to take out the full
underlying credit shortage. This left the short end of the money market
tight, even though speculation about an early cut in base rates has tended
to fade on a weakening of sterling in the ERM and recent disappointing
economic news.
The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of
Pounds 1,650m, but revised this to Pounds 1,550m at noon and to Pounds
1,750m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,406m was provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 454m bills, including Pounds 123m outright, by way of Pounds 54m bank
bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 69m bank bills in band 2 at 11
13/16 per cent. Another Pounds 331m bills were purchased for resale to the
market on May 13 at 11 29/32 -11 15/16 per cent.
Before lunch a further Pounds 362m bills were bought outright, via Pounds
198m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 164m bank bills in
band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon the Bank of England did not buy any more bills, but invited
the discount houses to use their borrowing facilities. A total of Pounds
590m was lent to the houses for seven days at 12 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,631m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 510m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds
485m to liquidity and bank balances above target of Pounds 5m.
At the weekly Treasury bill tender the average rate of discount on 91-day
bills fell to 11.1700 from 11.1806 per cent.

FT  27 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar firmer ahead of G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR finished towards the top of the day's range in Europe yesterday,
boosted by hopes of a US economic revival and by a higher than expected
inflationary indicator. This could deter the Federal Reserve from easing its
monetary stance.
Trading was subdued ahead of this weekend's meeting of finance ministers
from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Washington. Dealers
believe that the G7 will have difficulty agreeing on interest rate policy,
at a time when the US is pushing for lower rates, to stimulate world growth,
while Germany is struggling to solve economic problems caused by unification
and to support a weak D-Mark.
Nevertheless the market was cautious in case the meeting arrives at new
measures to stem any further advance by the dollar.
Hopes of an economic revival in the US improved after Mr Michael Darby, US
commerce undersecretary, said the recession is expected to reach a trough
and give way to a recovery during the present quarter.
It was announced yesterday that first quarter gross national product fell by
2.8 per cent, compared with 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.
This was a slightly sharper fall than expected, but more importance was
placed on news that the implicit price deflator, an indication of US
inflation, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent in the first quarter,
against 2.8 per cent in last year's fourth quarter.
This may keep the Fed cautious about cutting interest rates, according to
dealers, but the figure was largely caused by higher oil prices ahead of the
Gulf war, and this situation has now been reversed. Consumer prices fell in
March for the first time in five years.
At the London close the dollar had advanced to DM1.7545 from DM1.7470; to
Y138.15 from Y138.00; to SFr1.4785 from SFr1.4655; and to FFr5.9200 from
FFr5.8900. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index rose to 66.8 from
66.7.
Sterling maintained a soft tone, easing from third to fourth strongest in
the European exchange rate mechanism, but dealers said Thursday's talk of a

They indicated that the pound will remain vulnerable to selling in the

Sterling fell 80 points to Dollars 1.6860. It also declined to DM2.9575 from

<TEXT>
MARINE Midland Banks, the troubled New York-based subsidiary of the Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank, has reported a first-quarter net loss of USDollars 72.3m,
compared with a profit of USDollars 6m in the same three months last year.
The result, which follows losses of Dollars 164.3m and Dollars 111.5m in the
previous two quarters, was described as 'very disappointing' by Mr Geoffrey
A. Thompson, president and chief executive. Additional domestic commercial
loans had been classified as non-accruing, and there was a Dollars 109.4m
provision for losses on such loans.
The results mark a bad start to the year for the Hongkong Bank, which has
been hit hard by losses at overseas subsidiaries in the UK, Australia, and
the US. Last month it announced a 35 per cent fall in after-tax profits, to
HKDollars 3.1bn (USDollars 398m) for 1990.
Marine Midland expects further losses in the second and third quarters.
These are expected to continue until the US economy, especially in the
north-east, picks up. The bank's main problem is domestic loans, which are
now failing in general commercial businesses as well as in real estate.
The bank has been undergoing radical restructuring. Mr Thompson said
yesterday that operating expenses, excluding restructuring and
credit-related items, were 17.5 per cent lower than in the first quarter of
1990.
Capital ratios remained 'well above' levels required under 1992 risk-based
capital guidelines. The Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31 was 5.75 per cent,
compared with 4.18 per cent a year earlier and 5.84 per cent at the end of
1990. Non-third world loan loss reserves were built to USDollars 590.4m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr CARLO De Benedetti and Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the two warring Italian
businessmen, were last night on the brink of an agreement to divide
Mondadori, the country's leading media group with a turnover in 1990 of
L2,400bn (Dollars 1.9bn).
Barring last-minute hitches, the settlement will end one of Italy's
longest-running corporate battles, and one which has also had far-reaching
political overtones given the importance of Mondadori's media interests.
It gives Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding company, control of La Repubblica,
Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, and L'Espresso, the country's second
biggest weekly news magazine.
The De Benedetti faction is also expected to gain Mondadori's chain of
regional newspapers, as well as majority ownership of Cartiere Ascoli, a big
Mondadori-owned paper maker.
For his part, Mr Berlusconi will receive Mondadori's traditional publishing
interests, including most of its magazine activities, such as Panorama,
Italy's most popular news magazine.
The two men will take joint ownership of Manzoni, Mondadori's advertising
and media-buying subsidiary. As part of the agreement, Mr Berlusconi's
Fininvest company will receive a payment of around L170bn from Mr De
Benedetti.
The agreement is broadly along the lines of the division of the company
discussed, but never finalised, in abortive talks between the two sides last
summer.
The deal ends months of uncertainty during which Mr De Benedetti lost,
regained, and then once again lost control of the group, amid court
decisions and boardroom shifts which analysts believed were heavily
influenced by political considerations.
However, as the pendulum swung first one way and then the other, it became
increasingly clear that the ultimate loser was Mondadori itself. Although
once one of Italy's most profitable publishing and media groups, the company
barely broke even last year.

sell-off

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation was believed to be close last night to
selling its main group of US magazines in a deal worth around Dollars 650m.
The likely purchaser is K-111, the publishing company controlled by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, the investment banking company and one of the most active
takeover players in the US.
Both sides insisted last night that no deal had been signed and that
negotiations could last into next week.
The magazines involved are expected to include titles such as Racing Form,
Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera Weekly, New Woman, New York, Seventeen and
Automobile, but not TV Guide or Mirabella.
If the deal is completed it will be the first big Murdoch disposal since the
restructuring of most of News Corp's Dollars 7.6bn debt earlier this year.
Shares in News Corp rose to an eight-month high of ADollars 9.86 in Sydney
on the strength of a New York Times report that a deal had already been
agreed.
By next February News Corp must repay USDollars 800m to the banks, Dollars
600m to redeem a bridging loan, and Dollars 400m in three six-monthly
instalments after that. When the refinancing agreement runs out in February
1994, Dollars 6bn falls due.
The magazines have been up for sale for several months. Reed International,
the British publishing group, expressed interest in some of the magazines
but withdrew when Mr Murdoch said he was only interested in selling the
package.
K-111 is run by Mr William Reilly, former president of Macmillan. He was
credited with turning the US publisher, now owned by Maxwell Communication
Corporation, into a Dollars 1bn-a-year company.
The plan apparently is to run the Murdoch magazines as a stand-alone
consumer group, separate from its trade magazines but under the K-111
umbrella.
The deal bring KKR back into the headlines. At the beginning of the week
KKR's joint bid with Fleet/Norstar to acquire the assets of the failed Bank
of New England received official approval. There have also been rumours that
Murdoch magazines in the UK will also be sold as part of the current
disposal programme to reduce debt.
Mr Murdoch has also suggested that a big disposal in Australia is also
imminent. The most likely candidate is News Corp's printing interests.

loan reserves

<TEXT>
AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, the largest investor-owned insurance company in the
US, added a further Dollars 52m to reserves for bad real estate loans and
investments in the first quarter of 1991.
As a result, net realised losses for the quarter totalled Dollars 16m, with
the Dollars 52m provision being partially offset by Dollars 36m of realised
capital gains.
This compared with net realised gains of Dollars 20m in the first quarter of
1990, and contributed to a sharp fall in Aetna's first-quarter profits, from
Dollars 180m to Dollars 137m after tax.
Aetna added Dollars 224m to reserves in the fourth quarter of 1990. It said
this brought loan reserves to 'an appropriate level'.
About one third of Aetna's real estate properties are in the troubled
north-east and mid-Atlantic states. At the end of 1990 total real estate
write-downs and reserves for mortgage loans amounted to Dollars 550m.
Aetna said its health and life division fared well in the March quarter,
with earnings of Dollars 70.7m against Dollars 60.8m. The contribution from
commercial property-casualty business dropped from Dollars 57.4m to Dollars
32.5m, largely due to poor workers compensation results and the soft pricing
environment.
However, personal property-casualty edged ahead to Dollars 5.6m from Dollars
1.2m.

<TEXT>
PUMA, the German sports shoe company owned by Aritmos of Sweden, returned to
profit in the first quarter of 1991 after several years in the red caused
mainly by a disastrous US performance.
'The turnround is here,' said Mr Hans Woitschatzke, chief executive
(pictured below).
Puma had hoped this would be achieved in 1990, but was hit by supply
problems in the Far East and made a loss of DM8.9m (Dollars 5.2m), against
one of DM2.6m in 1989.
Shoe production in the Far East was partly shifted from Taiwan and South
Korea to lower-cost Indonesia. However, organisational and logistical
problems there, as well as a fire in the Philippines factory, forced Puma to
pay DM10m in air freight costs to keep dealers supplied.
With these difficulties largely solved, Puma earned a first-quarter net
profit in 1991 of DM6.8m, against a loss of DM3.6m last time. Turnover rose
by 30 per cent to DM162m, with most of the increase coming in Germany.
In 1990, turnover was 5.4 per cent higher at DM548m. Mr Woitschatzke said,
however, the percentage rise would have been in double digits without the
supply problems. Including business under licence, turnover was DM1.1bn
(DM1.05bn).
Mr Woitschatzke, who is stepping down for family reasons, said Puma would
announce 'a revolutionary new shoe concept' in June. He declined to
elaborate, but said the shoe would fit 'like a second skin'. He said Puma
was now ready to rejoin the ranks of the international brands.
Its problems in the US, where its sales were only Dollars 50m last year,
were caused by its slow feet against competition from Nike, Reebok, and
others. Adidas, the rival Bavarian company now French-owned, has also
suffered in the US.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WATSON &amp; Philip, the Dundee-based food and stores services group, is to
expand its wholesaling and retailing interests through the acquisition of
Amalgamated Foods, a privately-owned business, for Pounds 35.5m in shares.
The company is also making a cash-call of Pounds 11.2m which shareholders
can subscribe for on a three-for-five basis at 262p per share. W&amp;P's shares
rose 8p to 285p yesterday.
The acquisition will double the size of W&amp;P's business and extend its
coverage into the English wholesale and convenience stores market.
Both W&amp;P and AF are suppliers to stores in the Spar and VG symbol groups.
W&amp;P services some 180 independent retailers and owns 37 convenience stores
in Scotland while AF deals with over 1,000 independent food outlets in
England and runs 32 wholly-owned convenience stores trading in the Alldays
format.
Mr Ian Macpherson, chairman of W&amp;P, said yesterday: 'We have been walking
out for a long time together. In March we decided it was time to go to
church and at 5.15 this morning we tied the knot.'
The acquisition will be financed through the issue of shares worth Pounds
21.8m to the vendors and a placing of a further Pounds 13.7m of shares on
the vendors' behalf.
Robert Fleming has underwritten both the vendor placing and the cash-call
although gauging from W&amp;P's steady share price yesterday it looked as though
the issues had been well-received.
Mr Ron Jacques, chairman of AF, and his family holding account for 80 per
cent of the company's shares.
Following the acquisition, AF's vendors will end up with 24.7 per cent stake
in the enlarged W&amp;P although they will be bound by a standstill agreement.
Mr Macpherson said the food distribution industry was in a process of
rationalisation as had been demonstrated by Booker's Pounds 300m acquisition
of Fitch Lovell last September.
'We will now be in the top three or four in the industry,' he said 'We
wanted to make sure that we were the rationalisers rather than the
rationalised.'
The enlarged company will be combined on a merger-accounting basis. This
would have given the company combined sales of Pounds 427.9m and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 10.4m in the year to October 26 1990. W&amp;P's earnings per
share would have shown an 11 per cent improvement.

FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Board challenge defeated at Walter
Greenbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Walker Greenbank, the commercial wallcoverings group, yesterday
fought off an attempt by Aubin, its largest shareholder to have five new
non-executive directors elected.
After the extraordinary general meeting in London, Mr Charles Wightman,
chief executive, offered to help Aubin, a Jersey-based investment company,
dispose of its near 28 per cent stake. Walker maintained that Aubin was
trying to take control of the group on the cheap.
Mr Wightman said at least 20 of the 25 institutional investors and more than
1,000 small shareholders had voted against the challenge. He warned that
similar support would be mobilised if Aubin tried to oust any of the three
directors standing for re-election at the June annual meeting.
Walker's board did not, however, have a completely smooth ride.
Mr Chris Wright, of British Airways Pension Fund, which has a near 4 per
cent stake, asked why Walker had failed to mention 1989 losses at Bryant
Corporation when it recently bought part of that group, and whether the best
prices had been obtained for a string of subsidiaries sold to management.
Mr David Richards, chairman, said the Bryant losses were irrelevant because
they did not apply to the purchase. Mr Wright replied: 'As an institution we
could have understood that explanation and we object strongly to the
information being withheld.'

FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Provisions cut NHL by 35%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at National Home Loans, the mortgage lender and financial
services group, fell by 35 per cent in the six months to March 31, after the
group was forced to make heavy provisions against bad debts.
Taxable profits for the period were Pounds 10.1m, down from Pounds 15.6m in
the same period a year earlier.
Mr John Darby, chairman, said the group had been hit by the most difficult
housing market for 50 years, but he was confident that the downturn in
profitability would be only temporary as the underlying performance of the
group was more than satisfactory.
Mr Darby disclosed that the group had been the subject of a fraud which, he
said, was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. This had caused a
loss of Pounds 3.5m to the group, of which Pounds 2.3m, net of tax relief,
was taken as an extraordinary item.
The loss related to lending through the Castlegate Group, a second mortgage
and consumer finance broker in Reading, which went into creditors' voluntary
liquidation in December.
Provisions for other bad debts, including mortgage arrears, rose from Pounds
800,000 a year ago to Pounds 16.3m. Mr Kevin Milner, chief executive, said
that just under 1,000 homes had been repossessed by the group. Its mortgage
book now stands at Pounds 1.7bn, down from Pounds 2bn at the end of last
year. New lending in 1991 has risen to Pounds 500m, up from Pounds 450m in
the same period of 1990.
Most of the group's subsidiaries were said to be performing satisfactorily,
though the group's leasing subsidiary made a loss. Interest receivable was
Pounds 178.9m (Pounds 184.6m) while interest payable was Pounds 153.2m
(Pounds 162.9m). Total operating income was Pounds 44.5m, up from Pounds
30.6m, while operating expenses rose to Pounds 18.1m from Pounds 14.2m.
Earnings per share fell from 7.4p a year ago to 3.4p, but the interim
dividend is being maintained unchanged at 3.75p.
COMMENT
A year ago NHL looked as if it had found a way to come almost unscathed
through the depression in the housing market. The jump in its level of
provisioning since then suggests that it was unduly complacent and is now
paying the price. Nonetheless, there are some signs of strength in its
latest set of figures. Income is healthily up. Mortgage arrears are said to
have peaked, while margins have widened. On this form, the group seems on
course for profits of around Pounds 20m by the year end, and a maintained
dividend. But as with all mortgage lenders this will depend on how quickly
the mortgage market revives. Meanwhile, its performance has a distinctly
fragile appearance, which is not helped by greater reticence than in the
past about supplying details of how its subsidiaries are faring.

FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Granada expected to take over BSkyB
satellite TV rental side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA GROUP is expected to take over the satellite television rental
business built up by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television in the early months
of the satellite venture.
As a result Granada will take over more than 200,000 rental agreements for
satellite dishes and receivers, giving a boost to the company's rental
division which already has some 2.5m customers. The agreement, expected to
be signed soon, will mean additional revenues of more than Pounds 25m a year
for Granada.
Mr Murdoch set up his own rental organisation in the early days of Sky when
there was an overwhelming need to increase the number of viewers as quickly
as possible.
Since the merger of Sky Television and its rival British Satellite
Broadcasting in November to form BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson,
publishers of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, the television
company has been less interested in being directly involved in rental.
The deal is effective compensation for Granada's losses on surplus BSB
squarials. Granada was stuck with about Pounds 20m in redundant stock
because of the merger, and was one of those with a legal case for
compensation against BSkyB even though it was an investor in the satellite
venture.
Last week Comet, Kingfisher's consumer electronics chain, won a judgment
against BSkyB because of the effects of the merger on its business. Comet is
claiming more than Pounds 10m compensation although BSkyB said it would
appeal.
Apart from revenues of about Pounds 10 a month from each satellite rental
customer, Granada will also collect film channel subscriptions from them for
BSkyB.

LLOYDS BANK, the smallest of the 'Big Four' UK clearing banks, is to close
its commercial banking and treasury operations in Hong Kong and Singapore,
along with its representative offices in Indonesia and the Shenzen Economic
Zone of China.
The closure is the latest in a series of withdrawals from overseas
operations by Lloyds Bank to concentrate on more profitable retail banking
activities in the UK.
The Hong Kong branch employed 100 people and made post-tax profits of Pounds
2.7m last year. Lloyds said yesterday that it hoped that a fair number of
its employees would be given new jobs in its Hong Kong private banking
operations which are not affected by the closure.
The Singapore branch employed 47 people with profits of Pounds 1.2m. All the
operations being closed had been on the market for several months but
suitable buyers had failed to appear.
Lloyds commercial and treasury activities in Korea and Taiwan are also up
for sale. The bank, however, said yesterday that negotiations with possible
buyers were under way. Lloyds says it has no intention of withdrawing from
corporate and treasury activities in Japan.
The operations being closed had combined net assets of Pounds 20.2m at the
end of last year.
'This restructuring is consistent with our policy of concentrating our
resources on activities which can make a significant contribution to our
total business results.' said Mr Frank Jones, director of international
banking at Lloyds.

board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES TILDESLEY has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Norton
Group and quit the board. He has been at the centre of one of the
controversies besetting the engineering concern which includes the famous
motorcycle marque.
Norton is being investigated by the DTI and its shares were suspended at 18p
on April 1 because of a delay in publishing results for the six months to
October 31.
Yesterday evening's announcement included no reason for the departure and no
one was available to comment at Norton.
Mr Tildesley, non-executive chairman since 1988, only stepped into the chief
executive position in January, when Mr Philippe Le Roux resigned.
The controversy involving Mr Tildesley concerned the Pounds 8.2m purchase of
a German fasteners maker from a Channel Islands trust company set up to
benefit his offspring. His former company, PSM, had founded the German
business.
A poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights issue to help complete the purchase
had a bumpy conclusion in January.
Norton's new non-executive chairman is Mr Norman Minty, who joined the board
when Norton reversed into his eponymous furniture company in June 1989,
thereby gaining a main market listing.
Norton also announced two other board appointments, again with no
amplification. A Mr D MacDonald becomes chief executive and a Mr N Wilson
joins as a non-executive director.

Provisions amounting to Pounds 8.3m against the value of development

first half to December 31, against Pounds 431,000.
At the operating level this property investor and developer rose to Pounds
1.82m (Pounds 622,000); but interest payable of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 191,000)
reduced profits to Pounds 423,000 before provisions.
There is no interim dividend (0.6p), but directors intend to pay a dividend

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jones Group, a Dublin-based engineering company, reported taxable
profits of IPounds 5.51m (Pounds 4.97m) for 1990, up 7 per cent from IPounds
5.47m last time.
The recommended final dividend is raised by 1p to 9p, making a total of 12p
(11p).
The sale of the two environmental companies towards the end of the year for
a maximum of IPounds 13.8m helped increase shareholders' funds by 50 per
cent to IPounds 33m.

Dean &amp; Bowes Group reported lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.68m for 1990,
against Pounds 2.85m. However, on continuing activities the result was
Pounds 2.88m compared with Pounds 1.06m.
The company, which refurbishes leisure properties, said that inquiries,
quotations and orders were significantly higher than at the same time last
year and the present order book covered 60 per cent of the expected turnover

10.5p (14.2p) and the directors are proposing a maintained final dividend of
3.25p making an unchanged total of 6p. On a pro forma basis earnings for
continuing activities were 13p (6.2p).

FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fall to loss and rights at Porth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE same time that it announced a fall into loss in 1990, Porth Group
unveiled plans for a rights issue to raise about Pounds 3.5m, net of
expenses, and made public the appointment of Sir Michael Edwardes as
non-executive chairman.
In the year to December 31 this consumer products company dropped into
losses of Pounds 853,000 (profits Pounds 925,000) on turnover down slightly
at Pounds 21.17m (Pounds 21.3m). The company is omitting its final dividend,
leaving the total for the year at 0.5p (4.5p).
Interest payable rose to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 890,000) and, after a higher
tax charge of Pounds 227,000 (Pounds 15,000), losses per share came out at
7p (earnings 5.9p).
The company said that although it kept within its overdraft limits 'during
this difficult period', its principal bankers were unwilling to to agree
renewed facilities unless the group had an injection of capital.
Consequently Porth is issuing 61.41m new ordinary shares on a 4-for-1 basis
to raise Pounds 2.5m to reduce bank borrowings and Pounds 1m to provide
extra working capital.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For heavens' sake let's stop blaming the exchange rate for British
manufacturing industry's poor performance in the competition for a fair
share of world trade. On an exchange rate basis German products in Britain
should be some 35 per cent dearer than they were eight or nine years ago,
during which time the D-Mark/Pounds has gone from about 4.5 to 2.95. Also in
that period, the German slice of British business has continued to grow.
I wonder if it could have anything to do with the right attitude to quality,
a financial structure which supports manufacturing, the ability to plan and
invest for the long term and finally, just maybe, a belief in one's own
product.
Both government and population have a lot more to put right in the attitude
department before the exchange rate will have any effect at all.

<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder just how long banks will survive, but I am not an accountant.
The present system seems quite mad. I saw my 'new' bank manager the other
day, he's a delightful chap and shares my doubts] The very lowest interest
rate they offer to private people nowadays is a rate of 1.2 per cent a month
which works out at an APR of 15.39 per cent. Apparently you need to be a
teenager to get this, as a mature student of the banking system I wouldn't
qualify. Instead, the bank wants me to have its super dooper 'Classic
Account' for which it charges Pounds 7 per month, pays me interest when in
credit at an unpublicised rate which on enquiry turns out to be, I think, 2
per cent a year and charges interest on any overdraft at 1.9 per cent a
month (an APR of 25.34 per cent, or 13.34 per cent over the current base
rate). As an inducement I think it would give me a different plastic card
with which to impress waiters.
Ten years ago the same bank was perfectly happy, and presumably making a
profit, to lend to me at 2 per cent over base on only a fraction of the
collateral available now. Nowadays most of banks seem to make a loss.

Sir, Further to R. Bradley's letter (April 19), may I add Access to the list
of UK financial institutions which have not yet come to terms with 'abroad'?
While UK Access statements are apparently sent through the post, those going
abroad are sent via a mailing company, and there is invariably a
considerable time lag between the date of a statement and its arrival here.
Although I send off a cheque at once, I have on some occasions been charged
interest which I have not incurred.
Repeated correspondence requesting that this be remedied and my statement be
sent through the post has produced very evasive replies, plus the suggestion
that I ask someone in England to settle payments for me 'during your
temporary absence from England'.
I have now been living in Germany for nearly 20 years and am astonished that
someone at Access in Southend appears to know what my plans are.
At the very least, I detect disapproval of my being so unpatriotic as to
live elsewhere, and perhaps this is the misdemeanour for which l am being
charged interest?

FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: All bogged down in a myth of a cottage industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEE ST LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One does not challenge such a respected gardening authority as Arthur
Hellyer with impunity but l am afraid that his article 'All in a mire over
peat' (April 20) gives a false impression of peat production and the
horticultural value of peat.
The article, supported by the photograph, suggests that digging peat is a
kind of a quaint cottage industry in Ireland serving Saturday gardeners in
Britain. It isn't. Peat is a very big business driven by a 'market-led
approach', to quote the annual report of one Irish peat producer, whose
production is about 7m tons a year and whose export sales of horticultural
peat products, mostly to the UK, are in the order of Pounds 25m a year.
It is not the peat digger of the photograph who has traditionally and
economically dug peat for his hearth fire, who has caused the peat alarm. It
is rather the giant companies, gang milling and 'using the vacuum technique'
to harvest the peat bogs to the tune of more than 215m tons a year.
Satellite photography has revealed large areas of northern Europe and
Ireland left virtually wasted by the intensity of peat winning. The big
problems are yet to come.
l am surprised by Mr Hellyer's assertion that 'there is no obvious
substitute that has all the advantages' (of peat). The disadvantages of
peat, not to mention the environmental damage, are all too evident: so
acidic that it requires liming; of such poor air-filled porosity and
drainage as to need added grit or vermiculite; of such poor ability to wet
and rewet as to need chemical surfactants; such a low Cation Exchange
Capacity as to require an excess of nutrients and of such a low
carbon-nitrogen ratio as to render it useless for more than one season.
Mr Donald Beaton, a celebrated gardener and gardening writer of the 1850s
and 1860s, Prof John Lindley, the secretary of the Royal Horticultural
Society, and James Veitch, keeper of the Royal Exotic Nursery, all eminent
horticulturalists of their day, recommended the use of 'cocoa-nut refuse',
or what is now called coir, as a replacement for leaf mould and superior to
peat . At that time coir was a waste product of the Millwall and
Kingston-on-Thames rope and rigging industry that imported coir fibre from
India and Ceylon. The demand for 'cocoa nut refuse' became so great that
eventually and with the advent of the steam ship, supplies ran out and
gardening went back to leaf mould and sterilised soil until the 1950s.
The Royal Horticultural Society library is replete with favourable and
advisory references to the horticultural virtues of coir. More recently,
Geoff Hamilton, of the BBC's Gardeners World, stated in the journal
Horticulture Week (March 8): 'My own trials have indicated that coir
composts will give perfectly good results for home gardeners and I shall be
recommending them for this season.'
Mr Hellyer is perfectly correct in saying, 'It is high time that the
gardening public ceased to be bamboozled.'
But who's bamboozling whom?

FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: An unfair way to pay for TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JH BESCOBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A point not mentioned by Christopher Dunkley in his fascinating
overview ('The BBC at bay', April 20) of the BBC's place in contemporary
society is that the current method of financing the corporation severely
limits the viewer's choice.
Legally, if he wants to watch television at all, he must pay the licence
fee. Even if he abhors the BBC's offer ings, high-brow or low-brow, and
watches only ITV, Channel 4 or satellite, he must buy a licence. All of us,
in fact, are compelled to sup port the corporation financially.
I find this unfair and unreasonable. If some other method of financing the
corporation were to be devised which offered the choice of watching and
paying or not watching and not paying, then I would be happy for the BBC to
continue enjoying its reputation.
But why should we be compelled to pay? The licence fee is akin to a form of
taxation which almost all must pay whether or not they avail themselves of
the corporation's broadcast services.

FT  27 APR 91 / From one bright idea to another: How the successor to the
community charge could suffer similar pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time there was a bright and enthusiastic secretary of state for
the environment, called Nicholas Ridley, who was particularly enthusiastic
about a bright new idea called the community charge.
Introducing the new idea to the House of Commons in December 1987, he
announced that 'every authority will be able to levy exactly the same
community charge - Pounds 178 this year - to provide a standard level of
service efficiently. A higher charge will be a direct result of higher
spending, a lower one will mean greater efficiency and prudence'.
A little less than two years later, the UK found itself with another bright,
but less enthusiastic secretary of state, called Chris Patten. One reason
for his lack of enthusiasm was the Treasury's pronounced unwillingness to
finance the bright new idea. In November 1989 he announced that
charge-payers in England were now expected to pay an average community
charge of Pounds 278 in the coming financial year.
When the community charge - or poll tax as it came to be called - was
introduced, its average level in England turned out to be Pounds 357. In
just two and a half years, the starting level of the new tax had doubled
(though after the reduction schemes and transitional reliefs and income
support, the average actually paid was 'only' Pounds 285).
How was it possible for the level of the community charge to exceed that
initially expected by so huge a margin? The answer lies in its leverage. All
local authority spending above government assumptions fell on a tax that
accounted for about a quarter of local authority current spending and 20 per
cent of total spending.
Given this degree of leverage, the chances of huge divergences from
government expectations were high. But was that not the whole point of the
exercise? Not, as the government soon learned, if the overshoot could be
laid at its own door rather than that of the local authorities.
The difference between the assumption in November 1989 and the outcome a few
months later was not due to local profligacy, but to inflation. Mr Patten
was forced by Mr Nigel Lawson's Treasury to assume that local authority
expenditure would increase by 3.8 per cent in the following financial year.
This was below the Treasury's forecast of 5 3/4 per cent for the increase in
the retail prices index in the year to December 1990, itself enormously
below the outcome of 10 per cent.
The community charge was killed off by the Treasury. A tax designed to make
any increases in the burden upon it as unpopular as possible was asked in
1990-91 to cover a higher proportion of local authority spending than in any
year of the 1980s.
Now the UK has another bright, enthusiastic secretary of state for the
environment. Indeed, he is secretary of state, partly because of his party's
panic over the old bright idea. He has a new bright idea. It is called the
council tax.
Will the new bright idea suffer the fate of the old bright idea? Mr Michael
Heseltine, the once and present secretary of state for the environment, says
that this year a couple living in a house in the middle of his seven bands
and under a council that spends in accordance with his department's Standard
Spending Assessment (SSA) would pay Pounds 400. A couple living in the
lowest band would pay Pounds 267, while a couple in the most expensive would
pay Pounds 668.
Just think of the hullabaloo if all those numbers were to double by April
1993. Could that happen?
One reason that it might is Mr Heseltine's success in raping the Treasury.
By persuading the Treasury to increase value added tax by two and a half
percentage points in the Budget and then set the Pounds 4 1/4 bn proceeds
against the community charge, he has lowered the proportion of current
English local spending covered by the community charge to 16 per cent. Of
total local authority spending in the UK, the community charge will cover a
mere 11 per cent.
Suppose that total local spending in 1993-94 were to be around 10 per cent
higher than the government hopes, but that there were to be no increase in
central government support for local authorities. Then the new council tax
would be double Mr Heseltine's current estimates. Nothing, it would seem,
could be more likely than that, given the Treasury's dreadful forecasting
record on inflation and the fact that the closest approximation to inflation
in local spending is not the retail price index, but the increase in
earnings.
Is the Treasury going to increase its contribution by the rate of pay
inflation? One must wonder, particularly when one recalls that, in a moment
of dementia, the increase in the business rate, now a national tax earmarked
to local spending, was limited to the increase in the retail price index.
That has worked out well for the government this year. Next year it will
not. In the long run the retail price index will rise perhaps two and a half
percentage points less rapidly than local authority costs, this being the
long run increase in real wages. Thus, grants from the Treasury to local
government would probably have to rise still faster than local authority
costs if the share of spending to be met by the council tax were to be kept
where it is now expected to be.
The problem of leverage does not only arise for the burden of locally set
taxation overall. It also arises across councils. Wandsworth will have no
community charge this year, while Lambeth's charge for two adults will be
Pounds 901. For the median band of the council tax, the taxes would be
Pounds 135 and Pounds 501, respectively.
Yet the spending of the two councils diverges only modestly from the
Department of the Environment's assessment of needs: plus 6.5 per cent for
Lambeth and minus 8.7 per cent for Wandsworth. Out of these divergences from
what the man in Whitehall thinks he knows best, vast differences in taxation
emerge.
The government has never shown itself particularly concerned about such
inequities. But it is concerned about huge council bills. The secretary of
state may comfort himself with the thought that this time an election comes
between announcing the bright new idea and putting it into effect. He may
hope that the Treasury will prove reasonable thereafter. But, if the worst
comes to the worst, he will cap every council in sight.
Like any modern fairy story, this one will not have a happy ending. It was
the tax that disappeared last time. This time it is more likely to be what
remains of discretionary local services. If readers want clean streets, they
had better get used to picking up the rubbish themselves.

<TEXT>
Sir, Following Observer's comments (April 23) about the rise in football
programme cover prices after Sunday's Rumbelows League Cup Final, would it
be possible to re-base the programme index to allow for the increased size
and number of pages, paper quality and colour improvements etc.?
I wager the price per square inch alone would justify a large part of the
increase. Colour improvements are a bonus.

FT  27 APR 91 / Guy's on the casualty list: The solemn mood at the London
hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a dark shadow over the campus of Guy's Hospital yesterday, in
spite of the spring sun and gentle breeze blowing across London.
Crowds of patients and staff bustled between the buildings in the complex,
and an open-air coffee shop was doing good business. But a hastily-scribbled
National Union of Public Employees poster on a noticeboard nearby bore a
solemn reminder: '600 jobs cut. Never before has it been more important to
be in a trade union.'
Mr David Brown, a clerk, said: 'I'm very angry. This is part and parcel of
the move to turn the hospital into a trust. They are paving the way to make
redundancies easier.'
A counsellor at Guy's said: 'I think it's horrific. It's difficult to
understand how a hospital that was declared viable when it applied for trust
status can now suddenly be in such an appalling financial state.'
Dr Helen Crimlisk, a senior house officer, said she was concerned, but still
supported the principle of Guy's opting out. 'I'm not in favour of people
losing their jobs. But I think we've taken out a layer of administration. It
was very difficult to embark on any change in the past.
'I hope they will take this opportunity to change the way the health service
runs, to make it more efficient and relevant to the local population.'
Professor Stewart Cameron, professor of renal medicine, said: 'Flagship
Guy's is listing badly. There's no fat, there's practically no muscle and we
are virtually down to the bone.'
He said consultants - who voted convincingly for Guy's to become a
self-governing trust - were told the hospital had been projected to make a
Pounds 1.5m surplus in its first year.
'How is it that they got their estimates so catastrophically wrong?' he
said. 'And how can we have any confidence in people who have made such a
devastating mistake?'
A hospital porter said: 'I think it's scandalous. We're already
understaffed. A lot of rumours have been going about but they never tell us
anything. I suppose there's not much we can do about it.'
A pharmacy assistant was more stoical. 'I've been here a long time,' she
said. 'I could retire in three years. If they retire me, that's OK.'
'It's a shame,' said Mr Ron Kiely, a pensioner who has used the hospital for
many years.
One woman smiled as she hurried past. 'I'm not prepared to comment, but
let's just say this. The wrong people will be going.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Clouds over a commercial vision: Proposed cuts at Guy's
hospital have cast doubts on health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like ambulance sirens blaring in a noiseless night, the voices of managers
at Guy's hospital have shattered the peace with which the government thought
it had secured its National Health Service reforms.
Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, spent the weeks leading up to this
month's changes renouncing the business-like style in which they were first
presented, and stressing the government's continued attachment to the NHS as
a secure, caring public service.
He appeared to have succeeded. But health is the most politically volatile
of public services and, less than a month after the calm introduction of the
reforms, the first explosion has occurred. Managers at Guy's have announced
that they are seeking Pounds 12.8m in savings, hundreds of job losses, and
the likely closure of some clinical services.
There is the greatest possible irony - and embarrassment for the government
 -in the fact that the first controversy over the reforms has come at Guy's,
one of London's most famous teaching hospitals which became a self-governing
trust on April 1.
Until earlier this year Mr Peter Griffiths, the trust's chief executive,
worked in Whitehall as deputy head of the NHS management board. Ms Karen
Caines, Guy's new general manager, went to the hospital recently from the
Department of Health where she headed the division responsible for
implementing the government's reforms. The reforms themselves were to an
extent born at Guy's - Lord McColl, professor of surgery in its medical
school and one of the hospital's top doctor-managers, was among the trusted
group which advised the government on its plans.
Guy's is run by people who played a prominent part in advancing the entire
reform programme, and who are widely presumed to reflect official thinking.
Yesterday this left staff at other hospitals fearing that Guy's, often
described as the flagship of the reforms, was steering the rest of the fleet
towards the commercial vision of balance sheet medicine which Mr Waldegrave
has tried to dispel.
The government's opponents, meanwhile, are rejoicing in the fact that the
affair has sent the whole question of NHS funding springing back up the
political agenda in what could be a general election year.
Guy's managers and Department of Health officials were anxious to stress
yesterday that the proposed job cuts are not directly related to the health
reforms and the hospital's self-governing status. While essentially true,
the argument that the cuts would probably have been made anyway was hardly
likely to cheer critics, who have claimed consistently that underfunding is
the NHS's overriding problem. Britain spends less on health care in GDP
terms than most comparable countries.
This week's events at Guy's will give added bite to a meeting at Chequers
today when Mr John Major, prime minister, Mr Waldegrave and other ministers
will discuss with senior doctors targets for improving the nation's health.
The immediate problem for the Guy's trust is that it inherited Pounds 6.8m
debt from the old system on NHS funding. Many hospitals and health
authorities have, over the past year, been taking tough measures to clear
debt and balance their books in readiness for this month's changes. Guy's
neighbour, St Thomas, has recently completed a struggle to save Pounds 8m.
Mr Griffiths wants about 600 job cuts to help clear the deficit from the
hospital's Pounds 128m budget and provide a further Pounds 6m for
reinvestment in patient services.
Some senior medical staff at Guy's argued yesterday that, following years of
repeatedly tight financial controls, there is no scope for achieving such
savings without affecting services.
Prof Stewart Cameron, professor of renal medicine, said that when
consultants voted 2-1 in favour of supporting self-governing status in a
ballot which took place before the financial picture was clear, they
believed that the trust would begin life with a Pounds 1.5m surplus rather
than a Pounds 6.8m deficit. 'We must all of us feel, if not cheated, at
least that we have been misled,' he said.
Even more alarming for many staff at Guy's and the trust's sister hospital
at Lewisham is a decision by the management to conduct a review of all
clinical services over the next three months to determine priorities for the
future. Mr Griffiths said in a message to his 8,000 staff that 'services
whose patient satisfaction level is too low will find that resources will
not be allocated to them'.
The exercise is justified by the logic of the health reforms, under which
hospitals are funded in relation to the value of contracts they win from
health authorities and general practitioners. 'If contracts are not won then
the trust has no future,' said Mr Griffiths. 'There is no fall-back
position, as there was in the past, on a block sum of money appearing every
year irrespective of how many patients were treated or, even, how they were
treated.'
For managers, a decision to concentrate on what Guy's does best is likely to
make sound managerial sense under the contract-based funding arrangements;
activities which do not meet this criteria would be left to neighbouring
hospitals.
Many doctors fear, however, that the same financial pressures which have
provoked the call for job cuts will tempt managers to concentrate on the
most profitable activities. There is concern that unglamorous areas such as
geriatric care and services to the relatively-deprived communities from
which Guy's and Lewisham hospitals draw their local patients may be at risk.
Even if Guy's gets the staff cuts and financial savings it is seeking, this
will only clear managers' desks for some even bigger potential problems.
The London teaching hospitals, as national centres of excellence, draw many
of their patients from outside the capital. They are expensive institutions
to run and, with contract funding, may show up as uncompetitive compared
with local hospitals in the new market-based NHS. Health authorities in the
home counties now operate under strong financial incentives to treat more
patients locally rather than send them to London.
In addition, the regional allocation of NHS finance will in future be
broadly related to population. This will point up an already established
fact - that the capital has more than its fair share of hospital provision.
Combined, these factors provide a recipe for aggressive competition between
the London teaching hospitals, leading to the probable eventual closure of
at least one - with many more financial dramas like this week's events at
Guy's in between.
Guy's will not be alone in seeking to reduce costs. The Bradford Hospitals
trust is likely to shed 300 jobs over the next three years to save Pounds
7m. Leeds General Infirmary is reviewing costs and the Royal London faces a
likely Pounds 1.5m shortfall this year. The problem is not restricted to
trusts - all hospitals are now funded on the basis of the contracts they
attract - m of manoeuvre in tackling it.
All hospitals are heavily labour-intensive by the nature of their work -
nearly Pounds 90m of the Pounds 128m Guy's budget goes in staff costs. Many
hospital staff on the lower grades are in poorly paid jobs where
productivity and efficiency levels are often modest.
One of the biggest challenges facing managers is to find ways of lifting
productivity, for example, by turning porters into multi-skilled general
support workers, and increasing the use of cost-effective day-surgery
treatment techniques. So, although the NHS will remain labour intensive, its
managers are beginning to follow the trend in other sectors towards fewer
staff doing more varied, highly-qualified jobs.
While public finance remains tight, this is one of the most promising means
of releasing more money for patient care. But, as the events at Guy's have
shown, NHS managers do not have the same opportunities as their counterparts
in industry to get there through quiet negotiation. Health is too much of a
political battleground occupied by sectional interests for that.
Ministers hope that the introduction of self-governing trusts will
eventually enable hospitals to be managed out of the political spotlight in
a more local, low-key way. Eventually perhaps, but not yet. By yesterday,
the events at Guy's had provoked uproar, questions in parliament, and
demands for the scrapping of the health reforms. The prospects of the NHS
being a dominant issue in the next general election remain high.

FT  27 APR 91 / Leading Article: Just say no to Mr Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS SLOW GROWTH about to be replaced by no growth in the world economy? Yes,
according to the US Treasury. No, according to most forecasters, including
the International Monetary Fund. The US administration's lobbying for a
concerted cut in world interest rates is, therefore, likely to fall on deaf
ears at this weekend's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers
of the group of seven industrial countries. At least the ears that matter
will be deaf.
The recession in the US is not as serious as the administration suggests -
to judge by the financial markets, at least. The Dow Jones Industrial
average has risen by 10.5 per cent in the past three months alone, while the
US dollar has risen by 18 per cent against the D-Mark over the same period.
Nor do US economic indicators paint an overwhelmingly gloomy picture. The US
is now in its third quarter of an unexpectedly deep recession; but surveys
of consumer confidence have maintained their immediate post-war strength and
housing starts are beginning to increase.
US monetary policy has been steadily easing over the past two years. But the
Federal Reserve, worried by inflation and maybe scenting recovery, has
appeared unwilling to cut interest rates further in recent weeks. Yet the US
administration's call for concerted interest rate cuts is more than an
attempt to put pressure on its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan.
With the US presidential campaign on the horizon, the administration is
nervous that a home-grown recovery may be as slow and sluggish as was the
onset of recession last year. Successive interest rate cuts have not
stimulated spending by US consumers to any great extent. The added threat of
a prolonged period of slow, or even no, growth in Europe and Japan sends
shivers down the presidential spine.
New variation
No wonder Mr Bush is pursuing a new variation of a familiar theme: encourage
the rest of the world to pull the US out of recession, by trying to convince
it that this is in its own interest.
Yet the divergent aims and economic performance of the Japanese and Germans
do not bode well for Mr Bush's chances.
The Japanese have kept a noticeably low profile in recent weeks as the duo
of Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, and Mr David Mulford, Treasury
under-secretary for international affairs, have hawked their wares. After
over a year of tight monetary policy the Japanese economy is slowing.
Economic growth may slip below 4 per cent this year compared to 5.6 per cent
in 1990 - a slump by recent Japanese standards, but unsustainably high for
any other G7 country.
Policy co-ordination
Japan may ease interest rates over the next few months. But even if a
reduction in their interest rates were desirable, the Japanese would be
reticent over agreeing to another bout of policy co-ordination. The Japanese
authorities blame the expansionary monetary policy that followed the 1987
Louvre accord for the Japanese asset-market bubble and the subsequent need
to restore sanity to the Tokyo stock market.
In Germany, the next move may be up. The Bundesbank still fears that the
west German economy is over-heating, never mind the economic collapse that
is occurring east of the Elbe, which it blames on Mr Helmut Kohl.
Yesterday's announcement that wholesale sales in the western Lander rose by
10 per cent in real terms in the first quarter will have stiffened the
Bundesbank's resolve, particularly with wage negotiations in the crucial
engineering industries threatening to deliver wage rises of 7 per cent or
more. Nor has the weakness of the D-Mark over the past month eased its
worries.
It seems, then, that a concerted effort by the big three to stimulate the
world economy by cutting interest rates is unlikely and undesirable. If the
US economy does need a further monetary boost, what better time to provide
it unilaterally than a week after the dollar reached its highest level for
16 months?
It is the recession-bound European economies, rather than the US, which have
most to gain from a concerted cut in interest rates. A rise in interest
rates in Germany combined with a cut in the US might push the D-Mark back to
the top of the exchange rate mechanism and so make cuts in French, Italian
and UK rates more difficult.
Why, then, has Mr Norman Lamont aligned himself so firmly with the Germans
against the Brady proposal? Perhaps he is suffering from an excess of zeal.
Perhaps he believes those Treasury forecasts of imminent recovery. If so he
is among the few who do. But perhaps he realises that the UK government has
almost no chance of engineering a strong recovery before the general
election. If so, lower inflation is likely to be all the government can
bring to the hustings.

FT  27 APR 91 / Man In The News: Fixer finds friends for his Kurds - Jalal
Talabani
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month ago he made a triumphant return to Kurdistan and appealed to Iraqis,
both Kurdish and Arab, to topple President Saddam Hussein and end what he
called the 'bloody dictatorship of Baghdad'. This week he embraced Mr Saddam
and said he thought they could do a deal.
In the intervening days, of course, the Iraqi army had all but crushed the
post-war uprisings in Kurdistan and in the Shia Moslem towns of southern
Iraq.
But Mr Jalal Talabani, the veteran Kurdish guerrilla leader and politician,
has stunned many of his supporters with a U-turn so remarkable that it
stands out even in a nationalist movement famous for its shifting alliances
and loyalties.
Mr Talabani, now a grey-haired 57-year-old, has alternately fought and
negotiated with his enemies since he joined the late Mullah Mustafa
Barzani's Kurdish Democratic party at the age of 12. He split from the KDP
in 1964, and Barzani - hardly a man of unchanging allegiances himself - once
sneeringly described him as 'an agent for everybody'.
In the current negotiations with the Iraqi regime, however, Mr Talabani is
not alone, although it was he who spoke for the Kurdish delegation this week
after the first round of talks. The Kurdish side included Mr Talabani's
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (which he founded in 1975), the KDP (now led by
Mustafa's son, Masoud Barzani, who is expected to lead the next round of
discussions) and other members of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front.
Mr Talabani and his fellow Kurds are taking an extraordinary political risk
by talking to President Saddam at such a time and by urging Kurds to return
home when their long-term safety from government reprisals is not assured,
but they feel they have no choice. They do not want the nearly 2m Kurds who
have fled to the borders with Iran and Turkey to become permanent refugees.
At the same time they believe the west has accepted that Mr Saddam will stay
in power, and they want to squeeze concessions from the Iraqi leader while
he is still weak in the aftermath of the war over Kuwait.
'We are alone,' Mr Talabani said at rebel headquarters in Shaqlawa after his
meeting with Mr Saddam. 'We have no friends . . . The Iraqi government
wanted to crush us, but was unable to do so. And we wanted to overthrow the
government but have not been able to do so.'
So the negotiations continue. Nobody would have been surprised at Mr
Talabani's decision to talk to his enemies in the Iraqi government, or at
his subsequent optimism about the prospects for democracy in Iraq and
autonomy for Kurdistan, had he not been so widely admired as an astute and
prudent politician. Many Shia Moslems are furious at what they see as Mr
Talabani's betrayal of the 17-party Iraqi opposition coalition which is
seeking to overthrow Mr Saddam, but his friends and allies are confident
that he is not about to throw caution to the winds. 'I don't think he can be
deceived or be made to agree to something that does not accord with his
principles,' says Mr Ibrahim Ahmed, his father-in-law.
Mr Talabani, who is married with two sons, is as relaxed in a western suit
and sitting on a sofa as he is in baggy trousers and turban sitting on the
ground surrounded by his pesh merga (the Kurdish guerrillas, or 'those who
face death').
Years ago he often used to harangue his PUK colleagues and threaten to
resign as leader if he did not get his way. He would fling down his
revolver, tell his colleagues to do what they wanted without him and make as
if to leave.
They invariably urged him to stay, handed back his revolver, and yielded to
his wishes. But one day, so the story goes, when times were hard in
Kurdistan before the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, an angry pesh merga
bodyguard pointed his Kalashnikov at Mr Talabani's stomach and told him to
pick up the revolver and take responsibility for the mess into which he had
led the Kurdish people. Mr Talabani retrieved his gun. 'Since then he's
stopped doing that,' says one of his acquaintances.
A fluent English-speaker, the exiled Mr Talabani has impressed his
interlocutors in the west and elsewhere with a mixture of determination,
moderation, honesty and humour.
'He was always a shrewd politician and he has only one main occupation - the
Kurdish problem,' says Mr Kamran Karadaghi, the Kurdish foreign editor of
the Arabic newspaper al-Hayat. 'When he speaks about the Kurdish cause he
talks with the same enthusiasm and emotion as he did when he was 15 years
old.'
His early differences with the Barzani clan arose partly because he and his
leftist allies saw the Barzanis as tribal and backward, and to this day Mr
Talabani's supporters say he has a much better grasp of international
affairs and their relevance for the Kurdish problem than most of his rivals.
He was particularly anguished when the Iranian government used Iraqi Kurds
based in Iran to fight Iranian Kurds during the Iran-Iraq war. Like many
Kurds, he espouses ideals of cross-border Kurdish nationalism but has come
to accept that complete independence is not a goal which can be achieved in
the teeth of opposition from Turkey, Iran and Iraq.
His aim now is an autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan within a democratic Iraq, an
ambition so acceptable to Turkey that he was invited to meet Turkish
government officials in March. He is already close to the Syrians and
sometimes lives in Damascus. As for the Iraqis, this is the third time that
Mr Talabani has done serious business with the government in Baghdad,
although this time the stakes are higher. Since he last met President Saddam
in 1984, the Iraqi government has gassed to death the residents of Halabja
and all but finished its programme of depopulating the Kurdish countryside
by demolishing villages and deporting the inhabitants.
Some Kurds are inordinately proud of the 1970 autonomy agreement reached
with Baghdad by Mustafa Barzani, and it is on this agreement that the
proposed deal between the Kurds and the Iraqi government is to be based.
Kurds admire the 1970 accord because it represents a far greater series of
concessions from a central government than the Kurds have won in Iran or
Turkey, but it remains a piece of paper of the kind not normally respected
by Mr Saddam.
Mr Talabani and his allies are nevertheless hoping to put it into practice
and to enforce it by means of international guarantees. 'I have never seen
in all this time such a positive spirit, such a positive climate, such
positive ground for negotiation on Iraqi Kurdistan,' said Mr Talabani after
meeting Mr Saddam. His supporters are praying that his political acumen has
not deserted him.

FT  27 APR 91 / Pounds 200m plan for Cardiff development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC has put forward a Pounds 200m scheme to South Glamorgan County
Council for redeveloping a site linking the commercial and shopping centre
of Cardiff with its docklands waterfront.
The proposed project falls within the boundaries of the urban development
corporation set up four years ago to regenerate 2,700 acres of Cardiff Bay.
It is the largest urban redevelopment being undertaken in Europe after
London's docklands.
Mr Sam Pickstock, chairman of Tarmac Atlantic Wharf Developments, said in
Cardiff yesterday the scheme would go ahead even if the proposed Pounds 125m
barrage across the entrance to Cardiff Bay was not built.
The private bill to promote the barrage, which is seen as crucial to the
development, collapsed in parliament last week. The government has since
said it will sponsor a new bill of its own to get the measure on the statute
book.
Mr Pickstock said: 'This scheme means we are making a long-term commitment
to Cardiff, into the next century. Nowhere in the south of England has the
same potential for development and growth as Cardiff.'
Mr Peter Mathias, director of Holder, Mathias, Alcock, the Cardiff
architects which designed the scheme, said the centrepiece was a crescent
based on London's Regent Street.
Tarmac was the first developer to operate in Cardiff, arriving three years
before the government set up an urban development corporation in 1987. It
has already spent more than Pounds 50m and committed another Pounds 25m on
houses, commercial building and site clearance in the area.
Grosvenor Waterside, the property arm in Cardiff of Associated British
Ports, has already announced a Pounds 150m scheme on 40 acres for a mixed
development nearby.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS on an international agreement to protect the Antarctic from
exploitation by mining companies appeared to be heading for failure
yesterday.
Mr Curtis Bohlen, head of the US delegation and assistant secretary of state
for economic and international environmental affairs, said that after a week
of talks in Madrid supporters of a 40-year mining moratorium and others who
want an eternal ban were at loggerheads.
The US, backed by the UK, supports the 40-year moratorium, but is becoming
isolated by the increasingly popularity of the Australian position, which
favours an eternal ban.
Mr Bohlen said he had seen 'no indication that they (the Australians) were
willing to move away from the concept of a permanent ban'. There was 'no
chance' that the conference, which ends on Tuesday, would reach consensus on
Article Six of the Antarctic Treaty, which governs mining on the continent,
he said.
Nevertheless, supporters of a total ban say their position has been improved
by a change of heart this week by the Japanese, who came out in support of a
permanent ban. Many delegates said it was likely that if the meeting failed
to reach a consensus on mining, the issue would be discussed again in Bonn
in October.
The Madrid meeting is, in effect, a continuation of a special consultative
conference held in Chile last year.
Further talks are likely at the weekend in the faint hope of reaching
agreement.

in a desperate last-ditch effort to stay in power as rebels tightened their
grip on the capital.
With fighters of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
(EPRDF) within 65 miles of Addis Ababa after a series of lightning victories
against demoralised government troops, Mr Mengistu's slim chances of
survival depend on rebel reaction to a parliamentary proposal for a
transitional government and a ceasefire.
Western diplomats in Addis Ababa say the appointment of the moderate Mr
Tesfaye Dinka as prime minister is designed to win confidence among the
rebel groups about the government's seriousness in opening negotiations.
But most observers believe the proposals are too late to prevent the violent
disintegration of the Ethiopian nation after 14 years of strong-arm rule by
Mr Mengistu.
'Mengistu is finished. The only question is whether he will go peacefully or
be forced out in a bloodbath,' said one western diplomat.
Some observers believe the parliament's offer of open-ended, round table
talks with all opposition groups, probably outside Ethiopia, stands a slight
chance of averting the looming catastrophe, but only if Mr Mengistu resigns.
Last Friday Mr Mengistu said he would stand down if it would preserve the
unity of the country but for years he has cultivated the image of being the
only man who can prevent the break-up of the country - a view which retains
currency in some sections of the army and population.
Even if peace talks begin, fears are widespread about the real agenda of the
Tigray People's Liberation Front, the main group in the EPRDF, which, until
recently, was staunchly Stalinist and vague about its political programme
except demanding the removal of Mr Mengistu.
As rebels closed on the capital earlier this week, the US ordered the
evacuation of all non-essential embassy staff. Concern is widespread that
fighting could engulf Addis Ababa, unleashing violence after years of
pent-up desire for revenge.
Those fears have been bolstered with the recent experience of Somalia, where
the capital, Mogadishu, degenerated into an orgy of ethnic bloodletting and
anarchy as rebels neared the city seeking to extract concessions from the
government.
'The Mogadishu factor is very much in people's minds,' said one resident of
Addis Ababa.
For the moment the rebels appear wary of launching a full assault against
the capital until prospects for negotiations are resolved. But with three
provinces completely under rebel control, heavy fighting continuing on
several fronts around Addis Ababa and the secessionist Eritrean rebels
pressing their campaign against government troops in Eritrea province it
seems Ethiopia is in danger of fragmenting.
'It would take a miracle to stop Ethiopia breaking up,' said Mr Abdul
Mohamed, a leading Ethiopian political analyst. 'If Mengistu resigns
immediately and the rebels hold off attacking Addis there is a chance. But
it looks grim.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Japanese output falls again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial output fell 1.3 per cent last month, the fourth decline
in the past five months and the largest fall since July 1989, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said yesterday.
The index, against the 1985 base of 100, stood at a seasonally adjusted
127.4 in March, while the inventory index rose 0.8 per cent to 113.2, the
fifth monthly rise in succession.
At the same time, the inflation rate rose to 3.3 per cent in the financial
year to end March from 2.9 per cent in 1989. However, there was a fall in
consumer prices in Tokyo. The capital's consumer price index, a leading
indicator, rose an annual 3.3 per cent for April, down from 3.7 per cent in
March and lower than had been expected.
The Japanese government indicated yesterday it was determined to maintain a
tight monetary policy, despite suggestions from Washington that lower
interest rates would help the international economy.
Japan's Finance Ministry said US pressure would make no difference to the
country's monetary policy, which remains tight despite slower growth and
signs that inflation has begun to fall.
The Bank of Japan has been determined to cut money supply growth in an
attempt to ease pressures arising from the speculative stock and land binges
that were fuelled by easy credit in past years. The bank has also been
concerned that the labour shortage would add to inflationary pressures.
Mr Russell Jones, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the industrial production
figures were very weak, while the decline in Tokyo's inflation rate should
offer some comfort to government officials who feared a sharp increase in
service sector costs.
Japanese financial markets have expected that the Bank of Japan would lower
the Official Discount Rate (ODR) from 6 per cent, but bank officials
indicate that they want further heat removed from the economy before a rate
cut.
The central bank fears that a cut in the near future could prompt a return
to speculative stock purchases and a more general overheating of the
economy. Mr Masami Kogayu, the vice-minister of finance, said yesterday that
hints from US President George Bush about the benefits of an ODR cut would
not influence monetary policy.
US and Japanese trade officials yesterday suspended negotiations on foreign
access to Japan's semiconductor market after they failed to settle a dispute
over the wording on a market share target.
Tokyo has agreed to a target of 20 per cent for foreign chips, but does not
want the figure to set a precedent for market share targets in other areas,
and so wants vague wording. The US wants more precise wording.

FT  27 APR 91 / Ford steps up Halewood job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Britain is to step up job losses at its plant at Halewood on
Merseyside because of the decline in car sales caused by the recession.
About 900 jobs will go at Halewood this year, but the company said they
would be part of a five-year programme announced 12 months ago to reduce the
workforce by 2,800 in a long-term productivity drive.
Ms Sarah Perris, head of public affairs at Ford, Halewood, said: 'When we
announced our programme last year we could not anticipate the drop in sales
which the industry has experienced recently, just as we cannot possibly know
where we will be in three or four years' time.'
On Thursday, Ford said it was reviewing its cost structure and wanted to cut
2,500 of its salaried jobs throughout Europe over the next three years,
mainly among white-collar support staff not direct-ly employed in production
or sales and marketing.
Mr Martin Watkins, head of public affairs for Ford UK, emphasised yesterday
that the cuts were also part of a long-term cost-reduction campaign.
Ford employed more than 14,000 people at Halewood in the 1970s and the
figure is now down to about 8,500, accompanied by labour-saving,
capital-intensive manufacturing investment.
Mr Watkins said that the national 1979 workforce of 76,000 was now reduced
to 44,000. There had been no compulsory redundancies and the aim was to
continue job cuts through voluntary severance and early retirement. Recent
talks with unions had been straightforward business meetings.
He added: 'The current situation means that the focus has been somewhat
sharpened. There is no precision about our programme and details are still
being discussed.'

FT  27 APR 91 / Humble grandmother who healed the wounds of a warring
nation: Mrs Chamorro has surprised the sceptics in her first year as
president of Nicaragua
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago this week Mrs Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a humble conservative
grandmother with little political experience and believing in traditional
values of home, family and God, donned Nicaragua's presidential sash.
In a country accustomed to disasters, both natural and man-made, one more
seemed in the making. She had always shunned politics. Her previous taste of
power, as a member of the post-revolutionary junta in 1979, had brought her
to the edge of a nervous collapse - she resigned within a year, citing
ill-health.
Pushed into the political front-line on the strength of her husband's past -
the editor of La Prensa, he was assassinated by the dictatorial Samosa
regime - she was called upon to lead a fractious opposition to the polls in
1990. Defying most predictions, she beat the left-wing Sandinista party
(FSLN).
Mrs Chamorro inherited a nation bitterly divided by 10 years of civil war,
which had divided even her own family. Few believed her capable of healing
the wounds left by the 50,000 dead or of untangling the legal chaos created
by the thousands of property expropriations during the 11 years of
Sandinista government.
None the less, even her most outspoken opponents readily admit that the big
success of her first year has been to end the war. Some 20,000 Contra rebels
laid down their arms, while 75,000 government soldiers have been
demobilised.
The secret of her success has been to surround herself with close advisers
and friends, many of them drawn from her immediate family, whose pragmatic
approach has eschewed party politics. None of her senior ministers is a
member of any political party. The head of her cabinet, Mr Antonio Lacayo,
is her son-in-law.
A mild-mannered businessman, of Jesuit education, Mr Lacayo has been the
engineer of the peace. For the past year, he has patiently sat through
thousands of hours of meetings with table-banging trade unionists,
pistol-toting Contra rebels, disgruntled businessmen, spur-shod
cattle-ranchers and rough peasant farmers, all demanding more than he was
able to give. It is largely due to his negotiating tenacity that all have so
far settled for less.
A recent opinion poll showed Mr Lacayo to be the most popular politician in
the country, ahead even of the president.
Not all have been so lavish in their compliments however. Mr Virgilio Godoy,
the vice-president, is considered the chief spokesman for the right-wing
sector of the UNO alliance, which bitterly criticises the government's
pragmatism and President Chamorro's dependence upon Mr Lacayo. 'It is
(Lacayo) who chooses the ministers, and is giving the orders. He is running
the country. She is just there to legitimise what her son-in-law is doing,'
he said.
Mr Lacayo recently accused Mr Godoy of wanting to oust Mrs Chamorro from the
presidency. Mr Godoy denies this, saying he only wants to oust Mr Lacayo, to
re-establish control by the 12-party UNO alliance over the government.
'Lacayo has no political party. He shows a profound distaste towards the
parties and their leaders. He runs the government like a business rather
than a presidency,' he said.
The one party that does exert control, however, according to Mr Godoy and
his supporters, is the FSLN. They point to the government's refusal to
remove army chief General Humberto Ortega, the brother of former president
and Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega.
The moderates in UNO around Mr Lacayo, and the moderates of the FSLN, have
in effect established a coalition. The FSLN has supported the government's
'social contract' and economic plan; the UNO hardliners have not. In return
for FSLN support for economic reform, the government has postponed sweeping
military reforms.
That compromise has divided the Sandinistas. Hardliners within the party see
Mr Lacayo as someone intent on eventually breaking the remaining Sandinista
power - the army, police, and trade unions. General Ortega is being duped,
they claim.
After consolidating peace in Nicaragua, Mrs Chamorro now has to revive the
economy. And with unemployment and poverty rising that is no mean task.

FT  27 APR 91 / Treuhand seeks buyer for railway carriage maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Waggonbau, the world's largest builder of railway carriages,
has been placed on the market by the Treuhand, the east German privatisation
agency.
The Treuhand said yesterday it would be seeking buyers in Europe, the USA,
Japan and South Korea, as well as in Germany.
The company has been established from the ruins of a giant railway equipment
Kombinat but has been given about DM200m (Pounds 66.8m) for new investment
in the current year and, according to the Treuhand, could very soon be
profitable. It expects sales of about DM2bn this year, a large part from the
Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, talks over a possible lengthening of the one-year ban on sackings
in the east German engineering industry ended inconclusively yesterday. IG
Metall, the engineering union, is trying to extend the ban, which is due to
run out on July 1.
Another round of negotiations in the west German metal industry also ended
inconclusively, with the union threatening that warning strikes could begin
next week. The union is seeking a 10 per cent rise, the employers have
offered 4 per cent, and a settlement at about 7 per cent is expected.
The German dairy products group Alois Muller said yesterday it was planning
to build a plant in Britain. In 1990 the company had a turnover of DM508m
but is seeking to expand abroad. It is also building a plant in east
Germany.

FT  27 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) Arts: A Method of satire - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 4th May 1991) appended to this article.
BLACK SNOW, which opened at the National's Cottesloe Theatre on Thursday, is
the funniest and cleverest new play I have seen for a very long time. If
anyone says that you need to know something about Mikhail Bulgakov's
theatrical novel of the same name, forget it. Keith Dewhurst's dramatisation
stands in its own right. Anyone who likes the whole idea of acting and
directing should love Black Snow. For a start, William Gaskill's production
is full of wonderful performances, at least three of which are exceptional.
Bulgakov (1891-1940) was a successful Russian writer, though he ran into
problems with Stalin. He wrote his slightly bitter, but overall comic, novel
about his experience of the Moscow Arts Theatre and, in particular, of the
director, Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky. The novel was not published
in the Soviet Union, or indeed anywhere else, until 1965.
Stanislavsky was the arch proponent of the method school of acting. That is
all you need to know. Black Snow is a satire about the theatre in general -
or any institution that has become too grand to laugh at its own follies.
The Stanislavsky figure is Ivan Vassilevich, played by Robin Bailey. He is
very old, very dignified: feared rather than loved. When he enters the
theatre for a rehearsal, the cast stand up and applaud. He distorts texts to
make them fit his own idea of the character. Sometimes he has characters
written out altogether because of his own prejudices. It also emerges that
his theatre can no longer stage modern plays because modern plays are
written about young people and the founding members of the company have
grown too old to play them.
Bailey's performance is utterly commanding. We see him conducting rehearsals
and occasionally playing a role to demonstrate a point. There is an
unforgettable scene where he sends for a bicycle so that a character can
ride it round it round stage in a way that shows he is passionately in love.
This is real method and Bailey is both master and tyrant.
Other outstanding contributions come from Ron Cook as Maksudov (alias
Bulgakov), the writer, and Elizabeth Bradley as Stanislavsky's secretary.
Cook plays the part of the baffled outsider, whose drama is not performed in
the way he wishes, to perfection. There is a touch - presumably deliberate -
of Joseph K in Kafka's The Trial as he is overwhelmed by other people. He
usually has to silence his own intelligence, though sometimes he hits out:
'You can't act. If you could act, you wouldn't need a method,' he says of
one of the females.
Ms Bradley has one gem of a scene: Although hysterical a few moments
earlier, she takes down the text of the play immaculately on her typewriter
while simultaneously dealing with the telephone and the stars.
Other parts are played uniformly well. There is some marvellous business,
too, when a mad actress chases a mad cat and the cat runs up the curtains.
All theatrical bitchiness is there.
Correction (published 4th May 1991).
In my review of Black Snow at the Cottesloe in last Saturday's paper, the
role of one of the secretaries at the Moscow Arts Theatre was attributed to
Elizabeth Bradley rather than Gillian Barge. There are two secretaries in
the play, both of whom play other parts as well and both are uniformly
excellent. Apologies to Ms Bradley and Ms Barge for any confusion.

FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock rejects Major's optimism
about recovery - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLAIM by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that Britain was coming out of
its economic difficulties while other countries faced deepening problems was
disputed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in the Commons yesterday.
'I wish your optimism was well placed,' said Mr Kinnock who renewed his
charge that government policies had plunged Britain into 'deep recession'.
Mr Major stressed that inflation, having already fallen, was set to fall
'significantly further', and urged the government's critics to take account
of events since sterling's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System.
There had been five cuts in interest rates - four in the last ten weeks -
while at the same time there had been an appreciation and not a depreciation
of sterling.
Labour backbenchers shouted their disagreement when the prime minister also
asserted that Britain's trade gap was 'narrowing'.
Unperturbed, Mr Major insisted that it would be extremely difficult even for
Mr Kinnock to deny the improvements 'now coming about'.
When questioned later, government officials were unable to expand on the
factors which the prime minister had in mind, but emphasised that a turning
point in the economy presented special difficulties for those charting
future trends.
Mr Kinnock buttressed his attack by citing the view of Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton,the Governor of the Bank of England,that Britain's deep and
worsening recession was 'home grown'.
The prime minister refused to accept that the recession was 'home grown',
and pointed to the variety of causes which had caused a downturn in world
trade affecting other countries. 'We cannot be immune from those,' he said.
Mr Kinnock recalled that Mr Leigh-Pemberton had stated that while Britain
was in recession Japan and Germany 'undeniably' were not.
The Governor had also pointed out, he said, that although the economies of
other European Community countries had slowed down they were not in
recession.
Mr Kinnock maintained that the Governor's view had been borne out by the
International Monetary Fund, and urged the prime minister to take account of
concern expressed by the CBI, the Engineering Employers Federation and other
organisations.

TWO Japanese soldiers and an ex-soldier were arrested yesterday after they
tried to force their way into the office of the chief of the Defence Agency
to deliver a petition protesting against the planned despatch of
minesweepers to the Gulf.
In other protests, six car bombs exploded harmlessly outside dormitories
used by the Self-Defence Forces (the military) and a few peaceful
demonstrations were held. But generally, there was little public protest at
government's decision to send the ships on the first active service overseas
mission by the military since 1945. The flotilla was due to leave today.
At the Defence Agency, the three demonstrators, all in military uniform,
were held back by guards outside the door of the office of Mr Yukihiko
Ikeda, the agency's director general.
Witnesses said they shouted slogans condemning the despatch of minesweepers
as unconstitutional. The three, a sergeant aged 35, a 24-year-old private
and a 39-year-old former sergeant were arrested on obstruction charges.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures con-tinued to weaken yesterday as the market worried
about the depth of the recession and the prospects for an immediate
reduction in UK interest rates.
The June FT-SE 100 index closed 12 points lower at 2,502 as a fall on Wall
Street and a decline in sterling kept prices under pressure. June FT-SE
remained at a weak premium to the spot FT-SE index, indicating nervousness
in the futures market about the short-term outlook for UK shares. By the
close, June was around 20 points above the spot index, compared with fair
value of a 30-point premium.
Traded options reflected growing unease over the market's longer-term
prospects. Barclays de Zoete Wedd executed a large trade in the Euro FT-SE
index options, involving the purchase of December 2,325 puts and sale of
December 2,225 and 2,125 puts.
The Euro FT-SE options accounted for 8,773 lots of the market's overall
turnover of 28,409. Marks and Spencer was again traded actively, 1,644
contracts changing hands.
Nomura has followed other securities houses in expanding its UK and European
derivatives coverage. It has increased its derivatives team to 12 following
the appointment of Mr Chris Broadhurst, formerly of Goldman Sachs, as senior
manager in equity derivative sales.

FT  26 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Market support for ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI disclosed sharply lower first-quarter results, but still at the top end
of analysts' expectations, some of whom moved quickly to upgrade their
forecasts.
All were particularly impressed with results from what were thought to be
the trouble spots: bulk chemicals and agrochemicals. One disappointing area,
again contrary to expectations, was pharmaceuticals. Analysts blamed heavy
buying of drugs in the previous quarter ahead of price rises.
The range of forecasts for the full year is still wide. BZW, not the most
pessimistic of securities houses on ICI, lifted its profits estimate by
Pounds 20m to Pounds 770m. County NatWest, which issued a buy note on the
stock on Tuesday, reiterated its position and Pounds 850m prediction. Hoare
Govett, ICI's broker, moved from 'undervalued' to 'buy'. Hoare has written
in an Pounds 875m profit for the year.
ICI rose 18 at one point but closed just 3 better on balance at 1073p.
Turnover was a solid 1.9m shares.
Assets sale stories
The oil sector was alive with speculation that the sale of Occidental's
North Sea assets had been finalised, and that Elf Aquitaine, the French
state-owned oil group and long-time favourite to gain control of the assets,
had triumphed with a Dollars 1bn-plus bid. The story focused dealers' minds
on the 25 per cent stake that Elf holds in Enterprise Oil, and which many
expect to be placed in the market.
Enterprise is also thought to have bid for the assets, along with Atlantic
Richfield, the US oil group. Specialists said the Elf stake in Enterprise
had been overhanging the market and had depressed the exploration and
production sub-sector for many months; if it is sold it will lead to an
upward rerating. Enterprise shares dipped 5 to 554p.
Reuters erratic
Reuters' annual meeting caused the company's share price to move
erratically. Early in the presentation, Reuters management said revenue
would be flat for the year. Some analysts reported this immediately to
clients and the shares dropped below Pounds 8.
The company later said 'increasing cash balances will assist us in growing
our 1991 profits'. The implication that there would therefore be an
improvement on last year's Pounds 320m, the figure that some analysts have
forecast to be repeated this year, pushed the shares back up to within a few
pence of the previous night's close.
The shares weakened again in the last hour of trade, with marketmakers
saying that a US house had been caught with an over-long position in the
stock. Reuters ended a net 20 off at 803p after exceptionally high turnover
of 4m.
Monday's earthquake in Central America sent shares in the two big banana
importers, Geest and Fyffes, higher. Geest gained 28 to 347p and Fyffes rose
2 to 93p. UK importers are expected to benefit from higher retail prices,
while Caribbean suppliers are likely to supply from stock. Geest was also
boosted following a meeting with shareholders at brokers Cazenove.
Asda firmed a penny to 122p as it began its series of meetings with
securities houses. Brokers lowered their 1991/92 forecasts following the
meetings to Pounds 197m to Pounds 215m from Pounds 225m to Pounds 230m,
which had been expected.
There was uncertainty surrounding Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction
group, where a large placing of shares was said to have been attempted. BZW
was said to have tried to place more than 11m shares in Lilley, at a price
of 48 1/2 p, representing the holdings of a number of directors and
shareholders of Hatfield Estates, taken over by Lilley just over a year ago.
At the time of the takeover Hatfield directors agreed not to sell their
newly acquired Lilley shares for at least a year and not until Lilley's 1990
figures had been published.
Seaq turnover for Lilley was 365,000 shares, indicating that no placing had
taken place. Lilley settled 1 1/2 off at 47 1/2 p.
YJ Lovell's Pounds 30m rights issue, a two-for-five at 130p, received the
thumbs down by the market and Lovell shares dropped 33 to 145p.
MJ Gleeson advanced 17 to 805p following good results, with profits up 10
per cent at Pounds 5.05m, but Steetley was the latest building stock to
suffer from market fears that a rights issue could be forthcoming and fell
15 to 358p.
A report that UK groups were among the 26 first-tier contractors for
development of the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter project, America's next
generation of jet aircraft, sustained their respective share prices.
Details of the exact involvement should be released by the US Air Force next
week, but Dowty, 2 harder at 184p, hopes to receive a contract for Dollars
20m and Williams Holdings, also firmer at 284p, could be awarded a similar
amount. Williams was also the subject of a positive note from Smith New
Court.
Trafalgar House was bolstered by a broker's buy recommendation and settled 5
higher at 246p. The interim results are due on May 8.
With the company effectively dousing Wednesday's speculation of an impending
rights issue, ECC recouped much of that day's fall to close 10 higher at
420p. Pilkington firmed to 191p following news of a Pounds 7.4m disposal.
Fresh criticism of the fund-raising proposed by Cannon Street Investments
lowered the stock 7 more to 105p.
Vickers weakened further as fears of a sharp fall in sales of luxury cars
were confirmed by chairman Sir David Plastow. He warned at yesterday's
annual meeting that this, coupled with redundancy costs taken wholly in the
first half, would mean lower profits for the group. 'Over the full year
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is unlikely to make a significant contribution to
Vickers' earnings,' he said. Vickers dipped to 205p before ending 2 easier
at 209p.
Automotive component stocks bowed to more bad news from the motor industry.
Hard on the heels of the Volvo job losses, news of which lowered Lex Service
8 more to 189p, speculation arose of the possible temporary closure of the
Ford plants at Dagenham and Halewood. This was denied but main suppliers GKN
and Lucas Industries still lost ground, the former closing 9 down at 364p
and the latter 5 off at 156p.
Tace fell 12 to 144p following the resignation of a director and of the
company's brokers, Hoare Govett. The latter was appointed less than a month
ago ahead of an anticipated capital restructuring.
Shell strengthened to close 7 up at 527p, responding to a spate of buy
recommendations in the US. Ultramar, which has substantial Canadian
businesses, was hurt by poor results from Imperial Oil, the Canadian unit of
Exxon, and settled 10 off at 319p with some big selling orders said to have
been in the market.
British Gas eased to 248p ahead of next Tuesday's deadline for its response
to the Ofgas proposals on domestic tariffs. If Gas fails to respond, Ofgas
will send its recommendations to the Monopolies Commission.
Carlton Communications climbed 11 to 559p as Hoare Govett recommended the
stock for the long term. Analysts were impressed with the company's new
products at a television equipment exhibition in the US. The broker,
however, remained cautious in the short term, trimming this year's profits
forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 103m.
The return of rights issue talk concerning Granada left the shares 5 off at
187p.
Tour operator Airtours jumped 44 to 443p, the day after the company took a
group of analysts to the Champagne district of France for a presentation.
Sentiment was also helped by the arrival of the company as a constituent of
the FT-A All-share index - tracking funds are now likely to buy the stock.
New issue Headline Book Publishing closed at 122p, compared with a placing
price of 100p.
Lancashire &amp; London Investment Trust advanced 9 to 103p on the Pounds 8.4m
offer from fellow trust and main shareholder Anglo Scandinavian Investment
Trust.
National Home Loans reflected investor uncertainty ahead of today's interim
results with a loss of 5 at 134p.

FT  26 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reversed before the close
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market gave ground again yesterday as Wall Street continued to
stall and another round of minor rights issues from UK companies eroded the
cash reserves of the big investment institutions. Cash calls since the turn
of the year now exceed Pounds 3bn.
First-quarter trading results from ICI, the blue chip chemical group which
is widely held by institutions, brought little cheer for the market,
although the drop in profits was in line with the most optimistic forecasts
in the City of London. Weakness in sterling dealt a fresh blow to lingering
hopes for another early cut in UK base rates.
Equities opened higher after Wall Street's improvement overnight and
extended their gains very briefly to move to within six Footsie points of
the 2,500 mark in the absence of sellers. But ICI's profits figures brought
little joy across the broad range of the market and, with Sir Denys
Henderson, the ICI chairman, warning that trading could remain difficult,
the share market proved unable to sustain the gains chalked up at the
opening of trading.
With little else to look forward to, the UK market shuffled around its
overnight levels until Wall Street came in on the downside. The Dow
Industrial Average was sharply off in early trading and London quickly
showed a net fall of 8.5 on the Footsie before steadying as the loss on the
Dow was reduced to 14 points in London trading hours.
At the close the FT-SE Index stood at 2,482.1 for a loss on the day of 6.5
points. Seaq volume edged higher to 463.8m shares from the 436.7m of the
previous session but remained disappointingly low by the bull market
standards achieved only six weeks ago.
Yesterday's trading volume total included significant business in Reuters
shares, where selling was led from the US stock markets after the annual
meeting of the global electronics reporting group was told that revenues
would be flat in the months ahead.
Rights issues from a group of small companies with interests ranging from
housebuilding to the manufacture of Christmas decorations totalled only
Pounds 60m yesterday, but they maintained the pressures on institutional
cash holdings. Fund managers have already earmarked substantial funds for
the rights issues expected to fall on the equity sector over the next few
months; one manager commented that his cash flow for the next two months is
now committed.
Rights issue calls, together with the decline in daily trading volumes and
numerous placings of stock, are putting pressure on liquidity in the stock
market. There were further somewhat despairing suggestions yesterday that a
large takeover bid for a company on the FT-SE 100 list may shortly help
market liquidity by supplying fresh cash for institutional coffers; last
week's fund-raising by Hanson, regarded as the most likely bidder in the UK
market, was keenly assessed.
However, views on near-term prospects for the UK economy, depressed by
reports from this week's conference of the Institute of Directors of UK
companies, took a further blow from bearish comments from the Confederation
of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering
Employers Federation.
Equity strategists appear to be increasingly taking the view that the second
quarter of 1991 could prove unimpressive for investors, particularly when
compared to the strong performance of the first three months of the year.

FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines resist weakness
despite quarterly losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A SERIES of computerised sell programmes, including a particularly large one
in the morning which knocked almost 20 points off the leading index, left
share prices sharply lower yesterday in a market depressed by its inability
to recover from recent weakness, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 28.47 down at 2,921.04. The
broader based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.51 to 379.25, while the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks receded 2.42 to 496.03.
New York SE turnover remained on the low side, totalling 167m shares again,
with declining stocks outpacing advances by 956 to 569.
Among airline issues, Delta and UAL showed resilience to the downtrend in
spite of reporting large losses for the first quarter, which were in line
with market expectations.
Delta unveiled an operating deficit of Dollars 500.6m, against a profit of
Dollars 309m a year earlier, but the shares gained Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
71 7/8 . UAL announced an operating loss of Dollars 268.9m, compared with a
loss of Dollars 47.2m in the first quarter of 1990, and rose initially
before receding to end just a net Dollars  1/8 off at Dollars 159 1/4 .
Hopes that demand for air travel will recover as economic activity in the US
picks up has helped airline shares to perform well in spite of dreadful
quarterly earnings, and both UAL and Delta stand just below their 52-week
highs.
Compaq Computer plunged Dollars 9 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 on 6.4m shares
traded after stating that its second quarter profit for this year would
probably be below the Dollars 1.18 a share of the second quarter of 1990.
Data General displayed a more buoyant mood, advancing Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 17 7/8 on turnover of 1.6m shares. The company said yesterday that
it expected to report a Dollars 13m gain in fiscal third quarter earnings
because of the sale of a unit in Japan. In the second quarter the company
earned a profit of 60 cents a share, compared with a 29 cents a share loss a
year ago.
Wednesday's decision by an Alaskan district court judge to reject a plea
agreement between Exxon and the Justice Department over the Exxon Valdez oil
spill sent the stock sliding Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 59 1/8 . Although
Exxon has just reported a 75 per cent jump in quarterly income, the market
believes the decision exposes the company to a far bigger fine than the
Dollars 100m originally agreed with the government.
Diagnostek moved ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 20 1/4 after the company signed
a pact with the Teamsters Union to provide prescription drugs by mail.
Canada
TORONTO closed with a slightly easier bias after moderate trading. The
composite index lost 2.1 to 3,502.0, while declines edged out rises by 301
to 224. Volume came to 25.3m shares.
Mining issues fell 1.35 per cent, while golds dropped 2.35 per cent as the
bullion price lost USDollars 2 an ounce in New York.
BCE, unchanged at CDollars 40 3/4 , reported higher first-quarter earnings.
Alcan, which declined CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 24 1/2 , said over-capacity
in world aluminium inventories may force it to cut production. The company
added that if economic conditions do not improve it may have to reduce
capital spending.

FT  26 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Selling order pressures sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING weakened as a large selling order from the Middle East put further
pressure on the currency yesterday, but the reaction was probably overdone,
according to dealers, and the pound staged a partial recovery later.
It touched a low of DM2.9450 and temporarily fell to ninth from third place
in the European exchange rate mechanism before finding a floor, possibly
with the assistance of intervention by the Bank of England.
The order to sell sterling and buy Dollars 500m by the National Commercial
Bank of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia came at a particularly bad time, as sterling
was already losing ground ahead of this weekend's Washington meeting of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Traders were trying to get square ahead of the G7 meeting, and in sterling's
case this meant unwinding long positions after its recent failure to break
through DM3.00. Fears about a deepening UK recession and political
nervousness ahead of next week's local government elections in England and
Wales have unsettled the currency.
Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Union Discount, said that a few weeks ago a
selling order of this size could have been absorbed without trouble, but
yesterday was a different story.
Traders, who had already squared positions, did not want to be left with the
pounds and the order resulted in a game of 'pass the parcel', according to
Mr Parsons. He added that this should not be regarded as a crisis as far as
sterling is concerned.
The pound rallied to maintain its position as the third strongest member of
the ERM, based on figures from the European Commission. By the London close
it was just slightly easier at Dollars 1.6940 against Dollars 1.6945. It was
down to DM2.9600 from DM2.9725; to FFr9.9775 from FFr10.0175; to SFr2.4825
from SFr2.4925; and to Y233.75 from Y234.00. Sterling's index lost 0.4 to
90.8. In New York the pound ended 30 points lower at Dollars 1.6910.
The D-Mark was supported by news that the Soviet Communist party's central
committee had overwhelmingly rejected an offer by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev to
resign as leader. The German currency was little changed in the ERM but
improved against the dollar. It also rose to Y79.00 from Y78.70.
Comments by US President George Bush that he would like to see world
interest rates, including those of the US, come down tended to undermine the
dollar.
A rise in the number claiming US unemployment benefits in the week ended
April 13 did nothing to encourage hopes of an early end to the recession and
also weighed on the currency, leaving it towards the lowest levels of the
day at the London close. The market is now waiting for today's figures on
first-quarter US gross national product growth.
At the finish in London the dollar had declined to DM1.7470 from DM1.7535;
to Y138.00 from Y138.05; to SFr1.4655 from SFr1.4715; and to FFr5.8900 from
FFr5.9125.

FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Middle East selling drives gold
to a nine-month low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NERVOUS shudder went through the gold market yesterday as selling from the
same Middle East source which caused havoc in three raids on the market last
year drove down the price in London to the lowest level for nine months.
Traders said the National Commercial Bank of Jeddah sold gold on behalf of
clients in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East just ahead of the
morning price-fixing session in London.
The resulting nervousness caused the 'fix' to last longer than usual - 50
minutes - and the gold price dropped to USDollars 353 (Pounds 208.5) a troy
ounce. It recovered later because there was no follow-up selling in New York
and closed at Dollars 353.55, down almost Dollars 2.40.
While the damage caused yesterday by the Saudi selling was relatively light,
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said: 'If it was the
same Middle East source selling yesterday, the longer-term implications are
serious for the market. It will have an impact on investors who will be less
willing to get back into the market. It might also influence producers who
now might not be so willing to let the gold price rise before selling
forward.'
At the morning 'fix' on March 26 last year the National Commercial Bank of
Jeddah sold at least 50 tonnes, and possibly 100 tonnes, of gold and the
price plunged by Dollars 20 an ounce.
After the Saudis struck twice more, Mr Robert Guy, a director of N. M.
Rothschild and Sons, said the gold market had been damaged and that
'wittingly or unwittingly, the marketplace has been abused'.
The bank's London office declined yesterday to comment on whether it had
been selling gold or was involved in an earlier sale of sterling - Pounds
500m for dollars - which sent the pound reeling and was attributed by
currency dealers to Middle East sources.
Mr Smith said he had begun to believe the gold price would move up again but
yesterday's events meant he would stick to his forecast that the metal would
average Dollars 345 an ounce during the next few months.
Analysts suggested it was unlikely that gold was being sold to meet the
costs of the Gulf war. 'The Middle East is more likely to use gold as
collateral for loans than to sell it to raise capital,' said one.

attacked

A MOVE to introduce a new open-market pricing contract into scrap aluminium
trading has met opposition from scrap processors, particularly in Japan.
Japanese companies are criticising plans by the London Metal Exchange to
launch a contract for trading secondary aluminium, a low-purity metal which
is usually produced by recycling scrap. The new contract would be traded
alongside the LME's existing high-grade aluminium contract.
LME officials, who were visiting Tokyo this week, have yet to make a
decision on the plan. They are concerned about criticism from scrap
processing companies in Japan and elsewhere.
Mr David King, LME chief executive, said at a press conference yesterday
that the Japan Aluminium Refiners Association, a trade body, had expressed
opposition at a meeting on Wednesday.
The LME has often in the past run into heavy criticism from producers when
it has introduced new contracts. Producers complain that open markets, such
as the LME, create unnecessary price volatility. By contrast, metal-users
like the transparency which open markets bring.
Producers have been strongest in those metal markets where they are few  -
notably in aluminium and nickel. Companies in these areas consistently
opposed the use of LME aluminium and nickel contracts after they were
launched in the late 1970s, although they have since accepted their
popularity among consumers.
LME officials say the biggest support for a secondary aluminium contract is
in Europe - where there is a plethora of users in different countries -
followed by North America.
Opposition is strongest in Japan, not least because the buying side is
dominated by the large auto companies which are able to get good terms from
the processors without the need for an open-market contract.
The Japan Aluminium Refiners' Association told the LME that they feared the
contract would encourage speculation and breed volatility. But Mr John
Wolff, the LME chairman, said yesterday that the opportunity to hedge would
protect companies against price swings.
The Japanese side was not convinced. The often cosy relations between
producers and consumers in the Japanese market mean that scrap prices in
Japan do not swing as wildly as in Europe and North America. Japanese
processors, for the most part, would like preserve that situation.
The LME does not want to impose a new contract unilaterally on Japanese
industry, not least because the Pacific region, including Japan, accounts
for about one third of members' business.
But Japanese opposition alone is unlikely to block the launch. 'We believe
the contract would succeed without Japan but we would prefer Japan to be
involved,' Mr King said.

FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet diamond loan honoured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the turmoil in the Soviet Union, the country has been
punctilious in making loan repayments and delivering diamonds against the
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.95bn), five-year sales agreement signed last year with
De Beers' international rough (uncut) diamond cartel.
The Soviet Union, the world's second-largest diamond producer, joined the
cartel organised by De Beers, the South African mining group, last July. De
Beers loaned the country USDollars 1bn.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director close to the Soviet deal, said yesterday
that the last Dollars 150m of the loan had been drawn down in January, about
three months later than first expected. Soviet diamond stockpiles, being
held as collateral, had been transferred to the London offices of De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation (CSO).
Speaking in London after De Beers published its annual report, Mr Ralfe said
that the Soviet diamond mines were working normally in spite of the
upheavals, possibly because they were in such a remote area and because the
standard of living was relatively good.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, said he was now confident
that his group's diamond sales would this year match the Dollars 4.2bn
achieved in 1990.
In the early part of this year the rough diamond market had been dominated
by the Gulf war, which curtailed polishing activity in Israel for several
weeks and reduced trading activity everywhere. But the first three of the
CSO's monthly diamond sales were 'reasonably satisfactory, which indicates
the underlying confidence in the trade'.
The diamond industry was well-positioned to grow, he added.
De Beers' sales contract with Botswana, the world's most important rough
diamond producer in value terms, ended in December, but Mr Ogilvie Thompson
said he expected a new one would be signed in a matter of weeks. He also
expected the CSO would continue to sell all Botswana's diamonds in spite of
the calls by some politicians for up to 20 per cent to be sold
independently.

FT  26 APR 91 / Technology: A tribe of innovators - How a waste recycling
system developed by American Indians could help in the fight against
pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was developed in a dustbin in Maine by the Passamaquoddy tribe of
American Indians - but it could end by transforming the way the world burns
coal. At the very least, it should help make the US a cleaner country.
It is known as the Recovery Scrubber. But this new technology, described by
Robert Gentile, US deputy secretary for energy, as 'like using crumbs to
make a meatloaf', is simple, elegant and potentially revolutionary.
It takes waste material from a manufacturing plant, mixes it with waste
gases from the same plant, and recycles it, so that it can be used again. In
the process, it cuts waste emissions by more than 90 per cent.
The original design is intended for use in cement plants, but could
eventually be used in coal-fired power stations, where waste ash would be
used to scrub polluting gases.
'It uses a waste product to clean up the environment,' says Gentile. 'It is
so creative and innovative. And it's simple to instal. You don't have to
close your plant down to do it, it simply bolts on.'
The US department of energy liked the technology so much that it backed its
first commercial installation, at the Dragon Products Company cement plant
in Maine, with Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.5m) of the Dollars 11m total cost. The
backing was offered under the Innovative Clean Coal Technology scheme, which
awards funds to selected imaginative technologies.
Now, the Recovery Scrubber is poised to spread through the world cement
industry - where it has been described as the most significant development
in 25 years.
The scrubber not only recycles cement kiln dust - which is expensive and
hazardous to dispose of - but it cuts emissions of sulphur dioxide (one of
the gases causing acid rain) by more than 90 per cent. It also consumes
carbon dioxide, which helps cause global warming. The only waste product is
saleable potassium.
It works by mixing the dust with water to form slurry, and then combining
the mixture with waste gases from the cement kiln. The carbon dioxide in the
gas reacts with the dust in the slurry, giving reusable limestone, while the
sulphur dioxide in the gas reacts with potassium in the dust to form
potassium sulphate, which can be used as a fertiliser.
While other scrubbing systems exist, they do not have this recycling
capacity. Conventional systems introduce a new scrubbing agent, which must
be bought, and then release a sludge that has to go to landfill. 'What is
interesting is that this was developed by an Indian tribe, and it's not a
reservation concept. It's commercial, and vibrant,' says Gentile.
It is also lucrative. The Passamaquoddy Indians of Maine were once among
America's poorest people - earning a subsistence living from fishing and
farming. But through the project they have earned a commercial reputation
and the venture is being used as a case study by the Harvard Business
School. The new technology could bring them returns running into millions of
dollars.
It all began when the tribe won Dollars 40m in a land claim suit in 1980,
explains Tom Tureen, their attorney and now chairman of Passamaquoddy
Technology, the company founded to commercialise the scrubber.
After buying one of the largest commercial wild blueberry farms - from which
they now market a brand of premium ice cream - they acquired the then
loss-making Dragon wet process cement plant in Thomaston, Maine in 1983.
Shortly afterwards, they hired geochemist Garrett Morrison to help solve the
plant's problems with dust emissions. He then went on to invent the Recovery
Scrubber.
Within five years, the plant was making an annual profit of Dollars 8m. The
tribe then sold it to the Spanish cement consortium, Cementos del Norte, for
three times its original price.
With the US department of energy funding, and a further Dollars 6m from
Cementos del Norte, the tribe was able to carry out a full-scale
demonstration of the process, and has since had considerable interest from
cement companies worldwide, Tureen explains.
The technology could, he believes, be fitted to coal-fired power stations
just as it is to cement plants. 'In a coal plant with a high ash content we
would most likely use ash from the plant as an alkaline scrubber, and in the
process renovate the ash, which could then be used in cement manufacture.
You might have to add other alkaline waste, such as wood or paper waste.
'We expect there will be power plant applications where there is a high ash
content, or where alkaline waste is available, for instance in Scandinavia
because of the pulp and paper plants,' says Tureen.
But, he points out, power plants can, under the US system, win environmental
credits by investing their own money in fitting the Recovery Scrubber to
other, more suitable industrial plants. Under the credit system, as long as
a utility contributes to cutting overall emissions, it need not do so on its
own site.
'This may be more cost effective and more environmentally sound, because of
the zero discharge nature of our system. We don't convert pollution but
eliminate it, where scrubbers usually fitted to power stations add carbon
dioxide and waste that has to go to landfill.'
And at a cost of Dollars 10m-15m for most installations, the scrubber -
which also collects waste particles - is as cheap as conventional rivals.
It could, Tureen claims, play a big part in cleaning up some of the
pollution problems in the US. There is, he says, enough waste suitable to
feed the scrubber to deal with around a third of the 10m tonne per year
sulphur dioxide reduction required by US legislation introduced in 1990.

FT  26 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Batch of bad news upsets traders in German
bonds

<TEXT>
NEWS that Mr Gorbachev had offered to resign from his position as head of
the Communist party (the offer was rejected), coupled with poor German
inflation data, led to some selling of German government bonds, traders
said, although prices were virtually unchanged on the day.
The cost of living in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state,
rose 0.5 per cent in the month to mid-April, giving a year-on-year rise of
2.6 per cent.
Dealers said this was taken as a sign that nationwide inflation figures
would show a similar increase.
The lack of new federal government bond issues since the start of the year
have helped to keep yield rises in check, but dealers are increasingly
worried that there could be a new federal issue in early May which could
depress the market still further.
UK government bonds edged up, though traders said that in the absence of any
important economic data the move was probably inspired by the US market.
Attention in the gilts market is likely to focus on next week's local
elections, and traders expect to see some upward pressure on yields over the
next few days.
TRADING in Japanese government bonds was dull ahead of the Golden Week
holidays next week, although dealers warned that consumer prices index
figures released today could provide the market with some indication of
whether the Bank of Japan will ease its monetary policy.
Hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate are receding,
according to a national newspaper poll of analysts.
Roughly one-third of those polled said they expect a cut during May,
one-third between May and July, while one-third thought the cut would not
come until after August.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond was unchanged on the day in Tokyo at
6.74 per cent.
US government bond prices firmed at the short end but weakened slightly at
the long end yesterday as the market struggled to find a lead in the wake of
a successful auction of five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  3/16 at 96
1/32 , yielding 8.227 per cent, while the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100
1/8 , to carry a yield of 6.915 per cent.
Trading activity was reported to be light throughout the day.
Although the announcement of another large rise in the number claiming state
unemployment insurance perked up, the short end of the market, the injection
of fresh supply left the long bond weaker, with dealers and investors paring
positions to make room for the Dollars 9bn in notes sold at 1pm.
With Fed funds trading below the Federal Reserve's target of 6 per cent, the
Fed arranged overnight matched sales to drain liquidity from the banking
system and push up the rate.
In late trading, Fed funds had been squeezed back up to 6 per cent.

systems' products

<TEXT>
DATA GENERAL, buoyed by its first quarterly profit in five years, now aims
to re-establish itself as a leader in the field of mid-range computers,
writes Louise Kehoe. With the introduction of a new range of high
performance computers yesterday, the company claimed that it is on the way
to achieving long-term profitability.
Data General's comeback strategy is to focus on a new range of 'open
systems' products, based on industry standards, while also boosting sales of
its established proprietary products.
The new systems, launched at international events, extend the performance of
Data General's open systems product line into the realms of the mainframe
computer.
The new Aviion systems are based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
microprocessors supplied by Motorola and will process 117m instructions per
second, supporting up to 1,275 users on a network, the company said. Prices
start at Dollars 96,000.
Industry analysts predicted that the new products will significantly boost
Data General's Open Systems sales, which stood at about Dollars 100m last
year when the company had total revenues of Dollars 1.22bn.
Data General earned Dollars 12.4m in its last fiscal quarter, on revenue of
Dollars 311.7m. For it fiscal 1990, the company lost Dollars 139.8m on
revenue of Dollars 1.22bn.
Earlier this week, Data General announced the sale of its Japanese unit
Nippon Data General, to Omron of Kyoto, Japan,for about Dollars 46m. The
company expects to report a gain from the sale of Dollars 13m.

<TEXT>
WALT Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a 29 per cent
drop in second-quarter earnings, with lower operating income from all of its
main businesses, writes Karen Zagor.
Disney, which blamed the recession for its disappointing results, had net
income of Dollars 126.6m, or 95 cents a share, against Dollars 178.5m, or
Dollars 1.29, a year earlier.
Revenues grew 11 per cent to Dollars 1.44bn from Dollars 1.3bn. Operating
income in the 1991 quarter fell 26 per cent to Dollars 231.9m from Dollars
311.5m a year earlier.
For the first half of fiscal 1991, Disney's net income fell 16 per cent to
Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars 2.23 a share, from Dollars 352.9m, or Dollars
2.55, a year ago. Revenues advanced 13 per cent to Dollars 2.93bn from
Dollars 2.59bn.
Operating income in the first six months fell 13 per cent to Dollars 539.6m.
Although analysts have steadily reduced second-quarter earnings estimates
for Disney in recent months, the results were at the low end of
expectations.
During the quarter, operating income from theme parks and resorts plunged 33
per cent to Dollars 130.7m. The decline for the first six months was only 25
per cent to Dollars 269.4m.
Operating income from Disney's filmed entertainment business dropped 20 per
cent to Dollars 46.2m in the quarter in spite of a 31 per cent jump in
revenues to Dollars 613m.
The company attributed the decline in income to the poor performances of two
of its films - 'Run' and 'Scenes from a Mall'.
Operating income from consumer products fell 7 per cent to Dollars 55m on
revenues which grew 24 per cent to Dollars 154.9m.

FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: UAL and Delta Air turn in heavy
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Airlines and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers,
yesterday posted heavy losses for the first three months of 1991,
underlining the impact which the Gulf war and domestic recession has had on
the industry.
However, Chicago-based United Airlines was more cheerful about the outlook.
'We are encouraged by the recovery we currently see,' said Mr Stephen Wolf,
chairman, 'particularly in our Pacific markets where we expect May traffic
to approximate May 1990 level and June traffic to surpass last year's
levels.'
But Mr Thomas Roeck, Delta's finance director, stressed that operating
expenses continued to be 'up significantly'. This, he said, reflected the
growth in traffic and capacity in the current quarter, aircraft fleet and
facilities expansions, and 'favourable expenses trends in the prior year'.
Delta said that although the airline had been 'encouraged' by an 8 per cent
growth in traffic in the first quarter, much of this had stemmed from the
wave of fare-discounting in the first two months.
United lost Dollars 157m after tax in the three-month period, on virtually
static operating revenues of Dollars 2.22bn compared with Dollars 2.19bn in
the same period a year earlier, when the carrier reported a Dollars 36.4m
net loss.
However, its operating deficit was significantly larger, at Dollars 269m
against a loss of Dollars 47.2m last time.
The net figure was then reduced due to a number of items, including a
surplus on property asset disposals and a large tax credit.
During the quarter, revenue passenger miles fell by 2 per cent, while
capacity - measured by available seat miles - increased by almost 8 per
cent. The passenger load factor fell from 64.9 per cent in the first quarter
of 1990, to 58.9 per cent.
Delta, which ranks number three in the US industry after American Airlines
and United, saw a smaller net loss of Dollars 84.1m, compared with a profit
of Dollars 31.3m in the same period a year earlier.
Operating revenues were up from Dollars 2.12bn to Dollars 2.3bn, but the
carrier recorded an operating loss of Dollars 115.1m compared with a profit
of Dollars 48.1m last year.
Delta's load factor fell to 58.46 per cent, compared with 60.97 per cent a
year ago.
The losses reported by United and Delta follow some equally grim figures
from American Airlines last week. Overall, the US industry is reckoned to
have lost some Dollars 4bn during the last four months of 1990 and the first
three months of the current year.
With the Gulf turbulence now past and signs that the economy may be
recovering, UAL shares gained  5/8 to Dollars 160 by midday yesterday before
closing down  1/8 at Dollars 159 1/4 . Delta closed Dollars 1 1/8 higher at
Dollars 71 7/8 after touching Dollars 72 3/8 .

signs of turnround
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF BOSTON, hard-hit by the depressed New England economy, suffered
another loss in the first quarter. But the bank is showing some early signs
of a turnaround, including lower non-performing assets and loan write-offs,
as well as a cut in overhead expenses.
The first-quarter loss was Dollars 88.7m, or Dollars 1.24 a share, compared
with earnings of Dollars 43.6m, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
Net interest income tumbled to Dollars 202.4m from Dollars 302.3m,
reflecting narrower margins and lower assets. However, margins did improve
slightly compared with the final three months of 1990.
Although fee-based income was little changed from last year, total
non-interest earnings dropped to Dollars 155m from Dollars 212m. The 1990
figure included Dollars 33m from the settlement of pension obligations.
Profits fell from mezzanine financing and venture capital.
Non-interest expense rose to Dollars 345m from Dollars 326m, but would have
fallen by 4 per cent were it not for costs on foreclosed real estate and the
bank's failed bid for Bank of New England. BNE was sold earlier this week to
a consortium led by Fleet/Norstar of Rhode Island. Bank of Boston, which
will be displaced as the region's biggest bank by the enlarged
Fleet/Norstar, said it spent Dollars 16m on its abortive bid for BNE.
The bank's portfolio of commercial property, highly-leveraged transaction
and Third World loans has dropped for the past five quarters. But these
problem assets still comprised 32 per cent of the total portfolio on March
31, down from 41 per cent a year earlier.
Non-accrual assets and foreclosed property fell to Dollars 1.8bn on March 31
from almost Dollars 2bn. Net credit losses of Dollars 100m were somewhat
higher than a year earlier, but well below the Dollars 164m in the fourth
quarter of 1990.
Bank of Boston has trimmed its payroll by 11 per cent in the past year,
including a loss of 800 jobs in the latest three months.

COMPAQ Computer's stock price dropped sharply yesterday when the company
said second-quarter earnings were expected to be below those of the same
period last year, primarily because of the impact of the strengthening
dollar on overseas profits.
Compaq's share price dropped from a Wednesday close of Dollars 61 7/8 to
trade at Dollars 52 1/4 by the close yesterday in New York.
First-quarter earnings, reported yesterday, were Dollars 114m, or Dollars
1.26 a share, up 24 per cent from Dollars 9m, or Dollars 1.06, a year ago.
The earnings were at the low end of analysts' projections. First-quarter
revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 971m from Dollars 872m a year ago.
Compaq warned that second-quarter earnings would be below those of the
quarter last year when earnings were Dollars 104.3m, or Dollars 1.18 a
share, on revenues of Dollars 862m.
During the first quarter, international revenues rose 16 per cent, while US
revenues rose by 5 per cent, Compaq said. Foreign sales accounted for 59 per
cent of the company's revenues.
'The rising value of the US dollar may have an adverse effect on revenues
and profits in the second quarter,' said Mr Rod Canion, Compaq president and
chief executive.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AVIATION authorities in the US yesterday gave Trans World Airlines, the
heavily-indebted US carrier, permission to sell three of its London Heathrow
route authorities to American Airlines, the larger and stronger US carrier.
But it said TWA would be required to retain routes between three other US
cities - Baltimore, Philadelphia, and St Louis - and London. The ailing
airline, owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the US corporate raider, originally planned
to sell the six routes, plus other assets to American, for Dollars 445m in
mid-December.
Since then, the sale has proved controversial. Some observers - including
TWA's unions - have claimed that, shorn of these routes, TWA would not be a
viable operating entity in the long-term.
The picture was muddied further when Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the wealthy West
Coast investor, said he was interested in buying TWA, but only if it kept
the London routes.
Mr Samuel Skinner said it had been 'amongst the most difficult decisions'
since becoming US Transportation Secretary two years ago. He claimed that
allowing the three routes between New York, Boston and Los Angeles to pass
to American would make the carrier 'a major player in the US-UK aviation
market'. United, American's biggest domestic rival, has already won access
to Heathrow by acquiring Pan Am's London routes.
Mr Skinner added that he was 'sympathetic' to the effort by unions and
government officials to protect the future of TWA'. But he ruled that Mr
Kerkorian's proposal did not 'compel disapproval of the entire transaction'.
He also claimed Mr Kerkorian was still free to negotiate with TWA, while
American and TWA drew up a new sale contract.
Last night, Mr Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation said it 'remained committed
to a possible acquisition of TWA', although there were still 'substantial
unanswered questions regarding the status of the American/TWA contract'.
Mr Icahn suggested that that covered the sale of 'six routes or fewer than
six routes. . . for a total purchase price of Dollars 445m', while American
said the contract barred discussions between TWA and Mr Kerkorian.
American declined to clarify whether, by retaining the existing contract, it
might have to pay Dollars 445m for three routes.

JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the big US health care company, yesterday unveiled a 12
per cent improvement in underlying first-quarter net earnings and increased
its quarterly dividend by 17.6 per cent to 40 cents a share in a vote of
confidence in the strength of its consumer and pharmaceuticals businesses.
Net income for the 13 weeks ended March 31 was Dollars 418m, or Dollars 1.25
a share, on sales up 12 per cent to Dollars 3.15bn, against net earnings of
Dollars 244m, or 73 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.81bn a year
earlier.
Excluding one-time items in the 1990 quarter, net profits rose 12 per cent
from Dollars Dollars 369m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, last year.
Earnings before taxes rose 51 per cent in the 1991 first quarter to Dollars
609m from Dollars 403m.
Growth was led by Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceuticals business, which posted
a 21 per cent improvement in sales to Dollars 964m in the latest quarter.
Growth of consumer products sales was more modest, with a rise of only 4 per
cent to Dollars 1.19bn, reflecting a 5.9 per cent decline in overseas sales

A STEADY stream of rental and service fees has sheltered Xerox from the
recession's impact on sales of its more expensive copying and duplicating
products.
The Connecticut-based company yesterday reported virtually unchanged
first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 106m, orDollars
1.01 a share, against Dollars 113m, or 97 cents, a year earlier. The 1990
figures exclude a Dollars 367m loss on discontinued financing and real
estate businesses.
Total revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 4.2bn, but masked
significant differences among individual businesses. Lower sales of
electronic typewriters and large copiers were offset by a modest rise in
demand for less expensive duplicators and copiers, and fax machines.
Profits from document processing matched last year's levels, thanks mainly
to growth in income from services, rentals, supplies and financing of
equipment.
Xerox said it has a good response to its new DocuTech product line, launched
last October.
Xerox's financial services business, which includes the insurance group Crum
and Forster, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 6m from Dollars 3m,
despite a 9 per cent fall in revenues to just over Dollars 1bn.
The company said improved insurance underwriting income, helped by an
'aggressive' effort to withdraw from unprofitable business, offset lower
pre-tax capital gains.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, Europe's largest airline in terms of sales, yesterday confirmed
it was in talks about a possible co-operation deal with Sabena, the Belgian
carrier, while announcing heavy losses for 1990.
'Yes, there are currently talks, nothing more and nothing less,' said Mr
Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman.
The French company became the latest carrier to announce a heavy loss for
1990. It warned that the deficit was continuing to increase in the current
year.
Air France revealed a net FFr717.2m (Pounds 71.22m) loss for last year, its
first trading period since the merger with its two main domestic competitors
 -UTA, which flies to Asia and Africa, and Air Inter, the internal French
carrier.
Earlier this year, Sabena and British Airways revived an attempt to create a
new European airline. Last year, the Sabena World Airlines venture with BA
and KLM was wound up, mainly because of the Belgian airline's financial
problems.
Mr Pierre Godfroid, Sabena's chairman, in February described the talks as
being based on 'a very concrete proposal'. He said the plan would already
have gone ahead but for the Gulf war. But BA indicated at the time that
there was little prospect of agreement being reached soon.
Since then, the Belgian government - which owns 52 per cent of Sabena - has
approved a more than Dollars 1bn reflotation plan for the airline, to be
financed or underwritten by the state. This has lengthened the list of
potential suitors, which include SAS and Lufthansa, as well as Air France.
Air France estimated that the collapse in air travel since the Gulf crisis
had cost the group FFr3.3bn by the end of March.
The cost to Air France alone - not including its two new subsidiaries - was
FFr1bn in the first quarter of this year, it said.
'If the war is over, the crisis is not,' warned the group.

FT  26 APR 91 / All-party warning on depth ofrecession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP warning that the recession could turn out to be more severe than the
government has predicted came yesterday from an all-party committee of MPs.
The Treasury and Civil Service committee, in its report on this year's
Budget, criticises the government for being slow to respond to the economic
decline and for getting its forecasts wrong.
It also warns of the dangers of a squeeze on credit by banks forcing into
liquidation companies which, at other times, would have been viable.
The report follows several gloomy surveys of business opinion in the past
few days. These have conveyed doubts about the pace and timing of the
economic recovery, which the government hopes will start in the summer.
The recovery could be delayed, according to the committee, if the UK is
unable to continue over the next few months its recent programme of cutting
interest rates.
'We are concerned that the recovery is so heavily dependent upon a revival
in consumer confidence and consumer expenditure, which may falter if the
rising trend in unemployment continues unabated,' the report says.
The committee highlights what it calls the 'substantial' discrepancy between
the relatively bullish government forecasts at the time of the Autumn
Statement last November, and the Treasury's much bleaker set of projections
provided with the Budget last month.
The revision 'shows how slow the Treasury was to acknowledge the severity of
the forces pushing the economy into a deep recession', the report says.
It adds that the government might have been better placed to respond to the
decline had it known what was happening earlier.
Some of the failings, according to the committee, are linked to 'the
unreliability of the Treasury forecast and the fact that the margin of error
on some of the most important variables (in the projections) is
deteriorating'.
The report says the Treasury should publish full forecasts four times a
year, double the present rate.
Ministers should not modify them, but rather leave the job to officials.
In a section dealing with the causes of the recession, the report appears to
cast much of the blame on past government policies.
'Errors in the official forecast cannot be explained principally in terms of
adverse international factors, which have been relatively unimportant in
shaping the recession in the UK in comparison with tight domestic economic
conditions.'
The committee says that the retail prices index, the most widely accepted
measure of inflation, is 'becoming increasingly distorted', due to changes
in areas such as the poll tax.
It calls on the government to prepare a new index of consumer prices which
would allow a better comparison with the rest of Europe.

THE SOVIET UNION is poised to play a key role in the search for a Middle
East peace settlement, Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the country's foreign
minister said yesterday.
After four hours of talks with Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, in the
Caucasian town of Kislovodsk, Mr Bessmertnykh said Moscow would give a
'positive response' to the US proposal that it co-sponsor a Middle East
peace conference.
'The Soviet Union and the US intend to assist in the convening and holding
of a peace conference . . . We intend to act as sponsors,' he said at a news
conference.
His announcement came as the official news agency Tass reported that he
planned to visit Israel in May - a move which could lead to the renewal of
full diplomatic relations. Links were cut by Moscow during the 1967 Six Day
War.
Mr Bessmertnykh said the itinerary and exact date of his visit were being
worked out. 'Our relations with Israel are developing, and if this tendency
continues, there will be no difficulties in establishing full diplomatic
relations.'
Israeli officials, who have said that Moscow cannot take part in the
proposed conference without the restoration of full relations, said they had
received no prior notice of Mr Bessmertnykh's visit. But they said it would
be a welcome step towards restoring ties.
Moscow is understood to be ready to renew full links.
On regional peace, the Soviet minister laid out a three-stage negotiating
process:
The holding of a regional peace conference.
Separate discussions with the Palestinians - although it is not clear which
other countries would be at the talks.
A 'representative international peace conference' in which both regional and
world powers would participate.
Mr Baker, who arrived in Israel last night for his second round of talks
there in a week, said after the meeting with Mr Bessmertnykh that there was
a better chance than before of achieving a settlement in the region,
although he said that there were still 'considerable obstacles'.
Israel has made it clear from the start it does not oppose Soviet
co-sponsorship of a proposed regional peace conference. However, officials
said the government would continue to resist other features sought by Mr
Baker, who is scheduled to hold talks in Jerusalem today.
The two sides are at loggerheads over continued expansion of Jewish
settlement in the occupied territories.
Mr Bessmertnykh also predicted that a compromise on the conventional forces
in Europe treaty, signed last November but not ratified, was emerging.

FT  26 APR 91 / Ford plans 2,500 job losses in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent

<TEXT>
FORD, the US car maker, plans to cut about 2,500 jobs or 12 per cent of its
salaried workforce in Europe over the next three years.
Ford of Europe's net profits plunged by 79.6 per cent last year, to only
Dollars 263m (Pounds 156m) - from Dollars 1.29bn in 1989 and a record
Dollars 1.56bn in 1988 - its second worst result in 10 years.
Ford is under considerable pressure worldwide and is being forced to take
far-reaching measures to cut costs.
In the final quarter last year, it ran up a net loss of Dollars 519m, its
first quarterly loss for eight years.
Ford of Europe said yesterday that it was reviewing its European cost
structure. 'Salaried personnel costs must be reduced significantly, if we
are to remain competitive'.
It said that the cuts would come from 'indirect' salaried staff and would
not affect manufacturing or sales operations.
It aims to cut around 30 per cent of indirect salaried staff at a rate of
around 10 per cent a year over the next three years.
Ford of Europe has around 21,000 salaried staff with the main presence in
the UK with 9,800 and in Germany with 7,300.
Ford's workforce in Europe had already been cut from 130,500 in 1982 to
115,500 in 1989, but it rose to 126,300 last year largely through the
inclusion of Jaguar, the luxury car maker acquired at the end of 1989.
The Ford group's new car sales in Europe (including Jaguar) fell by 3.2 per
cent to 1.54m last year.
Total vehicle production (including light commercial vehicles) in Europe
fell by 4.3 per cent to 1.78m from 1.86m a year earlier.
In a meeting with UK union leaders, Ford management yesterday emphasised the
need for increased mobility and flexibility within plants and for further
erosion of restrictive practices.

FT  26 APR 91 / Down Ridley road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first time I met Mr Nicholas Ridley was at a do organised by a company's
public relations department - one of those functions that holds you up
between leaving work and getting home. This was before the 1987 election,
when he had just begun to settle in as environment secretary. His view of
local government sounded appalling.
As I remember it, we were to have fewer elected councils. Their powers would
be circumscribed; their payrolls small. These truncated councils would be
governed by feeble committees the size of an average company board. They
would meet for an afternoon once a year to decide what had to be done, but
they would not themselves provide services.
The work would be contracted out - refuse collection to one company, street
cleaning to another, housing to a housing association and so on. As we ate
and listened, our imaginations soared. The great kingdom of the councils,
with their endless meetings of committees of the retired, the civic-minded
and the disgruntled would be eliminated, wiped from the map of Britain.
Their direct labour workforces, their truculent dustmen, their unmanageable
teachers and their rows of inefficient clerks would vanish from town hall
payrolls. The public sector unions, so dependent upon the patronage of that
kingdom, would be humbled. So-long Nupe. Toodle-oo Nalgo. Bye-bye National
Union of Teachers.
Four years have passed and so has Mr Ridley, but the vision persists. If you
have given up on local democracy it sounds less appalling than it did on
first airing, particularly as espoused by Mr Michael Heseltine in the House
of Commons on Tuesday. The government was committed, said the environment
secretary, 'to developing the concept of enabling authorities. Councils will
increasingly be able to take advantage of competition between those seeking
to provide a service'. The intention was to 'increase the momentum' of
existing policies, 'to enable decision-making and responsibility to be more
directly in the hands of the people'.
You do not need an O-level in civil service-speak to understand what that
means. The open competitive tendering now obligatory under Mr Ridley's local
government act of 1988 will be extended: it is shown in one departmental
sample study to have saved 17 per cent of refuse collectors and a quarter of
the previous number of street cleaners, even where the work has remained
in-house. But that is not all.
The government will encourage the mass opting-out of secondary schools from
local authority control after the next election - assuming that it wins. Who
will oversee them? There are 4,900 secondary schools, more than could easily
be handled by a national schools funding council. Yet I suspect that before
long we will have one, from the government that gave us the university and
polytechnic funding councils We imagined the great kingdom of the councils
would be wiped out
and recently announced a new quango to look after further education and
sixth-form colleges.
As to the 24,000 primary schools, some direct local governance will always
be required - although by 1994 they will control their own budgets. The
education departments of the local authorities could then be reduced to
small agencies, with management devolved to school governors and heads. If
the central government dictated the funding, as it surely will, Mr Ridley
would be half way there.
The arithmetic tells the story. Education accounts for just 48 per cent of
local authority spending, and 37 per cent of local employees. It is managed
by county councils, the upper-level authorities that both the Conservatives
and Labour seek to abolish. What is left? Police and courts account for 16
per cent of expenditure; these are by custom usually treated as outside the
direct oversight of most councils. Transport (9 per cent) is being steadily
privatised, with more to come, and housing has either been sold off or
prepared for governance by tenants or voluntary associations. That leaves
something unfathomable called local environmental services (11.7 per cent)
and social services (10.5 per cent), plus peanuts on libraries and the like.
Mr Heseltine's vision is an improvement on Mr Ridley's. He talks up the
enabling councils of the future as important local mobilising forces, able
to make broad strategic decisions as he did on his famous visit to
Liverpool. They would bring together business, voluntary organisations,
local institutions like polytechnics and their own in-house expertise. They
still sound like Mr Ridley's stripped-down headquarters boards to me, but
they would meet more often and be taken more seriously in the Heseltine
version. His next discussion paper, probably out next month, will argue the
case for elected mayors or, alternatively, small directly-elected management
boards, or, again, sub-committees of the main elected council. The essence
is strong management, but delivery through contracts with others. The
theology is less controversial than it was. The contract culture is a theme
of the current issue of Marxism Today. The latest social policy paper from
the Labour-inclined Institute of Public Policy Research (30-32 Southampton
St, WC2E 7RA) has Bill Callaghan of the TUC asking: 'Do all public services
have to be provided by direct labour or is there a role for the private and
not-for-profit sectors?'
The Labour party has not fully woken up to this: its latest policy paper
promises fatter local government, fed by a broader tax base. Yet the slim
enabling council vision has its attractions. The flaw in the government's
version is that local finance is to be restricted to one highly-geared
source, the new council tax, and capped. That is wholly in the Ridley
spirit. While it prevails, Mr Heseltine's protestations of a belief in local
autonomy are, in the prime minister's favourite epithet, bogus.

When is a business school not a business school? When it's Ford Motor's UK
finance department, judging by a reunion at London's Savile club last night.
Guests included Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of GrandMet, Sir Colin Barker,
chairman of British Technology Group, Sir David Berryman, chairman of North
East Thames Health Authority, and Sir John Sparrow, chairman of the Horse
Race Betting &amp; Levy Board.
Along with a bevy of finance directors from companies such as GKN and
Amstrad, all began their careers under John Barber, Ford's finance director
up to 1968.
When he arrived from the civil service in 1955, Ford's finance department
was full of little men in green eye shades. Barber changed that and went on
a hiring binge. It was a period when financial analysis was in the
ascendancy and Ford became a prime training ground, much as Procter and
Gamble was for marketing.

It would be difficult for the Labour Party to lose its reputation for being
'never knowingly underlaunched.' The volume of glossy manifestos and slick
press conferences has intensified even though media-relations guru Peter
Mandelson has departed from headquarters in London's Walworth Road.
But the promotional machine is running a bit ragged. The reason is that the
general public still can't obtain the new policy document Opportunity
Britain - younger sibling of Meet the Challenge and Looking to the Future -
10 days after it was launched.
Walworth Road officers are on the defensive, but admit it is an
embarrassment. 'We had enough copies to give out to the press at the
launch,' they say. Unfortunately, it turns out, in their zeal for publicity
they handed the media every single copy there was.
However, the text is back with the printers and fresh supplies are expected
any day now. Labour hardliners will be relieved to hear that the printers
who produced the copperplate invitations to Labour's Pounds 500-a-head
dinner at the Hyde Park hotel are not implicated in the delay.

The Bank of Italy is hosting today the first of what are intended to be
biennial lectures of international renown. The Paolo Baffi Lecture on Money
and Finance has been created to com- emorate one of Italy's most illustrious
central bank governors.
Baffi's death last year recalled, among other things, his extraordinary
courage in standing up to politicians who at one time appeared ready to
consign him to prison because of the Bank's prying into the affairs of Banco
Ambrosiano. Known as the priest's bank because of its links with the
Vatican, Ambrosiano was subsequently plunged into bankruptcy by the dubious
activities of its chairman, Roberto Calvi.
Today's inaugural will be given by Professor Amartya Sen who will lecture on
ethics in economy and finance. It's a timely topic with the financial power
of the mafia growing internationally, and Italy still lacking a proper
system of law to regulate market behaviour.

Meanwhile Sir Jeremy Morse confesses that Lloyds Bank's losses on Harry
Goodman's International Leisure were the worst since the collapse of
Clarence Hatry's empire in 1929. If only more senior bankers had such past
mistakes indelibly inscribed in their memory, clearing bank shares would be
a much better investment.
Lloyds had a Pounds 2.2m exposure to Hatry, a 1920s wheeler dealer, and
ended up losing just Pounds 620,000. Lloyds' official history concludes that
at a time of buoyant stock market activity more could have been done to
determine borrowers' worth. 'Yet it is not always easy to devise procedures
that are completely foolproof against rogues, clever and cunning in their
deception.'
The sums of money lost may get bigger, but the excuses still sound the same.

</HEADLINE>

'How did you get on with the Queen, Mr President, and what did you think of
Windsor Palace?' It was the question all had been waiting for and Poland's
Lech Walesa didn't disappoint.
'Windsor is very nice. But I'd move a few things round a bit if I lived
there. The light was too far away from the bed - and the bed was so big I
could hardly find my wife.'
And the Queen? 'Ah yes, she's like a mother. Nations like England need a
mother. We need a mother too.'
Walesa is also a great admirer of another lady with near icon status in
eastern Europe: the iron lady herself, Margaret Thatcher. The two met again
yesterday, but 'far too briefly'. So he invited the ex-premier to come back
to Poland 'for a longer talk' about her vision of politics.
He was less charmed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, who was
quoted as having raised questions about the merits of debt- forgiveness.
Walesa, whose visit has been long on ceremony but shorter on substance,
recalled that while Polish workers were struggling to get rid of communism
western banks were bankrolling the ancien regimes.
'Imagine Poland is building a car. The 50 per cent debt relief agreed by the
Paris club gives us the body. The 20 per cent added by the Americans and the
10 per cent by the French is like adding wheels to the car. Anything extra
Britain can add is welcome.'

FT  26 APR 91 / Leading Article: Changing the constitution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTITUTIONAL reform is an ugly phrase. It conjures up instability and
militant minorities; and its apologists are branded as naive and out of
touch with the great majority satisfied with their governance. Yet such
fears and stereotypes are increasingly misplaced. Demands for reform of the
governmental system are growing and many are well-founded. It is time they
were treated with more respect in Westminster and Whitehall.
The publication of Mori's 'state of the nation' poll, the most extensive of
its kind for a decade, reveals deep dissatisfaction. Large majorities
believe that power is too centralised, that parliament is too weak, and that
civil liberties are inadequately protected. Support for electoral reform,
referendums, a bill of rights, an elected House of Lords and fixed-term
parliaments is accordingly strong. Barely one-third of voters are broadly
satisfied with the way they are governed, compared with 48 per cent in
strike-bound 1973.
It is not just a question of poll figures. Britain's economic and social
predicament cannot be divorced from its political structure. Historically,
that structure has served Britain well, and its strengths  - parliament
foremost among them - should be nurtured. But Victorian notions of the
unitary state, parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law are no longer
the last words on constitutional evolution. Most of our European partners
have gone well beyond them: we should learn from their experience,
particularly that of the Federal Republic of Germany, and not pretend that
Britain is a world apart, incapable of constitutional improvement.
External pressures
Yet even if the main parties keep up the pretence, external pressures will
intrude before long - three in particular.
First, the 'Scottish question' is assuming ever larger proportions. Mori
found 51 per cent of Scots supporting devolution or greater autonomy, with a
further third favouring outright independence. The Scottish constitutional
convention - which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats - is already
championing far-reaching autonomy, with a Scottish parliament to be elected
by PR. Scottish devolution in some form is just a matter of time; when it
comes, the ramifications for England will be unavoidable.
Europe is the second dimension. The extent of constitutional change already
wrought by the Community is barely appreciated in the UK, and the process
looks set to accelerate with the treaties following the two
inter-governmental conferences. And the side-effects are at least as
important: the Community, endlessly invoking regionalism and subsidiarity,
has done more than anything to give credibility to an 'independent Scotland
within Europe'.
Intractable issue
Third, the dynamics of Labour politics. The pursuit of untrammelled power at
Westminster has always lain behind Labour's conservatism on constitutional
issues. It will not survive a further election defeat, with the prospect of
another redistribution of seats in view. Encouraged by Mr Robin Cook and his
allies, the Labour leadership is already thinking the unthinkable. It may be
committed to it after the next election.
There is, of course, no stock reform package. Cool analysis should precede
firm commitment. Without doubt the most intractable issue is electoral
reform, because of its impact on the composition of the Commons, and thus of
governments.
Nonetheless, three lesser reforms have obvious merit. Fixed-term
parliaments, with provision for early dissolution should a government fall,
would reduce the election fever which currently preoccupies at least one
year in every four. Referendums on major constitutional issues, for which
there are precedents, could avoid repeats of the poll tax catastrophe. And
incorporation of the European convention of human rights into British law
would provide the basic guarantees for civil rights available in most
democratic constitutions.
For the rest, calm deliberation is preferable to crisis reform - and it
should start now.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Rail unions fail to agree response to
pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF rail unions yesterday failed to agree on whether to ballot on
industrial action or seek arbitration over a pay offer of 7 per cent from
British Rail. They will try to establish a common strategy within a week.
The executives of the RMT and Aslef rail unions will meet separately to
discuss whether to hold an industrial-action ballot of up to 95,000 BR
workers over a pay offer which BR says is final and both unions have
rejected.
Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef general secretary, said after the meeting of the
federation of rail unions that the unions' executives would discuss whether
to ballot or seek arbitration through the Railway Staffs National Tribunal.
Aslef leaders have favoured arbitration because they are negotiating with BR
on new arbitration machinery and do not want to be seen to break the
established mechanism under which all pay disputes should be resolved
through the RSNT.
The RMT is more sceptical about arbitration and some on its executive favour
an industrial action ballot to test support for strikes similar to the
campaign of industrial action in 1989.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said BR had 'cynically manipulated'
negotiations by delaying talks until the inflation rate had fallen. The
unions would consider all options to force an improvement.
The two unions will also try to reach a unified position with the TSSA
white-collar union, whose leaders will consider the BR offer next week.
The meeting in London between the RMT and Aslef came as the Union of
Communication Workers separately decided to ballot 14,500 counter and
clerical staff in the Post Office on industrial action over a 6.8 per cent
pay offer.
Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary, said he could not recommend the
'inadequate' offer.
