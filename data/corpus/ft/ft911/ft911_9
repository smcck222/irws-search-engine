FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Local Election Diary - Eden /
Trouble in paradise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL issue dominating the Eden District Council elections this year
is whether party politics are, in fact, desirable at all. Bounded by the
Lake District to the west and the Pennines to the east, the 900 square mile
Valley of Eden has long been an earthly paradise with sheep as plentiful as
ideologues are rare.
But are they any more? In the George Hotel amd the conspiratorial coffee
houses of Penrith's Devonshire Street, citizens are agog over the Cumberland
and Westmorland Herald's sensational headline: 'Eden Election Takes On a
Political Outlook.'
At issue is the revelation that of the council 37 seats an unprecedented 17
are being contested. Worse still, in Penrith itself - Eden's capital with
some 13,000 of the Valley's 47,000 population - conventional parties have
swept in to challenge a long tradition of dogma-free politics.
The outgoing council had just two non-independent councillors. Now all three
main parties have set up their stalls.
Until recently, other issues - the proposed visitors' centre (rejected), the
new pig farm (opposed) and the infamous 'Penrith Pong' emitted by an offal
processing plant - have hogged local debate.
Now, the politicians themselves are the talking point and, typically, they
blame each other.
Mr Stephen Parry, a public relations man, justifies his candidature for the
Tories on the ground that Mr Peter Hodgson is standing for Labour.
Mrs Joan Robinson, a Liberal Democrat, says that she has taken to a party
platform as she already leads the Liberal Democrats on Cumbria Council.
Despite its Clochemerle-like qualities, the issue is a serious one. While
some claim the party struggle is meaningless at local level, others say it
aids planning and spurs constructive action.
In consequence, attention has now turned to the avowedly non-political
Residents' Association that has long dominated the town.
Several citizens alleged this week that several of its nine candidates were
prominent masons. It was also claimed that council business is often
completed well away from the chamber.
An Italian P2 in Cumbria? No such allegation was made.
None the less, most critics insisted on anonymity. 'There is a concern about
the possibility that certain councillors are being dictated to by certain
organisations,' was as far as one would go.
Mr James Chambers, respected shopkeeper, mason and 25 years a councillor,
denied as 'ridiculous' any suggestion of a conspiracy, promising to fight,
fight and fight again to save the non-party politics he loves.
That said, he conceded that Eden's era of innocence appeared to be coming to
a close. As he left, his handshake was virtue itself.
******
The claims that something is rotten in the Valley of Eden owe not a little
to an historic battle between Councillor John Moffat, a bluff Independent,
and a council leader.
In 1986, Mr Moffat was ejected by the police after trying to sit in as an
observer on a working party examining council reorganisation.
Protesting at what he claimed was repeated and unnecessary secrecy , Mr
Moffat fought his rejection all the way to the Court of Appeal. He lost, at
a cost to his own pocket of Pounds 80,000.
The working party, meanwhile, came to no conclusion.
******
Ten miles away in Appleby, few dare hope that Mr Michael Heseltine's review
of local government will free them from under Penrith's jackboot.
The county town of Westmorland, officially killed off in the 1974
reorganisation, is now a reluctant part of Eden District though it jealously
preserves its 16th century Moot Hall, its mayor and its memories - lodged in
the mind of its 85-year-old historian, Mr Martin Holmes.
The meddlings of Westminster and the annual gipsy horse fair aside, not a
lot has happened in Appleby for the past few centuries, though there was a
nasty clash last year over plans to build homes on the edge of the cricket
pitch.
According to Mr Holmes, the last real political excitement came during the
Civil War when Lady Anne Clifford, a royalist benefactress, lived in the
town under the suspicious eyes of the parliamentary garrison led by one
'Harrison the Regicide.'
Lady Anne survived. But Harrison confirmed his lack of good manners by
sitting up and boxing the ears of his executioner not before but after being
disembowelled.

FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour and City capitalise on
compromise - The constructive dialogue taking place between old adversaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S spokeswoman on the Square Mile, Ms Marjorie 'Mo' Mowlam, claims:
'Up until now there has been a natural antagonism between the City and
Labour. That has now passed.
'As the European single market develops, Labour is now seen as user-friendly
 -our aim is to make the City user-friendly to the consumer throughout
Europe.'
If Ms Mowlam's upbeat reading of her party's relationship with the City owes
a little to wishful thinking, the fact that it publicly wishes to be
user-friendly to the manipulators of capital is evidence of how much the
party has changed.
Few dispute a sea-change in Labour's approach to its old enemy, nor its
desirability. With the single European market looming, Ms Mowlam and her
colleagues are aware that, in government, they will bear responsibility for
championing the interests of British financial services.
In consequence, both sides have replaced the old confrontational rhetoric
and insult swapping for something approaching a constructive dialogue.
No discussion of Labour's plans for regulating the self-regulators or
tackling insider dealing is now complete without Ms Mowlam volunteering
unsolicited praise for Sir David Walker at the Securities and Investment
Board or Mr Peter Rawlins of the Stock Exchange. Both institutions are
deemed to be 'moving in the right direction'.
Elsewhere, Labour now puts heavy emphasis on a two-way street of
consultation before legislation with the accent on the need for flexibility,
simplicity and transparency. This applies to the City's dealings with its
clients and, indeed, to a Labour government's approach to the financial
services industry.
Above all, Labour's message is that its intentions to improve consumer
protection and counter City fraud dovetail with everyone's objective of
ensuring London stays the EC's financial services capital.
'We have got to think strategically about what we want in Europe,' Ms Mowlam
says. 'At the moment we are in the lead, but, without strategic thinking, in
five or 10 years time Frankfurt will be snapping at our heels.'
One consequence of such an exercise is to recognise the small 'c'
conservatism of European consumers and act accordingly. Labour insists that
it supports the goal of wider share ownership.
But on City regulation, takeovers and SIB, it is determined to act.
Most vigorously, it argues that the 1986 Financial Services Act must be
reformed. The profusion of regulatory bodies - the Stock Exchange, the
Department of Trade and Industry and the self-regulating organisations
(SROs) - confuses Britons and foreigners alike and must be simplified.
Turning SIB into an 'executive agency' accountable to the trade and industry
secretary would allow SIB to absorb many of the DTI's investigative powers,
Ms Mowlam says.
The insider dealing team based at the stock exchange would be relocated at
SIB.
In turn, the reformed SIB would also have responsibility for a product
monitoring group to ensure financial products meet their marketing claims.
It would enforce a greater degree of disclosure - of agents' commissions or
tie-ins between insurers and banks, for example - at point of sale.
Tighter investor protection such as legislative powers to oversee company
prospectuses and share issues are also under consideration. Labour would
agree that the new functions taken over from the DTI should be funded by
central government.
The heavy costs of fraud investigations and investor compensation for
victims would be born, where feasible, by guilty parties. But already
hard-pressed SRO affiliates will continue to cover the financing of existing
responsibilities.
Those financial pressures would only hasten Ms Mowlam's other goal of
slimming down the present four SROs to two - one for wholesale and one for
retail services.
If they did not, SIB could simply 'unrecognise' its errant offspring.
This, together with simplified rules and, possibly, graduated protection
requirements distinguishing between the small investor and institutions
would reduce costs, Labour believes.
The new SIB would appoint a chief executive from outside the civil service
and maintain its own salary structure. Government would outline policy,
determine tasks and establish an advisory board. 'I want a degree of
efficiency and accountability that is missing now,' Ms Mowlam says.
Ms Mowlam claims that the so-called Tebbit Doctrine - that competition
issues alone are the only basis to halt a takeover - has already died at the
hands of Mr Peter Lilley, the present secretary of state at the DTI.
But she would go much further, giving the Takeover Panel statutory backing,
requiring the Office of Fair Trading to make a 'public interest'
recommendation and creating rights of consultation and information for
employees.
Criteria to be examined would cover everything from the effect on
employment, the local region, research and development and even the balance
of payments.
The stake level at which bids would be required is likely to drop from the
current 29.9 per cent to as little as 15 per cent.
Formal notification to the OFT would be necessary before bids go ahead.
Ms Mowlam justifies the changes as essential to level the playing field for
British companies, historically equity financed, with the complex security
that cross-shareholdings and bank support make prevalent among companies on
the Continent.
Industry is 'pig sick' of its vulnerability to predators, she says. 'I am
not opposed to takeovers, but I want them to be for the right not the wrong
reasons.'
Nonetheless, she goes on to insist that the Takeover Panel will be given a
high degree of flexibility. 'I accept the argument that it is not in
anybody's interest to create litigation battles,' she adds.
With the threat of European takeovers in mind, Ms Mowlam says Labour will
review the 40 per cent limit on building societies' borrowings from the
wholesale markets, which could make them vulnerable to continental
predators.
Taken together, Labour believes these measures combine a recognition of the
realities of the coming single European market.
By bolstering industry's defences and spring-cleaning the City's less
salubrious corners, it claims it can protect British interests and better
champion them abroad.
In the meantime, Ms Mowlam is caustic about inflexibility in the Tories'
handling of the EC's investment services directive - now under negotiation -
and its 'do nothing' response to the local government 'swaps' cases and
their damaging effect on the attitude towards London of foreign banks.
With Europe the 'headline issue' in the City, the Conservatives approach to
Brussels is to attempt to dictate their terms. Labour, she insists, will
negotiate.
If Labour wins the coming general election, the City can only hope that this
spirit of constructive compromise will be as equally generously dispensed at
home as it will be abroad.

FT  26 APR 91 / Alan Harper: Fleet Street craftsman - Obituary of a
photographer for The Financial Times
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAN HARPER, who died on Wednesday at the age of 34, was a photographer
whose approach to his profession was firmly in an established Fleet Street
tradition.
His attitude was that of a no-nonsense craftsman, interested in the best
practical picture in the circumstances, rather than as an artist temporarily
slumming.
That approach was rooted in his professional background and training. He
started his career at a small commercial photographic laboratory before
moving to the darkroom of the United Newspapers' London office. In those
days, United's newspaper interests were entirely provincial - the office
provided a photographic service to the group's newspapers, led by the
Yorkshire Post.
From the outset, Alan's aim was to be a photographer for a national daily
paper, and he moved to the Financial Times in 1981, again as a darkroom
technician.
He revealed an early ability to get the most out of every negative, and
displayed a keen interest in all aspects of the photographic craft. It was
therefore inevitable that time would bring an increasing number of
opportunities to move out of the darkroom. He became a full-time FT
photographer in 1986.
Alan joined the paper's camera team at a time when there was still
uncertainty about the proper role of photographs in the FT, partly due to
the poor reproduction of the presses at Bracken House, then close to the end
of their usefulness.
His photographic confidence and fluency grew along with that of the paper,
helped by the greatly improved reproduction of the new presses at East India
Dock, opened in 1988. As scope for imaginative photography opened up, Alan
was among the keenest of those seeking to take advantage of the new
opportunities to print and display pictures properly.
He was best known, among his colleagues, for a fascination with political
photography. A series of memorable pictures of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, as her
administration drew to a close, capture both her undiminished zest for the
fray and the photographer's equally striking determination to outstrip his
previous efforts in each successive portrait.
A second area of particular success was set-piece photography, where the
challenge was not one of pushing shoulders with rivals from other newspapers
but of thinking his way round technical obstacles. Colleagues recall a
picture of Canary Wharf taken from the British Telecom Tower (reproduced
above) as a technical achievement of the highest quality; and readers will
perhaps remember a striking photograph of the new bridge that forms the
Dartford crossing of the Thames in east London, published earlier this
month.
Colleagues describe a modest, extremely energetic man, with a mischievous
determination that kept him permanently cheerful. He leaves a wife and young
daughter; and two older daughters.

FT  26 APR 91 / Solicitors face setback in fight for wider rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE issue of whether solicitors will get wider rights to appear as advocates
in the higher courts was thrown into doubt yesterday after the committee set
up to advise the Lord Chancellor announced that it wanted to consult as
widely as possible before making recommendations.
Although the principle of wider rights of audience for solicitors is
enshrined in the Courts and Legal Services Act, Lord Griffiths - the Law
Lord who heads the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee - said the formal
application by the Law Society for extended rights of audience for
solicitors represented such a radical change in the present position that
the committee felt it was right to consult further.
The committee wants to hear from anyone who has an interest in the issue,
but will formally seek the views of judges, both branches of the legal
profession, government departments, advice agencies, consumer organisations
and professional bodies.
The Law Society said yesterday that it could not comment on the procedures
adopted by the advisory committee. In private, senior solicitors were
expressing dismay that the committee seemed intent on reopening the issue
instead of accepting the principle of extended rights of audience for
solicitors and concentrating on the merits of the society's application.
The Bar and the Law Society have been at loggerheads over rights of audience
for more than 10 years. In 1986 in an attempt to resolve matters they set up
a joint committee of barristers and solicitors under Lady Marre. The Marre
committee's report proved inconclusive, and in 1989 the government stepped
in to end the dispute.
Lord Griffiths hoped the consultation exercise would be completed by the end
of July.
The process was extremely complex, he said. Even after the committee had
considered the society's application, it still had to be approved by the
Lord Chancellor, the director general of fair trading and the four
designated judges. A veto from any one of them would 'scupper it'.
When the society submitted its formal application to the committee at the
beginning of this month, it said it hoped solicitors would be able to play a
full part in all Crown Court and High Court cases from January next year.
That now looks extremely unlikely.

FT  26 APR 91 / David Thomas: a much respected specialist writer - Obituary
of a reporter for the Financial Times
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID THOMAS, who died on Wednesday with Alan Harper, a photographer
colleague, in a car accident while on assignment for the FT in Kuwait, was
one of those writers who give journalism a good name. The FT's Natural
Resources Editor, he delighted in uncovering folly and inconsistencies, but
he achieved that with such intellectual rigour that he was respected as much
by the people he wrote about as by his colleagues and competitors.
David, who was 37, was a scholarship boy from Cwmbran, Gwent, who took a
first-class degree in social and political sciences at Cambridge university
before completing a PhD, published as Naturalism and Social Science.
Throughout his later career, which moved from the research department of
British Coal and the TUC to New Society magazine and the FT, David retained
a speculative interest in the clash of ideas and the larger truths of modern
society. However, he was also driven by an intense curiosity and appetite
for detail in his chosen fields.
At the TUC, he was thought to be one of the most brilliant researchers taken
on by the economic department in 20 years. He gained that reputation partly
because of his prodigious output, but mainly through incisiveness in
challenging the orthodox ideas of the Labour movement in the mid 1970s, for
example about introducing private capital into nationalised industries.
He brought the same spirit of iconoclasm and thoughtfulness to the FT when
he joined the labour staff in 1985. His initial anxieties that he might not
make the grade as a news reporter were quickly proved wide of the mark.
In a succession of important specialisms, he showed a predatory delight in
the chase, an ability to prise information from the tightest sources and a
sure judgment as to its true importance. Sometimes when a government
department was being difficult he would harangue an official until he got
what he needed. He was, in short, a superb reporter who saw each story as a
piece in the mosaic of policy and industrial strategy.
While covering the electronics sector, he became fascinated by the rise of
Alan Sugar's computer company, Amstrad. The result was a book, Alan Sugar,
The Amstrad Story, which won wide critical acclaim and also made the
best-seller list.
Colleagues attest that although he did not suffer foolish ideas gladly, his
demolition of opposing points of view was always done with a good-humoured
relish that kept his existing friends and made him more. Behind a rather
shy, donnish exterior, he was a witty and companionable man.
Colleagues in his department will miss him for his enthusiasm and
extraordinary capacity to collect and assemble snippets of information into
an important story.
The trade of journalism will miss a man whose abilities would have brought
distinction as an academic, a civil servant or a political activist, but
which he chose to devote to understanding industry and society, reporting
the truth and analysing why it mattered.
David lived with his partner, Jenny Rossiter.

FT  26 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Auditor denies trying to shield firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AUDITOR who advised NatWest Investment Bank over the accounting treatment
of its Blue Arrow holdings taken in the 1987 rights issue yesterday denied
to the Blue Arrow trial that his explanation of events was an attempt to
protect his firm.
Mr Paul McNamara, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, rejected a suggestion from
Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC, that, in an account to Sir Philip Wilkinson, the
NatWest deputy chairman, he had not told all he had known of the holdings.
Mr McNamara, Mr Roberts said, had told Sir Philip in April 1988 that Mr
James Riddell, County's finance director, had informed him the previous
November of the holdings taken by County, County NatWest Securities and
Phillips &amp; Drew. He had told Sir Philip that he had been given no details
about the transaction, Mr Roberts added, but he had been told the size of
the holdings. Mr McNamara denied that.
Mr Roberts was representing Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County NatWest chief
executive and one of the defendants. He suggested that Mr McNamara's account
was an attempt to 'cover the backside' of his firm, then called Ernst &amp;
Whinney. Mr McNamara rejected this, saying his firm had acted with the
'highest possible standards'.
Under cross-examination by Mr Roy Amlot, QC, for Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor
who advised County over the issue, Mr McNamara later agreed he had known the
stake held by County's corporate advisory department was worth Pounds 60m.
However, nobody at Ernst &amp; Whinney had calculated from that figure what
proportion of Blue Arrow's share capital it represented, Mr McNamara said.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the Pounds 837m issue.
The trial continues today.

FT  26 APR 91 / Lifestyle treatment to cure the nation's ills: The healing
process between government and doctors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and EMMA TUCKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT of a programme to raise health standards in Britain will
dominate discussions between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and medical
leaders at Chequers on Saturday.
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, last month announced his
intention to set specific targets for reducing the death toll from the main
killer diseases. Saturday's meeting will examine ways of achieving the
targets and encouraging healthier lifestyles.
Relations between the government and medical profession developed into
outright hostility during the battles over the government's National Health
Service reforms, which took effect this month. The atmosphere has improved
since Mr Major became prime minister, and his decision to invite leading
doctors and other health specialists to the Chequers meeting is further
evidence of that.
The proposed health targets will contribute to a World Health Organisation
international programme designed to reduce health inequalities within and
between nations by the year 2000. Initiatives are running in Wales and some
English cities, but until now there has been no overall programme.
Debates about the causes of health inequalities - which many health
promotion specialists believe are strongly linked to economic circumstances
 -have proved politically controversial in the past. There were indications
yesterday that the arguments would be revived by the government's latest
plans.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, yesterday circulated a draft of the
government's proposals and said they contained no commitment to action by
ministers to achieve the targets.
'This document barely acknowledges that people who are poor are more likely
to be in poor health, and offers not a single target to reduce the health
gap between rich and poor,' he said.
The government hopes that its NHS reforms, which have separated the
financing of health care from its provision, will encourage purchasing
health authorities to determine their populations' health priorities and
allocate resources accordingly.
Many of the lifestyle issues covered by the government's proposed health
targets are related to factors such as diet and smoking habits. Mr Michael
O'Connor, director of the Coronary Prevention Group, said the government
would be countering its own aims of improving the nation's health if it
continued to oppose EC proposals to ban cigarette advertising.
The overall health of the British population, measured in terms of mortality
rates, is improving but there are still big regional and local variations.
Health shortcomings are frequently associated with other social factors such
as poor housing and consequently economic circumstances. Although the
explanations for health variations are complex, a number of recent studies
have argued that there is a powerful link between the quality of health and
deprivation. One of them, a study of London in the 1980s, showed that death
rates among middle-aged men in the capital's inner-city boroughs were double
those of the more affluent outer districts.

FT  26 APR 91 / Most pupils opt to stay on in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of 16-year-olds is, for the first time, staying on at school or
college rather than opting for a job or government training scheme.
Last year those staying in education rose to 53 per cent from 48 per cent in
1989, according to figures on 500,000 pupils collected by local careers
officers throughout the UK. More than three quarters of 16-year-olds now
continue either in education or on Youth Training schemes, according to the
survey, issued by the Associations of County Councils and Metropolitan
Authorities.
Local education authorities said yesterday that Britain was now beginning to
compare well with other countries in the education and training of young
people.
Mr Roy Slade, who compiled and edited the report, said the figures also
contradicted the picture painted by the Prince of Wales earlier this week
when he said that only a third of 16-year-olds remained in further
education.
The trend towards staying on in the classroom in preference to getting a job
or taking up Youth Training was reported in each of 11 regions and could not
be linked solely to the recession or the rise in unemployment, the education
authorities said.
Overall, the national figures have to be seen in the context of falling
school rolls and an overall reduction of 7.5 per cent in the year group last
year. The reduction is part of longer-term demographic shifts and the
reduction in the number of school leavers which is causing many
organisations to revise their employment policies.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said the figures confirmed that more
young people were recognising the importance of continuing their education
beyond the age of 16.
'The reality which these figures, and indeed our own, show is very different
from the gloomy pictures we keep hearing about,' he said. Schools that have
opted out of local-authority control will no longer have to wait five years
before changing their status, Mr Clarke announced yesterday. He said he
would consider each application on its merits.

FT  26 APR 91 / Cambridge to establish management institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CAMBRIDGE University is to launch a management institute and its own MBA,
after a donation of Pounds 5m by Mr Simon Sainsbury of the retailing family.
The institute will open this September and expects to admit more than 150
students within three years. Mr Sainsbury said yesterday: 'Management
education and research is vital. It is a subject which has been strangely
neglected by our great universities.'
His donation follows gifts of Pounds 8m by Mr Paul Judge, former chairman of
Premier Brands, a food operation of Hillsdown Holdings, and Pounds 1.5m by
Guinness. Peat Marwick has also established a chair.
Mr John Hendry, the course director, hailed the new MBA as 'a major
innovation in management education'. It will be a three-year course, with
three terms spent in Cambridge and the remainder in the student's workplace.
The university has earmarked a central Cambridge site for the institute.
Oxford University also intends to establish an MBA programme and to expand
Templeton College, its existing management institute.
Schools that have opted out of local-authority control will no longer have
to wait five years before changing their status, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Education Secretary, announced yesterday. He said he would consider each
application on its merits.

FT  26 APR 91 / Impressionist auction will test market: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S is to sell 33 important Impressionist and Modern paintings
collected by the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty and his son Chester. They
are expected to raise at least Pounds 12m at auctions in London in June and
in New York in November.
The most important work is 'La Toilette' by Toulouse-Lautrec, showing a
woman examining her nails, which carries an estimate of Pounds 3m-plus.
Another evocative painting by the same artist, 'Le lit', a brothel scene of
a girl on a bed, is expected to make Pounds 2.5m. There are also works by
Renoir, Degas, Chagall, Henri Rousseau, Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt.
It is brave of the Trustees of the Chester Beatty Estate to offer the
collection this year. Prices for Impressionist and Modern art sank last
autumn and these will be the first important works to test the market.
A year ago the group would have been expected to make at least Pounds 25m,
and Sotheby's and the vendors obviously hope that the quality of the auction
will provide the incentive to persuade rich collectors to return.
Sotheby's also announced yesterday that it was selling Casa Batllo in
Barcelona, one of the last domestic commissions undertaken by the Catalan
architect Antoni Gaudi. Situated in the heart of the city, the eight-floor
extravaganza has the appearance of a submarine palace. Bids of above Pounds
55m are expected.
Meanwhile, in New York Sotheby's achieved an auction record of Dollars
363,000 (Pounds 214,800) for a Japanese silk scroll, 43in long, created by
Suzuki Kiitsu in 1845 and depicting the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets. That was
more than matched at Christie's, which set an auction record for a clock of
Dollars 1.5m. It was paid for an Art Deco clock modelled on an Egyptian gate
clock made by Cartier in 1927 and inspired by the revival in Egyptology
following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. It was lost for
many years and far exceeded its Dollars 150,000 top estimate.
Marilyn Monroe dominated Christie's South Kensington's auction of pop
memorabilia yesterday, with a film swimsuit selling for Pounds 13,200
against an estimate of Pounds 4,000.
Boyes, the Copenhagen auctioneer, offered toys in its first London sale. A
rare Bing clockwork car of 1906 sold for Pounds 5,062 and a model of Rudolf
Hess in uniform went to an American collector for Pounds 3,375, a record for
a single toy 'soldier'.

THE Brazilian government has won an important legal reprieve with a decision
by the Supreme Court last night to suspend regional court rulings to
liberate money seized in a national assets freeze 13 months ago, writes
Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
The freeze is seen by the government as a crucial part of its anti-inflation
programme.
Apparently heeding dire government warnings that a release of the Dollars
27bn still frozen would cause an explosion in the inflation rate, the
president of the Supreme Court said to free the money could 'damage the
government's economic policy and provoke economic chaos.'
Yesterday's ruling came in response to a government appeal against a
decision by the court in Sao Paulo.

FT  26 APR 91 / Kissinger had BNL business links: Former secretary of state
resigned from bank's advisory board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR HENRY KISSINGER who heads the international consulting firm - Kissinger
Associates - had business links with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the
Italian bank whose branch in Atlanta, Georgia made Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.3bn) in unauthorised loans to Iraq, according to Mr Henry Gonzalez, the
chairman of the US House Banking Committee.
BNL's activities in the US are at the centre of a wide-ranging congressional
inquiry into how its funds were used to buy militarily useful US technology
and equipment until as late as June 1990, a few weeks before the invasion of
Kuwait.
Mr Kissinger last night denied knowledge of the improper Iraqi loans.
The former US Secretary of State confirmed, however, that he served until
early this year as a paid member of BNL's international advisory board along
with distinguished British public figures.
Mr Kissinger resigned the BNL position on February 22, 1991 because of the
BNL Atlanta scandal. Mr Kissinger said last night: 'I didn't have any idea
of what BNL was doing in Iraq. All I know was what I read in the papers. I
resigned earlier this year because I don't want to be connected, I don't
want to be asked about this sort of question.'
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, the Texan Democrat investigating the BNL affair,
also claimed that Kissinger Associates advised US companies exporting to
Iraq, several of which were BNL-financed.
Kissinger Associates is an international consultancy with blue-chip clients
such as Midland bank, advising on political and commercial risk. Among its
early recruits were Mr Brent Scowcroft, currently President George Bush's
national Security Adviser, as well as Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, a veteran
diplomat, currently deputy US secretary of state. Both resigned on taking
office in 1989.
In a lengthy statement on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mr
Henry Gonzalez described how Mr Alan Stoga, a present Kissinger Associates
executive, met Mr Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in June 1989.
At the meeting, Mr Saddam apparently expressed interest in expanding
commercial relations with the US. 'Many Kissinger Associates clients
received US export licences for exports to Iraq. Several were also the
beneficiaries of BNL loans to Iraq,' said Mr Gonzalez.
In response, Mr Kissinger said his firm 'derived no income from Iraq'. To
his knowledge, Mr Stoga did not advise Iraq on any financial matters, but he
recalled that Mr Stoga told him that he was identified at the Saddam meeting
'as an expert on debt and could advise.'
The former US secretary of state, who has rarely spoken about his clients or
his business, said that his firm would not have interceded with the US
government to secure export licences for clients, but that 'it is possible
that somebody may have advised a client on how to get a licence.'
In his Congressional statement, Mr Gonzalez said Mr Eagleburger, who worked
for Kissinger Associates until two years ago, served on the board of
Ljubljanksa Bank (LBS), the Yugoslav bank.
He revealed that Federal Reserve investigators have found that between 1986
and August 1989 'BNL fuelled a significant amount of LBS's growth in the US
with 20 to 25 per cent of LBS's business from BNL.'
Among Mr Eagleburger's past clients was Enerjoprojeckt, a Yugoslavian
construction company that built several large projects in Iraq, Mr Gonzalez
said.
Mr Gonzalez said he wished to make clear that he was not accusing anyone of
any illegalities.

EXXON faces the prospect of a costly, lengthy and highly- publicised
criminal trial unless it agrees to raise substantially the Dollars 1.1bn
settlement it reached with the US and Alaska governments over the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
The oil company's liability for damages from the March 1989 disaster has
been reopened by a US judge's decision to reject as inadequate the Dollars
100m criminal fine which was included in the settlement. The remaining
Dollars 1bn is a settlement of civil damages.
Exxon said yesterday that 'while we are carefully considering the
implications of the judge's decision, we are continuing our preparation for
trial.'
The company has 30 days to decide whether to withdraw its guilty pleas to
four violations of environmental law, and thereby face a criminal trial.
Judge Russel Holland indicated that he would treat the case as a priority.
The federal justice department warned that the rejection of the criminal
fine also threatens the Dollars 1bn civil settlement.
Ms Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, a
Washington-based conservation group, predicted that Exxon would return to
the bargaining table on the criminal settlement, but that the justice
department and the Alaska state government might also seek higher civil
damages.

FT  26 APR 91 / World Trade News: Fast-track train runs off the rails - What
began as a petition has turned into a key political battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO widely divergent visions of free trade with Mexico expressed in the
italic paragraphs accompanying this article capture the polarities of the
mounting debate over President George Bush's request for a two-year
extension of his 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority. What was a pro
forma petition by a president to a Congress has turned into a key political
battle.
Congress has until June 1 to make up its mind whether to promise - as it
does when it grants fast-track authority - not to amend any trade pact
negotiated by the President. The same authority is needed for continued
talks under the stalled Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now that is being jeopardised by
President Bush's more controversial plans for free trade with America's
southern neighbour.
Opposed to the Nafta are the labour unions, textile and apparel
manufacturers, farmers, consumer and liberal church groups. In support are
hundreds of business leaders who see benefits in access to cheaper labour
and a more lucrative market for US products.
Both sides have mobilised for the battle. President Bush, with his entire
trade policy at stake, has reverted to street-fighter mode reminiscent of
his presidential campaign. His opponents are dismissed as heavily-financed
'fear-mongers' who practise 'defeatism'. His lieutenants in the cabinet are
being deployed en masse to congressional hearings to reiterate the
Administration line.
The Administration is arguing that the Nafta is a building block, not only
to a hemispheric-wide free-trade region, but to the President's vision of a
'New World Order'. Mr Robert Zoellick, the State Department counsellor, says
it sends a signal of encouragement to new Latin American leaders committed
to democracy and market economics.
Most of those opposed to the fast-track facility insist they are not so much
against increased trade with Mexico, even free trade eventually, as they are
the fast-track procedure itself. They want to slow the process, bringing the
continent's three economies more in line as well as their regulatory and
political systems.
Mr Mark Anderson, the AFL-CIO representative spearheading labour's fight
against the fast-track, contends that the negotiations are not so much about
jobs as investment in Mexico, when investment is vitally needed in the US.
If the Administration wants to help Mexico, he says, it should be providing
more debt relief and foreign assistance.
Dr Adolpho Aguilar, a visiting professor from Mexico at the American
University in Washington, is another opponent of the Nafta. He has warned
congressmen against the promise by Mexican leaders of new environmental and
job safety laws.
'Mexico is not a country where there is rule of law,' he says. 'Every
Mexican citizen knows how to get things done in spite of laws. The Congress
and the judicial system are controlled by a king who serves for six years
and chooses his own successor.'
Thus far, there is little sign of a consensus emerging and observers say a
congressional vote would be too close to call at this stage.
Compromise plans have found their way into the debate through Senator Donald
Riegle and Congressman Sander Levin, both from Michigan, where the motor
companies want the fast-track and unions oppose it. They propose to grant
the fast-track for the Uruguay Round but allow a limited number of
amendments to the Nafta. These would ensure congressional control over
issues of most concern: environment, rules of origin, health and safety
standards and dispute-settlement mechanisms - issues opponents do not
believe they can trust the Administration to address.
The Nafta would cause a mass exodus of low-skilled US manufacturing jobs and
a deluge of exports (including food tainted by polluted waters and
unregulated pesticides) to the US produced by exploited Mexican workers.
Real wages in both countries would decline. Mexican peasants, unable to
compete with mechanised American farms, would be thrown off their lands.
Meanwhile, the US would have given approval to one-party rule in Mexico
The proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) would provide
untold economic benefits, bringing trade and wealth to the entire continent.
It would raise Mexican living standards and 'lock in' recent Mexican free
market reforms. The only injury would be to a few US sectors, which would
have several years to 'adjust' and probably should not survive in any case
because superior American workers should be doing only high-skill jobs

FT  26 APR 91 / Kurds gamble on a Saddam promise: Few share Kurdish
enthusiasm for autonomy pact with Baghdad regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE leader Saddam Hussein is our supreme ideal in practising democracy,'
trumpeted one of the slogans plastered over the walls of polling stations
during the 1989 local election in Iraqi Kurdistan.
At the time, Kurdish residents of Iraqi towns like Suleimaniya - and Kurdish
guerrilla leaders in exile - described the government-sponsored elections as
a sham and scoffed at the idea of the ruthless President Saddam having any
interest in democracy or Kurdish rights.
Today, it seems, Kurdish politicians have changed their minds and are
prepared to take him at his word.
But the brief announcement on Wednesday by Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, that he and other Kurdish representatives had
reached agreement in principle with Mr Saddam on the establishment of
autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan leaves many questions unanswered.
It is easy to understand why each side should want to negotiate. Iraq's
ruling Ba'ath Party has seen its legitimacy undermined and its army weakened
by the hopeless war for Kuwait and the subsequent uprisings in Kurdistan and
the predominantly-Shia Moslem towns of the south; as for the Kurdish
guerrillas, their continued military presence in the mountains is rendered
politically pointless unless the mass exodus into Iran and Turkey of the
Kurds who make up their constituency can be reversed.
Mr Talabani and the Iraqi government say their proposed agreement is based
on the lapsed 1970 autonomy deal which recognised the Kurdish language and
cultural identity, provided for Kurdish representation in government and
called for the economic development of Kurdistan.
Many Kurds, however - not to mention those non-Kurds who have espoused the
Kurdish cause in recent weeks - are profoundly sceptical about the value of
promises made by President Saddam.
Mr Talabani and his allies believe concessions can be squeezed now from the
weakened Iraqi leader and gains preserved by means of international
guarantees.
Yet it is difficult to see the United Nations or any of its members agreeing
to enforce a purely domestic political arrangement. Nor has it escaped the
notice of those who distrust Mr Saddam that one of his main objections to
the proposed deal is the request for outside guarantors.
When pressed on the matter, Mr Talabani told a news conference in Baghdad:
'We think that democracy will be the main guarantee of the national Kurdish
objective.' Kurdish autonomy, in other words, is supposed to be preserved by
the presence of a democratically-elected and partly Kurdish government in
Baghdad.
The regime has certainly been talking a great deal about the need for
democracy and reforms since the end of the war, and President Saddam has
taken a back seat, in public at least, to Mr Saadoun Hammadi, the new prime
minister.
But even those who sympathise with the Iraqi Ba'ath Party in its present
predicament find it hard to swallow the suggestion that President Saddam and
his colleagues are about to steer Iraq towards genuine democracy after three
decades of increasingly brutal oppression.
Yesterday, with remarkable frankness, Mr Hammadi said that Iraqi steps
towards democracy would be gradual and might not meet the immediate
expectations of other countries.
One of the reasons for the breakdown of the 1970 agreement within a matter
of years was the central government's reluctance to carry out a census in
the Kirkuk area which would doubtless have shown a Kurdish majority.
Since then the authorities have 'Arabised' Kirkuk by transporting families
from the south, to such an extent that even Kurds believe that the Kurdish
inhabitants must be a minority of the population. Mr Talabani said the two
sides would discuss the matter of Kirkuk at a later stage.
Lastly, there is the probability that a deal between the Kurds and President
Saddam will demolish the flimsy, 17-party anti-Saddam coalition which
finally emerged after the Kuwait invasion.
The Kurdish political parties are now trying to set their agreement in
concrete while President Saddam is willing to talk, but anxious Kurdish
refugees and cautious western governments could hardly be blamed for
declaring yesterday that they would wait and see.

'empty' policies of anti-crisis plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Nikolai Petrakov, former economic adviser to President Mikhail
Gorbachev, has emerged as the foremost public critic of the Soviet
government's latest anti-crisis plan.
His analysis savages the programme, describing it as an ill-thought-out
series of measures without a political base.
The leading Soviet economist, who quit his Kremlin job in January because of
the government's disastrous economic policy, says in a critique of the new
plan - completed on Monday and thus before the Gorbachev-Yeltsin accord was
announced - that 'its phraseology is modern and progressive, while its
content amounts to tough administrative measures'.
On the one hand, the programme adopted by the Soviet parliament on Tuesday
sets out essential principles for switching to a market economy: a cut in
state spending, price liberalisation, privatisation and de-monopolisation.
But on the whole, there is 'no clear mechanism' for the successful
implementation of these measures, Prof Petrakov writes.
Prof Petrakov's criticisms, though trenchant, are still taken seriously in
the Kremlin - and some of them may yet modify the still-developing
government plan. The suggestions yesterday that Mr Valentin Pavlov, the
prime minister, was prepared to form some sort of coalition government,
could also mean the adoption of some of the radicals' ideas.
Although the recent joint declaration between President Gorbachev and Mr
Boris Yeltsin may help provide the political support Prof Petrakov cited as
a prerequisite for necessary reform, the programme still suffers from a
number of contradictions.
While calling for 'emergency budgets' to tackle runaway spending, the
government plan does not spell out areas where cuts can be made, apart from
calling for a moratorium on new spending. The 13-page analysis by Prof
Petrakov says an inventory of traditional expenditure would offer a real
chance of 'finding reserves' for budget cuts.
He and other proponents of radical economic reform have consistently singled
out the military-industrial complex as an important source of inflation
because of the money printed to support it.
'Without a sharp decrease and redistribution of resources devoted to the
military industrial complex, structural readjustment and anti-inflationary
measures are in general impossible,' says Prof Petrakov. He believes that
this sector accounts for at least 15-18 per cent of GNP, compared to the
official figure of 6.4 per cent.
As for the government's plan to liberalise prices by October 1992, he said
this would cause galloping inflation in the absence of resolute measures to
break up and privatise state monopolies and overcome severe shortages.
To deal with shortages, the government proposes tax incentives for
enterprises to produce more food and consumer goods, as well as the
privatisation of two-thirds of small businesses by the end of next year.
While proclaiming the need to take medium and large-scale enterprises out of
state hands (without a specific time-scale), Prof Petrakov says the state is
leaving itself ample room to interfere, both with the running of
enterprises, and their privatisation.
He says that new bodies foreseen to handle privatisation must be made
completely independent of the government.

FT  26 APR 91 / Public spending faces squeeze: Budget targets threatened by
rise in jobless and high pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of the Treasury's Pounds 3bn public spending contingency
reserve has been wiped out within just three weeks of the start of the
current financial year because of rising unemployment and high public sector
pay deals.
The trend has prompted warnings in Whitehall that the depth of the recession
threatens a significant overshoot in the Pounds 8bn government deficit
forecast by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his March Budget.
The economy continued to dominate Westminster yesterday with Mr Neil
Kinnock, the Labour leader, citing a report by an all-party committee of MPs
which accused the government of reacting too slowly to the recession.
'Britain's condition is very directly a result of your policies,' he told Mr
John Major, the prime minister. 'Why don't you accept responsibility or,
better still, take action to reverse this recession?'
Mr Major insisted that falling inflation and interest rates signalled an
early recovery, but it is acknowledged privately that the government may be
dogged in the immediate future by rising unemployment totals.
Senior ministers are concerned that key public spending programmes, notably
health and education, face a financial squeeze just as the government is
pledging an improvement in services in the run-up to the general election.
The Treasury has signalled the start of negotiations covering next year's
spending with a lengthy warning to every Whitehall department that it will
be seeking considerable savings elsewhere to offset the cost of higher
unemployment.
The Pounds 205bn spending target for the 1991-92 financial year, which
started on April 1, includes a Pounds 3bn reserve for unforeseen
expenditure. But unemployment is already more than 300,000 higher than the
1.75m assumed when the target was set. Even if there were no further
increase, the cost to the reserve in higher unemployment and other benefits
is about Pounds 1bn.
Another Pounds 320m of the reserve has been set aside to meet the cost of
higher-than-expected deals in the health service and the armed forces. Pay
deals in other areas of the public sector have been averaging 8 per cent,
well above assumptions.
The Treasury has acknowledged that its decision to raise child benefit will
cost Pounds 220m from the reserve, while the Department of Employment has
been allocated an extra Pounds 120m for training.
Ironically, the Budget decision to raise VAT to 17.5 per cent will cost
Whitehall departments some Pounds 450m. Mr William Waldegrave, the health
secretary, has secured agreement from the Treasury that the extra burden on
the NHS will be met from the reserve.
Overall, the demands mean that half of the reserve has been spent, and about
two-thirds of the Pounds 3bn which was notionally available three weeks ago
has been pre-empted. Another rise in unemployment could account for the
rest, since even the more optimistic forecasts point to a further 250,000
increase this year.
The outlook for next year - for which spending departments will submit their
bids by mid-May - is similarly bleak. In theory the Treasury has a Pounds
7bn reserve for 1992-93, but the increases this year will pre-empt half of
that.
Inflation will be sharply lower by next year, but that assumption is built
into budgets for 1992-93. The allocations for the NHS and education, in
particular, allow for only minimal real growth next year, suggesting the two
departments will seek several billion pounds more from the Treasury.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, is expected to
need at least Pounds 1.5bn in extra grants for local authorities to cushion
the impact of the poll tax in what he has promised will be its final year.
The new demands could wipe out the scope for tax cuts and force the Treasury
to revise upwards what many in the City see as an over-optimistic view of
the likely trend in public borrowing.

<TEXT>
THE Soviet Prime Minister said yesterday he was prepared to include in his
government representatives of 'other movements' in an effort to 'broaden its
social base'. The offer by Mr Valentin Pavlov at a plenary session of the
the Communist Party central committee remained vague, but appeared to
continue the momentum towards compromise in the Soviet Union.
This movement began with an agreement to establish order and end the strikes
which was signed by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet President, Mr Boris
Yeltsin, who heads the Russian Federation, and eight other Republican
leaders. It received a further boost last night when Mr Alexander Dzasokhov,
a Central Committee secretary, told a press conference after the two day
plenary session that the Communist Party was in favour of a government which
'integrated into it representatives of the republics - so that new figures
appear in the government'.
He said the party's ruling body had expressed 'great satisfaction' at Mr
Pavlov's statement, and that it was prepared for a 'widening of power'.
At the same plenum, Mr Gorbachev made an emotional if ritual offer of
resignation as Party general secretary after a trial by criticism from a
number of conservative Central Committee members. The offer, like his others
over the past two years, was immediately and heavily turned down by the
party politburo.
Mr Gorbachev has made full play of Tuesday's agreement with the republican
leaders, arguing that it opened up a new period of reform. However, it
appeared to have no immediate effect yesterday, as strikes continued in the
main coalfields and in Belorussia.
A token one-hour strike at the end of the working day, called by the
democratic Russia movement and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions,
is to go ahead today.
Strikers in Minsk, the Belorussian capital, met in the city centre to demand
an emergency session of the republic's Supreme Soviet - a demand which has
so far been refused. Demonstrators in the city of Orsha were reported to be
still blocking the town's railway station and threatening to block the
transit of imports from the west.
In Leningrad, metro construction workers and workers at the Kirov plant both
threatened strike action - while the Soviet air traffic controllers have
threatened strikes from May 21 if their demands for a tripling of their pay,
together with part payment in hard currency, are not met.
Mr Yeltsin defended his agreement with Mr Gorbachev before the Russian
parliament yesterday, saying it was a 'great victory'. The statement
recognised the sovereignty of the nine republics signing the statement, and
the right of the six which do not wish to sign a new union treaty to leave
the union. However his supporters, and strike leaders, expressed doubt and
surprise over the agreement.
Mr Lev Ponomaryov, a co-chairman of Democratic Russia, said that 'there are
phrases in the agreement I dislike very much', instancing the call for an
end to strikes. However, he also said that the agreement to hold elections
for the Supreme Soviet by the end of the year was 'to a certain extent a
fulfillment of the political demands of the miners'.

STERLING came under selling pressure early yesterday as investors took

A big sell order from the Middle East and growing concern that the UK
recession is lengthening conspired to push the pound briefly from third to
ninth place in the European exchange rate mechanism grid.
Up to yesterday, the pound had been resilient in the face of the dollar's
surge on the foreign exchanges. The pronounced weakness of the D-Mark
enabled sterling to hold its position in the ERM.
In the latest session in London, however, the pound was driven to a low of
DM2.9488 - against its previous close of DM2.9725 - before finishing 1.25
pfennigs off on the day at DM2.96, back in its place as third strongest
currency in the ERM. It closed almost unchanged against the dollar at
Dollars 1.694. Later in New York, it closed at Dollars 1.691 and DM2.9575.
Rumours that the Bank of England had stepped in to support the pound were
treated with scepticism by traders.
Mr Paul Chertkow, currency strategist at Citibank, the US bank, said the
pound had mainly suffered as a result of technical profit-taking yesterday.
But growing evidence that the UK economic recovery would not come as soon or
be as strong as forecast also undermined the pound.
This week's claim by the director general of the Confederation of British
Industry that some parts of UK manufacturing were in 'slump' came after the
government had announced record rises in unemployment and large falls in
industrial output. The news prompted renewed calls for lower interest rates
to stimulate the economy.
However, the government has said there must be a 'pause' in its efforts to
lower borrowing costs to allow sterling to settle down after the bank base
rate had been cut to 12 per cent from 14 per cent in mid-February.
A political risk has also attached to sterling ahead of the May 2 local
elections. Should the Conservative Party do badly, traders expect sterling
to fall below its DM2.95 central ERM rate.

FT  26 APR 91 / Iraqi forces quit 'haven' after western ultimatum

IRAQ began pulling its forces out of the Zakho area yesterday, hours after
the US, Britain and France had told Baghdad through the United Nations to
withdraw hundreds of armed police 'early this weekend' or face the threat of
force.
All its forces except for 50 policemen had been removed from the northern
Iraqi town 'to the satisfaction' of all parties, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari,
Iraq's UN ambassador, said in New York. President George Bush called the
withdrawal announcement 'encouraging'. It was vital that they left the area.
The ambassador's statement came as soldiers and journalists witnessed
hundreds of armed police piling into buses and armed personnel carriers and
leaving the town. Zakho is due to become a centre for the Kurdish refugees.
It was unclear how many Iraqi soldiers or policeman, if any, remained in
other areas in northern Iraq close to where the allies are trying to set up
additional relief camps.
The withdrawal from Zakho began after Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House
spokesman, said that Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador, had delivered a
demarche, or diplomatic note, to Mr al-Anbari on Wednesday night.
The action was taken after consultation among the allies to avoid any
'accidents' or armed confrontations and to encourage Iraqi Kurds to return
from the mountains to the refugee camps being built and secured by the
allies.
'An atmosphere of security is essential to facilitating the relief
operation,' Mr Fitzwater said. 'The presence of Iraqi security forces goes
counter to conveying such an atmosphere.'
He said there had been indications that the Iraqis were prepared to yield to
the order.
On Wednesday night British commandos were involved in a confrontation with
Iraqi policemen in Zakho who tried to drag away a Kurd injured in a car
crash.
About 2,300 US, British, French and Dutch troops have moved into northern
Iraq after ordering Baghdad to remove two Iraqi army battalions from the
frontier town. Baghdad complained about the order, eventually complied and
then sent armed police - reportedly secret police - instead.
Mr Fitzwater said the zone to be cleared of the 'intimidating presence'
stretched for several miles around Zakho. In terms reminiscent of the days
after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he said the allies were prepared to
'take whatever steps are necessary' to ensure the safety of the area.
Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, said later: 'We've got sufficient
forces in the area so there is no question but that we would prevail.'
The US, British and French ambassadors at the UN also presented a number of
other demands to Mr al-Anbari relating to the Gulf war.
A US official said the demands referred to what the west regards as Iraq's
failure to give a full list of its arsenal of weapons, to Kuwaiti complaints
about Iraq's continued detention of Kuwaiti citizens and property, and to
lack of progress on demarcating the Iraq-Kuwait border.
Allied troops have selected two temporary refugee sites, one just outside
Zakho and one 15km east of al-Amadiyah. Both Iraq and the allies want the UN
to take control of the camps, but UN officials say they do not have the
facilities to do so immediately.
West European governments have decided to strengthen their co-ordination of
aid for the Kurds.
The decision, which was taken at a meeting of the nine-member Western
European Union defence grouping and which follows the recent European
Community decision to delegate humanitarian aid through WEU, will be
implemented at weekly meetings of military staff officers from the WEU
capitals.
All nine member governments are making some contribution to the refugee
relief effort, providing men, transport aircraft or helicopters.
Western governments, meanwhile, have reacted with caution to the agreement
in principle between Kurdish rebel leaders and President Saddam Hussein on
autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan.
In Baghdad Mr Saadoun Hammadi, the Iraqi prime minister, said the aim of the
talks was to find 'an objective patriotic solution to the autonomous
region'.
He said Iraq was conducting the Kurdish dialogue 'with sincerity and good
intentions' and was prepared to 'open a new page, a new chapter' in foreign
relations. Mr Jalal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, said the talks would resume after President Saddam Hussein's 54th
birthday on Sunday. Emma Tucker adds: Mr John Major said he was sceptical of
much of the reported agreement on autonomy and democracy reached by Kurdish
leaders and President Saddam on Wednesday.
'I imagine there would be a considerable degree of reservation among many of
the Kurds as to precisely how this would operate,' he said in an interview
with the World Service to be broadcast tonight.
He said it was too early to say whether the agreement would bring forward
the date when British troops could leave northern Iraq.

FT  26 APR 91 / Two FT journalists die in Kuwait car blaze
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Financial Times journalists, David Thomas, Natural Resources Editor, and
Alan Harper, staff photographer, died on Wednesday when their car was
engulfed by flames in the southern oilfields of Kuwait.
Three other people, believed to be oilfield workers travelling in two
trucks, also died in the incident. There were no witnesses.
The road from the Burgan oilfields north to Al-Ahmadi is a public highway.
It runs through some of the most fiercely blazing oil wells lit by
retreating Iraqi troops in late February.
At the point where the accident occurred the fires are particularly close to
the road. Pools of oil regularly form near the road, sometimes creating
slicks on the highway.
The two journalists were part of an FT team working in Kuwait on a major
project for the newspaper, covering the reconstruction of the country after
the Iraqi invasion.
Richard Lambert, the Editor, said: 'David and Alan represented the best
qualities of the FT - they were full of integrity, commitment and flair.
This is a terrible loss for their families and friends, and for the
newspaper.'

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (40): A new channel
for grievances - Pensions / But the Ombudsman's influence does have limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES and their dependents, who have a grievance about their pensions or
other benefits from their company pension scheme, can now have their
complaint investigated by the Pensions Ombudsman, Michael Platt.
He opened his doors for business at the beginning of this month, operating
from an office* in London.
The Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), under the guidance of its
founder, Margaret Grainger, has provided a very successful voluntary
complaints service for the past seven years. But it had no legal teeth, and
had to rely on tact and persuasion.
If this failed, the only recourse open to a person with a pension grievance,
and who could get no redress from a company scheme or an employer, was
through the courts - a time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive
exercise. The Pension Ombudsman, set up under the 1990 Social Security Act,
provides a free, user-friendly service. He has wide statutory powers to
investigate and settle disputes.
The government's original intention was that the ombudsman would handle all
complaints relating to private-sector pensions, including personal pensions;
but subsequent regulations have required it to draw back from this
all-embracing concept. Nevertheless, he still has very wide powers. He can
adjudicate on complaints about injustice caused by maladministration, and in
a dispute of fact or law.
A clearer idea of how Mr Platt is developing his role will emerge when he
makes his first annual report. Nevertheless, any individual with a grievance
over pensions should not stop to consider whether or not it falls within the
Ombudsman's reference, but contact the bureau.
The ombudsman cannot usurp the functions of the trustees in exercising their
discretions, such as the payment of a death-in-service benefit; but he can
ensure that the trustees have operated within the rules of the scheme, and
that they have taken all relevant facts into consideration.
Again, the ombudsman cannot directly overrule the scheme actuary in the
calculation of transfer values. But he can ensure that the actuary has
conformed to the professional guidelines in making the calculation, and that
the basic details, such as length of service, are correct.
The ombudsman has adopted the policy long followed by Opas, that no one
making a complaint will get a purely negative response. If he cannot deal
with the complaint, then advice and guidance will be given as to whether
another complaints body might handle it; or, failing that, the complainant
may be given an explanation of his situation. For the ombudsman has
incorporated Opas into his operations, to handle the advisory and
conciliatory aspects of the service.
The stages of handling a complaint are:
1, The complainant must first raise the matter with the trustees or managers
of the scheme.
2, If he or she fails to get satisfaction, then he should contact Opas for
help. If the complainant contacts Opas without having first raised the
matter with the trustees or managers, Opas would tell him to do so, though
would also give guidance on who to approach and how to raise the matter.
This service is useful to a person who has a complaint or enquiry about
benefits from a previous employer's scheme with whom he has had no dealings
for some time.
3, Opas, through its countrywide team of voluntary advisers, would examine
and investigate the complaint. Most of the complaints so far received by
Opas arose through misunderstanding on the part of the complainant, or
maladministration by the scheme, and can be resolved by explanation or
negotiation. The complainant can go direct to the ombudsman, but the
ombudsman will encourage him to go to Opas first.
4, Where Opas is not able to resolve the complaint, either through
unwillingness on the part of the scheme trustees or the complainant, or
because adjudication is required, then the Ombudsman will investigate the
complaint. He has the statutory powers to require schemes to produce
documents, explain their attitudes and decisions and attend hearings. He can
seek the guidance of the courts on points of law.
Above all, his decision is binding on both the scheme and the complainant,
subject to appeal on a point of law.
Michael Platt hopes it will be possible to handle most cases by letter. But
where necessary, he will have personal hearings, either separately with both
parties, or jointly with both present. Complaints must be made within three
years of the matter's arising, though this can be extended if the facts were
not known within the time, or if it was not practicable to complain within
the time-limit.
The ombudsman can deal only with individual complaints; so where there is a
general complaint, such as occurred recently with the pensioners in the
Imperial Tobacco pension scheme, a person must be selected to make a
test-case complaint. Complainants can be legally represented, and the
Ombudsman has the power to award costs. But since this is not a tribunal, a
complainant cannot apply for legal aid.
*The address of both the Pensions Ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions
Advisory Service is 11, Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB. But there are
separate telephone numbers: the Ombudsman is 071 834-9144, and Opas 071
233-8080.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (39): The middle
class looks beyond manana - Other people's money / Democracy has changed
Spanish people's attitudes towards savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUAN JOSE Suarez, a 43-year-old journalist and broadcaster in Madrid has,
for a Spaniard, an almost unique problem. 'I am over-insured,' he complains.
'I have policies with Mapfre, with Winterthur, with Barclays Bank, with New
York Life.'
He also has two mortgages, a new car, three children and a charming American
wife, Susan, of whose expensive decorating tastes he will occasionally
complain, only to be instantly put in his place if he has failed to complain
out of earshot.
Juan Jose has no idea how much the family purse haemorrhages a month in
insurance premiums for the two houses, the cars and the multiple life
policies, but he is beginning to show signs of resistance. It was Susan,
drawing on her Anglo-Saxon upbringing, who sold him on the idea of putting
something away for the future.
'Our Spanish culture was very fatalistic,' he reminds enquirers, 'the
natural enemy of insurance and prudence.'
That childhood legacy probably still tears at him a little, though he
acknowleges that, now that he and other middle-class Spaniards have become
quite seriously wealthy, the sense that one should protect what one has has
grown strong.
'We went very quickly from nothing to everything,' says Juan Jose. 'Now we
worry about losing it. We worry about the durability and strength of the
social-security system. I'm going to live a long time, and I know that
spending money on insurance policies is not throwing it away.'
The lack of provision made by a society that is rightly praised for its
verve and zest for life meant that, by the time General Francisco Franco's
protective and paternalistic 39-year dictatorship came to an end in 1975,
Spain's savings rate was very low (statistically, it is traditionally high,
but savings accounts are subject to quick turnover) and practically no
attempt was being made, beyond the banking and savings bank networks, to
attract saving.
Low savings are still a problem for the Spanish economy, making it rely too
heavily on the entry of foreign capital to finance its deficits. But,
inevitably, the existence of a virgin market of 35m people was not going to
be left alone for long. From the moment the democratic authorities began
allowing foreign banks into the country, at the end of the 1970s, Spanish
habits began, slowly, to change.
Life insurance was a particularly stubborn nut to crack, and it was only
when insurers began to market the fiscal advantages of their policies -
rather than the Anglo-Saxon notion of preparing for old age or unexpected
death - that people began to take notice. Still, by 1986, the industry had
managed to sell only 2.1m policies to a probably small stratum of people who
had enough money to actually worry about how to avoid paying taxes. In
contrast, the mainstay of the insurance industry, car insurance, accounted
for nearly 12m policies.
That picture has changed in the past four years. Car insurance has become
increasingly unprofitable as Spain's crammed roads and impatient drivers
cause more and more accidents. But the rush of foreign entrants into the
market, smothering the television and newspaper advertising markets with
life policies and pension plans, and quickly copied by local institutions,
has bulldozed its way through fatalism, disbelief and suspicion.
By the end of 1989, the number of life polices had more than doubled to
4.4m. Car insurance, meanwhile, had grown just 16 per cent to 14.8m
policies. Where Spaniards were spending just Pta 11,000 a head on insurance
at the beginning of the 1980s, they were spending Pta 60,000 (Pounds 330) by
the end of the decade.
At the same time, a vicious battle was being waged between foreign and local
banks, and local savings banks, to attract and, more important, hold on to
savers. In late 1989, local banks finally laid their old interest-rate
cartel to rest and began to compete directly for rich savers - offering high
interest-bearing current accounts on amounts over Pta 1m. That has been an
expensive exercise for the commercial banks, and the big savings banks are
only beginning to compete, having first been forced to leave the insurance
market.
But while the growth of services and automation in Spanish banking has been
spectacular (one savings bank is working on machines that would enable
people to buy and sell shares), the most telling measure of change has been
the quick growth of personal-pension funds since the government first
allowed them to operate at the beginning of 1990.
In their first year, about 150 new pension-fund managers were able to
generate Pta 85bn-worth of business, but no one dreamed they would double
that by the end of last year, to some Pta 170bn. According to Mr Jose
Miracle, the government's pension-fund supervisor, 530,000 Spaniards now
have their own pension plans. 'Its an incredible number,' he says. 'It's
clear that, in this country, a certain layer of people have come to regard
long-term savings as an absolutely essential cover.'
Well, sort of. Talk to the Spaniards who are buying life policies and
pension plans, and it quickly becomes clear why they are so attractive.
Alfonso Moreno, a rich young financial analyst, quickly bought into a
pension scheme. 'I did it for fiscal reasons,' he says, meaning that what he
found attractive about the schemes is that they allow contributions of Pta
500,000 to be fully deducted from income tax and that a further Pta 250,000
is 15 per cent deductable.
So what about old age and all that? 'Look,' he says, 'I'm irresponsible. I
suppose if I were married I would do it differently.'
It is probably a reflection of their professions, but Alfonso Moreno and
Juan Jose Suarez approach buying their products in very different ways.
Alfonso says that, when he wants to borrow money (he has, truly, just bought
a Porsche), he shops around. 'You can save up to two points,' he says. As
banks vie for business, Alfonso's favourite stopping-points at the moment
are Barclays and the Caja de Catalunya, a Catalan savings bank.
Juan Jose says he makes a point of 'never asking about the interest rate,
just the length of time I have to pay the money back'. On the Pta 12m
mortgage he has just taken out? 'I got a good deal - 10 years  - but I don't
know what interest I'm paying and I haven't asked.'
Juan Jose is probably the more typical Spanish borrower. Which probably
explains why so many people are trying to lend him and the rest of the
country money. The sheer spread of offers at least means he is spoiled for
choice and is not going to get ripped off too badly.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (38): Clowns or
beauties still light up the collector - Alternative Investments / Most
cigarette cards are worth little, but a rare set may fetch a fancy price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AMERICAN collecting fanatic last month paid Dollars 450,000 (Pounds
254,000) for a cigarette card.
But don't bother ransacking the attic for that old box containing the cards
of your childhood. This was the one-off price needed to acquire the most
perfect example of the rarest and most desirable card in the market.
It is a portrait of the baseball player Honus Wagner, a big name around
1910. Wagner was an ardent anti-smoker, and when he discovered that his
likeness was being used to promote sales of cigarettes he asked the tobacco
company to withdraw the card. Fewer than 40 Wagner cards are known to have
survived, and less than 10 are in good condition. This one is the finest:
hence the price.
Most cigarette cards are virtually worthless. They were produced in their
billions in the UK and the US from the 1880s up to the second world war. But
they have always been collected, first by small boys, and now mainly by
middle aged men, nostalgic about their youth. (For some reason they have
minimal appeal to women). And the rarer sets, especially those of the
pre-1920 period, go for fancy prices: the British record is the Pounds
17,050 paid at Phillips in 1987 for a set of 20 Taddy's Clowns.
This was quite exceptional. Two rich collectors had been trying for years to
acquire these rare cards, of which only 15 complete sets are known, for
their holdings and they chased each other up in the saleroom. If a set of
Taddy's Clowns appeared on the market now, it would probably go for around
Pounds 7,000 - the underbidder on the record price was soon able to complete
his set, reducing the demand.
The same fanaticism fuels the search for cards from an even rarer set,
'Tobacco Leaf Girls', Edwardian beauties who have maintained their appeal.
One card could make Pounds 800; perhaps much more if two collectors need it
to complete the set of 20. The highest prices tend to be paid for the
earliest cards, such as 'Pirates', by the American manufacturers Allen &amp;
Ginter in 1888 and valued at over Pounds 300 a set. The only post-1930 set
to attract exceptional prices is the 'Life of Edward VIII', which
disappeared from the streets as quickly as the monarch. A set might cost
Pounds 1,500.
Around 15,000 sets of cards were issued in the UK. By the 1920s, Wills and
Players had bought out most of the smaller cigarette makers, like Taddy,
Kinnear, Duke &amp; Sons, Richmond Cavendish and Salmon &amp; Gluckstein; and for
almost two decades were pumping out annually new sets by the hundred.
Today, they can usually be bought for around Pounds 10 a set, with really
popular subjects, like the Kings and Queens of England, produced in massive
quantities in the 1930s, worth now around Pounds 5 - less if the cards are
stuck in one of the books published by the tobacco companies to encourage
loyalty to the brand. Serious collectors place their cards in protective
plastic covers. As well as rarity, condition is all-important: creased or
dog eared cards have minimal appeal.
The low value of most cards means that, these days, the auction houses tend
to sell them in vast job-lots - if they sell them at all. Phillips still
includes cigarette cards in its sales of books or collectables at its rooms
in Leeds, Ipswich, and Sherborne, as well as at London West Two. Christie's
South Kensington now has two substantial sales a year and confines
appropriate cigarette cards to specialist auctions - on such subjects as
cricket, fishing and aviation.
Generally, a saleroom lot which contains a few rare cards and carries an
estimate of up to Pounds 100 sells at around its target. The lots containing
thousands of popular cards from mixed sets, and with estimates up to Pounds
300, sometimes make much more as dealers compete for the hoard. These cards
will then be matched into sets and retailed at collector's fairs or street
antique stalls with a substantial mark-up.
There are specialist dealers who tend to offer a postal service. They can be
tracked down through the periodical Card Times. But around 70 per cent of
the lots at auction go to private buyers, who might do some weekend trading
of their spares to finance their hobby.
Christie's South Kensington noticed that prices in its October 18 sale were
appreciably higher than in the spring of 1990 when demand was weak: perhaps
the cutback in the number of auctions had left the dealers short of stock.
This would account for a job-lot of 129 complete sets, including many
pre-1920, selling for Pounds 4,620, as against a top estimate of Pounds 500.
A Phillips auction in Leeds, in late February, also suggested a healthy
market. One lot, consisting of cards from FJ Smith's 'Cricketers' - as well
as 'War Incidents (First Series)' and 'British Butterflies', from Godfrey
Phillips - made Pounds 297, against a top estimate of Pounds 50. Twenty-four
full sets of natural history and sport, conservatively estimated at up to
Pounds 100, went for Pounds 407. It does not matter too much if a set is not
complete - it is usually possible to acquire from a dealer the missing
cards.
But it is hard to predict price frenzy among the cigarette cards. The
collectors are getting older; the likely frequency of rare cards appearing
for sale is known; price levels have moved in line with inflation, but no
more. Certain areas are perenially attractive to collectors, like cards of
cricketers, which have shown an impressive rise in value in the past decade.
This has now levelled off. Boxers seem currently to be attracting attention,
joining Edwardian beauties as bankable propositions. Anyone with a little
surplus income could form an impressive cigarette card collection quite
quickly and painlessly.
But this misses the point. The attraction for enthusiasts lies in slowly
assembling sets in a particular area - sporting cards, military cards,
pre-1910 cards, cards produced by lesser-known cigarette-makers - and
pouring over the inevitable card stall at a boot-sale or at a Sunday morning
gathering of like-minded collectors, trading and exchanging until the
holding is complete.
Few areas offer the thrill of the chase with quite so many possibilities of
success. And there is undoubted investment potential among the earlier,
rarer, cards.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (37): Keeping the
house in order - On the move / Managers' careers may also interest savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CERI JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS particular reason this year to ensure that the fund manager
investing your money has a long and steady record, and as much experience as
possible of volatile markets.
Yet while the expertise of the individual managing the fund is fundamental,
there is no real mystique about the investment business - the management
principles are much the same as for any other industry.
Paul Haines, investment director of consulting actuary Noble Lowndes, says:
'There have been no career changes in the last six months where people who
have moved are so good that they could change my perception of an investment
house overnight. But some could change the house over a period of time.
Sometimes the problem with a house is not the quality of the staff, but the
way the house is managed. If there was a house where the investment
philosophy is sound but the management is poor, then a good leader can
provide what the house is lacking.'
Mr Haines also questioned the widely-held assumption that an investment
group necessarily suffers when a brilliant and charismatic manager leaves.
'If a manager is really exceptional, then he will train people in his
culture and that culture may persist beyond his own physical presence.'
There are, however, two typical scenarios that are likely to take their toll
on a group's fund performance.
The first is where a group's traditional fund management department falls
under the general business function, so that fund managers are remunerated
on the same scale as managers in other departments. The best fund managers
in their field can demand far more than such a structure allows. This type
of structural problem occurs most frequently in insurance companies. The
second is where different parts of a group are being merged, either through
corporate takeover or the internal rationalisation of one company - for
example, the merger of a group's pension and unit-trust arms.
That said, the appointment of one exceptional manager can boost client
confidence in a group, which in turn works like a self-fulfilling prophesy.
An example might be the former chief of Prudential Portfolio Managers, Giles
Weaver, who returned to his native Scotland in October to take up a
directorship at Murray Johnstone, with overall responsibility for UK
investment and pensions. Murray Johnstone has had mixed fortunes over the
last 12 months. Funds under management fell by Pounds 700m in 1990; its
attempts at merger have so far proved fruitless; and last month it
streamlined its operation with the redundancy of a further 20 staff.
However, the company claims it has not lost a single client since Mr
Weaver's appointment.
Hill Samuel Investment Services (HSIS) has also experienced a bumpy 12
months. Last month, chief executive Derek Fitch took early retirement
following the group's decision to restructure the company into two parts.
One arm is now headed by John Penny and concentrates on life, pensions and
mortgage business; the other is led by John Bourke, and deals with private
client services and offshore operations. One of the biggest blows to the
group was the departure in December of David Tilles and his team of four,
who had managed the Marks &amp; Spencer UK Selection Portfolio unit trust. They
left to form Delaware International Advisers, taking the Pounds 13.5m M&amp;S
contract with them.
This also followed the departure of HSIS former managing director David
Barker, who left in February 1990 to join Royal Insurance Asset Management
as managing director, with the brief to oversee all of royal's
fund-management functions.
Another troubled house, Kleinwort Benson, appointed Charles Cavanagh last
month as director and head of UK institutional fund management. Mr Cavanagh
was previously responsible for client relationships with UK pension funds at
Mercury Asset Management.
Not all moves are from one house to another. In January, Kleinwort Benson's
colourful Japanese unit trust manager, Campbell Gunn, moved to Switzerland
to manage private client funds from the company's Geneva office. His
position has been filled by Mark Pearson, who also managed the Kleinwort
Benson Japanese Specialist trust and had worked alongside his predecessor
for three years.
Other significant recent job-changes of note in the fund-management
fraternity include Jimmy West's move to Lazards as chief executive in
December, following the takeover of Globe Investment Trust by the Coal Board
Pension Fund.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (36): Budget deals a
blow at trusts - Offshore / Tax-deferral is still a useful possibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIZ WALKINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFSHORE MAY have become a more respectable place, but a number of its tax
advantages have been whittled away. The latest move was announced in the
Budget, against offshore trusts.
Since 1981, it had been possible to set up an offshore trust to hold assets
 -shares, for example  - which could then be sold free of capital gains tax,
so long as the money remained offshore. If it was ever brought back to this
country, tax would be charged, but meanwhile, the trust assets could
generate income on the full amount.
Existing trusts will still be able to benefit, but only so long as no
changes are made and no capital is paid to a UK beneficiary. The proposals
also mean that it will not generally be worthwhile setting up a new trust.
An early victim of a Inland Revenue clampdown was the so-called roll-up
fund. Instead of paying out dividends to investors, roll-up funds would
accumulate them into the capital value of their shares. This turned a
potential income-tax liability into one of capital gains, which at the time
was cheaper.
This loophole was closed in 1984, when the Inland Revenue stipulated that
all gains - income and capital  - would be liable to income tax, unless the
fund qualified for what was called distributor status. The primary criterion
for this was that the fund had to distribute at least 85 per cent of its
income as dividends, on which investors would then be liable to income tax.
A more recent measure involved 'umbrella' funds. These are investment
companies that offer different classes of share, or sub-funds. Each is
invested in a different area, typically a range of international stock
markets, bonds and currencies.
It used to be possible to 'convert' shares from one sub-fund to another
without incurring capital gains tax. This was a significant advantage over
onshore unit trusts, where any switch, even between funds managed by the
same group, counts as a disposal.
Umbrella funds have since been brought into line, and conversions will now
incur CGT if the gains are above the annual exempt allowance, currently
Pounds 5,500.
So are there still reasons for the UK investor to look offshore? Yes,
indeed.
While tax-avoidance may have been more or less ruled out, tax-deferral is
still a useful possibility.
Take roll-up funds. Now that capital gains tax is charged at the same rate
as income tax, these are certainly back in the picture. There is still one
disadvantage - as all gains attract income tax, the investor doesn't have
the benefit of the Pounds 5,500 CGT allowance.
But on the other hand, tax is not payable until the investor sells his
shares in the fund. So the liability can be deferred until, say, a time when
his income-tax rate is lower. Better still, if he moves abroad, he may
escape tax altogether.
Distributor funds, meanwhile, leave the investor in much the same tax
position as an ordinary unit trust. But here again, there is a brief period
of deferral, as income is paid gross and the tax bill arrives later, which
may have cash-flow benefits. The one caveat is that distributor status is
applied for retrospectively - funds must submit their accounts to the
Revenue for approval at the end of the financial year. Failure could have
significant consequences for investors, which means in turn that funds are
likely to be ultra cautious in their operations.
The other reason for considering offshore funds is the variety of
investments they encompass. Although there are now over 1,300 UK authorised
unit trusts, there are still areas they do not cover; for example, property,
commodities, currencies and futures-and-options contracts.
This is due to change shortly, with wider investment powers being granted to
unit trusts, but offshore funds are likely to retain an advantage for a
while. First, several unit trust management groups are wary of moving into
these areas, which they see as carrying greater risks and more
administrative demands. Second, the offshore funds have experience and a
record.
Most of the funds that are readily available to UK investors are based
within Europe and offered by subsidiaries of well-known UK companies, such
as Fidelity, Schroder and MIM Britannia. With EC harmonisation, the
differences between these and onshore investments will inevitably blur.
Meanwhile, this could be a golden age for offshore investment, with
regulations in place to reduce risks, but still some tax and other
advantages for the canny investor.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (35): UK is still
seen as best value - The managers must judge whether the equities rally will
last
</HEADLINE>

The Professionals
THIS IS not a competition, but an allocation exercise, the purpose of which
is to see how five professional fund managers manage a Pounds 250,000
portfolio on behalf of a client of their choice. In each case, the client is
either a wealthy individual or a small, self-administered pension fund. All
the fund managers stress that they are investing for the long term - 10
years and more  - rather than short-term gain.
The exercise started at the beginning of October last year. The portfolios
given here were struck as at the end of March, and will be reviewed again at
the end of June.
CASH IS supposed to be king in times of recession and uncertainty. Yet to
have been invested in cash during the past quarter would have meant missing
out on a dramatic rally in world share prices.
In the three months since the five last reassessed their portfolios, the UK
market has risen by 16.5 per cent; continental European markets have risen
by an average of 13.8 per cent; the US market has climbed by 26.9 per cent
(in sterling terms) and Japanese equities by 20.5 per cent (again in
sterling).
To varying degrees, all five correctly anticipated this upsurge in share
prices, chosing to buy equities at a time when the Gulf war had yet to break
out and the world economic and political outlook was very uncertain.
Now the war is long over, but economic uncertainties remain. The
professional investors now have to decide whether the rally in share prices
has been overdone, particularly in the US, where small-company shares rose
by 42 per cent over the quarter, without any incontrovertible evidence that
the country is out of recession.
Here is how the fund managers assess the outlook for the next quarter.
Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, is not altering his holding of UK
shares, in the belief that inflation and interest rates will fall further
during the year, setting the scene for economic recovery. 'Profits and
dividends should not suffer too badly in the recession, and the equity
market is still reasonably valued despite his rise,' he says.
He is selling his US stake - 12.5 per cent of the portfolio  - because the
market is, in his view, expensive and the prospects for economic recovery
doubtful. The holding in continental European equities is increased from 20
to 25 per cent, and he takes a new 5 per cent holding in Japanese equities.
He is also increasing his South-east Asia stake from 12.5 to 15 per cent and
his holdings of cash and Japanese bonds (accounting for 15 per cent of the
total) are switched into long French government bonds, where yields of 9.2
per cent are to him 'attractive against recent and imminent inflation, and
could fall substantially'.
Paul Myners, at Gartmore, is tinkering with the composition of his holding
of UK equities, which remains at 55 per cent of the portfolio. He wants to
increase his weighting in small-company shares and, as a result, a fifth of
the total portfolio is to be invested in small-company investment trusts.
Five per cent is to be invested in the capital shares of split-level
investment trusts.
He reflects that he was wrong to have invested 7.5 per cent of the portfolio
in Deutsche Mark bonds, which rose by 2.4 per cent over the quarter. They
are being sold, and the proceeds used to take the stake in Pacific Rim
equities from 7.5 to 12.5 per cent of the portfolio, and to take a new 2.5
per cent holding in Japanese equity warrants. Otherwise, the portfolio is
unchanged.
Simon Toynbee, at Mercury Asset Management, candidly admits that markets
rose more quickly during the first quarter than he anticipated. 'Our
cautious stance three months ago (with 20 per cent cash), with hindsight,
was not vindicated but was very appropriate at the time,' he reflects.
'After such a very sharp rise in all world stock markets, some degree of
consolidation is expected over the next three months,' he says. 'The value
of UK equities is still modest, and on a longer term view we remain
optimistic. We are concerned about the high valuation of US equities and the
weakness of the Deutsche Mark which is unsettling the German stock market.'
The aim over the next quarter is to take the UK weighting from 40 to 50 per
cent of the portfolio. Accordingly, the holding of UK gilts is being cut
back from 15 to 5 per cent after a quarter in which gilts rose by 7.7 per
cent. Cash is being reduced from 20 to 17 per cent, the 3 per cent being
invested in Far East equities. Otherwise the holdings remain the same.
Within the UK market, Mr Toynbee is looking to increase the portfolio's
exposure to those cyclical stocks that are sensitive to economic upturn: he
highlights the quality engineering companies, and GKN in particular. He
notes that sentiment towards smaller-company shares is improving, but says
it is important to buy companies with strong management and strong balance
sheets.
Howard Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, is still cautious. 'There
is no point in rushing into anything just because the markets are going up,'
he says. 'That is a recipe for disaster. I'm aiming to produce a real rate
of return and not to be a slave to the markets. Whatever the markets do now
I wouldn't have a single worry about the stocks I have here.'
His cash holding, 33 per cent at the beginning of the year, is now down to 8
per cent, and bonds are down from 25 to 12 per cent. The cash released has
been invested in equities, which now account for 80 per cent of the
portfolio, against 42 per cent three months ago.
UK stocks - which account for 40 per cent of the total  - include Abbey
National, British Gas, BTR, Fisons, Northern Foods, RTZ, Severn Trent,
Shell, Unilever and Whitbread. In the US, he has just two holdings: Failure
Group and General Electric. In other markets, he holds shares in: Ito
Yokado, Schering, Alcatel Alsthom, Stet, Banco Popular, Roche and Nestle.
David Poole, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, had the gutsiest stance back in
October when this exercise began. While the other investors had large cash
holdings, Mr Poole confidently put 80 per cent of the total into equities, a
stance subsequently vindicated by events.
There are no major adjustments to his portfolio: his holding of UK equities
goes up by 3 per cent to 63 per cent; continental European and US equities
are cut back slightly, as are European bonds and sterling cash; the exposure
to Japan and the Far East is adjusted marginally upwards.
In the UK market, Mr Poole has started to switch from defensive Footsie
businesses into quality growth stocks, including well-managed second-line
stocks which have underperformed, particularly those with a bias to US
earnings, such as Dawson International and Coats Viyella. He has also bought
a number of high-yielding convertible stocks, where dividend growth rate is
expected to exceed that of the ordinary share.
Note that all the fund managers are considerably more optimistic than they
were six months ago when this exercise began. They believe that a period of
consolidation is ahead; and that the best value is still to be found in the
UK market.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (34): The industry
needs small investors - Marketing / But seeking them through independent
financial advisers will mean paying the same sort of commission levels that
unit trusts have paid in the past - Investment trusts
</HEADLINE>

FOR FAR too long investment-trust companies assumed that investment trusts
would sell themselves. After all, they were plainly such an attractive
investment, when compared with say unit trusts, that savers would surely
come knocking at the door.
But they didn't. Over the decades the private investors in many investment
trusts died, or at any rate sold their shares, and the shares drifted to
wider and wider discounts against underlying assets. During the early 1980s
the average discount regularly came close to 30 per cent.
As prices drifted, investment institutions such as life-insurance companies
and pension funds came in to mop up the investment-trust shares. Usually
they did not regard them as appropriate investments, but at a low enough
price they were worth tucking away in institutional portfolios.
In this way, the big funds often came to own 70 per cent of an investment
trust's shares. This is the topsy-turvy situation in which the boards of
many trusts find themselves, and they know that such trusts have little
future unless the balance is redressed. The takeover of the giant Globe
Investment Trust last year, to be broken up by the pension funds of British
Coal, was yet another ghastly warning, if another were needed.
Now, nearly all the investment-trust managements accept that more effective
marketing to personal investors is essential if the investment trust
industry is to survive in anything like its present form.
In the distant past, investment trusts were able to rely on stockbrokers to
market their products. The reward of the brokers was the commission on the
deal, nowadays of something like 1.7 per cent on small bargains (it used to
be rather less). But stockbrokers have in many cases tended to become less
interested in private clients. Alternatively, they have sold unit trusts on
a significantly bigger 3 per cent commission.
Meanwhile, larger and larger proportions of the long-term savings of the
public over the years have gone into life insurance contracts and personal
pensions, sold by intermediaries who receive even more lucrative
commissions.
Such products can be sold aggressively through advertising or through
mail-order shots, and even through 'cold calls' on a door-to-door or
telephone sales basis. These rules have applied for many years now.
Investment trust shares, on the other hand, have come under the tight
restrictions which apply to the promotion of company shares in general, and
are designed to curb the activities of unscrupulous share pushers and
'boiler room' telephone selling operators.
But now big changes are in the offing. The Securities and Investments Board,
the top watchdog body for investments, has decided that investment trusts
should be put more in line with alternative savings products. Investment
trust savings schemes, at least, will soon be much more freely marketable to
the public. The new regulations may come into force later this year.
So far, investment-trust savings schemes have had to skate around the
existing rules. Investment trusts have not been permitted to sell 'off the
page' using coupons, as unit trusts can. Rather, investment-trust management
companies have had to advertise brochures, which is selling at one remove.
Still, investment-trust savings schemes pulled in Pounds 91m during 1990, a
42 per cent increase on the 1990 figure, despite poor market conditions.
Moreover, investment trusts have already been given a role in personal
equity plans. They are on a par with unit trusts in this tax privilege,
which gives both of them something of an advantage over life insurance
products. The latest Budget changes will serve to widen the range of
investment trusts which can qualify for Pounds 3,000 peps.
Now, the investment-trust marketing men are gearing up to take on the rival
savings media more directly. More and more, they are seeking to reach the
public through independent financial advisers, the sort of intermediaries
who sell life policies, pension plans and unit trusts. The trade body, the
AITC, has just hired a marketing executive with a brief to help member
investment trust companies to reach such intermediaries.
However, this means paying the same sort of commission levels - usually 3
per cent of a lump sum investment - that unit trusts have paid in the past.
Thus there are pluses and minuses in all this for the investor. Investment
trusts are starting to offer rather worse value for money, but on the other
hand the discount on assets is shrinking, which is very good for existing
investors and offers the promise of reduced share price volatility to future
investors too.
A further step has been taken by Foreign &amp; Colonial, now the biggest
investment trust. In a pioneering deal with Skandia Life, its shares are
being used as the investment medium for life insurance and personal pensions
products.
There is still, however, something like Pounds 15bn of funds of
institutional investors in the investment-trust market. If that pool of
capital is to be replaced by private investors' money within a reasonably
short period of time, the investment trusts' new marketing men are going to
have to work very hard.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (33): The yield is
handy, but watch the parabola - Split-capital trusts / A 1960s golden oldie
may appeal to seekers of both income and of capital growth - Investment
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPLIT-capital trust is definitely in vogue. Every other new
investment-trust issue seems to have several different classes of shares,
and such trusts now make up 10 per cent of the sector.
The main reason for the revival - the previous heyday of split capital
trusts was in the 1960s - is the ability of managers to structure the trusts
in ways that make them attractive to private investors. Income shares, in
particular, appeal to the older investor. Allied to a personal equity plan
(Pep), such trusts can provide vital tax-free income.
Some trust managers have been able to exploit an element of the Pep rules,
which allows new issues to be transferred, without charge, into a plan
within 42 days of the first day of dealings.
The rules allow investors to put the full Pounds 6,000 into a new issue Pep,
rather than the normal investment-trust limit of Pounds 3,000. Indeed,
trusts launched at the end of last tax year allowed investors to place as
much as Pounds 12,000 into two Peps, one for the 1990-91 fiscal year and one
for 1991-92.
One interesting variant of the income shares was created in the recent
launch of the Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust, managed by Rea Brothers. The
income shares will pay a very high initial yield, but will only be repaid a
penny in the pound when the trust is wound up in 10 years' time.
The Contra-Cyclical share thus resembles a temporary annuity - with the
advantage that, if the investor dies, his estate will still be able to sell
the shares at the market price. With an annuity, death means the loss of the
entire investment.
The price of most income shares follows a parabola - rising above asset
value in the first few years, and then falling back to par as the wind-up of
the trust approaches. This can make them dangerous investments for the
unwary, who may be attracted by the yield when the price is high, without
realising they will face a capital loss. However, this quirk can be used to
advantage by investors with a large capital gains tax liability. They can
buy income shares at the peak price and create an offsetting capital loss,
while enjoying the income.
Income is not the only advantage that a split-capital trust can offer the
private investor. If all the income is being siphoned off to one class of
investor, that leaves all the capital growth to the rest.
One class of shares that has become particularly popular in the recent
revival is the zero-dividend preference share. As the name suggests, this
brings no income but will normally be first to be repaid when the trust is
wound up. Barring a disaster, repayment will be at a level which guarantees
healthy capital growth.
For the small investor who has not used up his capital gains tax allowance,
these shares offer an attractive tax-free gain. And even investors who have
already used up their Pounds 5,500 CGT limit can use the shares to make
tax-free gains via a Pep.
Those willing to take larger risks may be interested in the capital shares
of split trusts. These promise substantial gains if stock markets, and the
managers of the trust, perform well.
Capital shares are highly risky. The normal split-capital trust structure
means that the capital shares will be worthless unless the assets of the
trust grow - and sometimes they need to grow substantially. But modest
growth rates in assets - of, say, 7.5 to 10 per cent per annum - can often
mean a substantial multiple of the share price.
Different trusts use different combinations of these shares, but they
normally revolve around the three basics - income, assured capital growth
and risky capital growth.
The attraction of these share varieties has created substantial demand, with
the result that many of the trusts trade at a premium to their net asset
value. 'I think the sector will grow, because of demand not only from
private investors, but also from institutional clients who want an income
stream,' says Lewis Aaron, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Mr Aaron expects more trust launches, particularly towards the end of the
tax year, and more restructuring of existing trusts into split-capital form,
with the aim of attracting institutional interest.
However, the continued health of the sector depends on demand being
maintained and not swamped by oversupply. It may also depend on the stock
markets performing well enough to prevent any disasters, such as capital
shareholders recording a total loss.
If disasters are avoided, and the managers show continuing creativity in
inventing new classes of shares with investor appeal, then the split-capital
sector is likely to be an important factor in propelling the investment
industry into the next millennium.

THERE is a risk that investment trust savings schemes may lose their status
as one of the cheapest ways of buying into the stock market.
The danger results from the trusts' attempts to widen their appeal by
selling via financial intermediaries.
Intermediaries have tended to favour unit trusts in the past, for the
understandable reason that they receive a 3 per cent commission for doing
so.
The natural response is for investment trusts to do the same. A number of
management groups have started to offer intermediaries a 3 per cent
commission for introducing new client funds. One of the most recent to do so
was the Scottish American Investment Company (Saints).
But the payment of commission raises a number of difficult questions, many
of which are related to the concept of 'best advice' which intermediaries
are supposed to provide.
Saints, for example, has had to decree that all investors who buy shares via
lump-sum investments in the savings scheme will have to pay commission,
whether they get advice from a financial intermediary or not.
Otherwise, intermediaries would be obliged, under best-advice guidelines, to
tell prospective investors to buy their shares independently.
This is bad news for those who wanted to use the Saints scheme as a cheap
way of buying into the trust, since new investors, and not existing
shareholders, pay the commission. The difficulties do not end there. Some
discount brokers charge as little as 1.25 per cent for making a sale or
purchase of shares. Saints makes a Pounds 10 charge for selling.
So buying and selling, say, Pounds 5,000 of shares through a discount broker
would cost Pounds 125; but Pounds 160 through the Saints scheme. (Stamp duty
would also be payable in both cases).
How can it be 'best advice' for the intermediary to recommend the scheme in
such an instance? And for a small sum of Pounds 1,000, even a broker
charging 1.85 per cent would be cheaper than the scheme.
It has been argued that the trust's shares will go up, and that when the
investor comes to sell, he might well be paying 1.25 per cent of a much
larger sum. A 3 per cent upfront charge could thus in the long run be
cheaper.
However, this is a difficult argument to sustain. Using a Pounds 1,000 sum
as an example, the investor would pay Pounds 12.50 upfront via a discount
broker, against Pounds 30 via the Saints scheme. For the total of broker
commissions to be larger than the Pounds 40 total of Saints charges, the
shares would have to rise in value to Pounds 2,280.
It is hard to believe that the financial intermediary will make that
calculation - and even if he did, he certainly will not be able to guarantee
such a rise. Of course, there is a significant danger that the shares could
go down. In any case, it is hardly 'best advice' to tell clients to pay a
high charge upfront, given the time value of money.
But the most telling argument that this system runs counter to 'best advice'
is the fact that not all investment trusts pay commissions. The investor who
buys through the Saints scheme is starting off with almost a 3 per cent
disadvantage, compared with the investor who buys via the savings scheme of
another which does not pay commission. The charge in the Foreign &amp; Colonial
savings scheme, for example, is only 0.2 per cent.
The investor will only be better off if Saints performs better than other
trusts which do not pay commission. But how can the intermediary be sure it
will do so? Past performance provides no proof. An investor who placed
Pounds 1,000 in Saints on January 1, 1980, would have seen his capital grow
(ignoring dividends) to around Pounds 5,000; the same amount invested in
Foreign &amp; Colonial would have grown to over Pounds 8,000.
The upshot of all this is that it is hard to see any justification for an
adviser's recommending a client to buy trust shares via a commission-paying
scheme. The private investor, if recommended a trust by an intermediary,
should establish whether or not he is being charged commission.
Intermediaries want to make a living and put food on their family tables;
that is understandable. But if private investors want to be charitable, they
should give to charity; if they want to buy investment trust shares, they
should use a non-commission paying savings scheme.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): The specialist
route into emerging markets may be volatile - Investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT TRUSTS have been steadily forced into specialisation over the
last decade. The large general trusts, which were the flagships of the
industry, have been whittled away by takeover and reconstruction.
Institutional investors, rightly or wrongly, just did not perceive that the
trusts' managers added value.
In contrast, specialist trusts, by concentrating on investment areas that
are illiquid or arcane, can bring value to the institutional portfolio.
For private investors, specialist funds are really the only way they can
gain access to emerging markets, such as Korea. And a closed-end structure
lends support to the managers.
There are funds for a wide variety of markets, including New Zealand,
Thailand and Spain. There are also other closed-end funds on offer which,
though not officially deemed investment trusts, have many of the same
qualities. Many of these funds, which can be found in the Finance, Land
section of the FT prices pages are dollar-based investments.
Perhaps the most successful specialist trust of all concentrates on a field
that is closer to home. Electra Investment Trust concentrates on the
unquoted sector and, since the start of 1980, has outperformed the FT
All-Share Index by almost 30 per cent and the FT Investment Trust Index by
around 8 per cent.
The trust has some 70 per cent of its portfolio in unquoted investments and
a wide geographical spread, with more than 40 per cent outside the UK. The
concentration on unquoteds is both an advantage and a disadvantage: it means
that the trust has a tendency to value its investments conservatively, which
may underplay its strengths; but it also means that the asset value is less
volatile.
Volatility is the problem for many specialised trusts. Not only is investing
in a niche area inherently more of a volatile business, but such trusts
often move to a premium to net assets in their early days, since they
represent one of the best ways for investors to gain access to what is
usually a fashionable area of the market.
When the area becomes unfashionable again, and prices drop sharply, the
trust then falls to a discount, creating a 'double whammy' effect for
investors. Private investors need iron nerves before backing such a trust,
and should ensure that a specialised holding is part of a more diversified
portfolio.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): First clarify
your aims - Choosing an Investment Trust / Then remember that, while the
past can be a useful guide, with so much specialisation, investment fashions
count at least as much - Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH ALMOST 250 investment trusts on the market, investors face a
bewildering choice. Trusts vary according to their size, marketability,
geographical spread, the industries which they target, and crucially of
course their investment performance.
No one can accurately predict which will do best over the next few years.
The past can certainly be a useful guide to the future but with so much
specialisation these days investment fashions count for at least as much. It
is obviously advisable to try to identify trusts or management companies
with a consistent record - but it is worth remembering that the individuals
who run them are also human beings: they can make mistakes, lose their
touch, or suddenly embark on a huge and expensive gamble.
The first thing to be clear about when selecting a trust is the nature of
your aims. Are you, for example, primarily interested in income or in
capital growth? Trusts have tended to become more growth-orientated of late,
but there are nine UK funds whose policy is to accentuate income growth, and
four which aim to achieve the same result with a more international spread
of assets.
The AITC's monthly information service shows the up-to-date distribution of
these assets. At the end of January, for example, the giant British Assets
trust had 79 per cent of its portfolio in the UK, with 18 per cent in North
America and 2 per cent in Japan. Murray International,on the other hand, had
54 per cent in the UK, 22 per cent in North America, 11 per cent in the Far
East, and 12 per cent in continental Europe.
UK General Trusts generally try to achieve a balanced return. The nine
trusts in this category were typically quoting gross yields of between 4 and
6 per cent at the end of January, roughly equivalent to the stock market as
a whole. Split-capital trusts have two classes of shares: income
shares,which receive all the income from the trust's portfolio, and capital
shares which receive no income but get all the capital gains. The latter are
obviously attractive vehicles for those investors anxious to avoid liability
to income tax.
The bulk of trusts tend to be orientated towards capital growth, in part
because the long years of inflation followed by rising stock markets formed
the impression that this was the more attractive option. The increasing
trend towards specialisation in individual overseas markets, where yields
tend to be low, has also led management groups to concentrate less of their
energies on providing a generous income flow.
The categories established by the AITC indicate fairly precisely to the
investor what he or she is buying: everything from the Far East, including
or excluding Japan, to technology, smaller companies, commodity and energy,
Europe and Australasia. The requirement for inclusion in most of the
categories is that a trust should keep at least 80 per cent of its assets in
the country, region, or sector in question.
Those who want a broad spread of international investments, and do not wish
to be confined to a specific market or region, will find plenty of choice
among the international general and international growth trusts. The
advantage of this is that market exposure, as well as individual stock
selection, can be left in the hands of the investment managers.
In essence, the key to choosing an investment lies in identifying the
appropriate degree of risk. For a first-time buyer with limited funds, a UK
trust offering a reasonable yield is probably the best bet: the income flow
provides some protection in falling markets, and the danger of adverse
currency movements can be ruled out.
Higher risk - but potentially greater rewards  - can be confronted in the
form of more specialised vehicles,notably those which have high gearing (ie,
borrowed money to buy additional shares in the hope that the rise in their
value will exceed the borrowing costs). Depending on the market's
perception, the level of gearing can contribute to swings in the
investment-trust discount - the difference between a trust's assets value
and share price, and thus an important influence on the investor's return.
An interesting variant in recent years has been the zero-coupon preference
shares issued by investment trusts. These first appeared when Scottish
National Investment Trust reorganised in 1987, and there are now 14 such
issues. The trick is that they offer a fixed growth in capital over a set
period.
As with the capital shares of ordinary split-capital trusts, investors
receive no income but are entitled to complete repayment before all other
classes of equity when the trust reaches its winding up date - provided,
that is, the assets are there in the first place. The lives of the 12
existing issues vary from four to 10 years. Olliff and Partners, a
stockbroking firm which specialises in investment trusts, recommends using
the zero-coupon preferences as a means of planning for school fees.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): A spur from
the chancellor - Personal Equity Plans / Access to EC markets will be
helpful, but charges may still deter - Investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTMENT-trust sector did quite well out of the changes in Personal
Equity Plans announced in the Budget. The chancellor agreed with one of the
main proposals submitted by the Association of Investment Trust Companies -
that Pep investments should no longer be confined primarily to the London
market but extended to include the whole of the European Community.
This change, which takes effect in the autumn, should make Peps less risky.
One criticism has been that they are too dependent on the UK market.
The freedom to enter a range of markets should help investment trusts in
particular. They tend to be less concentrated than unit trusts, preferring
to spread investments over a wider area. Many general investment trusts,
which were unwilling to change their strategy just to please Pep investors,
will now qualify under the Pep regulations.
Michael Hart, chairman of the AITC, for example, said his company, Foreign &amp;
Colonial, would now be able to offer Pep investment trusts. Several other
companies will be able to broaden the range of trusts available to Pep
investors. Mr Hart said the AITC had long been lobbying the government to
include EC exchanges in the Pep scheme.
The chancellor made another concession that will mainly benefit investment
trusts, rather than unit trusts: the decision to raise from Pounds 900 to
Pounds 1,500 the amount that can be put into a 'non-qualifying' trust - that
is, a fund that fails to comply with the rule that at least 50 per cent of
its investments should be in the UK (EC from the autumn) market.
This is good news for investment-trust companies, which are prepared to deal
in fairly modest amounts at low charges, unlike the unit-trust groups which
don't want to bother with such small sums.
On the other hand, the chancellor closed a small loophole, available to
investment-trust Peps exclusively: the freedom to use their status as a
quoted company to make unlimited rights issues, thereby increasing the
amount that could be invested well over the permitted maximum. But he left
open the other, more widely used, loophole, again confined to investment
trusts as quoted shares, of launching new issues, where the investor can
subscribe Pounds 6,000 instead of being restricted to the normal Pounds
3,000 maximum investment for investment and unit trusts.
However, there was disappointment that he ignored pleas from both
investment- and unit-trust companies that investors be allowed to put all
their Pep money into a collective investment fund, rather than just Pounds
3,000. In fact, a step has been taken in the opposite direction with the
plan to allow a further Pounds 3,000 to be invested in a single-company Pep.
This means that investors using the full Pounds 9,000 allowance will be able
to put only one third into a collective investment fund - the safest vehicle
 -while being encouraged to take the gamble of putting a similar amount into
only one company. A professional adviser who recommended a similar strategy
would quite rightly be rebuked by the regulatory authorities for failing to
give 'best advice'.
Mr Hart said that investment trusts seemed to be beating their heads against
a brick wall, with the politicians arguing that the purpose of Peps was to
encourage investment in industry, not in funds.
Nevertheless, Peps are still seen as a good opportunity for investment
trusts to attract new business, with the tax concessions as the lure. David
Smith, of Flemings, welcomed all moves to widen share ownership. Robin
Berrill, of Hendersons, said an 'enormous new marketplace' had opened up.
Unfortunately, unit trusts have so far grabbed the lion's share of the Pep
market. This is partly because the restrictions on Pep investments has made
them unsuitable for most of the big general investment trusts, which like to
spread their portfolios worldwide, and have therefore been unable or
unwilling to become qualifying funds. The inclusion of the EC exchanges will
lessen that problem.
At the same time, while investment-trust charges may be lower than those of
unit trusts, running a Pep does involve extra costs. This means that an
investment trust's Pep is slightly more expensive than its regular savings
scheme, which is undoubtedly the cheapest way to get into the stock market.
So anyone considering investment trusts may well prefer to forget the Pep
tax concessions and go for a savings scheme instead.
Unit trusts adopt a different strategy, relying on marketing and promotion,
paid for out of their existing higher charges, to achieve the volume of
sales needed, so that they can sell Peps with no additional charges,
absorbing the higher costs involved.
Because of the restrictions on advertising shares, investment trusts have
been unable to promote themselves in the same way as unit trusts, and this
has affected their efforts to sell Peps. So has the fact that most do not
pay commission to independent intermediaries, who are therefore reluctant to
recommend their products.
However, things are changing. The restrictions on advertising may soon be
lifted, and several investment-trust groups are now paying commission. At
the same time, intermediaries charging fees are increasingly recommending
Pep investment trusts, which have special advantages. For example, the
split-level trusts can offer Peps that provide a high income which makes the
most of the tax-free dividends.
With lower charges, and funds well suited to the small investor seeking a
safe haven in the stock market, investment trusts should be in a powerful
position to sell Peps strongly. The problem is in getting the message
across.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Long-distance
pacesetters - Performance / Last year was gloomy, but the horizon offers
encouragement - Investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERFORMANCE of investment trusts in 1990 offers a salutary lesson to
investors: that the search for short-term profit may end with fool's gold.
Average net asset values in the sector fell 25 per cent over the year -
underperforming the FT-A All-Share index by 11 per cent. Of 206 trusts
tracked by brokers County NatWest Woodmac, only 39 managed to beat the
All-Share. And only one trust in this sample, F and C Enterprise, was able
to maintain its share price over the 12-month period. Explanations for this
dismal showing are easy enough to find. The strength of the pound, which
gained significantly against most major currencies like the dollar, the yen
and the Deutsche Mark, hit the value of trusts' overseas assets on
translation into sterling.
The relatively poor performance of overseas indices, meanwhile (notably
those of Japan and other Pacific Basin countries), inevitably prejudiced the
returns of investment vehicles which had 50 per cent of their assets
overseas at the start of last year.
Looking at performance over a longer time-frame restores the morale of fund
managers, and provides the main justification for investment in investment
trusts. Figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC)
indicate that the sector as a whole has shown banks and building societies a
clean pair of heels, looked its unit-trust rivals squarely in the eye, and
generally kept pace with the UK stock market as measured by the All-Share
index.
On average, for example, a Pounds 100 investment in a UK general investment
trust grew to Pounds 175 in the five years to last December, or almost
Pounds 475 over the 10-year period to end-1990. Leaving the money in a
building society over these periods would have left the investor with just
Pounds 155 and Pounds 239 respectively, while he would have been even worse
off in a bank deposit account.
The AITC monthly figures (available from financial advisers, stockbrokers,
or direct from the Association) are the best source of comparative
performance statistics. Two main yardsticks are used - share-price total
return, and net-asset-value total return, which in each case is a measure of
the combined performance of the capital growth and income.
The share price is what investors pay for their shares in the market. The
NAV is the current value of the assets backing each ordinary share issued by
an investment trust: it comes after deduction of all the liabilities due to
creditors, and all capital with a claim to repayment ahead of ordinary
shareholders.
Movements in net asset values are useful, because they arguably show more
accurately than share prices the skill, or otherwise, of the investment
manager. Share prices, on the other hand, represent the actual value of an
investment to the shareholder in the market, and may therefore be deemed a
more appropriate guide.
The difference between the share price and net asset value is known as
either the discount or the premium. At their simplest, these are a
reflection of the imbalance between supply and demand for investment-trust
shares, and can have a major impact on performance.
Last year, for example, a 4 per cent premium for trusts investing in the
emerging markets of Asia had turned into a 17 per cent discount at the end
of last year as investor enthusiasm waned. This year, by contrast, has seen
a revival of interest in small companies, and investment trusts have been
identified as a means of buying exposure to the sector. Trusts like TR
Smaller Companies have seen their discount narrow, while Kleinwort Smaller
Companies and Aberforth Trust shares have both been on a premium in recent
weeks.
It cannot be said often enough that past performance is not necessarily a
guide to the future. One-year figures, although keenly watched by investment
managers themselves and publicised in the press, are less reliable than
five- and 10-year statistics when it comes to gauging a trust's consistency.
Certainly, trusts with general investment objectives can be usefully judged
in this way, though the potential for takeover or re-rating in a high
discount should not be overlooked when it comes to making a choice.
Apart from looking at performance in isolation, it is as well to put trust
records into perspective. The normal yardstick is the FT-A All-Share index,
which reflects how the UK stock market as a whole has behaved. The advantage
of this is that it is well understood by the majority of investors. The
drawback is that, with many trusts largely or even wholly invested outside
the UK, it is not a particularly fair or meaningful comparison.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): Charges
separate them - Closed-end virtues / Investment trusts and unit trusts both
spread the risk. But there are important differences, which investors should
take into account - Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT AND unit trusts both claim to be the best route for people who
want to dabble in shares, but who have only a few thousand pounds, or even a
few hundred.
Both allow you to spread your risks. The trust itself will have a large
portfolio of perhaps 20 or 30 shares - a range which, as a small individual
investor, you could not possibly duplicate on your own, as the stockbroking
charges involved would be prohibitive.
But with a pooled investment, such as a trust, you buy a proportion of this
portfolio. There may be some bad performers - for example, quite a few fund
managers had British &amp; Commonwealth in their portfolios at the time of the
company's collapse - but at least they can be counter-balanced by healthy
shares.
However, there are important differences between investment and unit trusts,
which investors should take into consideration.
An investment trust is really a listed company that owns a portfolio of
shares. It is known as a closed-end fund, because the size of the portfolio
cannot be increased by simply selling new shares. Investors can only buy or
sell shares among themselves. As with any other company on the stock
exchange, supply and demand have an important influence on the share price.
Because of this, the price of shares in an investment trust is very rarely
the same as the value of its underlying investments (known as the net asset
value, or NAV). Normally the share price will stand at a discount to NAV,
although if this gets too wide, predators may be attracted.
A unit trust is an open-ended investment, which means that its total size is
determined by the number of investors willing to buy units, which are bought
and sold from the managers.
Every time someone buys new units in the trust, the managers need to buy new
stock to increase the size of the portfolio; and when investors sell their
units the reverse is true. So, when there is a stock market crash, as in
1987, and small investors panic and sell their units, it means that the
trust managers have to sell off a substantial part of the portfolio. The
value of the units always reflects the value of the underlying investments.
The most visible difference between these two forms of collective investment
is performance. The accompanying table shows that, on average, investment
trusts have tended to outperform unit trusts. Why?
One reason is the charges. A unit trust usually makes a front-end charge of
between 5 and 6 per cent, and an annual management fee of between 1 and 1.5
per cent for equity-based funds (to be fair, money-market funds tend to have
much lower charges). These high charges are used partly to cover the cost of
marketing unit trusts. With an investment trust, you pay stockbrokers'
commission to buy the trust shares, and the annual management charge is
about 0.5 per cent. This means that, over one year, unit trusts invest far
less of your money in shares than investment trusts, so that the difference
in performance is particularly pronounced. The affect accumulates over a
long period, as more of your money is actually invested in the stock market
by an investment trust than by a comparable unit trust - in other words,
less is eaten away by management charges.
Another important point to bear in mind is that investment trusts have more
freedom when it comes to how they invest their funds. An investment trust,
unlike a unit trust, is allowed to borrow against its assets or 'gear up'.
This means that when stock markets are at low levels - as they were, for
example, during the Gulf crisis - investment-trust managers can borrow money
in order to buy cheap shares. Gearing can be risky, however, in a falling
market, as some trusts discovered at the time of the 1987 crash.
Unit-trust managers, on the other hand, cannot gear and are often faced with
having to sell part of the portfolio when unitholders redeem their units in
times of crisis.
Investment trusts are allowed to invest in a wider range of shares,
including those in smaller markets and in unquoted companies. For example,
when eastern Europe started to open up to western investors about 18 months
ago, unit trusts were restricted to investing in quoted European companies
which stood to benefit from increased trade or business ventures in eastern
Europe. Investment trusts, on the other hand, were free to invest in actual
eastern European ventures.
Obviously such investments are risky. However, given that unit trusts must
invest in shares which are easy to dispose of, in case unitholders suddenly
liquidate their holdings, investors who are particularly interested in small
specialist markets will find a wider selection of funds available in the
investment-trust sector.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): A place in the
shop window - Ways must be found to appeal once again to the private
investor. It will not be easy, but there will be help from savings schemes,
Peps and new rules that permit trusts . . . / Investment trusts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER LONG years on the fringes of the retail investment business,
investment trusts are currently staging a vigorous fight to regain the
central position they commanded decades ago, until upstart financial
products such as unit trusts and personal pension plans came along.
Many of the investment-trust managers have come to the conclusion that they
have little future unless they find ways of appealing once again on a mass
scale to the private investor, or to the intermediaries who advise him.
That was the clear lesson of the takeover of Globe Investment Trust last
summer. The Pounds 1.1bn flagship of the investment trust industry was
mopped up for cash by the pension funds of British Coal, which saw the
mighty fund simply as an easy vehicle for channelling huge sums into the
stock market.
Although Globe attempted to whip up enthusiasm among its private
shareholders, it proved to be fatally weakened by the huge build-up of
institutional holdings over the years. More than 70 per cent of its shares
by the end were owned by institutional investors, chiefly pension funds, and
they were quite happy to get out at something close to underlying asset
value.
For other investment trusts, the demise of Globe has had its compensations.
The removal of some 5 per cent of the sector at a stroke eliminated an
important part of the excess supply; and with demand for equity investments
reviving strongly this spring, the average investment-trust discount has
fallen to some 12 per cent, the narrowest for many years.
But it would have been much better, from the investment-trust sector's point
of view, to have removed the surplus by stimulating demand rather than by
cutting supply. That is the task upon which the industry is now embarked. At
least some 30 new trusts were floated last year, but they were mostly highly
specialised, and often quite small.
In recent years, investment trusts have gained a reputation as the informed
saver's preferred vehicles, while less experienced investors have been
directed towards unit trusts or life assurance policies. Long-term savings
are usually sold rather than bought, and in the noisy environment of retail
investment the voice of investment trusts has only been dimly heard. But now
the publicity drive is being stepped up.
In the past 10 years, the typical investment trust has turned Pounds 1,000
into some Pounds 5,000, including reinvested net income. The average unit
trust would only have produced Pounds 4,000 over the same period. That is a
message that is worth proclaiming.
New opportunities are also arising. The introduction of personal equity
plans, especially in their latest form, has given investment trusts the
chance to sell up to Pounds 3,000 each year per investor with benefit of a
tax shelter. And soon the curbs on selling investment trusts 'off the page',
through clipped coupons, will be largely abandoned, at least in respect of
the savings schemes now operated by most of the investment-trust management
companies.
When the new rules of the Securities and Investments Board come into effect
later this year, it will be possible to sell most investment trusts in
exactly the same way as unit trusts are marketed.
There remain significant differences: investment trusts are more volatile in
their share prices, but offer lower costs and generally higher performance.
It is possible to offer more complex structures than for unit trusts, for
instance split-capital funds, which can offer certain advantages, though
with the risk of confusing amateur investors.
Yet some of the barriers are breaking down. Indeed, most investment trust
managers are heavily involved with unit trusts as well.
From the point of view of the private investor, the significance of these
developments is that he is likely to see increasing promotion of investment
trusts. Traditionally, they have only been available through stockbrokers,
but other outlets, for instance independent financial advisers, are also
opening up. And many investment trusts will now also sell directly to the
public.
But investment trusts have a big mountain to climb. They have total assets
of rather more than Pounds 20bn, but probably only a quarter of that
represents the holdings of private individuals.
In contrast, unit trusts are worth over Pounds 50bn, and although they have
institutional investors too, so that individuals probably own only about
Pounds 30bn worth, that is still five times the effective size of the retail
investment-trust sector.
The dominance of the big, institutional investors has caused a reshaping of
the investment-trust business. Big general funds, like Globe, have tended to
be vulnerable to takeovers, and there has been a growth of smaller,
specialised funds.
But big, general, low-cost and low-risk funds would make much more sense to
the average private investor, so long as ways could be found of stimulating
regular demand, so that sellers could be balanced by buyers. Otherwise,
there would always be a serious risk that the share price could slip back to
a big discount.
Besides savings schemes, which include regular instalment plans, perhaps
under the umbrella of a personal equity plan, there is also the possibility
of linking investment trusts to personal pension plans and life-assurance
contracts. Foreign &amp; Colonial, now the biggest investment trust at just over
Pounds 1bn, is exploring these latter opportunities through a link with
Skandia Life.
Yet there is a paradox in such developments. In competing with rival savings
media, investment trusts run the risk of being forced to adopt similar cost
structures. For example, savings schemes were originally launched as being
cheaper than dealing through stockbrokers, but some of them now charge a 3
per cent front-end fee which goes to intermediaries. This makes them
actually more expensive than going through a stockbroker, though not yet
quite as costly as unit trusts.
In moving from a dimly-lit corner of the bargain basement to the shop
window, investment trusts are gaining sales but are not necessarily offering
better value for money.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Discount
became a loss - Hindsight / Even a small-print reader may trip over the
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE INVESTMENT world is rife with traps for the unwary
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and they are not all set by sharks or fraudsters. Even innocent transactions
can take great bites out of your investments, if you are not careful.
Hard-won investment gains have a habit of seeping away through management,
dealing and other charges.
Attention to detail and a willingness to read the small print helps. But
even that is not proof against unexpected loss.
Mr Ron Boyce, a part-retired civil engineer from Hayling Island, is a
small-print reader. He is well-informed and has a healthy degree of
scepticism when it comes to trusting other people with his money. Yet Mr
Boyce and his wife, Sheila, still managed to see a large chunk wiped off
part of their investment portfolio during what should have been a routine
investment operation.
Mrs Boyce had held unit trusts managed by Prolific for four years when she
and her husband decided to switch the investment into a personal equity plan
(Pep) in February. Yet the deal ended up wiping 8.7 per cent cent off the
value of their investment, even after a special discount from Prolific.
The Boyces did not make any serious errors, and Prolific did not rip them
off. They were just the victims of what can often be costly inefficiencies
in the investment markets.
At the root of the problem is the fact that it is not possible to transfer
existing investments into Peps - they have to be sold and bought back. Also,
under Financial Services Act rules, there has to be a seven-day 'cooling
off' period after a Pep application is received, to give potential investors
a chance to change their minds. Taken together, these rules caught out the
Boyces.
Their application was received by Prolific towards the end of February, and
their units (in the company's High Income and Extra Income unit trusts) were
sold on 21st. The money was then held for seven days, before being used to
repurchase units within the Pep.
During that time, the Boyces were out of the stock market - an unfortunate
week to be in that position, as the market surged. According to figures
supplied by Prolific, this led to a 4.3 per cent rise in the unit price of
the High Income fund and 3.6 per cent for the Extra Income. Buying the units
back was therefore a lot more expensive.
A close reading of the small print in Prolific's Pep brochure does not make
this market risk altogether clear. It explains the seven-day rule. It does
not explain, though, that existing units will be sold immediately by the
company, rather than at the end of the cooling-off period, giving rise to
the market risk. Prolific has since told the Boyces that the seven-day rule
is no longer required, and that it is reconsidering its policy in this area.
Also, it says it sees nothing wrong with its literature and no reason to
change it. That accounts for part of the Boyces' 'loss'. The rest resulted
from an aspect of unit-trust pricing that, again, even the most careful
reader of the small print might not expect.
The Boyces expected to sell units at Prolific's bid price, and buy them back
at the offer price. The loss that resulted from paying the spread between
bid and offer prices would largely be recouped by a 4 per cent discount
offered by Prolific (3 per cent available to all clients who switch, and 1
per cent for taking out a Pep).
Prolific's Pep brochure gives illustrative figures for what the spread is
likely to be. At the start of this year it was 6 per cent (generally in line
with other unit trusts). The spread could get wider, though: there is a
maximum permitted spread of 8.2 per cent for the High Income unit trust, and
7.9 per cent for the Extra Income fund.
The Boyces ended up suffering virtually the biggest spreads permissible  -
8.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. Why was the spread so big?
Because, explained Prolific, of a change in the basis of pricing the units
during the week between the sale and repurchase.
There are two different ways of pricing units. The choice of method depends
on whether a unit-trust manager is selling more units to investors than he
is buying back (in which case he is creating new units), or buying back more
units than he is selling (in which case he is cancelling surplus units).
In the first case, a 'creation price' is calculated, to reflect the costs of
creating new units. This is the price at which they are offered to
investors. In such cases, a unit trust is said to be priced on an offer
basis, and the price moves towards the top end of its permitted range.
When the manager is a net buyer of units, on the other hand, it calculates a
'cancellation' price, to cover the cost of selling the underlying shares. In
such cases, the unit trust is priced on a bid basis, and the price moves to
the lower end of its range. So the pricing can change a lot, depending on
the manager's situation at any particular time.
The Boyces fell foul of this process. Between the time their units were sold
and repurchased, Prolific switched from pricing its units on a bid basis to
pricing them on an offer basis. That meant that the Boyces sold at the low
cancellation price, but had to buy back at the high creation price.
In all, these factors left the Boyces with 1,671 units in the High Income
trust (compared with the 1,793 they started with) and 1,126 in the Extra
Income trust (compared with 1,232). That equates to a capital loss of Pounds
247.96 (the pre-loss value of their investment had been Pounds 2,853).
It takes time and and care to build up investments. Such losses can take a
long time to recoup. Given the current rates of income on the Prolific unit
trusts, the switch to the Pep will save Mrs Boyce Pounds 28.63 a year in
tax. That means it will be nearly nine years before the tax savings from the
Pep more than make up for the cost of switching in the first place.
'We should have known better,' says a rueful Mr Boyce.
He had always been distrustful of Peps, aware of the high management charge
that can wipe out any tax advantages. But the discount offered by Prolific
helped to persuade him and his wife that the switch was worth the effort. If
careful and well-informed investors can lose a substantial amount from what
should be such a simple transaction, what hope is there for others?

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Financing a
family idyll - Serious Riches / It's been based on: acumen, luck and joint
decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY IS not the only currency,' observes Christopher Lloyd Owen. 'You can
be stinking mega-rich and unhappy.'
Mr Lloyd Owen is certainly not unhappy. Whether he qualifies as 'stinking
mega-rich' is another matter; but life's adventures have left him, at the
age of 38, with a seven-bedroom Jacobean house, tucked between the few hills
surrounding Norwich, and a considerable clutch of investments.
More important, he is happily married to his wife, Antonia, and has two
children - Edward, 10, and Rose, seven. All business decisions are taken
jointly, he says.
Business acumen, coupled, as he freely admits, with luck, built the family's
prosperity. After school at Winchester and university at the Courtauld
Institute in London, where he was taught by Anthony Blunt, he worked as an
art dealer for 10 years, and then built up small businesses, in London and
then in Norfolk.
It is vital to the philosophy guiding Mr Lloyd Owen's personal finances that
he lives his life, and tailors his finances to fit it - never the other way
around.
Business and finance are discussed thoughtfully and incisively, but opinions
on less dry subjects have a habit of bursting up into the conversation.
Topics include his wife, his children, animals, art, particularly bird art,
gardening, and shooting. The family home - crammed with prints, paintings,
and ornaments - bears testament to his earlier career as an art dealer. Six
sofas show that the family has been lucky to receive a number of legacies.
The house - his fourth  - is also the best example of the part luck has
played in the family's good fortune. He has bought all the four houses he
has ever viewed.
All the moves accidentally took advantage of property price moves. The first
two homes were in Wandsworth, before the yuppies moved in. Then the family
went to Battersea, just before gentrification had reached that far. In 1986,
at last able to move back to Norfolk where he had been brought up, he viewed
his present house, fell in love with it, and bought it with cash. Over the
following year, East Anglian property values almost doubled.
He has a Pounds 30,000 mortgage to take advantage of mortgage interest tax
relief, but has otherwise avoided debt to finance property buying.
He scorns speculative property investment, and does not intend to buy a
second house. 'I would have thought for most people their home would be a
sufficient property investment.
His conservative investment philosophy ensures the family's idyllic
lifestyle can continue. Mr Lloyd Owen took out a pension when he was 32,
which is now building 'nicely thank you'. But it was a wrench: 'It's very
hard for anyone to realise they are going to be 65. I forced myself to start
a pension, but every time you pay it out it's dead money.'
He runs the pension fund through his company, for himself, via Standard
Life.
This is the family's only collective investment. Unit trusts he considers
'dull and grey'. 'Imagine you had Pounds 5,000 to invest and you bought
Pounds 5,000 in UK equity units from some manager. How dull] Wouldn't it be
more fun to have Pounds 2,500 in BP and Pounds 2,500 in Marks and Spencer?'
He expands: 'If you have a portfolio of UK equities with a reasonable
spread, you've done exactly what the unit trusts have done. They have only
put several eggs in one basket.
He admits the worth of unit trusts for investing in foreign situations, but
resists moves by brokers in this direction.
'We hold a reasonably balanced British equity portfolio - haven't the
share-owning classes been owning British equities since the coffee-houses
started?
'Someone once told me the stock market is only the upper class betting shop.
At that time I was rather horrified. But there's a grain of truth in it.
'As investors, our balance is almost entirely widows and orphans stocks  -
blue chip companies like ICI, Guinness and Glaxo. We were both brought up
with the old-fashioned ideas that you should never sell capital and neither
a borrower nor a lender be. And we are too busy living life to bother with
short-term gambles and speculations.'
Their portfolio was for many years handled by Grieveson Grant, which joined
Kleinwort Benson at Big Bang. Mr Lloyd Owen then left Kleinworts for Laing &amp;
Cruickshank, and now also uses a broker in Norwich.
His reasons are clear and trenchantly expressed - some London brokers are
over-charging, and the future for small investors lies with regional
stockbrokers: 'I think the London brokers have decided not to give the
client what he wants, because their main fee income comes form corporate
work. The small client is having to pay huge fees for analysts.
'The provincial firm, because they don't employ analysts and don't have to
pay Pounds 120 a square foot, I believe is going to end up as the best
stockbroker. I think they will serve the small investors best.
'We left Kleinwort Benson when their fee became ridiculous. It was going to
be a third of the income from the portfolio, even if they neither bought nor
sold a share.'
He is also 'heavily into Peps'. 'Anyone with a portfolio who doesn't
annually move a small amount into a Pep is a fool.' The brokers are
instructed to boost the Lloyd Owens' Peps to their capacity every year.
The only other big investment goes towards schooling. At present, Edward is
at prep school in Northamptonshire, and Rose is still at a local village
school. Having made the decision to pursue a private education for their
children, the Lloyd Owens put a lump-sum into a school-fees capital scheme.
'We might have been able to do as well elsewhere, but we've also got a life
to lead, and the scheme is going to do it for us. At the beginning of every
term, we will get a handsome cheque. We can't get at the lump sum, but it's
done.'
Prudence over life's most weighty concerns means bland practicality never
stands in the way of a light impulse, as two delicate, and beautiful African
red-eared waxbills in the corner of the Lloyd Owen kitchen could testify. He
saw them while in a pet-shop to buy dog-food, and fell in love with them. He
bought a cage at the same time, and carried them home.
Impulse buying was off the agenda when he was an art dealer. Dealers, unlike
an auctioneers, own their own art.
Dealing is not for the faint-hearted, particularly if, as in Mr Lloyd Owen's
case, you work on your own account. 'The problem is that, to be a London art
dealer, you do not just need weekend money; you need quite major financing
if you want to buy really good pictures, which is why quite a lot of London
art dealers work for a bank.
'It's a very bad investment, art, anyway. You should never buy a picture for
an investment. Only buy a picture if you like it. You should only buy a
picture as an investment if you are a dealer - then you have a chance to
make a profit out of it. Buying any object for an investment is a gamble.
'I stopped because I could no longer afford to buy the pictures I wanted,
because I had just got married. That was in 1978. It was great fun - I was
very much what you might call a dealer's dealer. I owned shares in pictures
and bought from one dealer and sold to another, rather than having private
customers.'
Most dealings on his own account were in English Victorian painters, of whom
Frith, best known for 'Derby Day', was an example.
Mr Lloyd Owen says the experience taught him one thing: 'You have never sold
a painting until you have got the money. There are a lot of companies out
there supplying goods and having their customers going bust on them. It's
given me extraordinary caution about giving credit to people. If you work on
normal profit-margins and you do not get paid for 70 days, I would rather
not have the deal.'
This provides a direct line to the core of his current finances, his two
companies, both of which seem far-removed from the world of high art.
One, Promotion Sourcing Ltd, is owned entirely by the Lloyd Owens. It
supplies companies with promotional gifts, such as golf-balls, diaries or
beer coasters emblazoned with the company logo. 'I went into that in 1983
when I acquired 50 per cent of the equity. In 1985, I bought my co-partner
out of it.'
Then came the chance to buy into Hangar Press, a Norwich litho printer which
now shares a building with Promotion Sourcing. 'That's constituted as a
partnership. They are different organisations because I have a partner in
Hangar Press.
'We are keen on credit control, and we have minimal borrowings. We don't
bleed the business dry. The two companies have a workforce of 11 - and I
have cracking good employees. They are your most important investment, and
your biggest expense. We have great fun at work, and we make money.'
Christopher Lloyd Owen is a 'hands-on' businessman, and regards the
companies as the major financial effort in his family's life: 'They have to
be. And in a way, apart from providing us with an income, they are the only
bit of thinking financially that we do about inheritance. Selling out the
business could be my pension fund. We are conscious of that.
'But if you can have fun on the way ..'
'Imagine you had Pounds 5,000 to invest and you bought Pounds 5,000 in UK
equity units from some manager,' says Christopher Lloyd Owen 'How dull]
Wouldn't it be more fun to have Pounds 2,500 in BP and Pounds 2,500 in Marks
and Spencer?' Even a careful and well informed investor can lose money on
what ought to be a routine operation. Ron Boyce switched his Pounds 2,853
unit trust investment into a Pep, and it cost him Pounds 248

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): A simple way
into global bonds - Unit Trusts / Recessions are traditionally a good time
to buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS become something of an old saw that, for unit trusts, 'past
performance is no guide to future prospects'.
Managers who specialise in international bonds, however, are only too
pleased to tell this to clients, because performance in this sector has
historically been poor, and was particularly bad in 1990. Nevertheless, a
number of management groups, including Mercury, Barings, Newton and
Fidelity, launched new global bond unit trusts earlier this year.
The unit-trust international fixed interest sector dropped by an average of
6.2 per cent during 1990, according to Micropal. The sector has shown an
increase of only 20.2 per cent over the last five years on Micropal's
estimates. Over the last 10 years, it ranks 12th out of 19 sectors.
Bond trusts also consistently under-perform the market as represented by the
JP Morgan Government Bond Index. In the last five years, the index has
returned 24.97 per cent - 4 per cent better than the average bond unit
trust. In the last 12 months, the index has lost only 1.74 per cent,
out-performing by almost 5 per cent unit trusts, which are weighed down by
management fees.
Financial advisers have retained some hostility towards the trusts, because
of the high fees. Alan Torevell, of Torevell Mahon Granville, says that
exchange-rate risks have been understated by managers; while Peter Smith, of
Hill Martin, baulks at the front-end fees - he suggests buying bonds via
European banks.
However, trusts still provide the most practical way for small investors to
tap international bonds. This is because several bonds need to be held in
order to gain a 'spread' of risk, and deals are usually made in massive
amounts - for example, French government bonds normally change hands in
units of FFr10m (around Pounds 1m).
The need to hold currency reserves - made considerably less important by the
UK's full entry into the European Monetary System - in order to hedge
against exchange-rate fluctuations also makes it difficult for a private
investor to get involved.
Bonds are still not good long-term investments, as the BZW gilt-equity study
makes clear - Pounds 100 invested in gilts in 1918 would now be worth Pounds
47.30, while the same amount invested in equities would be priced at Pounds
8,039.20.
But the same survey shows the best annual price increases in UK gilts all
followed the trough of a recession: 1932, when prices rose 35.6 per cent;
1977 (30.6 per cent); and 1982 (36.2 per cent).
Recessions are traditionally good times to buy bonds. Interest rates are now
high, and the best time to buy into the bond market is when rates are about
to fall. When interest rates are high, investors need a high rate of return,
or 'yield', from bonds to tempt them away from other investments. As the
amount paid out each year is fixed, this can only be done by cutting the
price.
When interest rates fall, bond prices rise again. This explains recent
increased interest in UK gilts.
David Rosier, managing director of Mercury Asset Management, put it this
way: 'It was exactly this scenario that we had in 1982. Economic activity
was absolutely flat. The gilt-edged market in 1982 returned 52 per cent,
whereas the All-Share index returned about 30 per cent.'
Nicholas Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says: 'Where we are
now, with real yields very high, the Anglo-Saxon economies in recession, and
inflation falling, we think it's a very attractive environment for the
global bond investor.' He adds that 1990 was a bad year for bonds, because
the German government issued debt in order to finance reunification, and
raised interest rates. So prices fell.
There are strong arguments for investing in foreign government securities,
and not UK gilts, thanks to the UK's relatively high rate of inflation.
Inflation reduces the 'real yield' received by the investor.
Mr Rosier explains: 'If you look at inflation in this country, it is 9.5 per
cent. The yield on gilts is 10.5 or 11 per cent, so you are getting about 1
per cent real yield.
'French inflation is about 3 per cent, but the yield on French government
bonds is about 9 per cent. We think the opportunities for capital gains are
greater in international bonds, because of the real yields available.'
Paul Sheehan, manager of Newton Investment Management's fund, puts real
yields from French bonds at 9.2 per cent, and from Dutch bonds at 9.3 per
cent. He, like most of the other fund managers, will be concentrating on
European bonds.
He also notes that, since October, bond prices have already risen by 10 per
cent in the US, and by 15 per cent in Japan. European bond prices have yet
to start increasing.
Hambros Bank's model suggests that the optimum time for investing in bonds
may already have passed. This certainly seems to be the case in the
Anglo-Saxon economies, while European markets will not offer such good value
for much longer.
Mr Henderson admits that bonds have never outperformed equities over a
10-year period, and does not see this happening in the future. However, he
does see bonds as an ideal alternative to cash over a medium-term
perspective of two or three years, when equities may still be in poor
health.
Over this time-scale, global bonds trusts could provide one of the few
routes to a substantial gain, along with a welcome degree of security.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): A simple but
impertinent way into blue-chips with the Woolwich - Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWICH Building Society attempted in January to simplify the world of unit
trusts with the launch of its Stockmarket fund.
Investors are able to buy and sell units at their local building society
branches, with the help of a plastic card, which can also be used to get an
update on the value of their holdings. Contract notes are being issued, but
no unit certificates.
There is only one fund on offer, which will invest largely in UK blue chips
and will be managed by Mercury Asset Management. There is a minimum
investment of Pounds 500, or monthly savings of Pounds 25. In addition, a
special account has been established, where only the interest is invested in
the fund.
So far, over Pounds 10m has been raised and the Woolwich says it is 'on
target' for 50,000 account holders in the first year. The majority of
accounts opened have been personal equity plans, and there is a a high
proportion of regular savings plans.
However, after all the effort that was involved in establishing the fund, it
was a pity that the Woolwich did not eliminate one obvious drawback. Savers
in the Woolwich Prime Gold account, the main savings account, might imagine
that they can simply transfer a monthly payment from their savings into the
new fund.
But that is not possible. They can transfer money from their bank account,
or they can invest a lump sum. Alternatively, they could open a Woolwich
current account, transfer the money from the savings account to the current
account, and then transfer again into the stock market fund.
This last solution, however, means that savers have to fill in a
current-account application form, which means answering a vast number of
impertinent questions about their salaries and past employers. To endure so
much questioning for the privilege of giving the Woolwich money seems well
beyond the call of duty.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Gilts gave
best returns - Bonds / But political doubts have now unsettled the UK market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THREE months of political and economic uncertainty, the UK
government bond market turned in a creditable performance in the first
quarter, although analysts warn that the gains may not be repeated.
In fact, the gilt-edged market gave investors better returns than any other
major government bond market during the first quarter, measured in local
currency terms. According to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index Monitor, the
gilt-edged market gave investors a total return of 6.65 per cent over the
period.
This strong performance is not surprising, seen against a background of
sharply falling interest rates. The base lending rate stood at 14 per cent
at the turn of the year. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,
currently faces calls for rates to be cut by a full 1 per cent to 11.5 per
cent.
However, the rise in gilts prices over the quarter was largely concentrated
in the first few weeks of the year. For example, the benchmark 10 per cent
gilt maturing in 2001 stood at a yield of 10.21 per cent in the first week
of January. The price rose steadily during January, such that the yield had
fallen to 10.24 per cent by February 15.
Since then, however, there has been less pattern to the market, with the
yield bouncing back to touch 10.64 per cent by mid-March. There are two main
explanations for the uncertain tone to the market in recent weeks:
Political uncertainty, with the government seen to be split over the issue
of local government finance and in danger of losing an election later this
year. Although the Labour party has won many friends in the City, in general
the gilts market takes the view 'better the devil you know'.
Supply pressures, with the market depressed by the prospect of heavy
issuance of new government bonds. Mr Lamont predicted a government borrowing
requirement of Pounds 8bn this year, but many in the market expect the
eventual outcome to be higher. The effect of new issues on the market was
seen on April 5, when the Bank of England announced the issue Pounds 800m 9
per cent Treasury bonds, maturing 2008. The outstanding bonds fell by nearly
a point.
In the face of these uncertainties, investors happy to accept currency risk
have looked for value in overseas markets. Many have made currency exposure
work for them.
For example, the performance of the dollar on the foreign exchange markets
during March led to heavy gains for holders of dollar-denominated bonds.
Once the currency gains are taken into account, US government bonds gave
sterling-based investors a hefty return of 12.27 per cent over the quarter,
according to figures from Kemper Investment Management. This performance was
only bettered by Canadian, New Zealand and Australian government bond
markets - each of which gave sterling-based investors a total return of
around 16 per cent over the first quarter.
However, the foreign-exchange markets have recently shown once again that
they can be volatile. This poses a hazard for even the most sophisticated
investors.
For example, the dollar fell to an all-time low of DM1.45 on February 11.
Fearing a collapse, many central banks intervened to support it. Just six
weeks later, the central bankers were forced to intervene in the opposite
direction, trying to cap the dollar's meteoric rise. By the end of March,
the dollar stood at DM1.70. The movement against sterling was less severe,
but the warning is clear.
A less risky method of diversification might be to invest in some of the
European government bond markets. After all, sterling can only fluctuate by
6 per cent from its central DM2.95 exchange rate against the Deutsche Mark
within the European exchange rate mechanism.
But this is still enough to alter return on investment profoundly. Thus the
rise of sterling, from being the weakest currency in the ERM to the second
strongest (after the Spanish peseta) during March, depressed the returns
available to UK investors from top-performing European bond markets.
For example, French investors saw a total return of 6.45 per cent from their
own government bond market during the first quarter. The weakness of the
French franc, however, meant that UK investors saw a return of just under 4
per cent, measured in sterling terms.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Absorbing and
confusing - Mergers and buy-outs play havoc with portfolios / Equities,
French Market Profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH FUND managers and individual shareholders have watched helplessly
over the last year, as the list of stocks in their portfolios has changed
and dwindled without any intervention on their part.
A wave of mergers and buy-outs has eliminated from the French stock-exchange
list a growing number of companies ' often already controlled, clearly or in
practice, by a larger group, but nevertheless in many cases interesting
components for a fund manager's portfolio.
Under France's merger process, one company can be absorbed into another
following a vote at a shareholders' meeting. Minority shareholders who might
want to hold on to their shares have no choice.
This process has in recent months seen the absorption of Dumez, the
construction company, into Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water group; or Facom, a
maker of hand-tools, into Strafor, the office furniture group; of Compagnie
Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale (CFAO), the distribution and African
trading company, into Pinault, the timber group.
More recently, Alcatel Alsthom, the electrical engineering and
telecommunications group, has announced plans to absorb three of its listed
subsidiaries, including Generale Occidentale, formerly the holding company
of Sir James Goldsmith. Total, the oil major, plans to do the same with its
portfolio holding company Omnium Financier de Paris.
Paribas, the investment banking group, adopted a different procedure. Rather
than merging, it chose to offer its own shares in exchange for those of
Poliet and Ciments Francais, two building material companies which it
already controlled.
Although this technique leaves minority shareholders with the option of
hanging on to their shares, this particular deal caused even greater
annoyance, especially among foreign fund managers. After selecting a cement
or construction investment for their portfolio, most were furious at being
offered an exit into a banking stock.
Although this wave of mergers and buy-outs has provoked laments in the
French financial press about the dwindling choice offered to investors on
the Paris stock exchange, however, some investors have viewed it as a
healthy reorganisation of the stock-exchange list. One of the problems with
the Paris market, these commentators remark, is that so many of the
companies listed on the exchange are controlled by other companies.
French investors seem not to worry too much about their lack of voting power
in a wholly-controlled company ' wrongly, perhaps, in the light of the
numerous occasions in recent years, when minority shareholders have been
royally fleeced by the dominant shareholder ' but at the very least, this
state of affairs reduces the liquidity of the stock.
Often, particularly on the second market, the free float of shares is less
than 15 per cent, making it impossible for major investors to deal in any
significant size.
Even among the bigger companies which are not wholly controlled, a formal or
informal pact among the 'hard core' friendly shareholders often reduces the
real free float to 50 per cent or less. Bank of France statistics suggest
that 35 per cent of listed shares in 1989 were owned by individuals, 20 per
cent by institutional investors, 21 per cent by industrial and commercial
companies and 23 per cent by foreigners. But stockbrokers DLP James Capel
estimate that 50 per cent of the real float of the shares making up the
CAC-40 index are held by foreigners.
Among French investors, the statistics are open to some interpretation. The
latest figures for the number of individual shareowners stand at around 6m,
but these date back to 1988, just after the series of privatisations which
brought a wave of new investors into the equity market for the first time '
Paribas alone attracted 3.8m small shareholders on its privatisation in
1987.
Many of these neophyte shareholders have since sold out, or transferred
their holdings into mutual funds, which account for around 8 per cent of
equity investment.
France's mutual fund industry as a whole is larger than the rest of Europe's
put together, with over FFr1,444bn (Pounds 142.80bn) under management at the
end of January in Sicavs, or Societes d'Investissement a Capitaux Variables
(the main form of mutual fund), according to Europerformance, the specialist
organisation which monitors the sector.
However, the bulk of this money ' FFr1,052bn ' is invested in money-market
or bond funds. French equity funds are much weaker, and several French banks
have gone to the UK to look for additional equity fund-management expertise:
Societe Generale, the big high-street bank, acquired Touche Remnant, Banque
Indosuez, the investment banking arm of the Suez group, bought Gartmore, and
Credit Commercial de France, the medium-sized commercial bank, took over
Framlington.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) says the amount of money
invested through Sicavs in French shares plunged in the first nine months of
last year by FFr40bn, to finish up at only FFr102bn at the end of September.
One of the problems is that the government's latest tax-sheltered savings
plan, the highly successful Plan d'Epargne Populaire, or Pep, is designed
more to help fixed-interest investment ' unlike its predecessors, the Monory
plan or the Delors Compte d'Epargne en Actions, which explicitly set out to
boost equity investment. Savers are putting their money either in the Pep,
which attracted FFr105bn last year, or in short-term money-market Sicavs.
This has not stopped the CAC-40 index from climbing back to a band around
1850, but as companies start to call for cash ' such as Beghin-Say with a
FFr3bn combined rights and convertible bond issue ' it puts a crimp in the
flow of funds into the equity market. If the Paris index is to reach again
the peak of 2141 it achieved a year ago, it will depend heavily on new
investment from foreign institutions to fill this gap.

JAPANESE stocks soared in the first quarter, confounding those who thought
it would take the market a long time to recover from last year's plunge.
Early this month, the Nikkei index stood 12 per cent above its level at the
end of last year, and a full 33 per cent above last year's low. In terms of
total returns in sterling, the first quarter produced a rise of more than 20
per cent.
At around 26,500, the Nikkei still stood well short of its all-time high of
38,915, hit in December 1989, but the recovery had been strong enough for
many investors to believe that the market was unlikely to see 20,000 again
soon. The impetus for this year's rise came from the end of the Gulf war,
and from a belief that Japanese interest rates were about to fall.
Stocks began to recover even before the shooting stopped in the Middle East,
when it was already clear that Iraq could offer little resistance. The
decline in oil prices below Dollars 20 a barrel gave investors in the
Japanese market the assurance they needed that Japan's energy lifeline was
secure.
Meanwhile, investors began to believe that, after two years of high interest
rates, the Bank of Japan would shortly ease the cost of money. Following
reductions in US rates, a cut in the Japanese official discount rate, from 6
per cent was widely expected before the end of this month, even though Mr
Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, continued to insist that he had no
immediate plan to ease monetary policy.
His main argument was that, despite the squeeze on credit, the economy
showed only slight signs of slowing down. While car sales are falling, as
are housing starts, other indicators of economic activity still point up.
The economy, which grew by around 5.2 per cent in the year to March, is
expected by the government to expand by a further 3.8 per cent in 1991-92.
Labour shortages remain industry's biggest problem, not any threat of a
recession.
Investors are in two minds about where stocks might go next. The rally in
the first quarter was largely powered by foreign investors, who thought they
saw a chance for Japanese stocks to rise following surges in New York and
London. After the foreign buyers, Japanese individuals jumped into the
market.
But Japanese financial institutions remained rather cautious. Partly, this
is because they have less money than before to invest in stocks. Banks need
to maintain loans to industry, just as they need to control their assets
carefully to keep inside international guidelines on the ratio between
assets and capital. Insurance companies are expanding loans to industry just
as the net flow of funds from clients is diminishing. Investment-trust
companies are also seeing their customers leave for the safety of bank
deposits. Pension funds alone cannot take up the slack.
High interest rates are no friend to stocks, particularly in Japan where
dividend yields are very low and investors rely almost exclusively on
capital gains from their equity investments. Nevertheless, the resilience of
the Japanese economy, even during a world economic slow-down, means that
sooner or later some companies will generate profits increases large enough
to justify substantial re-rating of their stock. Despite pressure of rising
labour and other costs, this may not be too far away. However, stockbrokers
warn that not all companies will benefit from such gains.
Meanwhile, other stock markets in Asia and the Pacific also mostly ended the
quarter with considerable increases.
The easing of US interest rates inspired a general re-rating of markets in
the region. In February alone, stocks rose 25 per cent in Taiwan, and 30 per
cent in the Philippines. Rallies in Australia and Singapore were more
modest.
However, in all the region, including Japan, only in Hong Kong do stocks
stand well above their levels of a year ago. In other words, there is some
way to go before the losses of 1990 are recovered, let alone the highs of
pre-1987.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Sweden and
Spain record the biggest gains in a mixed Europe / Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE excluding the UK, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices,
showed a total return of 13.8 per cent in sterling terms in the first
quarter. Measured in local currency, January was just 1 per cen higher;
February saw a rise of 11.9 per cent; but the climb slowed to 2.4 per cent
in March.
The quarter began with the same caution that had followed the slide in
equities which began in August and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The
European market also shivered on January 11, as Soviet troops moved on key
installations in Lithunia; and it took its time about reacting to open
warfare in the Gulf, which began less than a week later.
Optimism about an early end to the war brought the gains in February, which
were consolidated and improved on in March. However, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100
index was actually a little lower at the end of March than it had been
nearly three weeks earlier.
The quarter saw wide variations between countries, with Sweden and Spain (up
28.5 and 26.5 per cent respectively) at the top of the list, and Norway and
Germany (up 8.3 and 7.7 per cent) at the bottom.
Sweden's economy, by the second half of last year, had been heading into
recession, with foreign investors withdrawing from its former high-flyers,
international blue chips such as the telecommunications group Ericsson. This
year, however, domestic financial institutions, flush with cash, have
returned to the home equity market. The economic and fiscal position has
improved, and there has been a spate of corporate activity to excite equity
investors.
In Spain, the economic squeeze imposed on consumers as long ago as 1988 has
borne fruit. Early in March, the strength of the peseta, the prospect of an
interest-rate cut and an improvement in the inflation figures took the
market up by some 8 per cent over eight days.
Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd said this month, in its continental European
strategy monthly, that for those with an upbeat view on the dollar, Norway's
shipping, oils and metals (where profits and asset values are dollar
sensitive) provide significant gearing to dollar strength. 'Our view,' they
said, 'is that this is more a story for 1992.'
Germany has moved from euphoria to gloom. Between the peak of Ostphantasie,
in March 1990, and the end of the year, its DAX blue-chip index dropped by
29 per cent, as hopes for the domestic market were replaced by anxiety about
international recession and its effect on big overseas producers such as the
chemicals company BASF or exporters such as Volkswagen.
This year, the market has laboured under the burden of reunification costs.
There have been estimates that the growth rate in Germany's GNP could fall
by between 0.5 and 1 percentage point. Tax increases that will pay for
restoring the former east Germany to health are expected to complicate a
wage negotiation round, which is already potentially acrimonious. And the
weakness of the Deutsche Mark shows how uncertain the economy has become.
For the rest, there are a range of opinions. BZW expects Europe to hold up
against the world index after what it sees as 12 months of underperformance.
Kleinwort Benson is 'generally bearish' but adding: 'The markets are set for
a period of consolidation after their recent strong run, but we do not
look for a significant setback in view of continuing high levels of
liquidity.'
Mr David Roche, of Morgan Stanley, has advised his clients to go underweight
in equities and raise cash, or to lock in profits using derivatives. 'In the
past 10 years,' he said in a mid-March EuroLetter, 'dividends have grown
faster than profits, which grew faster than national income. In the next
five years this order will be reversed.'

pours in as US investors believe the worst is over / Equities

<TEXT>
'WOW, WHAT a Quarter]' screamed the headline on Barron's, the US business
weekly. It summed up Wall Street's reaction to the performance of US stocks
in the first three months of 1991.
Between New Year and the end of March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
10.6 per cent, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 13.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks a record 29 per cent.
The main driving-force behind soaring stock values was an injection of
liquidity into the market at the start of the year. In the face of recession
at home, imminent war in the Gulf, declining corporate profitability and a
banking crisis, institutional and individual investors decided that the time
was right to put their money back into equities.
The reason: they felt things couldn't get any worse, that the bottom of the
recession was near, and that interest rates - already on their way down -
would continue to fall.
Money poured into the market from institutions, but especially from the big
investment funds, which benefited from an inflow of Dollars 3.1bn of private
investors' money during February alone.
The biggest winners were secondary stocks, perceived by investors to be
undervalued and offering the best earnings potential, and the Nasdaq market,
which saw average daily volume jump to a record 161m. Medical and
bio-technology stocks led the way, while on the Big Board financial stocks
shone.
Yet the market's ride has not been uniformly smooth. The year opened badly
as worries about the approaching quarterly corporate reporting season and
the effect of war on the economy sparked a 130-point decline in the first
two weeks. The onset of hostilities in the Middle East changed everything.
The Dow rose nearly 400 points on a wave of patriotic buying. The war and
recession were seen to have been discounted by the market, which was looking
forward six months to a period of peace and economic growth.
At the beginning of March, prices retreated on inflation worries,
profit-taking and some disturbing employment figures. The bulls returned,
however, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to stimulate economic
activity.
Yet the quarter had one nasty shock left up its sleeve: an unexpected
profits warning from IBM in late March, which sent the Dow spinning 60
points lower. However, the market's resilience since then, spurred by the
first signs of a recovery in consumer confidence, has persuaded Wall Street
that the rise in stocks since January has not been a bear market rally, but
the beginning of a fully-fledged bull market.
As for the second quarter, the opening days of April could give us a clue as
to what to expect. The Dow jumped 63 points one day, and dropped 18 points
the next. As the economy slowly chugs into life, analysts expect shares to
keep going up, but not in a straight line.
In Canada, the picture was similar to that seen in the US; the Toronto Stock
Exchange 300 index rose 7.3 per cent during the quarter, with smaller
capitalised stocks making up good ground.
In Mexico, the strong market showing at the end of last year was maintained
during the first quarter of 1991. The Bolsa Index rose 35 per cent between
January and March. According to DA Campbell, the US broking house which
specialises in the Mexican mar ket, the gains have been fuelled by strong
new demand from overseas investors, an economy growing at a rate of 5 per
cent a year, a series of imminent privatisations, and anticipation of a more
liberal regulatory climate.
Much of the renewed interest in Mexico has been stimulated by the
approaching flotation of the remaining shares of Telefonos de Mexico, which
makes up 18 per cent of the Bolsa index. The government is planning a global
offering of 25-30 per cent of the company, and demand for the stock in the
first quarter boosted Telmex's share price by over 50 per cent.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): London's
advance is part of a global re-rating of markets - Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE investors who got it right, the first quarter of 1991 has joined
the London stock market's roll of honour.
Total returns on equities for the three months have been bettered on only
four occasions in the past decade, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd. A
combination of lower UK interest rates, reduced pessimism over recessionary
pressures and the swift ending of the Gulf war proved very favourable for
investors.
The FT Actuaries All-Share Index returned 16.9 per cent for the quarter, the
FT-SE 100 Index 16 per cent. As the period drew to its close, the Footsie
was reaching forward daily to new all-time peaks, and retail investment
interest in UK equities was maintaining the welcome return to levels
regarded as viable, if not necessarily hugely profitable, for the London
securities industry.
However, as the quarter ended, the FT-A All-Share index was still about two
points below its peak and, in sterling terms, the UK underperformed the rest
of the world by about 4.5 per cent.
This focus on the broader-based market index, and on sterling values, has
much to say about the performance of UK equities. The advance in London was
part of a global re-rating of equity markets, reflecting a number of
factors, including the speedy end to the fighting in the Gulf and the
powerful rise in the dollar towards the end of the quarter.
The shift in currency values was a double-handed boon to the UK stock
market. The strength of the US currency boosted prospects for the big
dollar-earners which provide about a quarter of the aggregate earnings of
the Footsie list. At the same time, sterling's improvement within the ERM
currency table enhanced the opportunities for cutting UK base rates.
Base rates were cut three times during the quarter, to bring UK rates down
to 12.5 per cent by the end of March, with the equity market clamouring for
further cuts. The half-point cut in base rates just after Budget day
overshadowed the Budget itself, which was seen as neutral for the stock
market.
All equity sectors achieved positive returns over the period. But lower base
rates failed to inspire property shares, which underperformed the All-Share
by 9.9 per cent. Weakest of all were oil shares, which underperformed the
All-Share by 10.4 per cent - not, strangely, because of the Gulf conflict,
but rather because of negative views on crude-oil prices.
The successes ranged across the dollar-earning stocks, with Glaxo, Hanson,
BAT Industries, RTZ and Reuters Holdings prominent, to sectors recovering
from previous misfortune, such as engineering, textile and even contracting
and construction stocks.
As the market moved into the second quarter of 1991, some murmurs of
uncertainty could be heard in the City of London. The outlook for the US
dollar was less clear, and the Gulf war was now history. On the home front,
another half-point cut in UK base rates was expected, but 'the next move
down may be several months in coming,' commented the strategy team at BZW.
And there was a question-mark over German interest rates.
Institutions successful in equities in the first quarter may find other
opportunities ahead. More rights issues are likely to follow the Pounds 2bn
of the first three months, and the estimated Pounds 8bn public sector
borrowing requirement implies significant gilt-edged funding. Mr Ian
Harnett, at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, notes that if institutions
now switch into cash, they will effectively secure the return on a FT-SE
level of 2,650 for the year-end without needing to risk further investment
in equities.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Now it's time
to stop and think - The ascent has been dramatic and the analysts are
bullish, but . . . / Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHART says it all. From Mexico to Germany, not a negative mark in sight
in terms of total sterling return for the first quarter of the year.
Equities have been humming right across the world, with some quite
exceptional performances in many markets, not least Hong Kong, Singapore and
Sweden, each showing a return of more than 30 per cent.
The world investment market, excluding the United Kingdom, as measured by
the FT-Actuaries World Index, showed a January-March sterling return of more
than 22 per cent. The UK itself produced a 17 per cent return.
Suddenly, it seems, spring has come to the investment air. The suggestion in
this space in the last Review, that good bargains were to be had in many
markets, but notably in the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Japan, has been
proved right, with gains ranging from a relatively modest (given the cost
and problems of creating a single country) 5 per cent for Germany to almost
28 per cent in Spain.
The advance continued into the first trading days of the present quarter.
London, as measured by the Footsie index, had new highs on three successive
days earlier this month. A number of major markets hit a 1991 high in the
first week of April, including France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium
and Austria.
The global stock-market advance took many fund managers and individual
investors by surprise, and was certainly more rapid than expected. Markets
continued to show their preference for declining inflation, and may even
continue to rise in the face of somewhat disappointing corporate-earnings
prospects.
Caution says that the sharp rise in the 1991 first quarter must lead to a
pause, and a number of uncertainties do remain - not least the political
situation in the Soviet Union, which is seen as having a particular
influence on the German market.
Yet Goldman Sachs is almost lyrical in its World Investment Strategy
Highlights for April. 'We remain of the view that global equity markets are
at the 'beginning of the matter'. The 20 per cent advance from their lows
marks what we believe to be the beginning of a global equity bull market.
The move, coming as it does at a time of historically low and declining
inflation and interest rates, is wholly consistent with prior bull-market
advances.'
The herd instinct is in full bull-run, and this is always a time for some
hesitation. Most analysts are suddenly pointing towards an investment
nirvana - so it may be the moment to check that the lifeboats are available
if needed, or at least to test the waters selectively. To expect the first
quarter's global gains of more than 20 per cent to continue throughout the
year seems a risky forecast.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): 'If it gets
any worse, your houses could be at risk' - The plowshares / Recession
darkens the Review's soap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BEVERLY CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Plowshares, John and Alison, are a couple in their late forties with two
children: Lucy, who is at university; and Toby, who still lives at home.
John Plowshare is an architect earning Pounds 60,000, while Alison has a
part-time job as a receptionist at a doctor's surgery.
Because of the death of John's parents, and his subsequent inheritance, the
Plowshares have a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 in unit trusts, Pounds 6,000
each in a personal equity plan, and just over Dollars 36,000 deposited in
the building society.
In this episode, we find John and his partners Tom and Amanda at the
Plowshares' house, mulling over the rather bad news that their accountant
has given them on the current financial state of their partnership.
IT'S MONDAY evening, and John, Tom and Amanda are gathered round the kitchen
table in the Plowshares' kitchen, conducting a brainstorming session on the
state of the architectural industry today, and the more immediately pressing
problem of the state of their architectural practice today.
'Something's got to give,' says Tom. 'We just can't afford all these
overheads.'
Business, largely from the public housing and office-building sectors, had
flooded into their practice for eight years, until last summer when the
impact of high interest rates caused a significant drop in worthwhile
enquiries. Since then, the staff have been kept busy, finishing off current
projects. Now, the facts have to be faced: that there isn't any more, or any
likelihood of any more, work on the horizon.
'Yep, something's got to give,' agrees Amanda, sadly pouring herself another
glass of wine.
John casts a wistful glance out of the window at his brand-new
top-of-the-range car parked outside the garage, gleaming with prestige and
bursting with executive gadgets. Through the other window, he can see his
partners' cars, parked in the street and looking equally appealing and
equally expensive. He heaves a sigh. 'Right, let's get down to it.'
Mr Ledger, the company accountant, has studied the books, talked to each of
the partners and written a massive plan of action, to try to save the
practice. He has pointed out that, as a partnership, the three architects
have unlimited liability against partnership debts.
'If the problem gets any worse, your houses could be at risk,' he has told
them. 'If you make severe cutbacks now, while you still can, you might be
able to salvage enough of a business to have something left when the good
times come around again.'
The Budget, largely aimed at helping companies with difficulties such as
theirs, has in fact little real help to offer the partnership. However, Mr
Ledger has recommended that the partners switch to paying VAT on a cash
basis, in response to the campaign the Customs &amp; Excise department has
started: 'Even with current problems, your income is over the Pounds 35,000
threshold but well under the Pounds 300,000 limit for cash accounting,' says
Mr Ledger. 'Switching to only paying VAT when you actually receive payment
will give you a massive cash-flow injection which is something you really
need at the moment.'
The first cutback is that the remaining staff - who, apart from the three
partners, amount to Dawn, the office manager, and an architectural student
gaining practical experience - are to be made redundant.
'You'll have to manage any work that comes in on your own,' says Mr Ledger,
'even typing the letters. The staff have been with the practice for less
than two years, and so are not entitled to redundancy money. They have been
paid on a PAYE basis, and over the past three months payment of their tax
has fallen into arrears.
'Keep it that way,' recommends the redoubtable Mr Ledger. 'There's no
interest on PAYE arrears, and you have your own tax bills coming up. If you
go into arrears on those, you will pay interest.'
The thought of the July approach of tax bills has sobered up the threesome
even further. Self-employed people pay their tax on a year-before basis. The
tax bill that arrives in July will reflect earnings for the year 1989-90 - a
year that John, Tom and Amanda remember, now rather ruefully, as a
high-income year.
The partners have stopped paying themselves salaries, and their payments
into pension plans and private medical insurance schemes have been suspended
 -dismissed as luxuries by Mr Ledger. The accountant has also recommended
that the partners chop up their company credit-cards, and as each wields the
kitchen scissors the gloom deepens.
The partnership's offices are the next to receive the attention of Mr
Ledger. The office rent has fallen into arrears - a step that Mr Ledger
approves of: 'Hold fire on the rent,' he stoutly advises. 'You need the cash
too much. Advertise to sub-let your spare office space. A large empty office
has bad vibes for creative people.'
But poor John, Tom and Amanda don't feel very creative. John has been in
touch with the Royal Institute of British Architects, to see what help they
can offer. The RIBA's London region redundancy counselling service has
proved to be extremely busy at the moment - which John finds comforting, in
a gloomy sort of way - and the advice offered has proved upbeat and
positive:
'The RIBA has told me that part of the strategy for surviving the recession
at the moment is to be well-placed to take advantage of the up-swing,' he
says. 'They recommend taking a long and honest look at the practice,
analysing strengths, weaknesses, resources and staff expertise.'
The partners look at each other with some amusement, hunting for signs of
expertise, but the atmosphere does cheer up a little as they each decide to
take a new area in which to research new business opportunities.
John fancies himself as a 1990s Green person, and so volunteers to research
developments in energy-saving and environmentally-sound work. Tom has been
the housing king in his time, and is looking towards bombarding the Housing
Corporation, which remains a great unknown at present but might have funding
free next year, with quantities of material on the merits of using their
practice over all others.
Amanda, looking towards 1992, has decided to look into developing
opportunities for undertaking work in France, in partnership with a French
architectural firm that has plenty of work at the moment.
The three partners hope that from this evening's session they will emerge
leaner, fitter and ready to take on any improvement in the construction
sector. 'We'll certainly be leaner and fitter, whatever happens,' says Tom,
sweeping the credit-card pieces into the bin, reflecting dolefully on his
lost access to lost lunches.
Later that night, the Plowshares - Alison, John and Toby  - gather around
the kitchen table to discuss the matter. Toby casts a sideways look at his
harassed father, and asks with apparent innocence: 'What are you going to do
about the cars? I don't suppose you can afford those any more.'
'We didn't talk about the cars, actually,' John replies, through gritted
teeth.
The cars, most beloved of the company toys that the partners have invested
in, should go, on the advice of Mr Ledger. 'The leases are too new to have
any value, but you would be wise to get rid of them and downgrade your cars
to something cheaper, particularly now that the Budget has increased the tax
burden for company cars,' says Mr Ledger. 'It's a short-term move, but it
would really help cash-flow. And, with the new tax, get rid of these mobile
phones if you really want to save money.'
Banished to using a phone box and driving a Mini, John grows philosophical.
That night, before turning out the kitchen light, John takes one last look
at his car parked outside the house. 'Ah well,' he reflects, 'no
central-locking, winding up the windows. . . It'll be good exercise for me,
at least.'

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Make the most
of high interest - Tessas / A few fixed-rate deals are still available
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THAT base rates are coming down, many savers are no doubt wishing they
had locked into fixed-rate savings at the start of the year.
Three separate base-rate cuts in February and March - adding up to a 1.5
percentage points and taking the base rate down to 12.5 per cent - have
naturally taken their toll on savings rates.
Many of the tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) either lowered
their rates or stayed put. Competition between banks and building societies
in the Tessa market is particularly keen, and they are reluctant to risk
losing customers by lowering the interest rate.
For savers who want to lock into a high interest rate, there are a few banks
offering fixed-rate Tessas.
Confederation Bank (tel 0438 744-238) has a five-year fixed-rate Tessa with
a gross compound annual rate (CAR) of 11.25 per cent. You have to invest a
lump sum of Pounds 8,040 and, each year, the appropriate sum is switched
into the Tessa from a feeder account. The rate on the feeder account is also
fixed at 11.25 per cent, but remember that interest on feeder accounts is
liable to income tax if you are a taxpayer. The penalty for transfer or
closure is 180 days' interest.
National Mortgage Bank (tel 021 712-2800) recently launched a five-year
fixed-rate Tessa, which pays 11 per cent gross CAR. Again, you make your
deposit into a fixed-rate feeder account, but in this case, the minimum
investment is Pounds 5,000. There is a penalty of 180 days' interest for
transfer or early closure.
If you are worried about locking into a fixed rate for five years, Save &amp;
Prosper/Robert Fleming (tel 0800 282-101) have a one-year fixed-rate Tessa.
The rate is fixed at 10.25 per cent gross CAR, and after one year you can
choose to switch your money into S &amp; P's variable-rate Tessa or you can opt
for another year at the fixed rate - though bear in mind that the new fixed
rate could be much lower if the base rate has been cut substantially. The
minimum investment is Pounds 500, and the maximum is Pounds 3,000 in the
first year. Interest is credited monthly, and you can withdraw net interest
quarterly if you want. There is a discretionary Pounds 50 penalty for
transfer or closure.
Bear in mind, too, that S &amp; P's fixed rate of 10.25 per cent is well below
the 12.18 per cent gross CAR being offered on its variable rate Tessa, and
that many variable-rate Tessas on the market are offering 15 per cent or
more. No one is giving any clues as to whether they will be lowering their
rates in the near future, so it is rather a gamble. However, if you do
decide to plump for a variable-rate Tessa, you would be wise to choose one
with no transfer penalties, as this will allow you to move your money into
the most competitive Tessa at short notice.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): A debt may
well be good for us - Paying off the mortgage / Basic-rate taxpayers should
look before they leap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUR PARENTS probably told us to stay out of debt if we possibly could. Good
advice, in the main. However, one kind of debt may be worth clinging to -
the mortgage.
Many people realise this, as is shown by a survey conducted by Mori for
Scottish Amicable, the life insurance group. Asked how they would use a
Pounds 30,000 windfall, 42 per cent of respondents said none of it would go
towards repaying their mortgage. Only 13 per cent said all of it would.
The proportion who would repay rose with the size of the mortgage. Only 31
per cent of those with a Pounds 40,000 mortgage said they would not break
into their windfall to repay any of the loan, while 28 per cent said it
would all be used to reduce the debt. This suggests that people are well
informed about mortgages. On loans up to Pounds 30,000, tax relief on the
interest makes them very cheap debts - despite the Budget - but the net
interest rates paid on larger loans are worth avoiding. This is shown by
comparing the real rate of interest paid on a home loan, after mortgage
interest tax relief, with the rates of interest available elsewhere.
On the first Pounds 30,000 of a mortgage, the net interest rate after
mortgage-interest tax relief, is currently 10.31 per cent, according to the
Building Societies Association. This will become better value if interest
rates continue to fall.
If any kind of debt makes you lie awake at night, then it is probably best
to pay off the mortgage as soon as you have the cash to do so. However, some
people, including mortgage-lenders themselves, argue that this approach is
unnecessarily prudent, because you should be able to find a safe alternative
investment that offers a higher rate of interest than you pay on your
mortgage - for example, tax-exempt special saver accounts (Tessas),
index-linked gilts or national saving certificates.
Steven Berry, of Hill Martin, points out that the new regime of independent
taxation and the abolition of composite rate tax on building-society
accounts for non-taxpayers, have made this easier - a non-tax-paying spouse
can receive some interest gross, while paying off debt net of tax.
By investing in this way a sum that might otherwise be used to reduce a
mortgage, you still have the cash in hand. For as long as you have a
mortgage, your building society is available to help with loans for
home-improvements or repairs.
John Bridel, adviser with Towry Law, adds: 'Very often one should keep the
funding vehicle going, anyway.' He points out that you should not
necessarily repay endowment-linked mortgages in full, as you will lose the
terminal bonus of the life insurance policy linked to the mortgage.
The money put towards the life policy makes up a relatively small percentage
of the total monthly payments, points out Mr Bridel; but the balance of the
final maturity value, after you have paid off the loan, could be very useful
 -for instance, to invest for retirement income. The terminal bonus, which
could be lost, makes up much of the return from with-profits policies.
Sometimes, too, one is required to pay an exit-fee when clearing a mortgage.
If you decide to pay off without notice, some lenders may charge a maximum
of an extra three months' interest on redemption. The Building Societies
Association says this would almost certainly be waived in most cases, and
the big societies do not make the charge, but it is as well to check the
small print in your contract. Check, too, on fixed-interest mortgages. The
special arrangements that the lender has made in order to offer a fixed rate
will be thrown awry by early repayment; and a justifiable fee of around
Pounds 100 will normally be payable.
You pay the full gross rate on all of the mortgage that is outstanding above
the Pounds 30,000 limit for mortgage tax relief. Last year, gross mortgage
rates managed to exceed 15 per cent. You are unlikely to find another
investment that can guarantee to match this return - though Tessa rates
appear to be remainining high while mortgage rates come down - so the best
bet is to use any lump sum to pay off any of your mortgage in excess of
Pounds 30,000.
The abolition of top-rate mortgage tax relief has made mortgages
significantly less good value for the very well off, and tax relief must be
subject to continued political risk. Successive governments have allowed the
threshold of Pounds 30,000 to be eaten away by inflation - if it had been
indexed from its rate in 1974, the threshold would now be almost Pounds
120,000, according to Hill Martin - and it might be cut completely by a
Labour government. The Conservatives intend to cut basic-tax rates, which
would reduce the amount of relief.
All such changes shift the logic in favour of repaying more of the mortgage.
But it is worth timing the move carefully if you have a building-society
repayment mortgage, because the societies charge interest on the capital
outstanding at the beginning of their year, and then collect it over the 12
months. On this basis, you should make your repayment towards the end of the
building society year - most societies have a December 31 year-end.
If you are repaying a part of the loan on which you are receiving tax
relief, you should let your tax inspector know as soon as possible, says Mr
Bridel. Otherwise you could find yourself with a big tax bill at the end of
the year.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Newcomers cut
the premiums - Insuring your home / The UK's climate may be changing - but
so is the industry's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS OUGHT logically to expect to pay considerably more for their
house buildings insurance this year. The storms of January 1990 - one of the
worst insured losses ever in the UK - were followed during the year by
record subsidence losses of nearly Pounds 1bn.
One might have expected all that to translate into a pretty sizeable
increase in premiums - especially in the context of more general climactic
trends, which are making insurers view the UK as something of a catastrophe
zone.
However, the picture is a more complex than it seems. For one thing,
competition within the insurance industry is hotting up. The few big UK
companies that once dominated the British market no longer have such a tight
grip; while the liberalisation of the European insurance market is leading
French, Swiss, German and other companies to compete in the UK.
The competition has led a number of insurers to seek ways to reduce the cost
of distributing insurance. In particular, a number have begun direct-sales -
combining newspaper, television and radio advertising with sales over the
telephone - in order to cut out the middleman.
Most British householders buy their house building insurance through their
building society, paying a commission of about 30 per cent for the
privilege. High-street insurance brokers also charge commission which, while
it is less than that charged by the building societies, can still amount to
between 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the bill.
In contrast, direct-sales companies can distribute their policies more
cheaply (with the cost of advertising and telephone back-up generally less
than the commission) and offer lower premiums.
New entrants to the market, like Royal Bank of Scotland (Direct Line) and
the Swiss company Wintertur (Churchill), are among the pioneers of
direct-sales methods; but other companies, such as Royal Insurance and
General Accident, which already have a sizeable share of building-society
business, have set up direct-sales operations.
At the same time, insurers are beginning to differentiate between risks,
charging rates that vary according to the age and building style of a
property. They have charged different rates for house contents, according to
location, for several years; this year, at least two have announced that
they are also considering varying buildings rates according to location.
The reason for this is that properties built on the clay soils of south-east
England, especially those with the shallower foundations typical before
1945, are more vulnerable to damage by subsidence. A number of buildings in
coastal or river-valley locations are more susceptible to flood, and
homeowners in such localities can also expect to pay more.
With greater competition, companies are concerned to meet claims quickly,
and are offering sophisticated back-up services. A number now offer all
policyholders the use of telephone help-lines.
For example, General Accident's policyholders have free access to the
company's advice-lines, which give customers advice on dealing with all
practical elements of a claim, including access to a recommended list of
local plumbers, electricians and other services. Royal Insurance offers a
similar service: the company's 'gold' policy provides a combined
house-buildings and contents insurance, with legal-expenses insurance, as
well as 24-hour access to a help-line.
As far as pricing is concerned, the position is clearest with buildings
insurance. The leading insurers that sell through building societies (Royal
and Sun Alliance, for example) increased their premium rates to 2.20p per
Pounds 1,000 of cover following a 10 per cent rate increase at the end of
last year.
The increases will widen the disparity between these rates and those charged
by over two dozen other companies. The direct writers obviously are among
them. Direct Line offers a rate of Pounds 1.60, for example. But there are
also a number of companies that sell either through brokers or their own
agents: they include Zurich Insurance and Co-operative Insurance Society.
Zurich sells its products through independent brokers, offers a rate of
Pounds 1.40 per Pounds 1,000 of cover for properties built after 1919, and
Pounds 1.70 for properties built between 1850 and 1919 (although this is
only available to customers living in areas safe from flooding or
subsidence).
Co-operative Insurance Society, the Manchester-based insurer, recently
reduced its rates to Pounds 1.60 for homeowners insuring homes built after
1945, and Pounds 1.80 for homes built before that date. Zurich says its
policies are cheaper than those offered by the major companies, because it
sells through independent brokers.
The new direct-line underwriters also offer cheaper home buildings policies.
Underwriters at Lloyd's of London offer a basic rate of Pounds 1.75, but
substantially less than this in some cases. High-value properties can win
cheaper rates, for example. Rates of Pounds 1.50 per Pounds 1,000 are not
uncommon for houses worth Pounds 250,000 or more, and for a house worth more
than Pounds 1m a rate of Pounds 1.25 is available.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Helping the
homeless - What's New? / . . . with a possible 40% return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSURED-tenancy Business Expansion Scheme survived the Budget without a
scratch. Most advisers had expected these relatively low-risk BES
investments to come under the hammer.
So all the better for House the Homeless of London II, which has launched
its second assured-tenancy scheme. It has two aims: one, to ameliorate the
plight of homeless in the capital and; two, to guarantee a 40 per cent
return on investments.
The scheme is run in conjunction with the Peabody Trust, a registered
charity, founded in 1862. House the Homeless will buy vacant properties on a
leasehold basis, letting them to the homeless. At the end of five years, the
Peabody Trust guarantees to buy the properties at 140 per cent of the asking
price. The risks? As with most assured tenancies, everything hinges on the
viability of the prospective purchaser.
'Peabody Trust has a property portfolio of just under Pounds 1bn and gets
grant of millions of pounds from the government every year,' says Keith
Turpin, of Touche Ross, financial advisers to House the Homeless of London.
But no matter how profitable the company, there is no guarantee that a
change of government will not see off assured tenancy schemes. A sobering
thought, with a general election due next year, if not this.
The biggest Budget boost for the savings industry was aimed at friendly
societies - and children, says Mark Rittner, of financial advisers Rathbone
Brothers. In other investments, 'if a parent makes a gift to a child, the
income on that gift is attributed to the parent and taxable. In friendly
societies, however, the income is solely attributed to the child and
tax-free,' says Mr Rittner.
This year, the chancellor raised the annual tax-free investment level in
friendly societies from Pounds 150 to Pounds 200, and revived the right to
issue children's life policies on a tax-exempt basis. The government imposed
a quota restriction on life policies for children in 1985, the effect of
which was to stop many friendly societies from issuing them.
'We are particularly thrilled,' said Peter Gray, general manager of
Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society. 'And we are definitely bringing
back a Baby Bond (a bond written on the life of the child, which can be
redeemed at a certain age or continued indefinitely).' Tunbridge Wells
Equitable offers two types of baby bond - a traditional with-profits policy,
and a unit-linked one based almost exclusively in equities.
Clive Scott-Hopkins, of independent advisers Towry Law, recommends Tunbridge
Wells's with profits contract: 'It's very competitive and has been one of
the top 10 performers for years.'
While providing a nest-egg for children is a good idea, and the
friendly-society route a relatively affordable one, parents would do well
also to plan for education. The average annual fees for independent boarding
schools in 1990 was Pounds 6,000, according to statistics from the
Independent Schools Information Service. For independent day schools, the
figure stood at Pounds 3,300.
Educational trusts are a route to be recommended only if you are sure the
money will be used for school fees, and as long as they retain their
charitable status. These conditions met, then Save and Prosper and the
School Fees Insurance Agency have unusual features in their schemes. A
lump-sum buys an annuity to provide termly payments. Although the yields on
this investment are relatively low, income tax, which is usually deducted
from the taxable element of the annuity payments, can be reclaimed.
Parents wishing to provide for their children's future would also be well
advised to examine ways of minimising inheritance tax. M &amp; G's Estate
Protection Plan - a life policy written under trust  - was named the winner
of the Financial Adviser's product of the year award for its user-friendly
and flexible approach. (Financial Adviser is a weekly newspaper for
financial intermediaries, published by the FT).
At its simplest, the plan sets up a trust outside the client's estate,
designed to pay the inheritance tax when it falls due, says David Druce,
life product development manager of M&amp;G. The premiums on the life policy can
be paid in either monthly or annual instalments - or, unusually, in a lump
sum. M &amp; G also produces an easy-to-understand inheritance tax guide, which
was part of the package commended by Financial Adviser judges.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Beware of the
overdraft trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES are coming down, but in many cases overdraft interest charges
have actually gone up in the last six to nine months. So now may be the time
to look more critically at interest-bearing current accounts.
Interest paid on balances in credit has fallen in quite a striking fashion.
In July last year, Abbey National paid 6.25 per cent gross on all balances
in credit. Today the figure is 4.5 per cent. Girobank paid a net 9 per cent
in July; today it pays 6 per cent.
As amounts to be earned from interest-bearing current accounts on balances
shrink, it is surprising to see that quite a lot of large banks and building
societies have actually raised their overdraft interest rates since last
summer.
This seems hard to justify, and holders of interest-bearing current accounts
seem likely to be especially hard hit: the downside of these accounts is
that overdraft charges, especially for unauthorised overdrafts, are
generally higher than on the old non-interest bearing variety.
The Woolwich Building Society, which has trimmed its overdraft rates, is a
shining exception. Some of the large clearers do fairly well, too: Barclays
and NatWest have held their authorised rates unchanged. Lloyds is planning
to reduce its rates on Monday April 29.
Most other large players in the market have increased their interest-rate
charges since last summer, even though base rates have fallen. A more
glaring injustice is hard to imagine. An unauthorised overdraft on Midland
Orchard or First Direct will now cost you 38.1 per cent (up from 37.6 per
cent last summer). Nationwide Anglia Building Society, with a charge of 39.2
per cent (36.8 per cent last summer) wins by a short head.
Meanwhile, earnings from the accounts are likely to fall. 'All our
interest-bearing accounts have been affected by the base rate moving down
and the abolition of composite rate tax,' says a Lloyds Bank spokesman.
Further falls in base rates will probably mean the attractions of
interest-bearing accounts will be progressively reduced.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): It may be time
for a fixed-interest mortgage - In the High Street / Look for a loan at 11%
cent or less, over three to five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THIS the time to be going for a fixed-rate mortgage? Yes, say an
increasing number of mortgage specialists. They believe that interest rates
will soon bottom out, and that there is no likelihood of a return to the
sort of interest rates seen in 1988.
'The underlying rate of inflation in the UK suggests to me that mortgage
rates will climb back above the 12 per cent level not long after the next
election,' says one foreign lender in London. 'This means that the current
generation of fixed mortgages is close to being as low as they are likely to
get.'
Mortgage brokers report that fixed-rate and capped-rate mortgages make up
most of the business they are doing at the moment. Bargain offers go fast
when they appear on the market. A mortgage from Portman Building Society,
with interest of 11 per cent fixed for two years, was sold out in five days
this spring.
More typical is a three-year fixed-rate mortgage at 11.75 per cent (APR
12.59 per cent) from Scarborough Building Society, available until the end
of April or a two- or three-year fix at 11.45 per cent from Girobank.
The sort of mortgage to look out for in the months ahead is one with an
interest rate of 11 per cent or less for an extended period, three to five
years. They may not compare very favourably with the sort of mortgages on
offer in the spring of 1988, but they are probably all that can reasonably
be expected from the UK market in the foreseeable future.
If you contemplate switching to a fixed mortgage, ask what the annual
percentage rate is - on the Girobank mortgage quoted above it was 14.6 per
cent, for example. Also enquire what hidden or additional charges there may
be; and whether there are substantial early-redemption penalties if you
repay the mortgage early.
Most reputable lenders will not make you pay redemption penalties if you
stay with them when moving house and getting a new mortgage. But some have
been making good money in a difficult market over the last few years by
stinging their other customers for early-redemption penalties averaging
around three months interest.
The justification for this is that lenders are committed to funding at a
pre-agreed price for the life of a fixed-rate mortgage, and that if the
customer redeems early because interest rates have fallen, the lender may be
left with expensive funds on its hands.
This month John Charcol, the mortgage brokers, put a two-year fixed-rate
mortgage on the market at 11.75 per cent (12.6 APR) which is especially
flexible: not only can it be a repayment or an interest-only mortgage, as
well as one of the endowment variety, but it has no redemption penalties,
though there is a Pounds 195 administration charge on completion of the
mortgage. Ian Darby, John Charcol's managing director, points out that 11.75
per cent is well below the average mortgage interest rate of the last 10
years.
Some home-buyers will hold on until election time - when we may expect base
rates to fall. But it is wise to remember that lenders are already able to
tap the advantages of expected future base-rate falls and offer them to
their customers through fixed-rate and capped mortgages. If you are planning
to make a move in the mortgage market and wait too long, you could find you
have left it too late.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Inflation won't
savage modest starters - Investing For Income / And the golden rule, as with
any investment, is to spread the risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCOME IS the main reason why many people have investments. Either they have
retired, and their pension is inadequate for their needs; or they are
relying on their investments to meet some pressing commitment such as school
fees.
It is natural that many should put their money into building societies when
they want income. The societies offer products that are easy to understand;
they are accessible; they offer a guarantee of capital return; and they are
universally perceived as safe.
But if you expect to need income from your investments over a long period,
building societies are a dangerous home for your savings. They provide no
protection from that great enemy of investors - inflation. A retired widow,
now with the state pension and a small pension from her late husband's
employers, may feel reasonably well off with savings of Pounds 50,000: she
could earn a gross income of as much as Pounds 7,000.
But in 15 years, inflation compounded at 5 per cent annually would halve the
real value of her building-society deposit. If interest rates also fell,
then the same sum might provide an income of only Pounds 5,000 - worth just
Pounds 2,500 in today's prices.
To avoid the rigours of inflation, you have normally to sacrifice income
now, in order to achieve capital growth, and thus, the prospect of a higher
income in future.
The sure way to protect yourself against inflation is to buy index-linked
gilts or national savings certificates. But in the former case, the
immediate income is only 2 per cent gross, and the latter pay no income at
all. So if you do need to live off the income from your investments, only a
small proportion of your portfolio can be placed in either of these
vehicles.
Equities have proved, over the long term, to be one of the best hedges
against inflation; but, as James Higgins, of London-based fee-charging
advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'Not everyone can afford to wait until
the yield on the average unit trust grows sufficiently so that it provides a
reasonable income.'
Mr Higgins has designed a scheme that will yield a high immediate income,
but which also permits the investor to share in the fortunes of investment
vehicles that are better longer-term achievers.
'Up to one third of the available sum is used to purchase a five-year
temporary annuity, taking advantage of the high rates we presently enjoy,'
he says. 'The balancing two-thirds will make up a five-year growth
portfolio, utilising whatever allowances the investor has available, but
including Tessas, personal equity plans (Peps), National Savings,
zero-coupon investment trusts - and perhaps even an element of
assured-tenancy Business Expansion Scheme, if the client's circumstances are
appropriate.'
The temporary annuity pays a very high rate, although of course it is only
returning to the investor his own capital. But that means, as a consequence,
that the investor will pay little income tax.
By the time the annuity expires, Mr Higgins argues, the growth portfolio
will have replaced the loss of the annuity capital and achieved some extra
gain on top.
However, there are many ways to achieve income from investments. The most
common are described below. The golden rule, as with any other form of
investment, is to spread your risk. Do not rely entirely on anything,
whether it is a fixed-income or an equities-based instrument.
High-yielding unit trusts offer capital growth, too
UNIT TRUSTS may not seem the most obvious source of investment income,
because yields, currently around 6 per cent gross, compare badly with the
returns from building societies.
The key, of course, is the fact that income on an equity-based investment
can grow. Figures from Fund Research show that dividends in the equity
income sector grew by 111 per cent between 1985 and 1990, compared with an
89 per cent rise in the income offered by the FT-A All-Share Index over the
same period.
Dividends are normally paid twice a year, and a judicious selection of funds
with different payment dates can ensure that some kind of dividend cheque
arrives every month. There are around 130 unit trusts in the UK equity
income sector.
At the same time, the capital value of the investment will grow over the
long term - something that will not happen with a building society deposit.
The average UK equity income unit trust grew by 440.8 per cent in the 10
years to March 1, according to Finstat, although that figure does include
reinvested income. In capital terms, the increase has been somewhere around
250 to 300 per cent.
The risk, of course, is that in much shorter periods, the value of the trust
could go down. So high-yielding unit trusts should never make up all the
income-seeking investor's portfolio.
Guaranteed income bonds carry a tax snag
GUARANTEED income bonds tend to be issued by insurance companies, and offer
a fixed return over a set period of years, normally somewhere between one
and five. Rates vary, depending on the life of the bond and the amount being
invested, but at the time of writing were between 9.5 and 10 per cent.
The return that GIBs pay is net of basic-rate tax, which cannot be
reclaimed, so they are not suitable for non-taxpayers. The best time to buy
them is when interest rates are at their peak, so that investors can lock in
to the high rates on offer.
Many companies offering bonds are quite small - but investors are protected
in case of failure by the Policyholders Protection Act, which guarantees to
pay out 90 per cent of the first Pounds 100,000 invested.
No CGT on gilts - and the issuer won't go bust
GILTS, which are bonds issued by the UK government, are an obvious choice
for any income investor's portfolio. They provide a healthy yield - between
10 and 11 per cent at the time of writing  - and any profit is free of
capital gains tax. In addition, the issuer will never go bust.
There are two yields normally quoted for gilts. The running yield,
calculated by dividing the trading price by the interest rate or coupon, is
the best indicator of the short-term return you will receive. The gross
redemption yield takes account of the fact that gilts will eventually be
repaid (redeemed) so investors will make a capital gain or loss, depending
on whether the bond is trading above or below the offer price. This is
important if you intend to hold the bond until redemption.
Gilts have different repayment dates, and there are some issues that will
never be repaid at all. Buying a long-dated issue brings certainty of return
over a long period; but it also means the investor is highly prey to that
great enemy of gilts - inflation. Long-dated gilt prices can also vary
substantially, so there is a risk that the value of your holding can go down
in the short term.
The cheapest way of buying gilts is through the National Savings Stock
Register, via the local post office. You can also buy a gilt or bond unit
trust, which will attempt to provide you with a good income by managing a
portfolio of securities.
You can take the interest from your Tessa account
ALTHOUGH tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) are desined to be held
for five years, it is possible to use them to provide income.
Investors can withdraw interest from the account without penalty, although
they can only receive the net (after-tax) rate. However, the tax advantages
do not disappear. At the end of the five-year period, the investor will
receive the 'tax' element of his interest in the form of a bonus.
If you plan to hold a large sum of money in the building society anyway,
there is no harm in holding as large as possible a proportion of it (Pounds
3,000 in the first year, Pounds 9,000 over five years in a Tessa). Your
income will be the same, and you will qualify for a tax bonus on top.
Annuities offer most to long-livers and over-70s
AN ANNUITY is an odd sort of investment, in that it is really a gamble on
how long you will live. You invest a lump-sum, and an insurance company
guarantees to pay you an income for the rest of your life. But when you die,
the insurance company, in most cases, keeps your investment.
Thus the longer you live, the better you do. Insurance companies know this,
so they vary the rates they are prepared to guarantee, depending on the life
of the buyer. The older you are, the greater the income the annuity will
pay. For these reasons, the Consumers' Association argues that it is
probably only worth considering buying an annuity if you are over 70. (There
are also joint-life annuities which carry on paying out until both husband
and wife are dead).
The most common type of annuity gives a fixed income, which obviously leaves
the investor at risk from inflation. But it is possible to buy an
increasing, or even an index-linked annuity, where the income steadily
rises, though it starts from a lower base. Unit-linked annuities give a
return based on the value of a particular fund, and thus can vary in value.
There are also temporary annuities, which have a limited lifespan and pay a
high income - but you lose all your capital when the annuity expires.
A lot of people are forced into buying annuities as part of their pension
plan. If you fall into this category, then it may well be sensible to
diversify the rest of your portfolio by buying more flexible
income-producing instruments. However, see above for the use of temporary
annuities, as part of an overall portfolio.
Cash funds for high yields and low charges
CASH unit trusts invest in money-market instruments - deposits, Treasury
bills, commercial paper and the like - with the aim of offering unitholders
a high yield.
A number of such trusts have been established over the past couple of years.
Investors had been discouraged by the poor performance of equities, and this
created an incentive for fund-management companies to offer a product that
was certain not to go down in price.
The managers also realised that, by persuading investors to switch into the
cash fund during a bear market, they would keep funds within the group,
rather than lose them altogether.
The trusts usually have a nil, or very low, upfront charge and a high yield.
At the time of writing, Fidelity's cash unit trust was offering a yield of
13.7 per cent, assuming income reinvested.
Equities in a Pep mean tax-free dividends
EQUITIES are a time-honoured means of achieving a growing income. They
represent a risk - the capital value of the shares can fall and dividends
can be cut, as many investors have been reminded in recent months. In the
long term, however, a diversified portfolio of shares is one of the best
ways to ensure your income keeps pace with inflation.
And if you are going to own shares for a long period, there is a strong
argument for holding them in a personal equity plan. For a 40 per cent
taxpayer, the fact that dividend income in a Pep is tax-free is highly
attractive.
In the short term, the fees charged by the plan manager may outweigh the tax
benefits. But over the long term, say five years or more, the income tax
advantages are substantial - there is much to be said for holding
high-yielding shares within your Pep. Of course, the capital gains tax
exemption is an added bonus.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Three treats
for children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILDREN'S SAVINGS were boosted by three measures in the Budget.
Friendly Societies - offering tax-exempt funds which pay out a tax-free lump
sum after 10 years - will now be allowed to take business from people under
the age of 18. As the Budget also raised the total amount any individual can
put into a society each year to Pounds 200 (this time last year it was
Pounds 100), this branch of the investment industry has been given a
significant shot in the arm.
Experts expect a surge of baby bonds,allowing parents and grandparents to
putmoney into a child's account, to hit the market once the Finance Bill has
received royal assent, which should happen towards the end of July.
Meanwhile, National Savings will launch a new product aimed at youngsters -
a tax-free children's bonus bond. Maximum investment will be Pounds 1,000
per child, in units of Pounds 25 each, and there will be a substantial bonus
paid after five years.
A final measure to benefit all families with children, irrespective of their
income, was the rise in child benefit. From October, families will receive
an extra Pounds 1 for their first child, and an extra 25p for each
subsequent one. Mr Lamont promised that in future the benefit would be
indexed.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A fillip for
share options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor used the Budget to promote the long-held Conservative
philosophy that individuals should own shares, both in their own companies
and directly in other groups.
Company share-option schemes have too frequently been used as 'shares for
the boys', with only a few key executives being allowed to reap the rewards
of corporate success.
The Chancellor has tried to encourage the widening of such schemes by
allowing options to be offered at a 15 per cent discount, provided that a
wider scheme has been publicised to all eligible employees over the previous
12 months. It is not clear how 'publicised' will be defined, and whether a
dog-eared announcement on a dark corner of a board next to the Health and
Safety at Work Act notice will qualify.
The potential size of share scheme rewards has also been increased. The
ceiling for participation in a SAYE share-option scheme has been increased
from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250 a month. And the maximum annual benefit under
a profit-sharing scheme has been raised from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8,000,
subject to an over-riding limit of 10 per cent of salary.
Beneficiaries can also save on capital gains tax, because they can invest
Pounds 3,000 of their shares into a personal equity plan (Pep) without
facing an immediate capital gains tax bill. This change was linked to a
decision to allow all investors to set up a Pounds 3,000 'single company'
Pep, in addition to the normal Pounds 6,000 PEP allowance.
This was another affirmation of the government's belief that Peps should
encourage direct ownership in shares, despite all the evidence that private
shareholders face severe risks unless they build a large, diversified
portfolio. Investment and unit trusts were kept at the Pounds 3,000 limit
for a Pep, although they will gain from the ruling that European stocks will
qualify for Pep inclusion.
Previously, 50 per cent of an investor's holdings needed to be in the UK;
now the 50 cent rule applies to the EC. The change will take effect in the
autumn.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Fiscal
neutrality rules - The Budget / The aim is to tax employees equally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET headlines were stolen by the chancellor's switch of the tax
burden from the community charge to VAT.
But budgets also offer the Treasury and the Inland Revenue the chance to
close old tax loopholes, and to offer new tax incentives. There was no new
product to rival last year's Tessa, but there was plenty to keep the
financial adviser busy.
One prominent area was the continuing crackdown on employee perks. The tax
advantages offered by company cars have been steadily under assault during
the 1980s, and there was a further attack, including the imposition of
employers' national insurance charges, this time. Mobile phones, if
available for personal use, also became a taxable benefit.
The idea is that employees should, in the long run, be taxed equally,
whether they are paid in kind or in cash. This principle of fiscal
neutrality also showed itself when the chancellor abolished higher-rate tax
relief on mortgage interest payments.
That change had been expected for some time, and was softened by the
simultaneous increase in the higher-rate tax threshold. Another area where
action had been widely anticipated was offshore trusts.
By rolling up their investments offshore in a trust, some well-off
individuals had been able to postpone, in some cases virtually indefinitely,
the payment of capital gains tax.
Although it will still be possible to delay tax on an offshore trust's gains
until a capital payment is made to a UK resident beneficiary, a supplemental
charge will be added. This will be, in effect, a charge on the deferred tax
which 'should' previously have been paid on the gains rolling up in the
trust. The charge will be levied at 10 per cent of the deferred tax for
every year, up to a maximum of six, that the gain is held in the trust
before being paid out.
The change will remove many of the apparent advantages of having an offshore
trust; but Caroline Garnham, tax partner with solicitors Taylor Joynson
Garrett, feels that the supplemental charge may be so complicated to
administer that it will be abolished before it reaches the statute book.
The Revenue also produced a consultative document about onshore trusts,
which represented an attempt to simplify the rules on trust taxation. The
general intention is to bring the taxation of trusts in line with that of
individuals.
On this page, we highlight some of the other changes in the Budget. And
articles throughout the Review also include details of Budget announcements,
where relevant.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): The changes at
a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Value Added Tax
Payable on most goods, rose by 2.5 points to 17.5 per cent - the first rise
since Sir Geoffrey Howe nearly doubled VAT in 1979.
Poll Tax
Pounds 140 cut from the level previously announced for 1991-92 for every
local authority in Britain; though some did not experience the full benefit,
because they would otherwise have received a rebate. No poll tax is payable
until the new bills have been sent out.
Mortgage-interest tax relief
Abolished at the top rate of 40 per cent. Top-rate taxpayers still receive
basic-rate relief of 25 per cent on the first Pounds 30,000 of a loan - a
threshold unaltered since 1983.
Income Tax
Basic rate (25 per cent) and the top rate at (40 per cent) unchanged.
Personal allowances increased 9.8 per cent, in line with inflation.
The only real change was to the threshold before the top rate tax is
payable: it rose by 14.5 per cent, from Pounds 20,700 to Pounds 23,700,to
soothe those who lost on the reduction in mortgage relief.
Personal equity plans
From January, investors will be able to take out a Pep of up to Pounds 3,000
in a single company, in addition to the Pounds 6,000 plan already allowed.
The restriction that at least half of all Pep investments must be in UK
equities will change some time later in the year. Thereafter, half of your
investment must be in the EC. A Pep can now hold Pounds 9,000 of shares in
non-UK companies.
Share-ownership schemes
discount on executive share-ownership schemes, if they introduce a
share-ownership scheme for their employees. The scope for profit-sharing
schemes and profit-related pay will also increase.
Offshore trusts
to clamp down on these tax shelters. Assets from existing onshore trusts are
now liable to a tax charge when transferred offshore, and the settlor to a
trust is liable to capital gains tax if he, or any of his family or his
companies, is a beneficiary.
Capital Gains Tax
The threshold before tax is payable on gains increased 10 per cent to Pounds
5,500 for individuals. Trustees are immune from tax on their first Pounds
2,750 in gains (another 10 per cent increase). Allowable gains from letting
rooms were doubled to Pounds 40,000. Retirement relief (when an individual
surrenders an interest in a business following retirement) was increased
from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 150,000,and is now claimable at the age of 55,
not 60.
Inheritance Tax
An indexed increase in the threshold before IHT is payable,from Pounds
128,000 to Pounds 140,000, was made.
High-street shares
Submissions have been invited for a plan to sell shares from high-street
retail outlets. If a good offer is forthcoming,the sell-off of the
government's remaining holding in British Telecom may be handled this way.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): A spring in the
market's step, Keynote - But the danger of volatility persists, as investors
assess the reality of the recession and the chance of a political upset at a
general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY, Investment Editor

<TEXT>
WITH THIS third issue of the Quarterly Review, we can celebrate a change to
an altogether more favourable climate for long-term investors.
October, focusing on the state of the markets as at the end of September,
sentiment was at its gloomiest level for years. As for the January issue,
with the long-threatened Gulf war in full swing the risks became
accentuated. But so did the potential opportunities. Our conclusion then was
that shrewd investors might need to be brave, but that the next few months
would throw up considerable opportunities.
So it has indeed proved. And whereas, in the depths of winter, it may have
seemed hard to take the optimistic line, in spring the investor's fancy may
be more easily tickled. But stock-market folklore brings due warnings ('sell
in May . . .'), and enthusiasm needs to be kept well under control. There
are no easy roads ahead.
Rarely has the gulf of understanding between the securities markets and
private investors been wider than during the past few months. And yet
students of the markets will argue that there has been a classical pattern
to the sequence of events.
First, a few numbers. During the January-March quarter, the UK stock market
rose by an impressive 16 per cent. This is on the basis of the broadest
measure of the market's level, the FT- Actuaries All-Share Index which has
some 670 constituents. The total gain by the All-Share since its low point
at the end of September last year was 24 per cent.
By any standards, the past six months has therefore been an excellent period
for investing in Ordinary shares in Britain, and the same applies to most
countries around the world.
To get an idea of the global trend, we must look at the FT-Actuaries World
Index, and this rose by 21 per cent in sterling terms during the
January-March quarter, boosted by the 26 per cent jump by the US national
index. The World Index has scored its impressive gain in the face of a
considerable economic recession in several major countries, including the US
and the UK.
To some extent, the lifting of the war threat may be credited for the
improvement in conditions. Last autumn there were fears of military
catastrophe in the Gulf, and of crude-oil prices soaring to Dollars 70 a
barrel or more. In the end, allied losses were light and the Saudi Arabian
oil production and refining facilities escaped untouched. That was been
transmitted to the financial markets.
But broader economic developments also played an important role. It has
become evident progressively during the last six months that the US has
entered a significant recession and the UK a quite severe one. Those weak
conditions have spread to much of Europe, certainly to France and Italy. But
Germany has continued to boom, recording economic growth of above 4 per
cent; and the Japanese economy has also continued to grow, although at a
progressively more moderate rate.
These divergences have fiercely pulled the markets in different directions.
In particular, the first quarter of the year saw a dramatic realignment of
the dollar and the Deutsche Mark, the latter dragging with it the whole of
the European Monetary System, including of course sterling with effect from
last October. On January 1, the dollar would buy DM1.495; on March 31, 14
per cent more at DM1.701.
This had the effect of turning the US stock market into a surprising winner
for many international investors, including those in Britain. Wall Street
was strong, and the strength of the dollar ladled cream on the top. Thus,
specialist American unit trusts, dogs for so much of the recent past,
dominated the quarter's performance tables, with the best funds providing
gains to UK investors of more than 40 per cent.
Just why recession should spell so much profit is bound to be mystifying to
many amateur investors. It should be emphasised, however, that there is
nothing unusual about it. Classically, the biggest percentage gains in US
stock-market indices are seen during the closing months of a period of
economic recession. The market reacts to falling interest rates and
anticipates the recovery in economic activity.
stock-market rally, when the bond markets staged their own revival.
According to the textbooks, equity markets follow a few months behind bond
markets. The worry now must be that in Britain, for instance, the gilt-edged
market ran out of steam back in the middle of February, and long-term
interest rates have drifted up to the wrong side of 10 per cent.
This is partly because the inflation news has tended to be disappointing,
but more tangibly because Norman Lamont's Budget last month confirmed that
the government will become a big borrower again, for the next two or three
years at least.
In February and March, as the UK stock market soared towards its all-time
peaks in nominal terms, investors were making big bets on the ability of the
economy to bounce back. So it will, but it may take longer than the dominant
optimists have been assuming.
Unfortunately the stock markets have become more than usually unstable
places. They are dominated by professional investors who tend to think
alike. Last year it was regarded as a clever idea to hold a lot of cash,
which could earn 15 per cent, but when the stock market is rising rapidly
the cost of such strategies can be very high. At the beginning of 1991, the
big investment institutions are reckoned to have been holding around Pounds
35bn in liquid assets, and this was always going to pose the danger of a
phase of panic buying.
There is now a danger of further volatility, this time possibly in the other
direction, as investors assess the realities of the industrial recession and
the risks of political upsets as we head towards the next general election.
But those investors who wisely bought around the lows of last autumn and
again in early January need not worry that they will forfeit all of their
gains.

FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Natural gas emerges as Europe's fuel
for the 1990s - Investment opportunities in an industry where de-regulation
is overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EMERGENCE of natural gas as the fuel of choice in Europe presents a
promising investment theme for the 1990s. The main competitors to gas - oil,
coal and nuclear power - have become less attractive in recent years to West
European governments and consumers alike on environmental and inflationary
grounds.
On a longer term view, the market for gas supply could become more
competitive as the European Commission attempts to liberalise the industry
by loosening the grip of entrenched monopoly suppliers.
Kleinwort Benson, the London stockbroker, estimates that West European gas
demand will rise from a current 25bn cubic feet a day to 36.3bn cubic feet
by 2,000 and 48bn cubic feet by 2,010. Much of this increase will be met by
Europe's main producers - the UK, the Netherlands and Norway - but imports
from Algeria and the Soviet Union are also likely to rise.
Investors wanting exposure to the growing demand for gas in Europe have
various options, says Mr Philip Lambert, the author of Kleinwort Benson's
gas review. Royal Dutch/Shell's position in European gas is second to none
and it has a strong presence in most of the transmission companies in
Europe.
Norsk Hydro is an obvious beneficiary of the increase in Norwegian gas
value. Not only is it likely that Norsk Hydro's gas production will nearly
triple to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d) over the next 10
years, but its 6.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven or probable gas
reserves - until recently regarded as uncommercial  - could soon become its
most valuable asset. Norway's Saga Petroleum is an even purer play than
Norsk Hydro, which also has aluminium, fertiliser and petrochemical
interests.
Italy's gas market should be viewed as the most bullish in Europe, in spite
of the 24 per cent market share that natural gas already has of the primary
energy market. Kleinwort Benson forecasts that this will rise to 30 per cent
by 2,000, since Italy has abandoned nuclear power and is under pressure to
reduce dependence on oil, which accounts for 58.2 per cent of the energy
market. Italgas, a quoted distribution company, looks attractive on a
three-year view, during which the dividend should begin to rise in line with
the growth of its gas business.
The jump in demand could help small independent suppliers and gas traders
trying to break into the European Community market, but for this to happen
the Commission would have to pass legislation to further open up the gas
market.
Europe's gas market is controlled by a small group of monopoly suppliers
which control production, transmission and distribution. Gaz de France,
SNAM, in Italy, British Gas, in the UK, Ruhrgas, in Germany, and Gasunie, in
the Netherlands, are very large players. Where a statutory monopoly is not
in place many countries allow a major supplier to retain its dominance.
But the Commission has challenged the entrenched monopolies that exist in
three EC countries for the import and export of gas by initiating legal
proceedings against France, Denmark and Belgium. In spite of deep opposition
from the gas suppliers, the Commission wants to institute a policy of open
access in the EC, whereby independent suppliers would be allowed access to
existing pipelines for gas transport to customers.
Elf Aquitaine is a major oil producer trying to gain greater access to the
EC gas market. Natural gas already accounts for around one-seventh of Elf's
earnings per share, and Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, its chairman, has said
recently that the monopoly gas suppliers will have to face more competition
in future. Elf has gas reserves of some 1,500bn cubic feet in its Lacq
deposit in south-west France, and has tried to gather more gas by taking a
50 per cent stake in Agas, the UK independent gas company, and a link with
Wintershall, in Germany. A partial privatisation of Gaz de France is
possible over the coming years, and both Elf and Total are known to be
interested.
After the UK, Germany probably operates one of the most open gas markets in
Europe; but Ruhrgas, owned by a consortium of oil companies, dominates
transmission and owns a large chunk of the pipeline system. Wintershall, the
energy subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, is challenging this
stranglehold with plans to build its own distribution system and allow other
companies, such as Elf and Austria's OMV, to transport their gas through it.
It is the leading chemical companies such as BASF and Dow Chemical - large
users of gas - which are pushing strongly for a policy of open access in gas
since they argue that this will reduce gas prices. The gas companies say it
will take away the incentive to invest in long-term projects in an industry
with extremely long lead times. This, says the suppliers, will reduce the
security of supply for consumers.

FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage buying fails
to support Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
SPORADIC buying by arbitrageurs failed to support share prices yesterday,
and the weaker yen and higher bond yields added to the depressed sentiment,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell a further 291.35 to 26,038.86 after a day's high of
26,341.85 in the morning, and a low of 26,037.87 just before the close.
Volume stayed dull at 380m shares and declines outweighed advances by 787 to
213, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
slipped 21.47 to 1,952.56, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.36
to 1,475.42.
Traders said investors and dealers liquidating positions before the Golden
Week holidays contributed to the weak trend. Miss Benedicte Ivey at Credit
Lyonnais Securities said it would be hard for the market to regain strength
even after the holidays as long as short-term interest rates remained at
high levels.
In addition, cash positions related to arbitrage trading were announced to
have risen to record highs of Y917bn as of April 19. Traders said this
reflected a movement towards derivatives-related transactions, due to the
stagnant cash market.
Profit-taking took in Sharp, firm on Wednesday on hopes of an upturn in the
US economy and which lost Y40 to Y1,540 yesterday, and Tsugami, a machine
tool maker, down Y27 at Y823. Big companies lost ground on the outlook for
short-term interest rates, Nippon Steel shedding Y5 to Y464 and
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries weakening Y33 to Y716.
Nihon Nohyaku, in agrochemicals, weakened Y160 to Y2,250 on selling by
individuals, after a three-day rally on rumours that a speculative group was
chasing the issue. But Asahi Chemical saw heavy buying towards the close,
gaining Y55 to Y850 on reports that it will acquire Toyo Jozo, a liquor
maker, which was unchanged at Y1,140.
Akai Electric closed Y59 higher at Y840 after revising its pre-tax profits
forecast up from Y1.7bn to Y3bn for the current year. Sony receded Y150 to
Y6,350 on reports that it expects to lower earnings projections because of
the sluggish US market.
In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 343.73 to 29,002.98 on volume of 31.8m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y300 to Y16,100 on margin
worries.
Roundup
THE REGION presented a mixed picture, and a number of themes yesterday.
Australia and New Zealand were closed for a public holiday.
SINGAPORE buyers concentrated on shipping and electronics, the former
regarded as relatively cheap, and with better prospects following the Gulf
war. In spite of afternoon profit-taking, the Straits Times Industrial index
gained 17.27 or 1.1 per cent to 1,553.94. Turnover increased from SDollars
188.5m to SDollars 229.6m. Hotels and properties showed losses.
Electronics moved on speculation that the sector, valued at or below the
market average, would be the first to benefit from any recovery in the US or
European markets.
TAIWAN gained 1.8 per cent, the weighted index climbing 107.08 to 5,913.82
on expectations of lower interest rates to boost the economy. Turnover rose
from TDollars 53.6bn to TDollars 68.9bn.
SEOUL's turnover nearly halved, from Won180bn to Won 94.8bn, as the
composite index fell 6.27 to 626.36. Traders attributed the sharp declines
of the past two days to tight local liquidity; companies have dividends and
taxes to pay towards the end of this month, and the government's tight money
supply has also drained liquidity from the equity market.
BANGKOK ended lower, with most sectors, apart from textiles, in decline. The
SET index slipped 11.74 to 883.60 in turnover of 4.69bn baht. HONG KONG was
described as thin and listless as the Hang Seng index eased 10.91 to
3,594.38.
KARACHI, still climbing on economic reform, set new highs for three
successive days up to Tuesday, when the KSE index finished 32 ahead at 1,707
in volume up from 4.8m to 8.3m shares, forcing the exchange to close on
Wednesday so that brokers could clear mountains of paperwork. It will reopen
on Saturday after its regular two-day shutdown yesterday and today.

FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sentiment mixed as Frankfurt
tests its 1991 highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES put in a mixed performance yesterday as Germany closed at new highs
for the year to date while France slipped at the finish. Milan and Portugal
were closed, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tested its highs yet again. Morgan Stanley raised its weighting in
Germany by two percentage points to 17.5 per cent, lifting the market, but
sentiment was not uniform.
At midsession, the FAZ index was 8.00 better at 686.92, a new closing 1991
high. The DAX index closed 16.72 higher at 1,620.45; an intraday high of
1,626.95 took it temporarily into new territory, against a closing 1991 high
of 1,623.83. Volume rose from DM6.1bn to DM7.8bn.
Mr Andrew Bell, European equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said
that a DAX index closing 20 points outside its trading range for the past
three months had not made a fundamental change in the market. However, he
thought that the main risks for Germany - higher interest rates and the
sharp slowdown in growth - threatened its neighbours almost as much as
Germany itself, and that the speed of recovery in the US and other English
speaking economies may be more important to German equity prospects than
continental and domestic concerns.
The big international blue chips, Siemens, Daimler and Deutsche Bank, all
made good rises yesterday. Interest remained in steels and engineering with
Thyssen rising DM6.40 to DM233.90 and Preussag DM8.50 to DM333. Retailers
also featured, as Kaufhof rose DM12 to DM514.50 after its Kaufhalle
subsidiary reported first quarter sales up 22 per cent. In specialist
chemicals, Degussa, oversold according to Dresdner Bank, rose DM8 to DM346.
AMSTERDAM ended higher thanks to a firm dollar and a strong bond market but
trading was light. Dealers said activity was slowing ahead of next Tuesday's
public holiday. The CBS tendency index added 0.5 to 96.0.
The chemical group, Akzo, closed a net Fl 3.40 higher at Fl 115.70, ex a
dividend of Fl 5, consolidating its gains after surprisingly good first
quarter results.
Nedlloyd, the transport group, went against the market to close 70 cents
lower at Fl 50.60. The VEB, a group protecting the interests of small
investors, said it would be voting against the endorsement of the 1990
accounts at the annual meeting on May 30. The group also said it supported
Mr Torstein Hagen's bid to gain management power at Nedlloyd. Mr Hagen
controls 23 per cent of Nedlloyd.
PARIS was flat for most of the day and then shed five points at the close as
Wall Street weakened. The CAC 40 index closed 5.02 lower at 1,777.01 in
unimpressive volume of FFr1.65bn.
Euro Disney was the day's most active stock, falling FFr1.90to FFr115 with
431,900 shares traded on reports that a dispute between two companies
helping build the amusement park outside Paris could disrupt part of the
park's construction. Euro Disney later said that the dispute would not delay
the completion of the project.
Lyonnaise-Dumez tumbled FFr28 or 4.5 per cent to FFr590 with 194,330 shares
traded on disappointment at the merged group's 1990 results announced late
on Wednesday. Analysts said the capital gains shown were lower than expected
and that expectations for the current year were not encouraging. Poor first
quarter results from its Canadian subsidiary United Westburne also weighed
on the price. The company is holding an analysts' meeting this morning.
ZURICH declined in light trading, the Credit Suisse index closing 1.5 lower
at 554.2. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, came under pressure for the
second consecutive day and was the most active stock on rumours of a
dividend cut and rights issue; the shares fell another SFr80 to SFr2,030.
OSLO was buoyed up by better-than-expected results from Norsk Hydro and news
that the Labour government planned to let the state pension fund invest in
industry. The all-share index closed up 8.88 or 1.9 per cent to 475.01 in
turnover worth NKr270m.
Norsk Hydro jumped NKr7.5 to NKr190 on a drop of a quarter in first quarter
net income, mainly as a result of the stronger dollar.
MADRID slipped in the afternoon session, and the general index closed down
2.10 at 279.22.
ISTANBUL's market index fell 39.3 to 4,134.36, taking its fall to over 246,
or 5.6 per cent since it came back from an extended holiday on Wednesday.

FT  26 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES were a little softer in quiet London trading yesterday. An
absence of UK economic data in the immediate future is likely to turn
attention to next week's local government elections.
At the moment there seems little prospect of an early cut in UK bank base
rates, despite Wednesday's claim from the Confederation of British Industry
that the economic situation is bad and getting worse.
Three-month sterling interbank was quoted at 11 13/16 -11 3/4 per cent
against 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent previously and 12-month money was unchanged
at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
On Liffe June short sterling futures held above an important support level
of 88.57. The contract opened firmer at 88.60 and closed at 88.64 compared
with 88.56 on Wednesday.
There was no encouragement of lower interest rates from the Bank of England.
The central bank did not appear to give enough help to take out the
underlying credit shortage on the cash market. A day-to-day shortage of
Pounds 600m was initially forecast, but this was revised to Pounds 550m at
noon and to Pounds 650m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 499m
was provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 53m bills outright, by way of
Pounds 48m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 5m bank bills
in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 261m bills were
purchased, via Pounds 188m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and
Pounds 73m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Late assistance of
around Pounds 185m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,010m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 105m and bank balances below target Pounds 5m. These
outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 520m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money was unchanged at 8.80 per cent as liquidity remained
relatively comfortable near the end of the month. Rates may edge higher
today as pension fund payments drain money from the banking system.
In Madrid the rate for 12-month Spanish Treasury bills was steady at 12.599
per cent at yesterday's tender. This followed the Bank of Spain's decision
to leave its money market intervention rate unchanged earlier this week,
despite upward pressure on the Spanish peseta in the European exchange rate
mechanism.

BANANA EXPORTS from the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and Panama will be
interrupted for between two to six weeks, following the earthquake which
devastated the region last Monday.
Mr Euclides Diaz, the secretary-general of the National Banana Corporation
in Panama, says repairs to roads and rail links to the banana-exporting port
of Almirante will take '30 to 45 days'.
The port itself has not been badly damaged, but most of the road and rail
bridges in the region 'have been completely destroyed.' Six packing plants
have been badly damaged and up to 3m boxes of bananas may be lost as a
result.
In Costa Rica, efforts are being made to divert exports through the Pacific
Coast port of Puerto Caldera. According to the National Banana Corporation,
'it will take at least 15 days before exports can be resumed through Puerto
Limon'.
About 500,000 boxes a week can be trucked across the country from the least
affected zones north of Puerto Limon.

THE European Commission's plan to reform the Common Agricultural Policy
would require 'additional budgetary resources', Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
agriculture commissioner, said yesterday.
Last month he warned the European Parliament that there would be 'serious
political difficulties' unless there was 'a substantial level of
compensation' to farmers for the severe price cuts envisaged in the plan,
but this is the first time Mr MacSharry has said that the new policy would
be more expensive. Beyond compensating farmers, extra funds would be needed
for 'the greatest challenge' of wider rural development, he said.
Final details of the commission plan are due in July, but it advocates
moving a large part of CAP spending from subsidised producer prices to
direct payments to farmers. This would be achieved through heavy price cuts,
with small farmers wholly compensated and larger farmers reimbursed if they
set aside land.
The extent to which big, efficient farmers are to be compensated is at the
centre of the debate, begun when details of the commission's plan leaked in
January. The leaked version foresaw only partial compensation, but two other
commission blueprints envisaged more generous, and even full refund of the
price cuts.
Mr MacSharry told a conference on CAP reform organised by the Club de
Bruxelles think-tank that the EC was raising farm spending by 30 per cent
this year only to depress farm incomes, because the price support mechanism
merely added to the stockpiles of food overhanging the market.
'The basic question is whether we should now provide more resources for the
existing mechanisms which, without improving the position of producers, are
likely to lead to bigger stocks, bigger exports, bigger expenditure and
greater intensity of production,' he said. The alternative was to pursue a
new approach that would lead to less production but which could still
guarantee a vibrant community agriculture.

AFTER FIVE years of haggling, Sri Lanka has signed an agreement with a UN
agency to exploit an estimated USDollars 270m (Pounds 159.4m) worth of
monazite deposits in the seabed off the south-west of the country, writes
Mervyn de Silva in Colombo.
The UN Revolving Fund for National Resources Exploration produced an
evaluation report as early as 1985, free of charge.
But worries about environmental damage and payment to the agency once mining
began had delayed a final decision.

TIN PRICES signalled a recovery in the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market yesterday to
close at MDollars 15.45 (Pounds 3.28) a kilogram, up by 42 Malaysian cents
from the previous day.
Yesterday's closing spot price, from a turnover of 87 tonnes, is the highest
reached in the past 19 weeks when prices hovered mostly below MDollars 15 a
kilogram.
On the London Metal Exchange, cash tin advanced by Dollars 227.50 (Pounds
134.3) to Dollars 5,915 a tonne at the close yesterday after rising by
Dollars 137.50 a tonne on Wednesday.
The market's rally, which has been evident through the week, offers hope of
relief to Malaysian companies where annual results released in recent days
have reflected the widespread industrial gloom and the numerous
announcements to move away from mining.
Malaysia Mining Corporation, the largest which annually produces 11,000
tonnes, slightly over a third of national production, reported its
first-ever operating losses in its tin operations last year.
Another company, Gopeng, with production of 1,600 tonnes, reported that
average metal prices last year fell by 29 per cent to MDollars 16,467 a
tonne, or MDollars 16.47 a kilogram.
Statistics, available to the end of last year, indicate that Malaysian
stocks have fallen by a third to about 14,000 tonnes, compared with more
than 17,000 tonnes currently held in the London Metal Exchange.
If the market rally continues, the Association of Tin Producing Countries
could again defer Thailand's proposal to impose further export cuts when it
meets in June. The proposal was rejected during the previous meeting held
early last month.

FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelters work close to capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN EUROPE'S primary aluminium smelters continued to work close to the
limits of their capacity last year, according to the European Aluminium
Association.
Output slipped by only 0.5 per cent from the 1989 level, from 3.58m tonnes
to 3.56m, it reports.
The Dusseldorf-based association monitors the aluminium industries in
Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and Yugoslavia.
This year low aluminium prices are putting considerable pressure on the
European industry, which is estimated to have the world's highest-cost
smelters.
In its latest Aluminium Annual Review, the Anthony Bird consultancy group
suggested that Italy has the highest-cost smelters with costs of 78 cents a
lb, followed by Spain and Germany at 76 cents, and France at 70 cents. In
comparison, Venezuela's costs are only 47 cents a lb and those in Canada are
51 cents.
Alumix, the state-owned Italian producer, recently announced a
rationalisation programme which will include the permanent closure in June
of the 30,000-tonnes-a-year Porto Maghera smelter.
The aluminium industry 'is closer to a shortage than a glut', says Anthony
Bird. 'We estimate that at the end of 1991 the margin of spare capacity and
the amount of excess stocks will be very similar to that seen in mid-1986 -
which was of course followed soon afterwards by a period of intense
shortage,' its latest Aluminium Analysis says.
Aluminium prices are 'dangerously low' because they make it impossible for
any new smelter project to cover its operating and capital costs and to earn
an acceptable profit, it says. 'That would call for a price of 77 to 83
cents a lb at April, 1991 prices and exchange rates.'

FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Optimism returns to NZ wool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTIOUS optimism is returning to the New Zealand wool industry, after the
settling of a long-standing debt with the Soviet Union and the return of
China as a buyer.
Prices rose by 43 cents per kilo at late April sales, with the market
indicator hitting 411 - 15 cents above the level when the New Zealand Wool
Board suspended its price-support mechanism in February. This followed
Australia's decision to end its support floor price system, which sent
prices on both sides of the Tasman Sea into a tailspin.
The absence of China and the Soviet Union as buyers had seen prices fall
over the last 18 months. China virtually stopped buying in 1989 due to
significant economic difficulties at home and over buying, while the Soviet
Union was forced to end its purchases last year due to its foreign exchange
crisis.
The first shipment of New Zealand wool for 12 months is on its way to the
Soviet Union, after action to pay NZDollars 20m (Pounds 6.87m) of an
outstanding NZDollars 50m bill, which allowed the completion of some
NZDollars 16m of shelved contracts. The completion of this deal was through
a consortium of exporters led by Christchurch firm Mircom, put together at
the Soviets' suggestion. The Soviets also saw the formation of a group led
by the ANZ Bank to issue credit lines to allow the trade to continue. The
Wool Board is to provide wool from its 630,000-bale stockpile to fill a
significant part of the new orders.
The arrangements were taken to indicate the urgency the Soviet government
saw in renewed wool imports.
The Chinese are also showing greater interest. While they had been
continuing to buy small amounts over the past year, their purchases were
miniscule compared to the mid- and later-1980s when they were New Zealand's
biggest customer for crossbred wools.
Mr Roger Buchanan, marketing development manager of the New Zealand Wool
Board, said the complex political and economic developments in the Soviet
Union, which had led to the resumed buying, were 'something of a mystery.'
He said it was known that Soviet mills were desperate for wool and it must
be assumed the government had placed a high priority on imports. Last year,
industry leaders unsuccessfully sought export guarantee insurance from the
New Zealand government in an attempt to help the trade. Mr John Falloon, the
Minister of Agriculture, said his refusal then had been vindicated by the
appearance of the ANZ Bank to support the sales.
The purchases to China follow visits to New Zealand by Mr Lie Huaqui, the
Chinese Foreign Minister, and senior buyers, who were apparently encouraged
by the lower prices. They had also resumed large-scale buying in Australia.
New Zealand government sources say the Chinese are expected to buy 25,000
tonnes this year - still well down on the peak sales of 63,000 tonnes in
1988-89.
The Council of Wool Exporters has warned farmers about the jump in prices,
saying it is due to a limited supply of wool at this time of year, which is
being actively sought by customers who had allowed their stocks to run down
to critically low levels.
It says a period of price instability should be expected at auction as the
market adjusts to the free trading environment following the withdrawal of
Wool Board support.

<TEXT>
A MOVE to introduce a new open-market pricing contract into scrap aluminium
trading has met opposition from scrap processors, particularly in Japan.
Japanese companies are criticising plans by the London Metal Exchange to
launch a contract for trading secondary aluminium, a low-purity metal which
is usually produced by recycling scrap. The new contract would be traded
alongside the LME's existing high-grade aluminium contract.
LME officials, who were visiting Tokyo this week, have yet to make a
decision on the plan. They are concerned about criticism from scrap
processing companies in Japan and elsewhere.
Mr David King, LME chief executive, said at a press conference yesterday
that the Japan Aluminium Refiners Association, a trade body, had expressed
opposition at a meeting on Wednesday.
The LME has often in the past run into heavy criticism from producers when
it has introduced new contracts. Producers complain that open markets, such
as the LME, create unnecessary price volatility. By contrast, metal-users
like the transparency which open markets bring.
Producers have been strongest in those metal markets where they are few  -
notably in aluminium and nickel. Companies in these areas consistently
opposed the use of LME aluminium and nickel contracts after they were
launched in the late 1970s, although they have since accepted their
popularity among consumers.
LME officials say the biggest support for a secondary aluminium contract is
in Europe - where there is a plethora of users in different countries -
followed by North America.
Opposition is strongest in Japan, not least because the buying side is
dominated by the large auto companies which are able to get good terms from
the processors without the need for an open-market contract.
The Japan Aluminium Refiners' Association told the LME that they feared the
contract would encourage speculation and breed volatility. But Mr John
Wolff, the LME chairman, said yesterday that the opportunity to hedge would
protect companies against price swings.
The Japanese side was not convinced. The often cosy relations between
producers and consumers in the Japanese market mean that scrap prices in
Japan do not swing as wildly as in Europe and North America. Japanese
processors, for the most part, would like preserve that situation.
The LME does not want to impose a new contract unilaterally on Japanese
industry, not least because the Pacific region, including Japan, accounts
for about one third of members' business.
But Japanese opposition alone is unlikely to block the launch. 'We believe
the contract would succeed without Japan but we would prefer Japan to be
involved,' Mr King said.

A TYPE of sugar, which has the uncanny ability to preserve meat and plants
so that they can can be revived to their original state after being dried,
has been approved by the UK's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
for use in the food industry.
Trehalose is a simple sugar, made up of two glucose molecules stuck
together, and is found naturally in yeast.
Food which has had trehalose added to it before drying, from fruit to meat,
can remain on the shelf indefinitely. When re-hydrated the food resumes its
colour, flavour and texture. Even vitamins, such a vitamin A, are retained
during the dried phase.
Trehalose has been patented in the UK, US and Europe by biotechnology
company Quadrant Research, of Cambridge, which is licensing the use of its
patents to large food manufacturers.

modelling, using supercomputers.
Elf says the research will be 'open'. Olivier Guillon, manager of the
centre, will be looking for collaboration from other oil companies operating
in the UK and from university geoscientists.
The establishment of the centre is a sign of Elf's efforts to

teeth - and do away with written records and paperwork.
The MacTooth software, developed by Degree Zero, of London's Harley Street,
runs on the latest Apple Macintosh Mac LC machine. When a new patient joins
the practice, the details are recorded on the computer by the receptionist.
After that, the dentist records details of treatment by using the mouse.
He or she clicks on to the diagramatic representation of a particular tooth
on the screen and then fills in part of the tooth with a specific colour to
represent a treatment. A silver splodge denotes an amalgam filling, while a
bright yellow splodge denotes a gold one.
Once the treatment is complete the software translates the colours into
codes from which it can generate the patient's bill and other paperwork. The
computer also produces a spreadsheet of the practice's accounts for the
auditors.

FINGERPRINTS and retina scans have been tipped as two ways of ensuring
security and preventing fraud. Now a further 'biometric' device has been
developed that could prove more effective in maintaining security in
financial transactions, such as withdrawing cash from hole-in-the wall
machines.
Veincheck, developed by Cambridge Consultants and the British Technology
Group, verifies a person's identity by the internal vein pattern on the back
of the hand. By passing a clenched fist under a scanning camera for a
fraction of a second an infra-red beam can scan the veins and the hand shape
and recognise the unique pattern.
This pattern is compared with a digital representation of it stored on a
plastic card to verify the identity of the person.
The developers believe the system will be more readily accepted by the
public than other more obtrusive biometric equipment. They are now looking
for funding to help commercialise the product - a demonstrator machine is
now in operation. Veincheck could be incorporated in cash-point machines
within two years.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International air traffic control agencies and large European radar system
manufacturers are showing interest in a new technique for the continuous
recording of radar information and voice communications between pilots and
air traffic controllers developed by a small Hampshire-based company.
Walton Radar Systems, with a turnover of Pounds 1m last year, has pioneered
a new system integrating voice and radar recordings which has just won its
first order from the Canadian defence department. It will be used in
military air traffic control at the low-level flight training base at Goose
Bay on the Labrador Coast.
The CAA is interested in acquiring the new enhanced system integrating both
voice and radar data on the same digital cassette. And Eurocontrol, the
Brussels-based air traffic control agency, is also studying the use of the
Walton system, especially as a last-minute recorder capable of replaying and
locating conversations between pilots and air traffic controllers in the
event of an aircraft incident.
Recordings of radar and voice communications are increasingly regarded as
providing important data in the investigations of aviation accidents. The
CAA has been routinely recording air traffic control radar data for many
years. But the new system enhances continuous radar recording by making it
more compact and swifter to replay as well as providing voice recordings.
Walton developed the radar recording technology for the Royal Navy in 1982.
It was used during the Falklands war for tactical analysis and planning. The
recorders were also used in the Gulf war. But the company sees the civil
aviation market offering the biggest potential for its technology.
'Radar recording is becoming recognised as a vital part of air traffic
control,' says Mike Jones, Walton's chief executive. 'But it is a
specialised business. Our success has been based on the fact that we have
developed systems specifically for the recording of radar data,' he
explains.

foreign investors

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippines' central bank plans to simplify procedures for repatriating
proceeds of portfolio investments. These could take effect from June.
This measure, with imminent reforms to laws governing foreign investments,
appears to be a manifestation of the government's desire to make the country
more attractive to foreign investors.
Mr Gabriel Singson, deputy central bank governor, said the rules will
simplify the registration and repatriation of foreign investments in
officially-approved Philippine securities. They would cut down the
registration and repatriation time to an average of 10 working days, against
three months currently.
The changes include the central bank authorising custodian banks - which
conduct 90 per cent of securities transactions - to issue securities
transaction documents. The measure is therefore expected to ease the
workload of the central bank, cutting processing time for the remaining 10
per cent of investors.
Dividend repatriation is to be speeded by removing the need for approval
from both the corporation issuing a security and the broker or custodian
bank involved. Approval of the 'transfer agent' - invariably a bank - will
be sufficient. Furthermore, foreign investors will no longer need to submit
a stock certificate.
Mr Singson said the reforms would address stockbrokers' concerns about
delays in the repatriation of foreign investments in central bank-approved
Philippine securities and the lack of effective control by the custodian
banks of the central bank registration documents.

FT  26 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Banks take interest in credit
cards - Moves in a fight to keep lucrative business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US financial institutions, fearful of losing ground in one of their most
lucrative businesses, are pulling every lever they can find to keep their
credit card holders and affiliated retailers happy.
American Express took the unprecedented step this week of cutting its
commission on food and drink bills charged to its green and gold cards. It
was responding to a threatened boycott by recession-hit restaurants in
Boston. It will reduce the fee on a sliding scale, with large restaurants
getting a half-percentage point drop to 2.75 per cent.
Citibank, by far the country's biggest credit card issuer, recently launched
a service which guarantees that its card-holders pay the lowest prices
available on the goods they buy. The bank says it has received claims
numbering 'in the hundreds' since the promotion began three weeks ago.
Some banks are also bringing down the interest rates they charge on
outstanding card balances.
First Wachovia, the Atlanta-based super-regional bank, this week offered the
lowest rate of any leading issuer - a floating rate of prime plus 2.9
percentage points, which at present translates to 11.9 per cent.
The Dollars 39 annual fee is higher however, than most other cards.
Chemical Bank, the 20th biggest issuer, is also introducing a floating rate
on its Visa and MasterCard, though at considerably higher rates than First
Wachovia.
Financial institutions are loathe to lose card-holders at a time when many
other parts of their business are under pressure. First Chicago, whose 6.6m
accounts make it the country's third biggest card issuer, raised Dollars
91.5m in credit card fees in the first three months of this year, equal to
34 per cent of its total non-interest revenue, and up from 26 per cent last
year.
Furthermore, the banks are realising that in a mature market it is cheaper
to hang on to an existing customer than to pull in a new one. Mr Jerry
Craft, executive vice-president at First Wachovia Card Services, says the
bank hopes that its new low interest rate will enable it to reduce marketing
and customer-retention costs.
The banks are facing severe competition for card business not among
themselves but from a growing number of other issuers, the most aggressive
of which is American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the telephone company. By
forging links with small banks, AT&amp;T last year gained Visa and MasterCard
franchises for its Universal card. It then marketed the card vigorously by
waiving the annual fee and offering lower interest rates than the 19.8 per
cent quoted by most money-centre banks.
The Nilson Report, a California-based publication which tracks the credit
card business, estimates that AT&amp;T had by last December vaulted into sixth
position among card issuers, with 4.5m holders.
Sears, the Chicago-based retailing and financial services group, is now
trying to get a Visa franchise through its purchase of a failed savings and
loan institution. Its Discover card is already the third most popular card.
Despite the recession, the credit card business continues to grow. The
number of cards in circulation in the US grew by 9.1 per cent last year to
293.4m, and billings jumped by 15.4 per cent.
But the fruits of this growth are by no means being spread around evenly.
Visa's market share, now at 43 per cent, is growing. MasterCard at 26 per
cent and American Express at 24 per cent are losing ground.
American Express set aside Dollars 50m in the first quarter for credit
write-offs on its cards. It ascribed the modest 2.2 per cent rise in the
number of its US cards in the first three months of this year to stricter
screening of applications and 'an intentional tightening' of its marketing
efforts.
But many American Express competitors show no sign of easing up on their
promotion campaigns. While the biggest banks are generally loathe to succumb
to public pressure for lower interest charges, their packages of 'services
and benefits' to card holders keep expanding.
Citibank, for example, has left its interest rate on its Visa and MasterCard
unchanged since 1981. But it now offers, among other things, extended
warranties on purchases made with its cards, discounts on long-distance
phone calls, plus the latest price guarantee scheme.
Five years ago, the 25 biggest Visa and MasterCard issuers accounted for
about 47 per cent of the market.
That slice has now grown to 60 per cent. Mr David Robertson, president of
the Nilson Report, predicts that the intensifying rivalry will inevitably
lead to the biggest issuers getting even bigger, at the expense of their
smaller rivals.

ARACRUZ Celulose, Brazil's leading woodpulp producer, is planning an
international share issue on the New York Stock Exchange to raise between
Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m in the form of American Depository Receipts.
Mr Mauro Molchansky, the company's financial director, said: 'We would like
to open a window on the international markets to finance projects for the
next decade and amortise some of our debt.'
Aracruz has, like other Brazilian companies, been hit by the country's low
standing in the international financial community for its non-payment of
debt, limiting sources of external financing and forcing companies to find
more imaginative avenues.
Mr Molchansky said that of Aracruz's total Dollars 727m debt, Dollars 222m
is short-term which the company would like to convert to longer-term
borrowing or amortise through equity swaps. Salomon Brothers of the US will
act as underwriter to the issue. He added that
Aracruz will be ready to trade its stock internationally by December.

portfolio to back bonds

<TEXT>
HUNGARY plans to build a share portfolio to back a planned issue of
convertible bonds, a privatisation official said yesterday.
As a first step the State Property Agency (SPA), the privatisation
authority, has put aside a 10 per cent state stake in a blue chip company to
inaugurate the fund, according to Mr Peter Rajcsanyi, a director. Buyers of
Hungarian convertible bonds could exercise them into shares from this fund.
After approval of the draft scheme, expected within a month, state stakes in
about 24 partially-privatised companies would be added to the portfolio, Mr
Rajcsanyi said.
Half of these companies would come from Hungary's First Privatisation
Programme, a project begun last September to put 20 of the country's best
companies into private ownership.
Once the Hungarian National Bank had decided on the timing, a single
investment bank would be chosen to manage the convertible bond issue, he
said.
Mr Rajcsanyi's remarks follow a statement by Mr Lajos Bokros, president of
the Budapest Stock Exchange, that Hungary planned to issue Dollars
150m-Dollars 200m worth of convertible bonds on the back of at least Dollars
250m worth of shares.
Convertible bonds are an imaginative way of linking Hungary's ambitious
privatisation programme with paying the country's Dollars 21bn foreign debt,
the highest per capita in eastern Europe.
'This is a novelty and we expect a relatively high interest in capital
markets,' Mr Rajcsanyi said yesterday. 'If we come up with new ideas and new
opportunities, then interest and eagerness can be maintained', he said.
Hungarian officials think that the new type of bonds would contain national
borrowing costs. Making Hungarian bonds convertible would give a foundation
to them that went beyond the usual guarantee of the national central bank,
Mr Rajcsanyi said.

FT  26 APR 91 / International Bonds: Heavy supply of issues in French franc
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO further issues totalling FFr2bn brought the level of supply in the
French franc sector of the Eurobond market to FFr3.5bn in the past two days
.
Credit National, the French financial institution, and a unit of Deutsche
Bank each launched FFr1bn of paper yesterday, following Banque Nationale de
Paris' FFr1.5bn deal on Wednesday.
Secondary market spreads in the French market sector have tightened over the
past month or so due to the shortage of paper in the primary market.
Most government-owned borrowers, having lost their government guarantees for
Eurobond issues, are sticking to the French domestic market rather than pay
a premium to tap the Eurobond market. At the same time, the strength of the
French government bond market, and its gains against the German market, have
buoyed foreign demand for French franc Eurobonds.
The tightening of spreads has allowed borrowers to achieve their funding
targets through the swaps market. The Credit National deal was swapped in
the floating-rate French francs at a couple of basis points below the Paris
interbank offered rate (Pibor). A number of other issuers are currently
looking at the market.
The market was able to absorb the heavy supply quite easily, as the paper
was spread across a wide range of maturities, from four years for Credit
National to 10 years for Deutsche, and among different groups of investors.
The Credit National deal, fungible with an outstanding FFr1bn issue, was
placed mainly with domestic institutions, while the Deutsche deal met strong
demand among German retail investors.
Another short-dated dollar deal, for Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the Finnish
Bank, emerged. The Dollars 200m four-year issue was priced to yield 85 basis
points over the average of three and five year US Treasuries (the four-year
Treasury is not a liquid benchmark).
The Treasury yield curve between three years and five years is unusually
steep, with a differential of about 50 basis points. This has created
arbitrage opportunities in the swaps market. However, dealers say the volume
of short-dated dollar deals has exceeded demand.
National Westminster Bank has raised Dollars 750m of subordinated debt in
the Yankee bond market, the first bank to tap the sector this year. The
10-year bonds, launched by Goldman Sachs, were priced to yield 140 basis
points more than the comparable US Treasury.
Dealers said the Yankee market was currently the cheapest source of
subordinated funding, which banks are keen to raise in order to meet capital
adequacy requirements. There is a strong appetite for high-yielding products
among US institutional investors, according to traders.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S 37,000 finance companies, which have been widely blamed for fuelling
the recent surge in land prices, face new controls on their activities.
If a bill recently presented to the Diet (parliament) is passed, finance
companies with assets of more than Y50bn will be required to file detailed
reports of their lending books each year to the Ministry of Finance. In
addition, they will be subject to spot checks by ministry officials.
The need for tighter controls was highlighted this week when Shizushin
Lease, a leasing company, with debts of Y255.5bn, filed for court protection
from creditors. If the company went under, it would be the first financial
group to go bankrupt during the present squeeze on credit.
The new bill covers leasing companies, housing and consumer credit
operations, which are collectively known in Japan as non-banks, to
distinguish them from banks. Non-banks have not been subject to the same
tight control as banks in the past because they were relatively small. But
in the past five years they have taken advantage of the expansion in demand
for credit to increase their loan portfolios to around Y70,000bn - or around
one sixth of Japan's total banking assets.
The bill comes in response to fierce criticism of finance companies from
politicians, newspaper commentators and others, who blamed them for
supplying too much credit to the property market. The shortcomings of the
regulatory system emerged after the Finance Ministry introduced strict
limits on bank lending to real estate companies but was unable to do the
same for finance companies.
The ministry's moves to regulate finance companies prompted strong
opposition from some credit organisations which said they were being
unfairly blamed for the crisis in land. They argued it was wrong to lump
together companies which lent little to property developers - such as some
credit card companies - with others which had extensive dealings in real
estate. Also, they said the distinction between banks and 'non-banks' was
unfair since some 'non-banks' were closely affiliated to banks.
These concerns are recognised in an annex to the bill which, says the
Finance Ministry, will only use its new powers in relation to land loans.

THE Brazilian stock exchanges yesterday scrapped their exclusive broker
system, moving closer to the auction system of the New York Stock Exchange.
Following a ruling by the National Monetary Council, buyers and sellers of
equities can now close deals without broker intermediation.
'The new rules will add flexibility to the stock exchanges by putting an end
to the brokers' trading monopoly,' said Dr Elizabeth Garbayo, superintendent
of market development at Brazil's stock market watchdog, the Commissao de
Valores Mobiliarios (CVM).
Brazilian investors welcomed the change in rules. 'The broker system has
created an insiders' club at the exchanges,' said Mr Antonio Carlos Molina,
head of the fund manager company Brasilpar Servicos Financeiros. 'This in
turn fostered a shallow market, the sort of environment in which scandals
can abound.'
It is hoped the move will spawn a 'specialist' system similar to the one
operating on the New York Stock Exchange. The specialists would guarantee
liquidity in certain stocks.
But Mr Alvaro Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, was
sceptical. 'This just won't catch on, because the market won't let it,' he
said.

Underlying growth in operating income rose by 60 per cent, while underlying
costs rose by only 25 per cent. The results reflected both the growth of
economic activity in the private sector and the bank's expansion into new

INTERPUBLIC, one of the world's largest marketing groups, announced an 8.4
per cent fall in first-quarter net income from Dollars 8.64m to Dollars
7.9m, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The group, which owns McCann-Erickson and Lintas, the leading international

London-based marketing company, as the main reason for the decline.
Lowe contributed to an increase in Interpublic's gross income to Dollars
353.78m (Dollars 284.49m) but had a negative effect on net income.
Interpublic's earnings per share fell to 22 cents from 26 cents 26) in the
three months to March 31. However, the dividend was raised to 19 cents,
against 17 cents last time.
For the past year the international advertising industry has been depressed
by recessions in the major markets of the US, UK and Australia.

FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Australian airlines join the rat
race - The fast-changing outlook for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Australia, airline officials need to be quick on their feet, not just to
react to market conditions but to keep pace with changes in government
policy.
Only six months ago, the federal Labor government ended decades of strict
regulation of domestic aviation by opening the market to any
Australian-owned entrant which could raise the capital.
Now the government has announced it will go ahead with plans announced in
December to privatise 100 per cent of Australian Airlines, the
government-owned domestic carrier, and 49 per cent of Qantas, the
international flag carrier.
The announcement was welcomed by Australian Airlines, which relishes the
thought of life in the private sector, and predicts strong competition among
foreign carriers keen to acquire a stake.
But the outlook is less certain for Qantas, irreverently known as the flying
rat because of its kangaroo logo, which lost a battle with the government
over the terms of the sale, and will become one of the few international
airlines barred from its own domestic market.
There are also serious concerns over the timing of the privatisations, which
is driven by the government's need to complete the process before March
1993, when it faces a general election.
The industry has still not recovered from a year-long domestic pilots'
strike, which was defeated early last year only with the assistance of the
Royal Australian Air Force.
The strike temporarily grounded both Australian Airlines and Ansett
Australia, jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation; wiped out the profits
of both airlines; and caused a serious dip in inbound tourism.
Weakened by the strike, the airlines were forced to cope with deregulation
and the advent of an independent competitor, Compass Airlines, which
succeeded in sparking off a fares war.
In addition, the Australian industry is suffering with the rest of world
aviation from the impact of the Gulf war and economic slowdowns in the main
English-speaking countries.
As a result, Australian Airlines expects to do little better than break even
at the operating level this year, following an operating loss of ADollars
13m last year, and Qantas will make an operating loss of between ADollars
350m and ADollars 500m, alleviated by profits of up to ADollars 400m from
aircraft sales.
Recognising reality, the government has abandoned plans to float both
airlines this year in favour of a trade sale, which may be followed by a
partial flotation next year.
Interested airlines will shortly receive an information memorandum seeking
bids for up to 25 per cent of either airline, subject to a total overseas
shareholding of 40 per cent for Australian and 35 per cent for Qantas.
The government will decide after seeing the initial bids whether to go ahead
with a partial flotation of the remaining shares or place them with other
strategic investors.
There is likely to be no shortage of interest in Australian Airlines, which
has around 43 per cent of the domestic market, and is known to have had
initial talks with several overseas airlines.
Air New Zealand has been trying for several years to gain access to the
Australian domestic market, and several other regional airlines are believed
to be interested, including Singapore Airlines, Garuda of Indonesia, and
Japan Air Lines.
Potential investors from outside the region include British Airways, which
has strong traditional links with Australia, and United Airlines of the US.
Whichever airlines eventually invest, Australian will gain from increased
access to flows of inbound tourists, 40 per cent of whom use domestic
airlines to travel within Australia.
Not surprisingly, Mr Ted Harris, Australian's chairman, says he welcomes the
government's decision to go ahead with the sales, reasoning that trade
buyers will value the airline on the basis of long-term potential rather
than current performance.
Most of the airlines which are interested in Australian are also looking at
Qantas. However, Qantas is in a much weaker position. The airline misjudged
the growth of the tourist market after the boom during Australia's
bicentenary in 1988, and geared up too quickly to deal with growth which has
not happened.
As a result, it will have to sack between 3,000 and 5,000 of its 20,000
staff to get back into line with the productivity levels of competing
airlines. More drastic surgery is being considered by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, which will produce a crisis report for the airline's board in
May.
Qantas further damaged its image last month when details emerged of a series
of secret agreements with Brierley Investments, American Airlines and Japan
Air Lines hatched during the joint takeover of Air New Zealand in 1989.
The agreements caused Qantas to pay a higher price than its partners for Air
New Zealand shares, and committed it to subsidise dividends to Brierley and,
in some cases, top up the return from future sales of shares.
Qantas says the secret deal was justified because it conferred partial
control of an important competitor, and blocked a rival bid which would have
allowed British Airways to build a powerful South Pacific hub.
Nevertheless, the episode weakened the already insecure position of Qantas
management in Canberra, and helps explain the government's decision to
reject the airline's plans to acquire up to 25 per cent of Australian to
protect its access to domestic traffic.
The decision prompted an angry response from Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman,
who said the airline was being excluded from the domestic market at the same
time as the government was encouraging overseas competitors to buy a stake
in Australian.
Ironically, the explanation offered by government advisers is that allowing
Qantas to enter the domestic market would make it difficult to refuse an
international licence to Ansett, which would then be in a position to
compete with Qantas.
The value of the two airlines is unclear because of the difficulty of
judging the premium which overseas airlines may be willing to pay for
strategic reasons. The government has also muddied the waters by indicating
that it will strengthen the balance sheets of both airlines before the sales
begin.
Government officials are still working on the size of the proposed capital
injections, but airline executives say Qantas has debts of more than
ADollars 3bn compared with equity of around ADollars 1bn, and requires
between ADollars 600m and ADollars 1bn to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to
more acceptable levels. Australian Airlines has debts of ADollars 1.3bn
compared with net assets of around ADollars 1.7bn, and is understood to have
asked the government for ADollars 300m.
On this basis, analysts say Australian is probably worth between ADollars
750m and ADollars 1bn, and Qantas between ADollars 1bn and ADollars 1.5bn -
assuming the government guarantees a stable environment by ruling out
further changes of policy.

Xerox

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STEADY stream of rental and service fees has sheltered Xerox from the
recession's impact on sales of its more expensive copying and duplicating
products.
The Connecticut-based company yesterday reported virtually unchanged
first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 106m, or
Dollars 1.01 a share, compared with Dollars 113m, or 97 cents, a year
earlier.
The 1990 figures exclude a Dollars 367m loss on discontinued financing and
real estate businesses.
Total revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 4.2bn, but masked
significant differences among individual businesses. Lower sales of
electronic typewriters and large copiers were offset by a modest rise in
demand for less expensive duplicators and copiers, and fax machines.
Profits from document processing matched last year's levels, thanks mainly
to growth in income from services, rentals, supplies and financing of
equipment.
Xerox said it has a good response to its new DocuTech product line, launched
last October, which combines several different functions in a single
high-speed machine. It noted that all 28 customers who tested the equipment
have ordered permanent installations, and some have placed further orders.
Mr David Nelson, analyst at Shearson Lehman, predicted DocuTech shipments
will further boost Xerox's sales later this year.
He noted demand for office copiers had been relatively unscathed by the
recession as the volume of copying keeps on rising, while the cost of
lower-end machines had fallen to the point where they were no longer a major
capital investment.
Xerox's financial services business, which includes the insurance group Crum
and Forster, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 6m from Dollars 3m,
despite a 9 per cent fall in revenues to just over Dollars 1bn.
The company said improved insurance underwriting income, helped by an
'aggressive' effort to withdraw from unprofitable business, offset lower
pre-tax capital gains.

second-quarter warning

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer's stock price dropped sharply in early trading yesterday
when the company said second-quarter earnings were expected to be below
those of the same period last year, primarily because of the impact of the
strengthening dollar on overseas profits.
Compaq's share price dropped from a Wednesday close of Dollars 61 7/8 to
trade at Dollars 54 at midday yesterday in New York, a fall of over 12 per
cent.
First-quarter earnings, reported yesterday, were Dollars 114m, or Dollars
1.26 a share, up 24 per cent from Dollars 9m, or Dollars 1.06, a year ago.
The earnings were at the low end of analysts' projections. First-quarter
revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 971m from Dollars 872m a year ago.
Compaq warned that second-quarter earnings would be below those of the
quarter last year when earnings were Dollars 104.3m, or Dollars 1.18 a
share, on revenues of Dollars 862m.
During the first quarter, international revenues rose 16 per cent, while US
revenues rose by 5 per cent, Compaq said. Foreign sales accounted for 59 per
cent of the company's revenues.
'The rising value of the US dollar may have an adverse effect on revenues
and profits in the second quarter,' said Mr Rod Canion, Compaq president and
chief executive.
He explained that Compaq had been able to hedge currency exchanges to mask
unfavourable exchange rate changes toward the end of the first quarter, but
if the dollar continued to rise against foreign currencies, there would be a
significant impact in the second quarter.
The full impact of US price reductions ranging from 8 per cent to 34 per
cent, implemented earlier this month, will also be felt in the second
quarter, the company said. The price cuts are aimed at increasing Compaq's
share of the US personal computer market, said Mr Canion. He noted, however,
that Compaq's unit shipments in the US increased by 20 per cent in the first
quarter, compared with an industry average of about 5 per cent.
After the close of the first quarter, Compaq announced a Dollars 135m equity
investment in Silicon Graphics, a high performance graphics workstation
manufacturer. The companies also reached a technology exchange agreement
under which Compaq will make license payments to Silicon Graphics. Jointly
developed products will be manufactured and marketed by both companies.

FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Allied-Signal hit by car
industry slump

<TEXT>
ALLIED-SIGNAL, the US industrial conglomerate, saw its first-quarter
earnings halved as a result of weak markets in its core automotive,
aerospace and engineered materials businesses.
Net earnings tumbled to Dollars 63m, or 47 cents a share, from Dollars 129m,
or 90 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell to Dollars 2.9bn from Dollars 3.1bn.
Mr Edward Hennessy, chairman of the New Jersey-based company, said profits
were hit by the slump in the North American motor industry, the cutback in
commercial airline traffic (which reduced orders for aircraft spare parts),
and weaker consumer demand, which affected sales of carpet fibre.
The automotive division, whose products include brake systems, spark plugs,
turbochargers and filters, slid to an Dollars 11m loss, from profits of
Dollars 32m.
Second-quarter profits will be significantly boosted, however, by the
Dollars 476m sale of US offshore oil and gas operations owned by Union Texas
Petroleum, in which Allied-Signal has a 39 per cent interest. The sale was
finalised earlier this month.

<TEXT>
NEWMONT Mining, the US natural resources company in which financier Sir
James Goldsmith holds a 42 per cent stake, turned in a 12 per cent decline
in first-quarter net income from continuing operations on sales which fell 9
per cent.
For the three months ended March 31, Newmont recorded net income of Dollars
37.4m, or 55 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 151.3m, against Dollars
57.4m, or 85 cents, on sales of Dollars 165.5m a year ago. The 1990 earnings
were distorted by income from discontinued operations of Dollars 14.7m, or
22 cents a share, and a one-off after-tax gain of Dollars 10.4m, or 16
cents.
Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 37.4m in the 1991 quarter,
compared with Dollars 42.7m a year earlier.
During the first three months of 1991, the average price Newmont received
for gold fell to Dollars 401 an ounce from Dollars 414 an ounce a year
earlier.
Newmont Mining's 90.1 per cent interest in Newmont Gold contributed Dollars
36.2m in pre-tax income, down 23 per cent from Dollars 46.8m the year
before. Newmont Gold received an average of Dollars 373 an ounce for gold in
the latest quarter compared with Dollars 404 a year earlier.
Sir James acquired his holding in Newmont in October in a Dollars 1.3bn
forest-for-gold asset swap with Lord Hanson's UK conglomerate, in which Sir
James exchanged his stake in CFI - the major operating business within
Goldsmith's Oriental Investments group - for the Newmont holding.

<TEXT>
BCE, the telecommunications holding company, reported higher first-quarter
earnings with larger contributions from Bell Canada, the telephone utility,
and Northern Telecom, the equipment manufacturer.
The Canadian company's earnings were CDollars 293m (USDollars 252.5m), or 88
cents a share, up 11 per cent from CDollars 265m, or 82 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues were CDollars 4.7bn, against CDollars 4.4bn.
Bell Canada contributed CDollars 227m, or 74 cents a share, against CDollars
220m, or 73 cents, a year earlier, and paid preferred dividends of CDollars
17m in both periods.
Its local service revenues were up 4 per cent but long-distance fell 2.6 per
cent because of a slow economy. Operating expenses dipped 3 per cent.
Montreal Trustco and TransCanada PipeLines made lower contributions.
Shell Canada posted a CDollars 35m loss in the first quarter, blaming a
sharp drop in refined products prices and the recession. A year earlier it
earned CDollars 63m, or 56 cents.
The company will continue rationalisation while spending heavily to develop
the big Caroline natural gas field in Alberta. This should be generating
revenue early in 1993.
United Westburne, controlled by Lyonnaise des Eaux of France, had a
first-quarter loss of CDollars 8.2m on revenues of CDollars 489m, against a
profit of CDollars 2m, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 591m.
The wholesale plumbing, heating and electrical supplies group will continue
regional expansion in the US.
The shutdown of two Ontario uranium mines and weak metals distribution
markets reduced Rio Algom's sales and earnings in the first quarter.
But the company's potash operations improved with better international
prices while higher production increased returns from Rio's western coal
venture.
Overall, the main Canadian arm of Britain's RTZ Group earned CDollars 14m,
or 31 cents a share, down from CDollars 20.1m, or 44 cents, a year earlier,
on sales of CDollars 265m, against CDollars 355m.
Copper earnings were stable, while the tin mining operation offset lower
prices with higher output.

ALCAN ALUMINIUM warned that it would be forced to reconsider its 1991
capital spending of CDollars 900m (USDollars 775.8m) and its dividend policy
if the global recession continues and aluminium demand remained stagnant.
Mr David Morton, chairman, said after the annual meeting that the world
aluminium industry was going through a 'rough spot that may be quite
prolonged'.
Alcan reported a small loss in the first quarter, but maintained its
quarterly dividend.
Mr Morton would not estimate the impact of low prices and sluggish demand on
Alcan's second quarter, but he indicated that business in April did not show
much change from the first quarter.
Spot ingot prices in London earlier this week touched a four-year low of
around the equivalent of 61.5 US cents a pound. Mr Morton said that at such
a level Alcan could still make an operating profit at the smelter level.

<TEXT>
UNISYS, the struggling computer giant, reported continuing heavy losses for
its first quarter. It said it was 're-evaluating its plans' to reduce costs
by narrowing product lines and selling non-strategic assets.
Unisys said it still expected to reduce its debts, which stand at Dollars
3.43bn, by Dollars 600m this year. However, it acknowledged that this goal
would be harder to achieve than anticipated.
For the first quarter, Unisys reported a net loss of Dollars 98.2m, or 79
cents a share. Analysts had expected losses of around 62 cents a share. In
the first quarter a year ago, the company reported a net loss of Dollars
3.2m, or 19 cents. Revenue for the quarter fell to Dollars 2.06bn, from
Dollars 2.31bn in the same period a year ago.
'Our first-quarter results reflect our previously-announced projection of a
loss for the first quarter and a difficult first half,' said Mr James Unruh,
chairman and chief executive.
The company plans to maintain net worth in excess of Dollars 3.5bn as
required by its bankers.
Unisys said losses on a big government contract to supply desktop computers,
and the effect of government price controls in Brazil, hurt operating profit
in the quarter.

<TEXT>
ADIA, the Swiss-based international employment and services group, yesterday
disclosed a 43 per cent fall to SFr115m (Dollars 78m) in net consolidated
earnings in 1990.
Group turnover, including computer leasing operations, declined by 3.2 per
cent to SFr5.8bn. Revenues from the core employment, security and inspection
services rose 3 per cent to SFr4.1bn.
Adia SA, the Lausanne-based holding company which operates to a fiscal year
ending June 30, will announce its dividend in September. Adia said it would
be lower than the SFr27.5 per bearer share and SFr5.50 per participation
certificate paid on the previous account.
Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German retailing group, and Swiss businessman Mr
Klaus Jacobs acquired a 53 per cent stake in Adia last month. This followed
efforts by Omni Holding, Adia's ultimate parent and the linchpin of
entrepreneur Mr Werner Rey's financial empire, to resolve its debt problems.
At the same time, Adia secured the reimbursement of an outstanding SFr192m
loan to Omni.
Mr Rey's company is under court protection while its assets are being
realised.
In 1990, Adia said, the operating environment had worsened in most of the
countries in which it operates. Worst affected were the US and UK. Also, the
dollar, in which Adia realises half its profits, depreciated throughout the
year against the Swiss franc.
Group operating earnings, excluding computer leasing, fell 26 per cent to
SFr204m. Operating profit from temporary help and personnel services dropped
27 per cent to SFr149m.
The 1990 figure includes SFr28m in provisions which, says Adia, would cover
its remaining exposure to Omni.

<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest company, reported lower first-quarter pre-tax
profits of NKr1.069bn (Dollars 156m) against NKr1.624bn a year earlier. The
company blamed the negative effect of a strong dollar towards the end of the
reporting period.
Net profits fell to NKr611m from NKr813m in the first quarter of last year.
Norsk Hydro said that net income was strongly influenced by the
strengthening of the dollar.
'Altogether, the realised and unrealised effects of foreign exchange
movements during the period resulted in a loss of NKr450m, compared with a
loss of NKr11m in the first quarter,' the company said.
The unrealised exchange loss is expected to be offset over time by the
positive effect of a high dollar on future revenues.
Group operating revenue rose to NKr16.23bn in this year's first quarter,
compared with NKr15.57bn last time. Operating income dipped, however, to
NKr1.81bn from NKr1.89bn in the first quarter of 1990.
'The strengthening of the dollar towards the end of this year's first period
contributed to an increase in financial charges to NKr852m from NKr318m in
the first quarter of last year,' Hydro said.
Provision for current and deferred taxes in the first quarter of 1991
amounted to NKr438m, equivalent to 41 per cent of pre-tax income, compared
with NKr796m, or 49 per cent of pre-tax income, in 1990.

FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: The power of a public sector
hero - Endesa's future under Spain's electricity shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S big private sector electricity generators have nightmares about Mr
Feliciano Fuster trampling over their territory with the might of the state
behind him.
Mr Fuster, a 66-year-old Mallorcan industrial engineer, is president of
Endesa, the state-controlled electricity utility that commands nearly a
quarter of Spain's generating capacity. He is a hero in the public sector
and the central figure in a sweeping and increasingly combative
reorganisation of Spanish utilities by the government.
He is irritated that two of his biggest private sector rivals, Hidrola and
Iberduero, are thinking about merging in order to confront the
reorganisation ordered by Madrid.
'It would not promote competition,' he says. 'In fact, it would be against
competition. I cannot compete with a group that has practically all the
(low-cost) hydroelectric capacity in the country.'
Spain's electricity is generated by more than 20 companies, many of them
small with tiny regional distribution rights. Most own only a half or a
third of a power plant. Because tariffs have been unified, the government
has had to erect a frighteningly complex compensation system where low-cost
producers pay out to high-cost rivals according to standard asset values
held by the companies.
The reorganisation 'which uses the new British model as a form of
confirmation', says Mr Fuster, is designed to create just a few large
generators.
'The efficiency of the sector has not been exactly fantastic,' he says,
pointing out that the industry has short and long-term debts of around
Dollars 40bn, even though final tariffs are roughly similar to other
European countries. 'We are a collection of geographic monopolies. Why
should the sector stay as it is simply because it has traditionally been
that way?'
If that sounds defensive, it is. Endesa has been fiercely criticised for
abandoning its role as a wholesale power supplier to the private utilities,
which are obliged to buy some of their power at a rate fixed by the
government.
In 1989, it bought 9.2 per cent of Sevillana, the Andalucian generator and
distributor. Earlier this year it bought 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in
northern Spain, and smaller packages of shares in Union Fenosa, also in the
north, and Fecsa, the Catalan utility. The president of one Spanish bank
with large holdings in the sector says this amounts to little more than the
nationalisation of the industry.
Nonsense, says Mr Fuster. 'If we wanted to control Sevillana we would have
bought it. What do they accuse us of? Buying 10 per cent of Sevillana? Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya bought 10 per cent just after us and no one said a thing. We
bought that stake because we and Sevilla have a lot of business together.'
'We should not be talking about whether we are public sector or private
sector. We should be talking about whether we are efficient or not. Endesa
is not the state. We are a company in which the state holds a 75 per cent
stake. (The other 25 per cent was floated in Spain and New York three years
ago). We are not nationalising. We are offering public sector management.'
That management has not served Endesa badly. It is the state holding
company, the Instituto de Industria's (INI), most profitable company,
earning some Pta80bn (Dollars 741m) after tax last year.
The fact that Endesa, when it was the sector's ugly duckling, was forced to
concentrate on coal-fired thermal power, while the private sector was
allowed to build hydro-electrical and nuclear plants, has been turned on its
head. Even independent analysts believe it is the most specialised and
efficient thermal power generator in the country now.
However the carping from the private sector will not go away, largely
because Mr Fuster's acquisitions have placed Endesa in a strong position to
head one of the two or three groups - he would rather see Hidrola and
Iberduero each controlling a separate combine - that emerge from the
reorganisation.
Any reorganisation of the sector will involve a huge interchange of assets
between the final sector leaders in order to ensure they have roughly
similar production mixes. Holding on to 11.5 per cent of Fecsa, 5.7 per cent
of Union Fenosa, and 9.2 per cent of Sevillana means Endesa has something to
swap. Viesgo, Mr Fuster says, will probably be sold on again as part of an
asset swap.
Whatever the private sector and its banking partners do, Endesa is probably
unstoppable. Mr Fuster and the government are convinced that larger
generating companies will allow the industry to cut costs and replace
over-regulation with real competition.

UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the leading French state-owned insurer,
yesterday reported a 27 per cent increase in net profits for 1990, writes
William Dawkins in Paris.
Group turnover rose 51 per cent to FFr97.3bn (Dollars 16.5bn). However, UAP
said the underlying rise was 9.4 per cent, after taking account of the
consolidation of its minority stake in Groupe Victoire, and its controlling
stake in Gesa, the Spanish assistance and emergency services group it
acquired in February last year.
Net profits rose from FFr3.4bn in 1989 to FFr4.2bn last year, a 23 per cent
increase, re-adjusted to 27 per cent after changes in accounting principles
to bring UAP in line with international norms.

Government officials describe the process as 'a very advanced idea, although
not yet concrete'. The pool of public banks, as Mr Carlos Solchaga, the

stake in Volvo Car

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Motors and Volvo of Sweden are expected to announce shortly a
preliminary agreement which could lead to the Japanese car maker taking a
substantial minority stake in Volvo Car BV, the Dutch car producer.
Volvo Car BV, which produces Volvo's medium-sized 400 series, is currently
owned 30 per cent by Volvo of Sweden and 70 per cent by Dutch state
interests.
Politicians in The Hague said that Mitsubishi, Volvo and the Dutch Economic
Affairs Ministry were hoping to sign a letter of intent at the end of next
week setting out the basis for further negotiations.
Final agreement on the transaction is expected later in the year. The option
being explored most intensively is a construction whereby each of the three
partners would get a one-third stake in the enlarged share capital of Volvo
Car BV.
As part of the deal, the partners would commit themselves to investing more
than Fl 2.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in the development and production of a new
medium-sized car.
Government officials, who stressed that the negotiations were highly complex
and still far from over, declined to say how much the Dutch state would
receive for its Volvo shares.
Among the most contentious issues is the type and quality of the jobs at
Volvo Car BV, the Netherlands' only car producer. Dutch unions have
consistently argued that the company must be more than a simple assembly
unit and must continue to be involved in research and development.
Government officials said that although the parties were making progress,
the outstanding issues were too complicated to allow final agreement to be
reached quickly.
Mr Hiroshi Ninomiya, chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Europe, said that several
issues in the negotiations were still unresolved. 'We need some more time
for detailed discussions. It is too early to make an official contract.'
Mitsubishi Motors has been in negotiation with Volvo and the Dutch
government for more than a year.
Its entry into car production in the Netherlands would further strengthen
the rapidly growing Japanese car making presence in Europe.
The three leading Japanese car makers, Toyota, Nissan and Honda are already
developing car plants in Europe, all three in the UK.
Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda have been seeking to follow in their wake, but
are seeking partners for a joint venture. Mazda is seeking a collaborative
venture in Europe with Ford of the US, which holds a 25 per cent equity
stake in Mazda.
Earlier this week Suzuki announced that it would begin car assembly in
Hungary at the end of 1992.

LOWER earnings in specialty chemicals and coatings helped push down
first-quarter net profit at Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, by 4.7 per cent
to Fl 192.2m (Dollars 98.6m), writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Operating profit showed a steeper decline, falling by nearly 21 per cent to
Fl 296.6m from Fl 375.2m. However, this decline was largely cushioned by a
substantial reduction in financing charges to Fl 67.7m from Fl 113.6m in the
1990 first quarter.
The company blamed the fall in operating profit mainly on its activities in
Brazil, which had enjoyed a particularly good first quarter in 1990 and
which had not been able to match these results in 1991.
Akzo, the first big Dutch company to release results for early 1991, said in
February that first-quarter results would be lower. But the 4.7 per cent
decline compared well with the 30 per cent fall in 1990.

represented an advance of 5 per cent on the 69.8p of 12 months earlier.
Net revenue for the year amounted to Pounds 10.01m (Pounds 9.39m) for
earnings of 3.1p (2.9p) per share. A proposed final dividend of 2.08p brings
the total to 3.1p (2.82p).

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Japanese group pays Pounds 7m for
Pilkington offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the UK glassmaker, is selling Pilkington Reinforcements, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, to Nippon Sheet Glass Group of Japan for a cash
consideration of Pounds 7.4m.
The disposal takes Pilkington a step forward in its reorganisation strategy
that was outlined at the end of last year after the group saw pre-tax
profits fall 30 per cent in the six months to September to Pounds 103.2m.
Also at the end of last year Pilkington again became the subject of takeover
rumours as BTR, which had bid for the company back in 1986, raised its stake
from 3.75 per cent to 4.04 per cent.
Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, stressed that the disposals
were motivated purely by strategic considerations and were not related to
any bid specul-ation.
However, after the disappointing results, and after BTR had increased its
stake, Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, admitted that the group needed to
consider divesting itself of non-core businesses and eliminating loss-making
operations in order to focus more closely on its major flat and safety glass
activities.
Since the beginning of this year the group has already sold two companies in
the insulation business, closed its sheet glass plant in New Zealand and its
Australian high rise curtain walling business.
It also sold part of its 6.8 per cent shareholding in Taiwan Glass Industry
Corporation to Nippon Sheet Glass and is in the process of selling a 50 per
cent stake of Pilkington Optronics to Thomson CSF, the French defence
electronics group.
Pilkington Reinforcements, which processes glass fibre filaments and yarns
into reinforcement cords for use mainly in vehicle engines and industrial
machinery, did make a profit last year and the sale price to Nippon Sheet
Glass is at a premium to net asset value. But it is not central to
Pilkington's operations, particularly as Pilkington does not make the raw
material fibre that goes into the reinforcement cords, it said.
Nippon Sheet Glass, which makes flat and safety glass, mainly for the
Japanese market, is involved in the reinforcement business through its
Nippon Glass Fiber subsidiary.
The Japanese group has been increasing its exposure to international
markets. Apart from acquiring part of Pilkington's stake in Taiwan Glass
Industry Corporation, last year it bought a 20 per cent stake in
Libbey-Owens-Ford, Pilkington's US subsidiary, where it is represented on
the board.
It also has a joint interest with Pilkington in a company in Taiwan that
makes glass for the auto industry and a Korean glass company.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cash call at Pressac to fund US expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSAC HOLDINGS, the circuit board, electronic and electro-mechanical
component maker, is jumping on the rights issue bandwagon and raising Pounds
5.7m net, principally to fund US expansion.
The group intends to spend Pounds 5m on upgrading its Alabama circuit board
assembly factory. The new plant is expected to be installed by March 1992.
The offer, of up to 8.16m new shares, will be on a 1-for-2 basis at 75p
apiece. The shares, which fell 12p before the announcement, closed down 9p
yesterday at 89p.
Mr Geoff White, chief executive, said that the proposed investment would
enhance Pressac's position as a supplier of flexible printed circuits to the
automotive industry. Net reduction of group debt of approximately Pounds 6m
would be between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 700,000.
A month ago, Pressac reported a slight rise in interim profits to Pounds
1.15m (Pounds 1.02m).
At the time Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, said that the US recession was
'particularly affecting' the automotive industry but argued that it would be
'short-sighted to delay an investment programme because of the present
economic decline'.
The issue has been underwritten by Baring Brothers with Rowe &amp; Pitman acting
as brokers. All the company's directors are to take up their entitlements in
full except for Mr Jeffrey Cullis who is to sell sufficient rights nil paid
to enable him to subscribe for the balance of his entitlement.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: MJ Gleeson buoyed by rents and interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MJ Gleeson Group, the Surrey-based construction and civil engineering
company, bucked the gloomy sector trend by announcing a near-10 per cent
increase in interim profits.
The improvement - from Pounds 4.59m to Pounds 5.05m  - for the six months to
end-December came despite what directors described as 'continuing pressure
on margins in UK contracting and the severely depressed market for
housebuilders.' Turnover expanded to Pounds 104.08m (Pounds 78m).
The group was cushioned to a certain extent by its expanding rental income,
up from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.69m, reflecting satisfactory first lettings
and rent reviews. Trading profit of Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 3.15m) included
interest receivable of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 164,000).
The interim dividend is raised to 3.12p (2.83p), payable from earnings per
share of 32.28p (29.42p).

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Whitbread Investment may hold key to
brewery battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVENISH, the West Country brewer which is fighting off a takeover bid from
Boddington, the pubs, hotels and health-care group, was yesterday warned by
the Whitbread Investment Company not to expect its automatic support.
WIC, an investment trust 49.9 per cent-owned by Whitbread, could decide the
outcome of the battle because of its holdings in both companies. It has a
15.3 per cent stake in Devenish and a 21.9 per cent stake in Boddington.
Devenish said it was hopeful of WIC's support since the investment trust's
policy, as outlined in the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
into the supply of beer, was to support the boards in which it has
investments.
However, WIC, while not wishing to comment directly on the bid, said it was
not its policy to automatically offer support.
It pointed out that when Mr Robin Farrington became its chairman three years
ago he issued a statement outlining the trust's strategy which would guide
its policy in the present takeover battle.
Mr Farrington said while WIC did not normally interfere with the management
of companies in which it had investments, it would judge each situation on
its merits.
He added: 'It may be that on occasions a management team from outside is
thought likely to provide the best prospects for the longer term development
of a company. If that is seen to be the case then the WIC would be prepared
to endorse that option.
'The same would apply if a company receives an offer which in our opinion,
and that of our advisers, more than fully reflects the company's long-term
value.' Analysts interpreted the statement as a significant change of policy
from WIC's past strategy of siding with the boards of companies in which it
invested.
Following the MMC report, the government is forcing all brewers owning more
than 2,000 pubs to release the tie on half of those outlets in excess of
that number by December 1992.
If a brewer has a 15 per cent holding in a rival then those pubs are also
included in the total, complicating Whitbread's situation.
It owns some 17 per cent of Boddington - 5.9 per cent outright, and another
11 per cent through WIC.
However, if Boddington's bid was accepted, Whitbread's holding in the new
company would be reduced to about 12.5 per cent, thereby eliminating the
need to sell any pubs.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Redoute scents victory after first Empire
closing date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDOUTE CATALOGUE, the French mail order retailer, had virtually won control
of Empire Stores Group by the first closing date of its 125p per share bid
on Wednesday.
The offer values Empire at Pounds 49m.
Redoute, part of the La Redoute retail group, owned or had valid acceptances
from 47.9 per cent of Empire's share capital and was waiting for 'valid
cover' on another 4.7 per cent of the group, which would take it to 52.6 per
cent.
The remaining 4.7 per cent includes 4.4 per cent which Redoute acquired on
Wednesday, including the purchase of one large institution's holding.
Redoute is likely to declare the bid unconditional when it receives the
further valid acceptances, but could wait until the next closing date on May
8.
Gecos, the Italian food retail group, has yet to decide which way to take
its 24.2 per cent holding in Empire. It could remain as a minority
shareholder in Empire. Redoute cannot make a better offer to Gecos than it
has to other shareholders. Gecos has said it would clarify its position by
May 1.
Empire shares remained at 126p yesterday, just above the offer price.
The European Commission said yesterday that the merger was 'compatible with
the common market'. Approval from the competition authorities in Brussels
had been expected.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo faces change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALAMAZOO, the office stationery and business forms company, is considering
moves which could end its control by the Kalamazoo Workers' Alliance. They
have been given a cautious welcome by the KWA trustees.
Mr Kenneth Dibben, chairman, said that the board and trustees had been
having discussions concerning the possibility of issuing shares for
acquisitions or to raise funds.
He added that the main concern of the trustees, who control 51.5 per cent at
the moment, was that the company could be taken over and the payment of
dividends discontinued despite making profits.
'We have been looking at some of form of entrenched dividend rights,' he
said. He was hopeful that agreement could be reached within two or three
months.
Mr Dibben believed that if the company had been able to issue shares earlier
it is unlikely that it would have paid cash for recent acquisitions, which
had left it with high borrowings during the downturn.
Kalamazoo also announced the return to interim dividends with a 0.5p
payment, the first since 1988.
For the six months to the end of January pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.03m
against losses of Pounds 1.29m.
Mr Dibben said that taking the recession into account, and the fact that
most of the profits were earned in the second half, he expected full-year
profits of not less than Pounds 3m, compared with Pounds 1.3m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 28.35m, against Pounds 31.52m of which Pounds 3.7m
was from discontinued activities. Earnings per share were 1.8p (nil).
KWA has held a controlling stake for about 25 years. Its holding began at 30
per cent and it was intended by the original owners that this would
eventually rise to 100 per cent through purchases.
However on the death of the company founder involved, KWA was not legally
allowed to make further purchases.
Mr Dibben said it was un-fortunate that the holding at this point had been
51.5 per cent. 'If it had been 30 per cent or 80 per cent we would not be in
this difficulty,' he said.

<TEXT>
BZW, the securities and investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, made an
acceptable profit in the first quarter of the year, Sir John Quinton, group
chairman of Barclays Group, told the annual meeting yesterday.
Trading conditions were no better than in the equivalent period of 1990, Sir
John said.
A considerable number of redundancies had been made at BZW, and the number
of executives had been reduced from 55 to 28 over the past four years.
Only between 1 and 1.5 per cent of Barclay's lending was not good, which,
Sir John claimed, was satisfactory in a time of deep recession.
A shareholder who criticised the appointment of Mr Nigel Lawson, the former
Chancellor of the Exchequer, as a director of Barclays was told that Mr
Lawson had been immensely useful and had more than earned his keep.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Lovell Pounds 30m rights to reduce debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YJ LOVELL (Holdings), the housing and construction company, yesterday
announced a Pounds 30m rights issue and warned that it would have to make
substantial extra provisions against developments in this year's accounts.
The dual announcement sent the shares into a sharp decline to close 33p down
at 145p. The 2-for-5 rights issue of 23.77m shares is pitched at 130p.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said: 'We should have had a rights issue before
the recession but we didn't. This is to make sure we don't come out of the
recession over-geared.'
The company estimated it would have to make extra provisions of between
Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m, before tax relief, for its urban renewal
division.
This comes after a Pounds 16.5m provision made when it decided to close the
business in July last year.
Mr Hichens said since publication of results for the year to end-September
the market served by the urban renewal division had deteriorated further.
There was also a need to set more money aside for the commercial development
and residential operations. In total, the company said it expected to make
provisions of at least Pounds 22.5m in the current year accounts.
Mr Hichens said that, without the rights issue and taking into account the
extra provisions, gearing would have risen to at least 108 per cent. With
the issue proceeds, it would fall to just below 50 per cent. At the end of
last month, indebtedness totalled Pounds 74.7m while the company had Pounds
3m cash.
On current trading, he said half-year results would 'fully reflect' the
impact of poor trading conditions. But, helped by the recent disposal of an
interest in an industrial estate, which produced Pounds 15.6m, Lovell would
show a modest pre-tax profit. It intended to pay maintained interim and
final dividends of 2.2p and 6.75p respectively.
For the year to end-September, Lovell reported a 32 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 19.9m after taking most of the provision for the urban
renewal business as an extra-ordinary item. It dipped into reserves to pay
the dividend.
The rights issue document gives details of the remuneration agreed with Mr
Robert Sellier, the former group managing director at Wimpey who this month
takes over as Lovell's chief executive.
Under a three-year service agreement, he is to receive an annual salary
initially set at Pounds 200,000 and, at the discretion of the board, an
annual bonus of up to 50 per cent of base salary linked to profit targets.
He may apply for options over 400,000 shares.

IN SPITE of a surge in interest charges from Pounds 475,000 to Pounds 1.23m,
Liberty, the retailer and wholesaler of upmarket goods, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7.23m in the year to February 2 1991.
That represented only a marginal decline from Pounds 7.4m in the year to
January 27 1990, and was the second-highest profit reported in its 125-year
history.
Turnover increased by some 9 per cent from Pounds 85.2m to Pounds 92.5m. Tax
took Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3.1m) and minorities Pounds 137,000 (Pounds
89,000), after which earnings per share came out at 26.13p (26.32p).
A final dividend of 5.2p is proposed, making a total for the year of 6.9p
(5.95p).
Mr Harry Weblin, chairman, said that although the retail market had been
extremely difficult, trading profit from retailing activities had improved
from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.19m.
The converting and wholesaling division had concentrated on exports, he
said, but the adverse affect of currency fluctuations put pressure on
margins, and trading profits here fell to Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.64m).
Fabric printing in France showed substantial improvements in both sales and
profitability, and there was a continuing demand for printing and dying.
Property rents increased to Pounds 937,000 (Pounds 821,000).

German buy

<TEXT>
RYAN HOTELS yesterday announced a 4-for-17 rights issue to help fund the
acquisition of the Carat Hotel, Hamburg, which it has agreed to buy for
DM16.25m (Pounds 5.5m) cash.
The Dublin-based group aims to raise about IPounds 4.84m (Pounds 4.36m) net
of expenses through the issue of 13.9m new ordinary shares at 40p each,
compared with a closing price of 42p sterling yesterday.
It also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from IPounds 2.75m to IPounds
2.82m for the year to October 31, but warned that it expected a loss in the
current half as tourist activity failed to recover after the Gulf war.
Turnover fell to IPounds 19.24m (IPounds 21.17m). Interest charges rose to
IPounds 863,000 (IPounds 775,000). Earnings per share fell to IPounds 4.48p
(IPounds 4.57p). The final dividend is maintained at 1.25p, making an
unchanged total of 1.75p.
Borrowings will make up the balance of the purchase price. These represent
30 per cent of shareholders' funds.
The acquisition follows the group's strategy of buying hotels with
year-round corporate business. It brings the number of its hotels on the
Continent to three, and the profit contribution to 35 per cent.
In March the company sold 65 per cent of the equity of Blooms Restaurant,
which owns, among others, Blooms Hotel in Dublin, to former executives for
IPounds 4.25m.
The consideration represents the net asset value of the hotels, which
contributed a trading profit of IPounds 447,000 to last year's results.
Ryan still holds 1.63m redeemable cumulative preference shares and has an
option to sell the remaining stake for at least IPounds 1.75m.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, has sold the
electrical equipment distribution arm of STC, its recently-acquired UK
subsidiary, to CDME, the French electrical wholesaling company.
Consideration for the sale, which is the result of an auction, is not being
disclosed.
Mr Alain Viry, a director of CDME, said the purchase marked the company's
first inroad into the UK and would give it, at a stroke, about 10 per cent
of that electrical equipment wholesaling market.
There has been speculation that Northern Telecom would sell the business
ever since it acquired STC in an agreed Pounds 1.9bn deal last November.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Coats cleared to bid for Tootal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has cleared the way for Coats Viyella to pursue
its Pounds 194m hostile takeover bid for Tootal, another of the UK's leading
textile groups, by recommending that the bid should not be referred to the
Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission.
The MMC conducted an investigation into the prospective merger between Coats
and Tootal two years ago after the two companies agreed terms for a friendly
merger. The Pounds 395m agreed bid lapsed during the MMC investigation.
Coats waited until March this year to make another offer, this time on a
hostile basis.
The current bid was put on ice during the OFT's investigation. Tootal, which
is fighting fiercely against the bid, now has two days - until Saturday - in
which to issue any new information to its shareholders.
Tootal plans to publish details of a profits forecast - covering profits
before and after tax together with earnings per share - for the year to
January 31.
It will also release details of 'specific projects' for its core businesses
intended to 'improve profitability significantly' in the next financial
year.
Coats, which already owns 29.4 per cent of Tootal, yesterday demanded that
it produce a balance sheet and cashflow statement for the 1990-91 financial
year. Coats also asked for further details of the Pounds 23m extraordinary
restructuring costs that Tootal included in its recently released
preliminary results.
Tootal, which was forced by the timing of Coats' bid to bring forward the
publication of its preliminary results so that it could include them in its
defence document, said it would wait until its annual report came out at the
usual time in May to produce the balance sheet and cashflow statement.
For weeks the stock market has been speculating that Coats would make a
second offer after Tootal has issued its profits forecast.
Tootal's shares, which rose above Coats' original offer of 65p cash shortly
after the bid in anticipation of a second offer, were unchanged at 76p
yesterday. Coats' shares also ended the day unchanged at 140p.

TT Group, the industrial holding company, has increased its hostile bid for
Magnetic Materials Group, the USM-quoted maker of magnetic components, from
Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 9.2m, writes Jane Fuller.
This followed TT's purchase yesterday of a further 7.4 per cent stake at 50p
per share, against the original offer price of 37p. TT now controls 24.8 per
cent of its target.
MMG's share price has risen 10p to 51p since the first offer was announced
on April 17.
TT said the new offer represented a historic p/e of 13.4, but MMG said the
price still did not reflect the underlying value of its niche businesses,
which supply long-term growth sectors - telecommunications, aerospace,
automotive and instrumentation.
It also stressed its gearing of 14.4 per cent on net debt of Pounds 1.6m at
the June year-end, and the net asset value of 61.8p.

offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, yesterday formally completed its
emergency recapitalisation package and announced that 240 of its senior
managers had subscribed to a Pounds 5m open offer for shares, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
Late last month Saatchi concluded weeks of tense negotiations by securing
shareholders' approval for the recapitalisation.
It involved a Pounds 55m rights issue and preference shareholders swapping
their stock for ordinary shares, after which Saatchi's ordinary share
capital has increased nearly tenfold to about 1.54bn shares.
The Pounds 5m management offer, which was underwritten by Mr Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, involved issuing 28.49m shares at 17.55p
each.
Mr Louis-Dreyfus, who had pledged to buy at least Pounds 1m of shares in the
management offer, now holds 8.79m shares.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Bank issues writ against Raglan Prop Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAGLAN PROPERTY Trust yesterday announced that Security Pacific, one of its
bankers, had placed its Piries Place subsidiary into receivership and issued
a writ against the parent company.
The subsidiary, which is in the hands of Price Waterhouse, developed a
scheme comprising a supermarket, shops and offices in Horsham, West Sussex.
Although the supermarket and a number of the shops are let and trading, the
development has fallen sharply in value.
The writ issued by Security Pacific on April 9 is thought to concern the
Pounds 11m limited recourse loan that financed the scheme. There is a
dispute about the construction cost overruns that have been guaranteed by
the parent company. Raglan said it would vigorously defend the action.
Raglan said its principal bankers - Kleinwort Benson, Midland and National
Westminster - had been informed about these events and had confirmed their
support.
Raglan's share price fell  1/2 p to 2 1/2 p.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Etam falls 51% to Pounds 8.5m but holds
final dividend at 4.65p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETAM, the clothing retailer which has been approached by the investment
vehicle of a South African family, suffered a 51 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits in the year to January 26.
The taxable figure of Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 17.5m) came after a first-half
loss of Pounds 1.1m. After two dividend cuts in the past 12 months, the
final is maintained at 4.65p, for a total of 5.85p (6.6p).
The better-than-expected news initially drove up the share price by about
10p. It closed 2p ahead at 162p.
Since the beginning of February, when Oceana Investment Corporation made a
draft proposal to obtain more than 50 per cent of the shares, the price has
recovered from less than 100p, outperforming the market by 43 per cent
before yesterday's rise.
Etam, which rebuffed the approach, said the Takeover Panel had ruled that it
was in an offer period.
Oceana, controlled by the Lewis family, has a 6.6 per cent stake.
Etam's pre-tax figure was the worst since 1983-84 and the dividend was only
1.3 times covered by earnings per share of 7.51p (16.7p).
Turnover continued to grow to Pounds 206.5m (Pounds 181.2m), a 14 per cent
increase; but profit before interest fell by 37 per cent to Pounds 10.5m
(Pounds 16.8m) in spite of an Pounds 870,000 benefit from a change in
depreciation policy.
Although Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.8m) cash was held in January, debt peaked at
nearly Pounds 15m and Pounds 1m interest charges replaced Pounds 640,000
income. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1m were also taken above the line.
A four-year expansion programme that increased shop floorspace by 60 per
cent to 860,000 sq ft and the number of outlets to about 250 was completed
by the middle of the year. Mr Rodney East, chief executive, said the large
amount of new space had put pressure on costs, which were also pushed up by
rents, rates and wages.
Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the poll tax and high mortgage rates
had hit its customers, traditionally younger women in the C1/C2 social
group.
In response to the decrease in the number of 15 to 25-year-olds, the group
was moving down as far as five-year-olds with its Tammy Girl range and up to
35-year-olds at its Etam shops, which account for more than 60 per cent of
the business.
Of the two 1987 acquisitions, Snob was making a useful contribution from its
teenage base, but Peter Brown, the menswear chain, incurred a loss.
COMMENT
Pity the investor who bought shares at 319p in the July 1987 placing which
raised Pounds 34m. Between then and last October's low of 60p, the shares
underperformed the market by 77 per cent. Over the past four years Etam has
invested Pounds 78m, against depreciation of Pounds 29m, more than doubled
its floor space and increased turnover by more than 80 per cent. But pre-tax
profit has fallen to less than half the record Pounds 17.9m made in 1987-88.
The group must, however, be given credit for dragging itself out of the
first-half mire, even if a little of the gloss is put down to defensive
moves against Oceana. This year it should benefit from cost savings, the
elimination of losses and a lower interest charge. Even a modest increase in
sales should have a favourable impact on the bottom line. Pre-tax profit
forecasts range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 13m, giving a prospective p/e of
between 13 and 16. That rating has as much to do with bid speculation as
with recovery potential.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: N Brown placing as profits rise 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
N BROWN Group, the home shopping concern, joined the long list of companies
seeking funding from the stock market yesterday when it asked shareholders
for a net Pounds 16.4m to finance the development of a centralised warehouse
and distribution centre.
The placing and open offer, which represents the first time the company has
sought equity finance since 1971, is on a 1-for-8 basis at 209p per share.
The issue was well received in the City and the shares closed 3p higher at
228p.
Sir David Alliance, chairman, and his family trusts, have bought an
additional 1m shares in the company, taking their total holding to 65 per
cent, and have agreed to take up their full entitlement of shares under the
issue.
The balance has been conditionally placed with institutional investors by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, subject to clawback from existing shareholders.
N Brown also brought forward its annual results yesterday to coincide with
the rights issue. These showed that pre-tax profits had advanced by 12 per
cent to Pounds 14.01m on sales of Pounds 140.17m (Pounds 126.57m).
Earnings per share rose from 13.95p to 15.67p and a final dividend of 4p is
recommended for a total of 5.65p, a 7.6 per cent increase.
The proceeds of the rights issue will help offset the Pounds 20m cost of
developing the company's warehouse at Shaw, near Manchester. By the end of
the year N Brown had already spent Pounds 18m on the project.
Following the rights issue, the company's gearing level will fall from 119
per cent to 56 per cent, helping to reduce its interest charge, which last
year amounted to Pounds 5.65m.
The company's core catalogues, targeted mainly at niche markets, were said
to have contributed a satisfactory performance. During the year N Brown also
launched another three catalogues including one for the disabled.
'There are 4m people from the wheelchair-bound to those with rheumatism who
are classified as disabled. The high street does not look after them so we
launched a catalogue for them,' said Mr Jim Martin, managing director.
He said he remained unconcerned by the recent consolidation of the UK mail
order industry which had seen Otto Versand, of Germany, snap up Grattan from
Next and Redoute Groupe, of France, buy Empire Stores Group. But he added
that in due course N Brown would look to develop its presence in continental
Europe.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Frogmore hits out at Southend Prop's
gearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHEND Property Holdings, which is attempting to become one of the largest
quoted property companies in the UK through a Pounds 130m paper bid for
Frogmore Estates, yesterday said that the merger would create a stronger,
better balanced portfolio, savings in administrative costs and improved
liquidity for the shares.
Frogmore Estates hit back, however, saying that: 'Southend's offer is no
more than an attempt to solve a very real gearing problem at Frogmore
shareholders' expense'.
In the offer document, posted yesterday, Southend announced a revised net
asset value per share of 147p. This followed a revaluation of its investment
property portfolio which has declined 8 per cent in value to Pounds 239.4m
since the end of March 1990.
Frogmore said it noted this revised figure with considerable surprise.
'Recently reported net asset values of other property companies,
particularly those concentrated in offices and retail, have shown
considerable declines,' it said.
Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend, said that the relatively small
decline was explained by the absence of any City of London properties and a
conservative internal valuation last year.
Southend said that its gearing after revaluation was 123 per cent and Pounds
100m of its Pounds 158m borrowings were in the form of a 35-year quoted
debenture at a fixed interest cost of 6.9 per cent after tax.
The merged group would have gearing of 49 per cent and would have gross
assets in excess of Pounds 600m, net assets of Pounds 330m and net
borrowings of Pounds 161m.

FT  26 APR 91 / Borrowers bank on a good relationship: How the UK credit
squeeze is forcing companies back to their traditional lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER almost a decade of being spoilt for choice by a procession of
business-hungry bankers, blue chip companies are having to pay more for
their credit facilities.
'The cost of borrowing is certainly rising,' says Mr Christopher Bull,
finance director of BTR, the industrial conglomerate. 'The days when banks
would clamour to lend at very fine margins are over.'
The trend reflects the return of a seller's market as banks concentrate on
securing adequate returns on their capital.
Their changed priorities stem partly from the need to satisfy capital
adequacy requirements and comply with the Bank for International
Settlements' capital ratios.
'The Basle ratios are driving the pricing policy of the banking system,'
says Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank.
Companies have observed less of an increase in the prices of day-to-day cash
management tools. These, they note, do not entail the commitment of valuable
bank capital.
Mr Ian Duncan, finance director of Tomkins, the conglomerate, says: 'The
market is as competitive as ever for forward rate agreements (FRAs), swaps
and large foreign exchange transactions.'
But they say that banks are noticeably reluctant to agree to loan requests
under uncommitted credit facilities.
'We have experienced a number of cases of banks not being willing to lend on
uncommitted lines, particularly when the loan period would take in the end
of the quarter, when their balance-sheets are being assessed,' says BTR's Mr
Bull.
The credit squeeze has given a boost to relationship banking, which had been
exposed to intense pressure while price competition was keen.
'The reason people are emphasising relationships now is that they have to,'
says Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, the glassmaker. 'The
banks just doing transactions - the Japanese in particular - have gone
home.'
Blue chips say they never abandoned relationship banking because of its many
advantages. Even News Corporation, whose recent debt restructuring required
the co-operation of 146 bank lenders, says it has 'always stuck with'
relationships.
'The transactions that the 146 banks participated in were all originated by
a small group of banks that did everything for us,' the company says.
Relationship bankers, companies argue, tend to be more reliable in times of
distress, more trustworthy, faster on their feet in bid situations, and
dream up more useful new ideas.
'Relationship banking has two benefits for us,' says Mr Nigel Stapleton,
finance director of the publisher, Reed International. 'First, they are more
responsive when we need something done quickly. Second, because they know
the business, they come up with some relevant innovative ideas.'
If Reed had put its credit facilities with the banks offering the lowest
commitment fees during the lending spree, it could have ended up with lines
in place from the failed Bank of New England, Mr Stapleton points out.
'I like to have clear relationships with a number of banks which means that
if it starts to rain, the umbrella stays up,' says Mr Bob Carlton-Porter,
finance director of the building products group, ECC.
In fact, many finance directors ensured that their companies obtained
relationship banking on the cheap during the buyer's market by using offers
from transactional-oriented banks to drive down their core bankers' prices.
'We use good rates as leverage,' says Mr David Jinks, finance director of
Cadbury Schweppes, the soft drink and confectionery group. 'Clearly one has
to take what is available in the market at the best rates.'
Others achieved a similar goal by putting multi-option facilities (Mofs) in
place, tying their lenders up in one facility at a lower cost than a
bilateral overdraft agreement or a syndicated term loan.
'Our Mof didn't cost me more than 2-3 basis points,' says Mr Nigel Turnbull,
finance director of Rank Organisation, the leisure group.
BTR's Mof, arranged in 1987, provided the group with Pounds 500m in a
standby line of credit for at least five years at an annual average cost of
3 1/2 basis points.
The lenders hoped to benefit by supplying all of their customers' ancillary
banking requirements. But, with up to 20 banks typically bidding for the
work, the customers were usually assured a competitive quotation.
Most transaction-oriented banks have now departed the fray, reducing the
blue chips' bargaining power, and new Mofs are scarcer than hens' teeth.
Furthermore, lending for some purposes - for example, to buy property - is
hard to find at any price.
'Very few banks or investors are interested in property finance,' says Mr
Donald Main, finance director of Trusthouse Forte, the hotels group.
'We have seen pricing this year go shooting up,' says Mr Turnbull of Rank.
'If we tried to put the same committed lines in place it would cost us at
least 50 basis points more than it would have two years ago.'
The situation may get worse, from a corporate perspective, before it gets
better.
NatWest's Lord Alexander said last month that 'corporate customers may well
find that available funds will continue to decline in real terms, and that
the price of those funds will continue to rise, even for the larger
companies, to a 1 per cent margin.'
Eventually, however, the finance directors of most blue chips expect the
availability of cheap finance to increase as pressures on banks ease. These
veterans of previous business cycles doubt that super-keen pricing will be
unique to the 1980s.
'You could have asked that question post-1974 and people would have replied
'We have learnt our lesson now',' says Mr Duncan of Tomkins. 'It is a
function of the cycle, sadly. There will always be banks who look for an
apparently quicker profit with a lower margin.'
Trusthouse Forte's Mr Main says: 'It is currently a seller's market as far
as the banks are concerned. But in 18 months to two years it will probably
be quite different.'

FT  26 APR 91 / GPT and Siemens launch switchboard joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electronics group, and GPT, the largest UK
telecommunications manufacturer, have agreed to merge their British
distribution companies for computerised switchboards.
The joint venture will have a turnover of Pounds 170m and employ 2,000
people. It is intended to be a stronger force in the UK market with the
ability to cater to the needs of multinational customers.
Siemens, which owns 40 per cent of GPT, stressed that it was not taking
greater control of the company.
There has been speculation since Siemens and the UK's General Electric
Company jointly acquired Plessey in 1989 that the German group would
gradually come to dominate GPT, a former GEC/Plessey joint venture.
However, Siemens said: 'This is not the next step in Siemens taking a
greater share in GPT. Whatever happens in that direction is in the hands of
Lord Weinstock (GEC's managing director).'
The two companies being merged are GPT Sales and Service, which has turnover
of Pounds 130m and employs 1,600 people, and Siemens Communications Systems,
formerly known as Norton, which has a turnover of Pounds 40m and employs 450
people.
The merger is conditional on the approval of the Office of Fair Trading.
Following the merger, Siemens and GEC will each indirectly own 50 per cent
of the venture, to be known as GPT Communications Systems.
Siemens will own 17 per cent of the venture directly with the remainder
coming through its 40 per cent stake of GPT.
Mr Bryan Meade, a senior GPT executive, will be chairman, and Mr Peter
Zaboji, a former Siemens executive, will be managing director.
GPT and Siemens will appoint equal numbers of directors to the company's
board.
The venture will be financially consolidated into GPT, which will own 83 per
cent.
GPT Communications Systems will have between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of
the market for distributing private auotmatic branch exchanges (PABXs).
The other major players in the market are British Telecom and Mercury
Communications, both of which are important outlets for GPT's products.
The joint venture relates only to distribution, with manufacturing
continuing to be the responsibility of GPT.

FT  26 APR 91 / ICI profits plunge 52% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday reported a 52 per cent fall in
first-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 198m. Turnover fell 12 per cent to
Pounds 3.05bn.
The chairman, Sir Denys Henderson, said: 'Our results reflect the
recessionary conditions in many markets. The first half is likely to remain
difficult but some modest improvement in demand is possible later in the
year.'
Most analysts had forecast an even worse outcome, so ICI shares rose sharply
when the figures were announced. However, the price fell back later to close
just 3p up at 1073p.
Net profits after tax for the first quarter fell from Pounds 265m to Pounds
123m, giving earnings per share of 17.3p (38.1p).
ICI Pharmaceuticals, whose strong performance during 1990 underpinned the
results of the whole group, showed a surprisingly sharp fall in the first
quarter of 1991. Trading profit fell from Pounds 144m to Pounds 88m and
turnover was Pounds 324m, down from Pounds 367m the previous year.
The company said the underlying pharmaceuticals business remained strong.
The 1991 figure was hit by advance buying of drugs last year to beat price
increases, and by the weaker US dollar.
Turnover in paints fell from Pounds 417m to Pounds 362m, but the trading
profit improved marginally - from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19m  - as the
business cut costs.
The quarter's only significant improvement was in fertilisers where trading
profits jumped from Pounds 1m to Pounds 9m. ICI tried to sell the fertiliser
business last year to Kemira of Finland but was blocked by the UK government
on the advice of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Other agricultural products performed reasonably well. Trading profits in
agrochemicals and seeds fell only slightly from Pounds 72m to Pounds 67m
even though European sales were hit by cold weather in January and February.
Worst hit by the recession were petrochemicals and plastics, which made a
Pounds 6m loss, compared to a profit the previous year of Pounds 38m, on
turnover of Pounds 538m (Pounds 601m).
'If there is one area where we see some concern about whether we have seen
the bottom of the recession, it is petrochemicals and plastics,' said Mr
Colin Short, finance director. 'There may be some way to go before we see
the bottom there.' Chemical analysts say that plastics prices have fallen
heavily during April.
The profit margins of ICI and other international petrochemical producers
are likely to be substantially worse during the second quarter of the year
than during the first quarter.
Even though ICI's results for the first three months were above market
expectations, analysts were reluctant to upgrade their profits forecasts for
the whole year.
UBS Phillips and Drew is still going for Pounds 700m, BZW for Pounds 750m
and Kleinwort Benson for Pounds 860m.
ICI's pre-tax profits were Pounds 977m in 1990 and Pounds 1.53bn in 1989.

FT  26 APR 91 / GEC Alsthom plant in N Ireland to shut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French engineering group, is to cut 900 jobs in the
UK and close its power equipment plant at Larne, Northern Ireland, at the
end of this year.
The retrenchment is a result of the electricity industry's shift away from
large steam turbines to smaller, more efficient combined-cycle plants. GEC
Alsthom's Larne factory, which employs 500, produces large steam turbines
and was particularly vulnerable to the change in philosophy. Its closure is
a big blow to the Northern Ireland economy, and was attacked by trade union
leaders.
The remaining job cuts involve 200 workers at Stafford, 175 at Rugby and 28
at Manchester. GEC Alsthom, which is jointly owned by the General Electric
Company of the UK and Alcatel Alsthom of France, employs 23,000 in the UK,
excluding yesterday's reductions.
Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom, said: 'After the privatisation of
the generating companies contracts we had from the old CEGB were cancelled.
We are also dependent on exports but a number of overseas contracts are
taking longer to fix.'
The closure at Larne comes just three years after the announcement of a
Pounds 20m investment programme, supported by the Northern Ireland
Industrial Development Board, to modernise its production facilities.
Mr Richard Needham, Ulster economy minister, said the announcement was a
serious setback. The government would work closely with the company to try
to minimise the long-term effects.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union,

FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Southend/Frogmore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's offer document from Southend Property for Frogmore merely
underlines the cheekiness of the Pounds 130m bid. In Southend's favour, its
shares have performed twice as well as Frogmore's over the last five years.
But the price of bull market aggression is an uncomfortably stretched
balance sheet. The cost of servicing the Pounds 100m debenture, for example,
may be a fixed 6.9 per cent net; but gross that up and allow for the
discount on the issue's flotation, and 10.5 per cent may not look like cheap
borrowing in a year or two's time. The combined gearing of 49 per cent -
against more than 120 per cent at the moment - offers a convenient way out
at Frogmore's expense.
Frogmore shareholders might just be prepared to back Southend's judgment if
offered attractive terms. But there is no premium for winning control. While
the 455p estimate of the target company's net asset value looks reasonable,
Southend's bid is calculated on a mere 8 per cent drop in the value of its
own property portfolio. It will have to be more generous and throw in at
least an element of cash if it is to have any chance of success.

FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: UK banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of rights issues in the bank sector has helped the market to
value the clearers as a simple bet on interest rates and economic recovery,
similar to the construction and property sectors.
The prospect of flat earnings this year has largely been ignored on the
assumption that 1992 should see a gratifying bounce.
As fresh evidence has suggested that the recession may be deeper and longer
than was thought only weeks ago, the banks have begun to suffer. The UK bad
debt provisions which dragged down profits last year could turn out to be
annoyingly persistent. The sector has underperformed the market by some 4
per cent since its peak in March. Since the start of the year, Midland and
NatWest, seen as the most heavily geared to recovery, have slipped back to
only modest outperformance. Lloyds has done worse again, while Barclays,
financially the strongest of the clearers, has outperformed the market by 10
per cent in the year. Abbey National, alone in having no corporate exposure,
has returned to the top of brokers' buy lists.
All of which highlights the importance of the interim reporting season in
June. If the banks make further large UK provisions, the implication is that
far from being flat, 1991 could actually turn out worse than last year.
Putting a price on 1992 will be harder than ever.

FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From the rubble of the 1980s, a familiar question is emerging: whether
takeovers in the UK are by their nature a bad thing. A House of Commons
committee has been hearing from such as the chairman of Pilkington and Sir
John Clark, the erstwhile head of Plessey, on the iniquities of the present
system. The Guinness appeal has revived memories of the most notorious
takeover of the decade. Some of the arguments deserve careful consideration.
The snag has to do with the examples.
Sir John Clark blames the loss of his company on short-termism. But the real
issue in the Plessey bid was whether long-term research and development
could be achieved by a company of Plessey's size, not whether it would be
undertaken by GEC and Siemens. In the case of Guinness, the central problem
of the old Distillers Company before the takeover was that it was bogged
down in short-term expedients such as price-cutting and overproduction. It
is now perhaps the most successful drinks company in the world, not least by
virtue of its long-term strategy. As for Pilkington, its shares have
underperformed the London market by 40 per cent in the past 20 years. How
long a term does its chairman have in mind?
There may well be scope for reform at the detailed level; it seems generally
agreed, for instance, that the 29.9 per cent bid threshold is set too high.
But the whole argument belongs within a larger one of corporate governance,
which as yet is scarcely being addressed except by those investing
institutions which industry regards as being at the root of the problem.
More fundamentally again, British boardrooms are split between those who
want protection from predators and those who want freedom to prey. The same
Commons committee session which heard from Pilkington was told by
Kingfisher, whose bid for Dixons was blocked on competition grounds last
year, that policy should be clarified to make takeovers simpler. If the
captains of industry do not know what they want, the rest of us cannot help
them.

FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Not much cheer from ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,482.1 (-6.5)
If the UK chancellor is looking further for anecdotal evidence on the
economy, he could do worse than turn to the first-quarter results from
Imperial Chemical Industries. The 52 per cent fall in pre-tax profit
represents a levelling out of sorts after the 72 per cent drop in last
year's final quarter. But the 11 per cent drop in volume is genuinely
startling, even if it compares with the last good period before the 1990
downturn. The company can point to theoretical reasons for optimism, such as
the fall in UK and US interest rates, the stability of oil prices and
sterling's decline against the dollar. But at the operating level, there is
no sign of a revival in orders at all.
More specifically, there is a worrying drop in profits from the
pharmaceuticals division, ICI's traditional prop in the downswing of the
cycle. Even after adjustment for disposals,profits seem to be down by
perhaps a quarter. For the group, the impression is that recovery will be
postponed until the third quarter at the earliest and will be modest when it
arrives. It sounds like a prescription for the UK corporate sector as a
whole, including the likely prospect of limited further recovery in 1992.
But this need not be unduly bad news for ICI's share price, whatever it
means for the market. Assuming recovery is at least discernible by the start
of next year, ICI's present yield of 6.8 per cent should be safe enough. The
shares have almost entirely missed the revival in cyclical stocks such as
housebuilders. Their turn has to come eventually.

FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: Flexibility the key to pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MACMAHON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Roger Lyons (Letters, April 22) is reading my predecessor's letter
too narrowly. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) is keen that
equality in occupational pensions should be achieved as soon as possible,
but it is the compulsory aspect, applied retrospectively, that is both
impractical and expensive. Certainly some schemes have surpluses, but the
majority do not. For many employers the cost would be prohibitive.
The NAPF is not advocating any particular age for equal pensions. That must
be for employers to decide in consultation with their employees. We do,
however, call on the government to facilitate equality by providing some
flexibility in state pension ages.
Occupational pension schemes have a very good history of improving benefits
to meet changing social needs. Given that it is accepted that equal benefits
have to be provided for periods of service after May 17 1990, I have little
doubt that improvements to past service entitlements will be made on a
voluntary and planned basis within an acceptable timescale.

FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: Questioning the value of aid workers' salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr. DONALD B BUTCHER.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Observer neatly linked (April 22) the World Development Movement's
delight at the prime minister's 'hope' - expressed in 1983  - that Britain
would, in five years' time, achieve the aid target of 0.7 per cent of
economic output) with the news that the WDM chief would soon become 'World
Bank fat cat'.
The point is surely worth a little adornment? Since the World Bank annual
salaries will soon pass the Dollars 1bn mark and since the reported 100,000
expatriate experts in just Africa are said to be costing some Dollars 5bn a
year, Britain will have to hurry to double its aid budget just to keep a few
of the aid workers' salaries moving ahead in the time-honoured way. We can
then spare a thought as to whether their activities add a single dollar of
value to the economies in which they labour.
Many claim the value added is negative and the experts say Africa is poorer
today after 40 years of pursuing aid policies which change but little in the
face of staggering failure.
World Bank policies are now being challenged yet again on the entirely new
grounds that they actually prevent the development of the private sector,
the key to any progress.
Why do we go on and on persisting with these failed polices? Simple. Aid is
basically an international business and there are a lot of well-developed
fat cats (WDFCs?) who understandably do not want the milk taken away from
them. The developing countries would be well advised to look elsewhere for
their salvation.

FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: ECGD and political risk re-insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CRABB.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report (April 19) of the speech Mr Malcolm Stephens, chief
executive of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, gave last week to the
Confederation of British Industry pointed out, rightly, the concerns UK
exporters have over the government's preparedness to provide political risk
re-insurance for the soon-to-be-privatised insurance services wing of the
ECGD. You also drew attention to Mr Stephens' argument that the government
was justified in blocking a parliamentary amendment to ensure that such
re-insurance be available for three years after the privatisation because,
if the amendment was passed, new legislation would be required to extend the
three year period.
This, as the Labour party supporters of the amendment know, is nonsense; the
amendment would, in fact, have compelled the government to provide this
essential re-insurance for a minimum of, and not up to, three years after
the privatisation. Exporters now have every reason to fear that a
Conservative government will scrap this support when its commercial risk
re-insurance facility does expire after three years, and therefore that the
level and cost of short-term credit insurance available for exports to the
less-developed countries after that time will depend entirely on what the
privatised company is prepared to offer.
The decision to oppose a move intended to commit the government to providing
support to Britain's hard-pressed exporters certainly casts doubts on ECGD's
motives in participating in a conference, next month, which has been
endorsed by the Institute of Export and the British Exporters Association,
to allow exporters to discuss whether 'the planned changes at ECGD are the
best long-term solution for all concerned' at a time when the Export
Investment Guarantees Bill, which will pave the way for the privatisation,
may have already been passed by parliament, thus letting the government off
the hook.

FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: The subtleties of networking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R. GARRETT.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Campbell's letter (April 9) seems to polarise a position on
networking in organisations where more subtle thinking is needed.
There are no clear definitions of 'official' and 'unofficial' networks in
any organisation in which I have worked. Neither was seen as right or wrong
but both were seen as necessary and sufficient.
There is a need for the discipline and measurement of processes like total
quality management to be integrated with the 'soft' skills of judgment,
sensing, ingenuity and the creation of organisational vision and purpose.
These are explained in the new book Conceptual Tools by Jerry Rhodes.
The present interest in learning organisations is because they seem to offer
a way of integrating the rational and emotional aspects of working life by
tapping the learning of all groups in the organisation and thereby
continuously transforming it.
The desire to break out of exclusive analytical/logic cycles of learning and
tap into the emotional drive and enthusiasm found in the soft learning
cycles of unofficial networks explains, I think, the current trend to
'culture change' programmes in such businesses as BP, BA, Rover, and ICI.
All of this is a great challenge for many directors who still seem stuck in
Bourbon mode - learning nothing and forgetting nothing.

Sir, In the 1970s we were told that government interference would solve
Britain's economic problems. It didn't. In the 1980s, we were told that
getting government out of industry would solve our economic problems. It
hasn't.
A new approach is needed in the 1990s. We might learn from Europe and
welcome the proposed ideas of consultation with employees laid down in the
modest EC-proposed directive of Euro-Works Councils.
Instead, your leader (April 23) continues to sing the song of the 1980s.
Left to themselves British companies, taken as a whole, won't train, won't
invest in manufacturing, and won't consult in a partnership fashion with
their best resource - the skills of their workforce.
In the long (very long) run your hope that market forces will make British
companies consult their workers might come true. But by the end of that long
run as someone might have said the productive British economy will be dead.

FT  26 APR 91 / Seeds of hope for a troubled industry: Five years after
Chernobyl, the outlook for Europe's nuclear energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster in the Soviet
Union, nuclear power remains the controversial fuel par excellence.
Ask a nuclear expert like Mr Jean-Claude Charrault, head of the nuclear
division at the European Commission, about the future and the prospects
appear rosy: 'Nuclear energy is beginning a new phase . . . For the next
century, the nuclear option will remain impossible to do without.'
But ask an equally informed commentator like Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear expert
at Sussex University's science policy research unit, and the emphasis is
different: 'With existing technologies, nuclear power is already on a path
of slow, but inexorable decline. World capacity is at or very near a peak it
may never exceed.'
A similar polarisation of views occurs whenever two or more nuclear pundits
are gathered together. Over the past year, however, there has been one
change: nuclear enthusiasts say they detect the first tentative signs of a
revival, particularly in Europe, as memories of Chernobyl fade.
On the face of it, the evidence to support this claim is thin. Nuclear power
station construction remains at a very low ebb. Only two new nuclear plants
began operating in Europe last year, Penly in France and Neckarwestheim, the
last remaining order in Germany. France and the UK are alone in western
Europe in having nuclear stations under construction.
Yet some recent developments have given hope to the still powerful nuclear
lobby. Sweden, boasting the world's largest nuclear power output per head,
has reversed the decision made in 1988 to begin phasing out nuclear power
from 1995. Facing the prospect of an energy shortfall, many observers now
expect Sweden's 12 nuclear power plants to complete their natural lives.
In a referendum last September, 53 per cent of Swiss voters opposed the
abandonment of nuclear power, though an almost equal number supported a
10-year moratorium on licensing new facilities.
The industry also hopes that the government elected in Finland in March will
give the go-ahead for a fifth nuclear reactor. It detects signs of a
re-think among politicians in Italy, where there has been a moratorium on
nuclear power since a referendum in 1987.
More important still are indications that east European countries will not
abandon nuclear power, despite Chernobyl. Political liberalisation has,
however, led to a re-appraisal of the Soviet-designed reactors, many of
which fell far short of western standards. The five nuclear stations
operating at the start of 1990 in east Germany, for instance, were all
closed down for safety reasons.
But east Europe has an equally pressing environmental problem - its
over-reliance on hugely polluting coal-fired stations. Some countries may
plump for nuclear reactors designed to western standards as a partial
solution. Czechoslovakia has signed separate agreements with the French and
with Westinghouse of the US, both aimed at developing its nuclear industry,
which accounts for 28 per cent of its electricity generation. Bayenwerk,
Pressenelektra and RWE, the three main German utilities, have plans to build
modern nuclear reactors at the east German sites of Greifswald and Stendal,
which housed Soviet-designed plant.
If these are the seeds of hope for the industry, there is still plenty to
worry about. Six smaller European countries - Austria, Denmark, Greece,
Ireland, Norway and Portugal - have no nuclear power and show no signs of
wanting it.
Attempts to expand the industry in Spain have run into the brick wall of
socialist government disapproval and public distrust following a serious
fire at the Vandellos reactor in 1989. Environmental opponents are still
active, notably in Germany, where some nuclear stations have been shut down
following successful challenges to their operating licences in the courts.
In all the struggles between the industry and its opponents, three issues
tend to dominate:
Political support. Some governments in western Europe are trying to rebuild
public confidence in nuclear power. One example was a strongly worded
statement backing nuclear's revival issued last month by Belgium, Britain,
France and Germany.
UK ministers regularly stress their backing for a continued nuclear
programme, even though they are committed to a neutral review of the
industry in 1994, the scheduled completion date for the Sizewell nuclear
station. The next general election is perhaps the most important factor,
since the Labour party opposes more stations after Sizewell.
Environmentalists believe the industry and its government supporters are
fooling themselves when they detect the beginnings of a public groundswell
behind nuclear power again.
'They are under-estimating, one, the public sentiment against nuclear power
and, two, the degree to which the organisation of the environmental movement
has improved incredibly in the last few years,' says Mr John Willis, nuclear
power co-ordinator at Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International. Environment.
In a neat reversal of roles, the nuclear industry is on the side of the
angels on one environmental issue. Unlike coal, oil and gas, nuclear power
does not create carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 'The growing
concern about environmental problems and the recommendations at national and
international levels for limiting air-polluting emissions, bring rather
strong prospects for a substantial increase in the production of electricity
through nuclear power,' says the EC's Mr Charrault.
The green groups are keen to kill this argument stone dead. They argue that
the choice between carbon-emitting coal and nuclear power is a false one.
There are other options, notably energy conservation. 'Nuclear is a silly
option for dealing with the greenhouse effect,' says Mr Willis. 'Any
sensible business person would go for the least cost option.'
Costs. Two events have focused concern on the cost question. The first was
Chernobyl itself, since it led governments and utilities to ponder the huge
potential liabilities if a nuclear disaster occurred in a democratic
country.
The second was the UK government's botched attempt to privatise its nuclear
industry. The cold eye turned by the financial community on nuclear's costs
revealed as misleading its repeated claims to be supplying cheap power. Even
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear operator in England and Wales, now
admits that power from Sizewell will cost 5.2p a unit (kilowatt/hour),
compared with 2.9p from a new gas station.
The nuclear industry believes smaller, better-designed reactors will cut
costs and help to reassure the public on safety. The main manufacturers -
Westinghouse of the US, a joint venture between Framatome of France and
Siemens of Germany, Mitsubishi of Japan and Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swedish-Swiss engineering group - are all working on innovative designs.
But there is a problem: how to finance the multi-billion dollar cost of
bringing these designs to full commercial development. The obvious answer -
persuading the electricity utilities to place orders  - seems blocked.
Nuclear generating capacity in western Europe tripled over the 1980s,
largely thanks to orders placed in the 1970s. This bonanza is unlikely to
repeat itself.
Even nuclear enthusiasts acknowledge that prospects are dim in the US.
France, arguably the world's most successful nuclear nation, has reached
saturation point. Belgium is similarly placed. Some experts also say that no
new orders are expected in west Germany for 10 years.
This leaves Japan, where public opposition is growing; some newly
industrialised countries such as South Korea; eastern Europe; and a few
orders here and there in western European countries like the UK, Finland and
the Netherlands, if political constraints can be overcome. Nukem, the
nuclear consultancy subsidiary of Germany's RWE, forecasts that 12 new
nuclear reactors may be ordered and operating in western Europe (including
east Germany) by 2005. Even this, however, does not add up to a healthy diet
for an industry with such a capacious financial appetite.
Electricity utilities in much of the world face similar financial pressures
to those in the US, where power companies are plumping for smaller, cheaper
gas plants which do not bear the potential liabilities of a nuclear
disaster.
The nuclear lobby points out that some 100 European reactors will reach the
end of their operating lives over the next 30 years. But to enjoy its share
of the feast, this troubled industry will have to survive the next decade,
when there is little reason to expect many of the new orders will be
nuclear.

FT  26 APR 91 / Leading Article: Walesa's challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'AN IRON curtain is descend-ing over the continent.' With these celebrated
words, delivered in 1946, Winston Churchill recognised the onset of the Cold
War and the post-war division of Europe. The curtain remained down for 43
years and then in just a few months was torn asunder. But, as President Lech
Walesa of Poland remarked during his visit to the UK, 'the political iron
curtain should not be replaced by a silver curtain of indifference'. For so
long victims of the Soviet determination to keep them in, must the peoples
of eastern and central Europe now be victims of the European Community's
wish to keep them out?
No people struggled to tear down the curtain as bravely as the Poles. Lech
Walesa is the symbol of a victorious struggle in which, as he says, 'the
peaceful overthrow of communism in Poland changed the visage of the
continent and paved the way back for other countries of central and eastern
Europe to the family of free nations'.
Like other post-communist countries, Poland puts its relations with the
European Community at the heart of foreign policy, domestic politics and
economic reform. It regards membership as the main safeguard for its
democracy and liberal trade as the chief stimulus to its economy. Yet the
leaders of the European Community seem to regard what the Polish government
refers to as 'giving Europe back to Poland and Poland to Europe' as at least
an embarrassment, if not as a nuisance.
Liberal trade
True, EC foreign ministers have now accepted that membership may figure in
the preamble to the prospective association agreement as 'an ultimate,
though not an automatic' goal. EC members have also consented to a 50 per
cent reduction in Poland's external debt. However welcome, these concessions
are not enough. Poland needs more than promises for the distant future; it
needs more than debt forgiveness; and it needs more than aid. Poland needs
liberal trade.
Poland seeks a free trade area with the EC, for essentially all products,
one that would ensure stability of market access for Polish exports (about
half of which already go to the EC) and would also enable Poland to maintain
the open import system it now enjoys.
Market access
Liberal access to EC markets matters to Poland for four reasons: first, the
EC is already by far Poland's most important trading partner and, with the
virtually complete collapse of exports to the Soviet Union, its significance
must grow; second, greater outward orientation is an essential element in
the reform of the Polish economy; third, rapid growth of exports is a
necessary condition for service of debt and attraction of new capital; and,
finally, liberal access to EC markets is the only way that the Polish
government can persuade its people to tolerate liberalism at home.
At present Poland's exports of agricultural commodities, of textiles and
clothing and of steel, which account for about half its exports to the EC,
are under various kinds of restraint. Those restraints did not prevent
Poland from achieving rapid growth of exports last year, but are bound to
limit Poland's long-term capacity to exploit its comparative advantage.
The problem for the EC is that it is committed to offerring asymmetric
advantages to Poland, but finds that Poland's trade regime is more liberal
than its own. How difficult EC negotiators must find it to deal with a
country that embraces both the EC and liberal trade] Unfortunately, the EC's
response seems to be to recommend more protection to Poland rather than
embrace more liberalism for itself.
The leaders of the EC must raise their gaze from their collective navel,
from butter mountains and farmers' votes and even from inter-governmental
conferences. They can choose to create something that has never before
existed: a Europe whole, peaceful and prosperous; or they will bear
responsibility for Latin American-style chaos and instability on their
eastern borders. President Walesa has thrown down the challenge. Dare
European leaders not pick it up?

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The whole map of Europe has been changed . . . But as the deluge subsides
and the waters fall short, we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and
Tyrone emerging once again. The integrity of their quarrels is one of the
few institutions that has been unaltered in the cataclysm which has swept
the world.' - Winston Churchill, after the first world war in 1922.
John O'Hara, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic taxi driver, did not know he was
part of a grotesque overture to historic talks on Northern Ireland's future
as he drove to collect a fare in south Belfast last week.
Hours earlier loyalist paramilitaries had announced the suspension of
'operational hostilities' once talks started. There was a whiff of hope in
the province, as if light had crept beneath the smog of deep sectarian
hatred which has engulfed Northern Ireland for generations.
But as Mr O'Hara slowed near the Lisburn Road, masked gunmen opened fire. He
had become the fifth taxi driver to be murdered in the province in six
months, another grim statistic from more than 20 years of the 'Troubles'.
Next Tuesday, Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, opens a
series of round-table talks involving the province's political parties, the
Irish and UK governments. Just reaching agreement to talk took more than a
year. It will be prefaced with a meeting of British and Irish ministers in
London today.
For the first time in at least 15 years, political leaders are to sit down
and discuss shared problems. The killing will not stop. Men with guns still
walk the streets. But given the tortured politics of Northern Ireland, the
very fact that political leaders are talking is an achievement in itself.
Over the next 10 weeks, conflicting pre-conditions and aspirations will be
juggled and rejuggled in the hope that enough of them can be reconciled to
secure a lasting settlement. Mr Brooke himself admits the possibility of
failure, saying the obstacles to be overcome may be too great 'to be scaled
in the limited time-frame we have given ourselves'.
He has addressed, in the lexicon of the province's politicians, 'the
totality of relationships' within the British Isles. That covers a devolved
government in the province itself, relations with the south, and between
London and Dublin. Talks will start with bilateral meetings, then move to
internal government in the province, before turning to the wider
relationships such as the Anglo-Irish axis.
At the crux are two basic questions. How, and by whom, is Northern Ireland
to be run? And what is its relationship with the rest of the British Isles?
Ultimately the test will be whether shared disillusionment across the two
communities, allied with political intransigence, will be sufficient to
overcome decades of mistrust.
But how the agenda will unfold is as clear as Irish mist. Diametrically
opposed views have to be accommodated. Many old quarrels have to be
forgotten. Northern Ireland remains a black spot of terrorism and
unrepresentative government in an increasingly barrier-free Europe.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, the Rev Ian Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, the unionist
leaders, have been sparring partners for more than 20 years. Some in
Northern Ireland feel progress will come only when the old guard has been
replaced.
Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, along with loyalist
paramilitaries, has been excluded from the talks - partly because the
government is adamant that no concession must be given to terrorists, partly
because the main political parties could never be persuaded to sit at the
same table.
Yet, despite the justifiable qualifications, the latest initiative has,
perhaps, a better chance of success than the many plans littering Northern
Ireland's recent history. Signs of a change of mood are evident.
At least in part, it reflects weariness. In 22 years of 'the Troubles',
2,872 people have been killed in Northern Ireland, the overwhelming majority
of them civilians.
Dominating the province's recent politics has been the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement - a pact which, when signed, led to fiery protests by unionists at
the prominent role it allotted Dublin in the affairs of the province.
Effigies of Mrs Margaret Thatcher were burned outside Belfast City Hall.
Unionists refused to meet government ministers.
Now unionists are prepared to negotiate. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have
responded to a change of mood among their followers. They realise that many
 -particularly the young  - no longer accept the old battle cries of 'no
surrender' and 'Dublin rule is Rome rule'.
There is an urgency among all parties to solve at least some of Northern
Ireland's problems against the backdrop of a Europe striving for greater
convergence. The province cannot afford to become fossilised in its ancient
quarrels. There must be proper political representation.
Attitudes in London, too, are changing. Mr John Major does not have the same
convictions about Ulster as Mrs Thatcher, who helped forge the 1985
agreement, only to be taken aback at the scale of protest from unionists -
including her own supporters. Subsequently, Mrs Thatcher appeared frustrated
with the whole issue, seeing Northern Ireland in terms of security. Mr
Major's relative ignorance is almost an asset. His instinct, according to
one senior official is, as on Europe, 'to get in there and negotiate'. He is
prepared to listen.
Although the government in London hopes the talks will help break the cycle
of violence, the security dilemma will still exist. There are now more than
16,000 army troops in the province. Army action, including house-to-house
searches, alienates munity. Some youths join the paramilitaries just 'to get
their own back' on the army. So the roundabout of violence is given another
spin.
UK government policy is to seek a settlement acceptable to the majority of
people. Finances and energies have been directed, since the 1985 agreement,
at strengthening community relations and breaking the sectarian divide.
Most prominent have been the promotion of integrated schools and
highly-interventionist legislation to end discriminatory employment
practices. The economy of the province, where unemployment reaches 50 per
cent in some pockets, has been pump-primed with billions of Treasury funds -
the Northern Ireland Office expects to spend Pounds 6.4bn this financial
year.
Some successes have been palpable. Ten schools, out of 450 in the province,
take both Protestant and Catholic children - compared with just one a decade
ago. Jobs have been created in the worst ghettos of Belfast and Londonderry.
The new Fair Employment Commission has exposed companies where Protestants
or Catholics have a disproportionate share of jobs. But, given the starkness
of sectarian division only the edges have been chipped away.
Mr Charles Haughey, the Irish Republic's prime minister, has talked of the
need 'to chart a new path which will soften and eventually eliminate the
divisions of the past on this island'. Dublin is willing to contemplate a
new arrangement that would 'transcend' the 1985 pact and, possibly, remove
articles two and three from the Irish constitution which lay claim to
Northern Ireland.
Dublin is aware of changes in its own politics. Half the Irish population is
under 28 and does not carry the emotional baggage associated with a united
Ireland. A visitor to the republic might be surprised at the public
indifference to these talks or to the wider problems of Northern Ireland.
But the sub-text of Irish policy is still the achievement of some form of
unitary state. Mr Haughey has spoken of the need to persuade 'our unionist
countrymen that their future lies with us'. This view is shared by the SDLP.
Again, the unionists are seen as the main problem. 'In the SDLP view, the
central relationship, the one that goes to the heart of the matter, is the
unionist people's relationship with the rest of this island, or rather their
distrust of the rest of this island,' says Mr Hume.
During her election campaign last year Mrs Mary Robinson, Ireland's
president, talked of the need for the republic to 'reach out' to unionists.
But while Mrs Robinson might talk of reconciliation, she has few
constitutional powers and very little influence on the direction of policy.
For their part, the unionists have not rushed to embrace Mrs Robinson.
Underlying the unionists' position is an assumption that the Irish
Republic's claim on Northern Ireland has to be dropped. From Mr Brooke, they
have won an assurance that the province will remain part of the UK as long
as a majority of its population want it.
After that, unionists seek as top priority renegotiation of the Anglo-Irish
agreement, a pact which forced the majority community to realise it could
not take sympathetic government from Westminster for granted.
Unionists are prepared to contemplate a replacement agreement, insisting
that they are committed to good relations with the south. But they argue
Ireland's influence must be no more than that of any other 'foreign
government'.
That leaves scope for textual barter. Giving Dublin the right to be
consulted on the affairs of the province would not be acceptable. Dublin
currently has the right to put forward its views through the Maryfield
secretariat outside Belfast. A right to make representations the British
government, with a consulate in Belfast, might succeed.
On the question of a devolved government there is more of a muddle. Mr
Molyneaux favours a devolved administration fitting 'snugly' into the
British parliamentary system - suggesting he wants little more than a
enhanced 'county council' system.
Mr Paisley backs full-blown legislative devolution along the lines of the
former Stormont parliament. He rejects the concept of a 'power-sharing
executive', believing it did not work under the 1973 Sunningdale agreement,
an early attempt to give the Roman Catholic community a voice in government,
and would give disproportionate power to the minority community.
But, perhaps influenced by the younger generation within the party, most
noticeably Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader, Mr Paisley's Democratic
Unionist party is anxious to look for new schemes for sharing executive
responsibility. There is no expectation of a return to strict majority rule.
What shape then, in an ideal world, might an agreement take if talks were to
succeed? There would almost certainly be a new Northern Ireland
'government', subordinate to Westminster and Dublin, in which the voices of
unionism and nationalism were carefully proportioned.
The replacement Anglo-Irish agreement would build on a willingness among the
peoples of north and south to be 'good neighbours' while accommodating both
nationalist and unionist aspirations.
It is a tall order indeed. Most critically, any deal will depend on mutual
understanding - a sparse commodity in the province. There is no guide to how
the talks will evolve over coming weeks. Northern Ireland officials describe
them as 'organic'.
All parties know they have an opportunity to show progress can be achieved
by discussion and not, as the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries would have
it, by violence. It is a high-risk business. If there is no success then the
grim and utterly predictable likelihood is more violence.

FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: Onnagata - Sadler's Wells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lindsay Kemp, performer and director, high priest of theatrical camp and
drag, is back in town; and, despite the passage of the years, he's just the
same - a self-indulgent trashmonger. This time, however, he is occasionally
touched by things I never thought he could show - soul, wit, eloquence,
talent.
As every FT reader of course knows well, an onnagata is a specialist
travesty performer, a male member of the Japanese Kabuki theatre who
performs only female roles. Kemp takes the idea of the onnagata as the
premise for what gradually becomes a one-person autobiography, an anthology
of Kemp memories. Sounds pretty icky, doesn't it? I was dreading it. For
over half of Onnagata, which is a hundred-minute vehicle for him (no
interval), he and his type of theatre revert to their usual kind of dull,
incense-laden, narcissistic, tacky mystique. But it is far more
forward-moving than most Kemp theatre; and its use of lighting and fabric is
often marvellous.
Kemp's manner tends to be a drag-queeny mix of grande dame and sentimental
grande horizontale. Half of him bravely copes with the ardours of diva-dom,
half of him basks in fond memories of being a great star, lover, whore,
queen bee, murderess, etc. This persona - which some people find so
liberated and liberating - has always struck me as pretty sickly, and I'm
grateful for the unwonted dash of fun he occasionally adds here. And I'm
held by the way he makes Onnagata entirely a personal account. Four other
performers keep reappearing, but veiled and garbed in black - 'invisible'
Bunraku puppeteer figures.
The best scene - his long initiation and debut as onnagata  - occurs early
on. As metaphor, it keeps developing. The puppeteers mask, robe and
transform him. (Something of the objective nature of Japanese theatre rubs
off on him here.) At one point, he quivers in his robes like a moth;
whereupon flames, carried by the 'invisible' men, are carried onstage. You
see just how the onnagata is both frightened and attracted by performing, is
both trapped and excited. In the slow fan ritual dance that follows, gender
really isn't the point; beauty is.
The scenes that follow, much more obviously sensationalist, are far less
interesting. He 'remembers' being various female figures across history and
the globe. His Salome kisses John the Baptist's head (while a voice sings
Dalila's 'Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix'). His Isadora Duncan does some
lumpish half-steps to a Brahms waltz, and his Loie Fuller does some rather
fine things with two huge wings of fluttering fabric and changing colours of
light (while - heaven help us  - the Hostias from Verdi's Requiem plays).
And so on.
The Hostias, like the Cuius Animam from Rossini's Stabat mater, are, of
course, a cheap ploy to seduce an audience. Go it with God all the way to
Sodom. Once or twice, however, Kemp really does use them to suggest
something poignant - that he knows his kind of onnagata is damned but that,
even with Heaven's closed gates in sight, he must still pursue his destiny.
Tripe, but occasionally riveting.

FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: On Wenlock Edge - Purcell Room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The poetry of Housman inspired a whole generation of song composers in this
country, Vaughan Williams being only the most considerable of them. His
cycle On Wenlock Edge is one of the important staging-posts in the evolution
of English song and the prospect of a leading tenor taking it on always
raises hopes.
On Wednesday the singer was Arthur Davies, well-known to audiences at
English National Opera and increasingly on the international stage. His is
an operatic tenor, clear and open in the Welsh tradition. He would probably
be happier singing this cycle with orchestra, as he is not an intimate song
interpreter in the line of Partridge or Rolfe-Johnson; but a little poetry
in his art would undoubtably shine through in the right performance.
Unfortunately the accompaniment was far too heavy; whether through lack of
rehearsal or a belief that they had a big operatic voice to support, the
London Smetana Trio (with extra violin and viola) played several notches too
loudly. That special feeling of a land eternal and tranquil, the heart of
what On Wenlock Edge is all about, was almost wholly lacking.
Almost, because it surfaced in the penultimate song, 'Bredon Hill'. At last
the playing became quiet. We could hear the words for the first time and the
sensitivity with which Davies charted the song's progress from lazy
summertime love to the chill bereavement of winter gave an idea of the
English song interpreter he might aspire to.
There are few song cycles written for piano quintet accompaniment and it was
enterprising of the performers to couple the Vaughan Williams with the first
performance of Marjolijn Anstey's The Lost Summer: Dunkirk 1940, a cantata
based on poems by Ted Harriott. This offers few opportunities for the singer
to show an awareness either of drama or poetry. But Davies's versatile
singing was a reminder of what a valuable tenor he has become to us.

BBC Bristol begins a new season of its ever-interesting 10 x 10 series of
short films by first-time directors with a work called 'The Fall' (10.20
BBC2). If this doesn't make you cry nothing will. The Intermezzo from
'Cavalleria Rusticana' can, on its own, reduce some to tears and when used
as the central theme in a ballet about Celeste Dandeker, a dancer who was
permanently paralysed by an accident on stage, it is enough to make you
howl.
It is quite something to convey as much as this little film does about
dance, and unfairness, and the human spirit, all in 10 minutes.
Channel 4's Short Stories (8.30) investigates the group of people who listen
to and join in Clive Bull's late night phone-in show on London's LBC Radio.
A new series of Your Life In Their Hands (9.30 BBC2) begins with a look at
spiritual healing. Derek Jarman's homosexual film Sebastiane (11.35) in the
'Banned' season on C4 might have seemed more accessible to ordinary viewers
if the dialogue was not in Latin. (English subtitles).

FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: Compagnie Jean Gaudin - The Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programme leaflet begins, of course, with a meaty quotation from Roland
Barthes, and follows it with a message from the mastermind of the evening
telling us that it is not the quotation that influenced him but the way of
thinking. Yes, it is the French new dance back at The Place - the Compagnie
Jean Gaudin  - and yes, the heart plummets as the evening gets under way,
and La Dame aux Camelias is given the rounds of the kitchen.
A few observations from a victim of this enterprise may suggest something of
its flavour. There is a large wooden trellised set, emblazoned (ask not why)
with the Petainist motto Travail, Famille, Patrie. There is a round red
velvet seat with ambulant tendencies on which the performers perch and
journey about the stage area (and how I wish it had done the decent thing
and taken them off to Heathrow).
There are two men and three women involved: I could identify Marguerite and
Armand, but the slightly Spanish girl, and the tall chap in the ill-cut
jacket, mauve skirt and sensible shoes, did not really ring true as Dumas
characters. There was a great deal of dialogue in French, much of it
whispered, all of it of transcendent tedium, with the cove in mauve as chief
chatterbox. He had a heavy English accent and kept his hands very busy above
his waist and shoulders with ever such graceful gesticulation.
Fragments of a squally Callas recording of La Traviata are played when the
chit-chat dies down, and two of the girls suggest the falsities of La Vie by
bursting into mocking laughter from time to time. There are references to
sniffing cocaine. M. Gaudin's 'choreography' is more concerned with
production than steps, and is banal.
The evening amounts to a confused, pretentious, ill-conceived and drearily
executed gloss on its original, and receives the support of the Association
Francaise d'Action Artistique. It is singularly lacking in artistic action,
and I do not find it does any good to the fair name of French contemporary
creativity. It is, though, yet another example of the perfectly dreadful
things the French are perpetrating under the impression that this is modern
dance.
The programme-sheet provides an idiosyncratic translation of the spoken
text. The key to the affair reads: 'Oh, I feel like an indistinct heap
tonight'. A heap of what only General Cambronne could tell.

FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: Twelfth Night - Royal Shakespeare Theatre,
Stratford-Upon-Avon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Shakespeare Company's new production of Twelfth Night at Stratford
is not very romantic, not very pretty and not particularly funny. It is,
nevertheless, riveting to watch and contains one great redeeming grace:
there is some regret shown at the end for the way Malvolio has been treated.
The director, Griff Rhys Jones, must have made a fundamental decision at the
start. That was to dress the court of Illyria in naval uniform. The decision
reduces the romanticism at a stroke. People in uniform walk, behave and even
listen to music in a more formal way than others: they do not fall
uncontrollably head over heels in love. The result is that Terence Hillyer's
Orsino has no great passion for Olivia: he is coolly detached throughout.
On the other hand, the approach has its compensations. Since Orsino so
rapidly changes his affections at the end, there is no reason to believe
that he was much attached to Olivia in the first place. Also, with the naval
uniforms comes a relatively austere setting. The colours are darkish: Laura
Ashley in sombre mood. The restraint is reflected in the playing. This Sir
Toby Belch (Bill Wallis) does not belch. Even he has been a naval officer in
his time and sometimes wears the uniform to show it. In the late night
drinking scene, he is in white tie and tails. The costumes in general are of
the late Victorian, early Edwardian period that is currently fashionable in
Shakespeare productions.
Much of the comedy stems from the play as a whole rather than from
individual characters, though there are some inspired moments. When the law
intervenes in the duel scene, Sir Toby does a sword dance on the foils as if
that is what he had been doing all along. Olivia (Jane Gurnett) wields a
heavier sword than any of them. Ms Gurnett plays the part sensibly and
without coquettishness: a woman who knows the right man when she sees him.
That seems to me the best way of doing it.
Where Olivia comes into her own is when she realises that her steward,
Malvolio, has been maltreated. Her line 'He has been most notoriously
abused' is said slowly and with feeling. Malvolio, played by Freddie Jones,
leaves the stage with some dignity. His threat to be revenged on the whole
pack of them is spoken more in sorrow than in anger, and there is some point
to Orsino's statement that peace must be made with him. This avoids the
cruelty of some productions where Malvolio is treated almost like Shylock.
There is a gloriously flaxen-haired Sir Andrew Aguecheek from Tim McInnerny
and I liked Linda Marlowe's Maria, very much a vivacious gentlewoman. Ken
Wynne's Feste struck me as over-bitter, though this fits with his role in
taunting Malvolio to the end. Altogether this is a more satisfactory
production of Twelfth Night than the one currently showing at the London
Playhouse by Sir Peter Hall because it is more of a piece. A lot of thought
has gone into it; a lot of pleasure comes out of it.

FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: A city with a silver lining - The Museum of Walloon
Art, Liege
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lovers of fine silver quiver at the mention of Liege, the lovely but
much-ravaged city which bestrides the River Meuse. In the middle ages, along
the length of the Meuse there were towns and monasteries famous for
metal-working. The latest flowering of that tradition was the beautiful
17th- and 18th-century silverware of Liege, worthy to rank with the finest
in Europe.
This vanished craft has inspired an important exhibition at the Museum of
Walloon Art in Liege (until June 2). Domestic Silver of the Province of
Liege may not the most alluring of titles. However, this major exhibition
sponsored by Banque IPPA, is something of which Walloon patriots can feel
justly proud.
There has been some highly effective string-pulling behind this exhibition.
Of the 300 or so exhibits, a remarkable two-thirds come from the private
collections of old and unnamed Liegois families. Since it has never been
shown in public nor even published, the experts and dealers are not going to
want to miss such a golden opportunity.
They will also appreciate the exceptionally handsome and scholarly catalogue
(BF 950); it is also, I might add, dry-as-dust. It gives a complete
directory of Liege hallmarks, with the wry comment that it will be a great
help to silver fakers. A few examples of fake pieces have been included in
the show, their modern origin detected because of misunderstood hallmarks.
However, the fake can also be detected thanks to recent research into the
kind of alloy used in Liege, mid-way in quality between Bavaria and Paris.
For the low-brow silver enthusiast, however, the exhibition offers the
pleasure of a vast and varied hoard of covetable objects, ranging from
coffee-pots and candle-snuffers to sword-hilts, cake-slices, and a
clothes-brush. A short didactic section describes the workings of the
all-powerful guild of silversmiths. However, the kind of detailed
information about craftsmen, their workshops and customers which makes
students of the London silver trade so happy, is missing. When the French
army took Liege in 1794 and, horrible deed, burnt the vast cathedral of St
Lambert, they also abolished the guilds and the archives vanished.
Liege in the Ancien Regime was an unusual place. It was the capital of a
principality ruled, as it had been since the days of the great Bishop Notker
in the 10th century, by a Prince-Bishop. And that, we are told with rather
tantalising brevity, accounts for the style of Liege silver. No king meant
no vying to impress foreign diplomats and hostile powers, no posturing noble
courtiers. It meant no Madame de Pompadour, no Madame de Montespan. The
Church dominated life in the city; when the bishop died, they changed the
hall-marks.
Customers for new silver and those who equally often took heirlooms along to
be refashioned, were either clerics or sober-sided bourgeois. Some
impression of the social setting comes from a reproduction of a painting by
the 18th-century artist, Paul-Joseph Delcloche. It shows the bishop and his
dinner-guests supping off oysters. There is plenty of silver about the room
and on the table, but by far the richest object is the jewelled crucifix on
the episcopal midriff.
So Liege silverware tends to be elegant and unostentatious, whether the
pieces are Baroque, Rococo or influenced by the new classicism which creeps
in from around 1750. Generally, fashion tends to be ten years behind Paris
and London. On the other hand, in terms of technique masterpieces were
produced to match anything which could be brought at more metropolitan
centres. Not all the exhibits come from Liege; there is a group of objects
from the so-called bonnes villes of the province, such as Maastricht,
Waremme and Saint-Trond.
Splendid table fountains, containing no one know quite what, were a
particular feature of the Low Countries and there are many in the show,
majestically pear-shaped on three legs. Many coffee-pots and candlesticks of
the 1770s have a violently twisted, swirling form which reminds us that art
nouveau was later to flower spectacularly in Belgium.
Centre-piece of the exhibition is an elegant table laid for a six o'clock
dinner for eight persons. The date would seem to be sometime round the
1780s, last years of the good life in rich, tasteful, independent Liege.

FT  26 APR 91 / Management: A Japanese view of competition - Last night's
Stockton lecture at the LBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quest for the secret of Japan's economic success has brought forth an
avalanche of scholarly, and not so scholarly, books and articles over the
past decade. As a genre it has been dominated by foreigners.
It is salutary, therefore, to hear a Japanese academic of the stature of
Professor Hajime Yamashina - until recently chairman of the department of
precision engineering at Kyoto University and a man associated with two of
Japan's leading business awards, the Production and Maintenance Award and
the Deming Prize - putting so little emphasis on Japan's industrial success
in terms of its financial system or industrial structure.
Instead, Yamashina, in delivering his Stockton lecture at the London
Business School last night, located Japan's industrial strength in
companies' continuous redefinition of what it means to be a competitive
manufacturer in the context of producing 'attractive products with
attractive costs'; and, by seeing orginality in the ability to develop and
make products as well as invent them.
This orientation has had important consequences for the deployment of people
throughout a manufacturing company, and the skills of those employed.
As the charts below indicate, the deployment of engineers in Japan is
greater in the design and developmental phases of manufacture than in the
west, and is comparatively weaker at the stage of origination.
Significantly, the stylised Japanese company employs fewer (but more
qualified) operators than does its western counterpart.
Yamashina said that, in the pursuit of competitive manufacturing, Japanese
engineers in categories (d) and (e) have been concentrating in three areas:
better quality control; higher value-added per person; and, shorter lead
times. All are important, especially the latter.
Product variety is now a given condition of competitive life and, 'there has
been a growing need for products matching individual persons' circumstances,
personality and tastes which eventually leads to customer orientation
production, meaning a separate model for every customer'.
The Japanese are great namers of trends and epochs. The current one is
called 'constantly launching new product period', and it plays to their
strengths by emphasising time-based competition and customer-oriented
production.

FT  26 APR 91 / Management: Northumbrian takes the steam out of bargaining -
The water company's controversial moves to change the role of its eight
unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is all very well for companies to deny bargaining rights to trade unions
when setting up a new plant. But employers which take representational roles
away from unions and give them to organisations they have set up themselves
are courting serious industrial relations problems. They rarely try it.
Northumbrian Water, which supplies water and treats sewage in the north-east
of England, thought the potential rewards were tempting enough for it to
make the attempt, although the value of doing so remains to be seen.
For the moment, however, it is remarkable enough that Northumbrian has
persuaded the eight unions which represent its 1,200 strong work-force that
they should give up the lead role in pay negotiations - and that it has done
so with remarkably little public criticism from them.
The process the company and the unions have recently completed falls short
of derecognition. None the less it will mean a significant diminution in
power at Northumbrian for the eight unions - Nalgo, the GMB, the TGWU, Apex,
Ucatt, the EETPU, the AEU and Nupe - which currently represent the company's
employees.
Following a recent accord, pay and other matters relating to employees will
be determined at a company council consisting of 11 members, four appointed
by management and seven elected (indirectly) by the workforce. Although the
unions will elect a representative to advise the council, they will not
control the selection of the seven employee councillors.
Such a scheme strikes at the heart of trade unionism. It is hard to imagine
anything like it being accepted in union strongholds like local government
or large engineering companies. Yet the unions at Northumbrian, the largest
part of the Northumbrian Water Group, were not an easy target.
The company is, after all, based in the north-east of England, an area where
union traditions are strong. Although the company says the proportion of
employees in unions has slipped from a peak in 1979 of about 98 per cent,
the present figure, 83 per cent, is still above that at many other
organisations.
The industrial relations which Northumbrian has experienced in recent years
hardly provided a reason for the company's action. True, there was a 31-day
strike by manual workers in 1983 but that was part of a national stoppage.
National pay bargaining has since been abandoned, following withdrawal by
Northumbrian and Thames Water, and at Northumbrian both unions and
management believe their relationship since the 1983 strike has been
cordial.
What then were Northumbrian's motives? Mike Temple, regional personnel
advisor and the man who developed the details of the new system, says that
the company did not deliberately set out to weaken the power of the unions,
even though he does not deny that that has been the effect. 'What we wanted
was a better relationship with our employees.'
The change in the role of the unions was not a quantum leap by the company,
says Temple, but part of a gradual process of developing more teamlike,
company-conscious attitudes. 'We want to get rid of the them and us
attitude,' says Temple.
The idea was encapsulated in rather more grand language in a recent message
to employees; this said that all employees, whether manual workers or
management, were in the same ''big team', with common vision, mission and
values'.
As part of the unifying process, staff have been taken through two-day
courses, some of which is designed to inculcate values such as recognising
other people's points of view and satisfying customer needs. Team briefings
have been introduced to help improve internal communications; team working
has been increased; and the company is gradually bringing in single status
conditions by which everyone will work under the same terms of employment,
including holidays, sick pay and pension benefits.
Plenty of other companies have adopted similar strategies but Northumbrian
saw the way the unions functioned as a barrier to creating the 'big team'.
Temple says: 'Trade unions have interests other than the pure success of the
company. They each have full-time officers, they each have their own history
and prejudices and they each owe loyalties to the TUC and to members outside
the company.'
At one stage the company considered derecognising all the unions, denying
them any role in the company. However, by the time it announced its plans in
November, it said it was prepared to recognise one union on the grounds that
employees wanted the security of a trade union to represent them. All very
well, but none of the unions wanted to relinquish its members at the
company.
In the end a compromise was reached by which all eight agreed to act as one
in a confederation. The unions thus kept their members but most employees
believe union powers at the company were none the less very considerably
curtailed.
Since the ending of national bargaining, pay has been determined by a system
in which local full-time officers negotiate with the company. Northumbrian
says that in future pay will be determined through the company council,
advised both by a confederation representative and a representative of an
employee association being set up, in part, for non-union members.
The seven company councillors who represent employees will be appointed by
members of seven local employee councils who in turn have been elected by
the workforce. Issues they will discuss will include health and safety, the
role of the business and its performance, research and development and, of
course, pay.
Quite how pay will be determined is unclear. Temple says he hopes that
decisions can be arrived at through members arriving at a consensus rather
than voting. The decision is then likely to be put to a ballot. What is
certain is that pay rises will be determined through the council, rather
than through talks with full time union officers, says Temple.
In spite of the changes, Don Macrae, district officer of Nalgo, with about
350 members the largest union there, says the agreement is a long way from
the derecognition once feared and 'in practical terms may not make that much
difference'.
The unions will have representatives on a standing committee to deal with
harmonisation of conditions and Macrae believes this committee could have a
significant, possibly decisive, influence on pay determination, particularly
in the first year.
The union confederation will have a right to represent members involved in
disciplinary procedures and will have safety representatives on each of the
seven area councils. Macrae says that the seven company councillors
representing employees are also likely to be active union members and that
this has proved to be the case so far.
None the less the compromise is far from what the unions would have liked.
'It is what we have got and we will make the best of it,' says Macrae.
How then did Northumbrian achieve the changes so smoothly? The unions
considered industrial action but it was never a serious proposition. The
1983 strike by manual workers proved that it is not easy to stop water
companies doing their business; water still flows even if significant
numbers of employees are missing.
Northumbrian also helped itself by preparing the ground for change long in
advance. As long ago as February 1988, Sir Michael Straker, the chairman,
told employees that eight trade unions was too many. The creation of the
company council was hinted at last May when Northumbrian set up the seven
area councils. The various steps, and the reasoning behind them, have been
explained through such methods as team briefing.
By the time the proposals were announced there were some unlikely converts
to the cause, among them Malcolm Fraser, president of the company's Nalgo
branch.
Fraser, a union activist for many years, has become the chairman of the
employee association, which many see as a rival to the unions, but sees no
conflict with that and his Nalgo position. He says the company had had
problems relating to employees and creating a common purpose because there
were so many different unions and bargaining groups.
Union power was always fragmented because there were so many of them and
management always had the upper hand in pay talks because of the lack of
militancy among employees, he says. 'There was more chance of being kicked
to death by a demented donkey than getting members of Nalgo out on strike.'
Fraser believes the new system will give employees 'two bites of the cherry'
because the employee association will also involve previously unrepresented
non-union members.
Among ordinary workers, both white- and blue-collar, there is concern that a
loss of union power has been designed to weaken the hand of employees. One
Nalgo member, who works in Northumbrian's head office in Pity Me, County
Durham, says he would have preferred the company to have modified the
bargaining system rather than replace it.
The main worry is that the employees' lead role in pay determination will be
played by ordinary workers, unskilled at dealing with management, rather
than full-time union officials. 'People on the company council are not
clever enough to represent us,' says Jimmy Metcalfe, a joiner and a member
of the Ucatt construction union who has been with the company for 17 years.
'The union officials know all the ins and outs. I think pay could suffer.'
The changes, says Metcalfe, appear to be for the company's benefit 'rather
than ours.'
Comments like that are typical. They demonstrate that the company has some
considerable way to go before it succeeds in creating the 'big team' which
it says is behind the employee representation changes. The challenge is to
ensure that the employees are not alienated.

FT  26 APR 91 / FT Law Report: No damages for berthing delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD NAVIGATION Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker,
Lord Justice Staughton and
Sir David Croom-Johnson):
April 12 1991
DAMAGES FOR breach of contract are assessed on the basis of what is required
to put the plaintiff in the same position as if there had been no breach and
the defendants had performed their obligations in the way they were
contractually entitled to perform them, not as if there had been no breach
and they had performed their obligations in the way they did in fact perform
them. Accordingly, where cargo sellers delay the vessel's berthing for
loading, but load within the sale contract time at a faster rate than the
contractual minimum, the buyers cannot claim on the basis that loading would
probably have been at that faster rate had there been no delay, and that the
vessel would therefore have been freed earlier thus diminishing their
demurrage costs.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Roplack Enterprises
SA, sellers of maize shipped on World Navigation, from Mr Justice Phillips's
decision in favour of the claimant buyers, Kurt A Becher gmbH, on their
appeal from the Board of Appeal of the Grain and Feed Trade Association
(Gafta).
LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that three contracts for the sale of maize provided
for shipment by instalments in April, May and June 1985. The quantity to be
shipped in June was 12,000 tonnes.
Each contract was on Gafta 64 terms and Argentine Centro terms.
Clause 7 of Gafta 64 provided that the vessel should load 'in accordance
with the custom at port of loading unless otherwise stipulated'.
The Centro clauses provided that buyers should give 15 days' notice of
readiness to load; and that once the vessel was berthed 'sellers guarantee .
. . a minimum average loading rate of 500 tonnes per weather working day,
Sundays, holidays and Saturday afternoons excepted'.
On May 24 1985 the buyers nominated World Navigation to load the June
portion.
She reached Zona Comun on June 13 and tendered readiness to load.
She would have berthed on June 25 had the shippers' loading documentation
been in order. It was not. She was by-passed by other vessels next in line,
and did not berth until July 18.
Between July 18 and July 22 she loaded 24,000 tonnes, including the
12,000-tonne June portion.
The buyers claimed the sellers were in breach of contract in not having the
goods ready to load. They contended that damages consisted in demurrage they
had had to pay under the charterparty by which they had provided the vessel.
The sellers disputed the claim. They said they were not in breach of any
obligation and even if they were, the buyers had suffered no damage, because
if the vessel had kept her turn on June 25 they would have had 48 days to
load the 24,000 tonnes, and loading had been completed within that time.
Alternatively, to load the 12,000 tonnes they had 24 days, and had completed
in time.
Arbitrators upheld the buyers' claim. The Gafta Board of Appeal allowed an
appeal on the ground that the vessel used less than 18 days laytime, whereas
the contract allowed 24 days. Mr Justice Phillips allowed the buyers' appeal
and remitted the award to the Board of Appeal for reconsideration in the
light of his judgment. The sellers now appealed.
Assuming that the sellers were in breach of contract in not having the
necessary documentation to enable the vessel to keep her turn on June 25,
the first question was what was their obligation with regard to rate of
loading once she had berthed?
The buyers contended that although the Centro clause provided for a minimum
average of 500 tonnes per weather working day, the Gafta obligation was to
load according to the custom of the port. They said port custom might be to
load by a method which would produce a faster rate.
Mr Justice Phillips rightly rejected that contention.
The Gafta provision was that the vessel was to load in accordance with port
custom 'unless otherwise stipulated'. The Centro clause did otherwise
stipulate.
Under that clause the buyer would not be in breach if he maintained an
average of at least 500 tonnes a day.
Accordingly, the sellers were entitled, once the vessel was in berth, to
take up to 48 counting days to load the complete cargo, or 24 counting days
to load the three contracts.
Assuming again that the sellers were in breach in not having the
documentation ready, the next question was on what basis should damages be
assessed?
The buyers contended that, given that the vessel was delayed by the breach,
the proper course was to consider what would probably have happened had
there been no breach. If the probability was that she would have loaded at
the same rate as she actually did unload, they were entitled to damages
because, but for the breach, the vessel would have been free and demurrage
would have ceased to accrue by July 1.
Their damage, argued the buyers, was the demurrage incurred between July 1
and July 22 when the vessel was finally free. What they claimed was the
value of the lost chance of freeing the vessel earlier.
The sellers contended that no damage had been suffered because, had the
vessel berthed on June 26, they would not have been obliged to complete
loading and free the vessel any earlier than they did.
In Lavarack v Woods (1967) 1 QB 278 Lord Denning MR in minority said that a
wrongfully dismissed servant was entitled to bonuses he might reasonably
have expected to receive, because the employer had deprived him of the
chance of receiving them. He said 'he is entitled to compensation for the
loss of the chance', even though he had no legal right to receive the
bonuses.
The majority would have none of that. Lord Diplock said: 'The law is
concerned with legal obligations only . . . not with expectations, however
reasonable.'
The buyers relied on Paula Lee v Robert Zehil (1983) 2 All ER 390,397,393
where the defendants wrongfully repudiated a contract to buy 16,000 garments
each season from the plaintiff dress manufacturer. The plaintiff contended
that damages should be assessed on the average of all his garments. Mr
Justice Mustill concluded that damages should be assessed in terms of such
reasonable selection of garments as would 'yield the lowest price'.
Earlier, however, he said that inquiry into the plaintiff's actual position
in face of the breach and his position if the contract had been performed,
involved 'identification of the promise, followed by a valuation of its
promised worth to the promisee'. He said each part of the inquiry might
involve considering a choice which would have been open to the promisor.
Mr Justice Phillips identified the broken obligation as a single discrete
obligation to procure appropriate loading documents. He said the inquiry
concerned valuation.
He said that when assessing damages the board must ask how long loading
would have taken had World Navigator berthed promptly; and that the question
was to be answered, not by assuming that the sellers would have loaded at
the slowest permissible rate, but by considering all factors that would have
been likely to influence their conduct.
The judge was right that the breach was of a single discrete obligation. One
must, however, consider the consequences to the buyers of the breach and
what was required to put them in the same position as if it had not
occurred.
In that event laytime would have begun to run on June 26. The sellers'
obligation would have been to load in the number of counting days under the
Centro terms, but no more.
They did so. Despite the breach the buyers got that to which they would have
been entitled had there been no breach. To accept the buyers' contention
would be to make the sellers pay damages for failing to do that which they
were not obliged to do.
In the light of those conclusions it was unnecessary to decide the extent of
the sellers' obligation to enable the vessel to reach berth.
The appeal was allowed. The award of the Board of Appeal was affirmed. Their
Lordships gave concurring judgments.
For the buyers: Martin Moore-Bick QC and Geraldine Clark (Richards Butler)
For the sellers: David Johnson QC and Mark Havelock-Allan (Sinclair Roche &amp;
Temperley)

FT  26 APR 91 / The Property Market: Birmingham core breaks outwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rosehaugh, whose fall from financial grace has overshadowed what remains an
extensive development programme, is talking with the Birmingham City Council
about the treatment of 16 acres of land adjacent to the new international
convention centre and the national indoor arena, still under construction.
This is the Brindleyplace project.
Waterlinks, the joint venture company of Bryant, Douglas, Tarmac and Wimpey,
is negotiating with two large office users about the construction of nearly
250,000 sq ft of offices - a big addition to an existing development at
Birmingham Heartlands, on the north-east side of the city.
At first glance, these two schemes have nothing to do with each other. The
first is next door to a new focal point of the city. The second is part of a
scheme to regenerate a rundown district, has received the help of city grant
and is the object of a visit today by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary. But on closer inspection they have elements in common.
The first element is geographical. The schemes are just outside, but at
opposite ends of the city centre. They illustrate the way in which the core
business district of the city is breaking outwards. This is partly a
planning question: the city council has for some years been seeking to
induce greater vibrancy outside an inner ring road. This carriageway is
efficient for through traffic but holds in the city centre like a belt with
a sealed buckle and is largely responsible for Birmingham's reputation as a
car-crazy city.
So far the private sector has fallen in with the planning aim only to a
limited degree. But Brindleyplace and Waterlinks, coupled with the London &amp;
Edinburgh Trust redevelopment of the famous, or notorious, Bull Ring Centre
with its landmark cylindrical tower, and Avatar's Arcadian shopping and
leisure development, offer the possibility of a wider and more diverse city
centre.
The concomitant of the geographically-constrained city centre is that the
central office district is small - too small to cope with the demands which
have been placed upon it. The agents' boards are ready evidence of a
plethora of small space, but new buildings with large floors are scarce.
Research by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, shows that this year more
than 1m sq ft of office space will be completed in the city centre. But a
high number of pre-lettings means that only 272,000 sq ft of it will find
its way on to the market. However, Chesterton notes that, at the end of
1990, another 19 schemes, totalling 2.4m sq ft, has outline or detailed
planning consent which had not been implemented. Whether all these schemes
will be built is a matter of some doubt.
Against this background, Brindleyplace and Waterlinks - the latter with
abundant land supply - could have the effect of doing for Birmingham what
the Rosehaugh-Stanhope-British Rail Property Board development at Broadgate
did for the City of London: extend the central business district.
The second common element of Brindleyplace and Waterlinks is that, although
they were born in the heady days of surge in property values during the late
1980s, they are projects likely to come to fruition in the next cycle of the
property industry, probably during the mid- and late 1990s. But their
financing techniques reflect not the debt-led speculative development of the
1980s but the desire to reduce exposure of the early 1990s.
Waterlinks was conceived as part of a wider regeneration plan, progeny of
the joint city council/private sector urban development agency which also
bears the name Birmingham Heartlands. It owed its origins to a belief that
private-sector expansion would make financially possible the transformation
of old factory areas into an office park, a belief given a fillip by the
fact that the companies, before the values surge, had quietly assumed
control of up to 40 acres of land for a mere Pounds 10m.
Brindleyplace has always been seen as a complement to the convention centre.
It was under the control of the ill-fated Merlin group, which persuaded the
city council of the advantages of a development which combined the
once-fashionable idea of the festival marketplace, with offices and other
amenities such as a national aquarium, thought to be a potentially lucrative
national tourist attraction.
Merlin moved into a joint venture with Shearwater, in the late 1980s a
high-flying Rosehaugh subsidiary specialising in retail. Merlin eventually
bowed out. Shearwater was absorbed in Rosehaugh, as the latter sought to
control its finances. Rosehaugh has completed the purchase of the land from
the city council for Pounds 16m and brought in the Terry Farrell partnership
to re-work the whole scheme.
This re-working is now the subject of negotiation with the city council, but
Rosehaugh hopes by the end of September to have in place a detailed planning
application for a first phase, largely of shopping and catering facilities
to back up the convention centre, and an outline application for the whole
site.
Rosehaugh envisages a development built around a series of squares with 1m
sq ft of offices (up from the 600,000 sq ft planned by Merlin), about 50,000
sq ft of retail (down from the 200,000 sq ft in the Merlin scheme) plus a
hotel and a leisure complex. the nature of which remains the subject of
talks. Rosehaugh has dropped the idea of an aquarium. So there is much for
the city council to ponder.
While Rosehaugh will move into the first phase on its own account, the rest
of the development will be market-led. That is, if there are no customers
for the office buildings they will not be built. Cash flow would be helped
by selling on the land for the leisure developments.
Likewise, Waterlinks keeps 40,000 sq ft of offices, speculatively built, as
stock, but will not undertake large-scale office building without a pre-let
or a design-and-build contract. Caution is the watchword.

FT  26 APR 91 / The Property Market: Marginal rise continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERALL returns showed a marginal improvement for the second month running,
according to the Investment Property Databank monthly index.
Although rental and capital growth were both the same as in February,
increased income lifted total returns to -0.4 per cent. As a result, returns
for the March quarter were higher than those recorded over any of the
previous four quarters.
The opposite has been true of rental value growth, with a modest but
continued deterioration in each quarter over the last 18 months. Estimated
rental value growth was -0.3 per cent in the March quarter.
Annualised total returns fell slightly to -7.9 per cent. Capital growth was
 13.6 per cent and rental value growth now stands at a mere 2.5 per cent.
Both the office and industrial sectors recorded a slight improvement in
returns, whereas that of the retail sector worsened over the month.
Offices remained the least successful sector for the month, the quarter and
the year. Rental value growth remained negative at -0.3 per cent, bringing
the decline for the quarter to -1.2 per cent. Total return for the quarter
was -3.0 per cent, similar to the returns recorded for each of the previous
three quarters.
Offices annualised return of -11.1 per cent is lower than that for
industrials (-3.7 per cent) and retails (-6.4 per cent).
The industrial sector made a zero return in March - a slight improvement on
February's results. The March quarterly total return of -0.4 per cent was
the best recorded for any sector over the last year.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Sogat admits sex discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINT union Sogat has admitted to an industrial tribunal that it
represented women members at a company less effectively than men because
they were split into single-sex bargaining groups.
The tribunal found that the company, security printers Thomas De La Rue,
based in Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear, had 'knowingly aided' Sogat and its
Newcastle upon Tyne branch in providing less effective collective bargaining
for women than for men.
The company has agreed to the tribunal findings and settled an equal-pay
claim from the women. It has also promised that all future collective
bargaining and access to jobs training and other benefits will be free from
sex discrimination.
Sogat is to reform the way it negotiates within the company. The union, led
by Ms Brenda Dean, has been trying to phase out single-sex chapels (office
branches) since an investigation by the Equal Opportunities Commission in
the early 1980s.
Four women, who had worked for the printing company for between 16 and 27
years, began their proceedings in 1989 when they claimed pay parity with
male print assistants and porters.
They also complained that Sogat had discriminated against them by providing
less effective bargaining and protection than it provided for men-only
chapels. For historical reasons, the Newcastle branch of Sogat is organised
into single-sex chapels.
After the claim was filed, Sogat admitted discrimination and later agreed to
support the women's equal-pay claim. Mr John Mitchell, national organising
secretary of Sogat, said yesterday that the union had been trying for some
years to phase out single-sex chapels.
The EOC, which backed the case, will have some of its costs paid for by the
company. The EOC conducted an investigation in the early 1980s that led two
Sogat chapels to amalgamate, and efforts had been continuing since then to
end segregation.
Mr Mitchell said he had put forward proposals for departmental negotiating
units, instead of the current eight single-sex chapels at the factory.
Mr Alan Lakin, the EOC's legal adviser, said he welcomed the positive
attitude shown by the union and the company. 'Separating women's jobs for
negotiating purposes is a prime cause of job segregation, which is the
underlying reason for the persistent earnings gap between men and women,' he
said. 'Other unions and employers must now realise that these practices have
been found unlawful.'

FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Teachers will reserve option of
striking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, yesterday backed
away from strike action in opposition to the government's review body for
teachers' pay. However, its executive reaffirmed the union's opposition to
the body and refused to rule out the use of future industrial action.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, last week made the setting-up of
the review body conditional upon the unions 'tacitly' giving up the strike
weapon. In spite of the NUT's stance, he is still proceeding with the
Teacher's Pay Bill, which has its second reading in the Commons on Monday.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said yesterday: 'Teachers should fear
a review body because it could lead to a longer working year, a reduction in
teacher support time, an extension of their duties and responsibilities, and
increased use of discretionary pay, causing further divisions in the
teaching profession.'
However, the union said the NUT would take part in the review, if
established, and indicated that strike action on the issue was now highly
unlikely. The other five teachers' unions all support the proposed review
body.
The NUT also decided yesterday to oppose the introduction of teacher
appraisal unless the government withdraws its proposal to link it to
discretionary pay awards. Graduates are in increasing proportion taking a
year out before starting work, a report disclosed yesterday. Cambridge
University careers service said that 12 per cent of graduates were still not
looking for work six months after graduation. Of those proceeding to jobs,
teaching and the law were the most popular choices.

FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): More young people seek job or YT place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG increases in the number of young people aged 16 to 18 waiting either to
get a job or to obtain a Youth Training place have been reported this year.
According to confidential government figures, there was a rise of 23.3 per
cent in the number of young people given government bridging allowances -
because they could neither get a job nor obtain a YT place - in the six
months to February 1991, compared with the equivalent figure in 1989-90.
In London and the south-east, the comparable increase was 67.4 per cent.
Recipients of bridging loans get Pounds 15 up to a maximum of eight weeks.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's spokesman on training, said the figures revealed
a genuine crisis in many areas in the provision of YT and the maintenance by
Training and Enterprise Councils of the government's guarantee of a training
place to all those aged 16 to 18 who wanted one.
The Department of Employment said that the guarantee of YT to any young
person who wanted it would be met. It said the bridging allowance was given
not just to people wanting a YT placement but also to young people who
wanted a job. In 1989-90, 56 per cent of school leavers aged 16 to 18 took
up a YT place.
Anxiety has been rising among Tecs over their ability to maintain the
guarantee at a time of rising unemployment and a cut in real terms of their

FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories mount attack on 'Napoleon' -
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative-dominated Bruges Group, which opposes a Federal Europe,
yesterday sprang from recent internal rows over its criticism of Mr John
Major to publish a highly personal attack on Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission.
Mr Delors was likened to Napoleon and accused of having 'exceeded and
perverted' his responsibilities, by Mr Russell Lewis, a leader writer on the
Daily Mail and author of the pamphlet. The EC president had undermined the
spirit of the Treaty of Rome with his 'Brussels bureaucrats' narrow,
interventionist, mercantilist approach.'
The pamphlet reflects the group's determination to counter any who favour
moving towards a federal Europe. For many of the group's supporters, Mr
Delors is a favourite target.
It says that to some Mr Delors is an 'European idealist' but 'he can also be
plausibly regarded as a French nationalist who hopes, though by drearier
means, to fulfil the dreams of Louis XIV, Napoleon or de Gaulle and turn the
new Europe into a greater France.
If the Liberal Democrats hold a balance of power after the next election,
they would insist that any agreement with one of the major parties - which
would encompass a commitment to legislate a change to the electoral system -
should be formal and last for a parliament lasting at least four years, Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader said yesterday.

FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Unease surfaces over fairness of
local tax - Council finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major insisted yesterday in the face of some Tory expressions of
unease, that the government's plans for a council tax would be fair and that
more than 70 per cent of people would gain from the change.
Labour MPs cheered as Mr Peter Fry, Tory MP for Wellingborough, warned that
there would have to be an investigation into the disadvantage suffered by
his local authority if he were to advise his constituents that the tax was
fair.
Wellingborough had been penalised for trading profitably and passing the
profits on to chargepayers, he said in the Commons, and even the cheapest
house there would pay more than the dearest house in Westminster.
There would also be a transitional protection scheme and rebates for people
on low incomes.
The plans came under a further Tory attack, when Miss Beryl Goldsmith,
secretary to Mr Norman Tebbit, condemned them as 'grossly inequitable.'
Miss Goldsmith, in a letter to the London Evening Standard, made it clear
that her letter had nothing to do with Mr Tebbit.
Her complaint, raised with Mr Major by a Labour MP, was that even after the
discount for someone living alone, her one-living-room flat in the Barbican
would attract a higher bill than that for Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, and his family, in Westminster.
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, and Mr Heseltine both emphasised
that the surest way to reduce local tax bills was to vote Tory.
Speaking in Bristol, Mr Patten said that residents there faced 'double
jeopardy' from coming under a Labour-controlled city and county.
A Labour government committed to scrapping the government's powers to cap
council spending would mean 'triple jeopardy,' he said.
Labour, meanwhile, renewed a broad attack on the Tories' approach to local
government, saying that the choice in the May elections was between 'quality
and cuts' in services such as transport and education.
While maintaining the attack on the council tax, Mr John Cunningham, the
party's campaign co-ordinator, refused to commit the party to repealing
council tax legislation if it were passed before the election, saying he
thought the timetable unlikely to be achieved.
As for charges of high-spending, Labour pledged that its Quality Commission
would mean efficient delivery of local services, and challenged the
government to say why people should not be able to vote for a higher level
of service.
Government spending on advertising has increased as the local elections have
approached, as it did before the 1987 local elections, according to a study
commissioned by BBC Radio.
Out of an advertising spend of Pounds 34m in the first three months of the
year, nearly half was spent in March.

<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the international health care company, is to move its group
research centre from Essex to a science park to be built at the University
of York.
The Pounds 15m research centre will be the first and largest tenant on York
Science Park, it was announced yesterday. The 21-acre park, next to the
university's Heslington campus, is a joint venture between the university
and P&amp;O Developments, the property subsidiary of the P&amp;O shipping group.
Mr John Robinson, Smith &amp; Nephew chief executive, said the company expected
to sell its research centre at Gilston Park, Essex, for about Pounds 5m. It
would spend Pounds 5m fitting out the centre in York and then pay Pounds 1m
a year in rent.
The university and P&amp;O expect to spend Pounds 23m developing the science
park in three phases up to the end of 1994. The first phase, including the
Smith &amp; Nephew centre, is scheduled for completion in November 1992. Some
200 scientists and technicians will move from Essex to York.

FT  26 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Decision may take two weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ernest Saunders, Mr Anthony Parnes and Mr Gerald Ronson must wait another
two to three weeks before learning whether they have won their appeals
against their convictions in the Guinness trial.
The Court of Appeal yesterday finished hearing the appeals, which Lord
Justice Neill said raised important and difficult issues. He said it would
be at least a fortnight before he and Mr Justice Ognall and Mr Justice Owen
would be able to give their judgment. If they dismiss the appeals against
conviction, they will go on to hear appeals against the sentences imposed on
the three men at the end of the trial last August.
Mr Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, is serving
five years for conspiracy, theft and false accounting.
Mr Parnes, a City stockbroker, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years for theft and
false accounting.
Mr Ronson, head of the Heron group, released in February after serving just
under half his 12-month jail term, was also fined a record Pounds 5m on his
convictions of conspiracy, theft and false accounting.
He had been given until May 25 to pay the fine. Yesterday the Appeal Court
extended the time until 10 days after the end of the appeals.
Mr Saunders and Mr Parnes are in Ford open prison in West Sussex. If their
appeals fail, Mr Parnes will be eligible for parole at the end of June and
Mr Saunders at the end of next April.
The central issue in the appeals against conviction, which lasted eight
days, has been the defence contention that Mr Justice Henry, the trial
judge, misdirected the jury.
All the charges in the case related to the share support operation mounted
by Guinness during the takeover battle for Distillers.

FT  26 APR 91 / Guy's will cut staff in effort to reduce costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUY'S, ONE of the most famous hospitals to become a self-governing trust
under this month's health reforms, plans to shed staff throughout its
organisation.
The hospital's managers are also mounting a review of all clinical
activities over the next three months, which may lead to withdrawals of some
services to patients.
Trust hospital managers have wide freedom to run their own affairs.
Yesterday's developments at Guy's, coming less than a month after the
introduction of the reforms, threaten to revive fears that the changes will
force commercial values on the National Health Service - a view ministers
have been anxious to dispel.
Health service union leaders say the actions of the trust management at
Guy's, in south London, confirm fears that self-governing hospitals will
become more like private ones.
Mr Peter Griffiths, Guy's chief executive and until recently deputy chief
executive of the government's NHS management board, told employees yesterday
that the trust 'must have fewer staff this year'.
The reductions would be made 'at all levels, where possible by early
retirement, redeployment and leaving vacancies unfilled'. The management
says it will 'attempt to avoid compulsory redundancies'.
Staff costs form a much higher proportion of total expenditure in hospitals
than in many commercial organisations. Nearly Pounds 90m of the trust's
Pounds 128m budget is spent on staff costs at Guy's, its sister hospital at
Lewisham and associated services. The trust inherited debts of Pounds 6.8m
and Mr Griffiths told staff the first priority was to get into good
financial shape.
It was 'destructive of morale and standards' to be lurching from one crisis
to another. 'We want to get to the point as quickly as possible where we pay
staff properly and improve working conditions, but that can only happen when
our finances are in shape.'
The review of Guy's clinical services will examine efficiency, relevance to
the needs of the local population and the views of general practitioners and
health authorities.
Mr Griffiths said there was no point in supporting a service that was not
best for patients simply because it had always been provided. If contracts
were not won there would be no future for the trust.
There was no longer a fallback position of money appearing every year
regardless of how many patients were treated. Services that had low patient
satisfaction levels would find that 'resources will not be allocated to
them'.
Mr Hector MacKenzie, general secretary of the health union Cohse, said:
'Guy's is now behaving exactly like a private hospital, dumping patients and
services which are not profitable.'
Part of the hospital's difficulty, he said, was the amount of debts that had
been built up from previous years of chronic underfunding.

BRITISH and Irish ministers meet in London today for the last time before
historic round-table talks on Northern Ireland's future, Ralph Atkins
writes. Agreement still has to be reached on where later stages of the
negotiations will be held.
Talks bringing Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together for the
first time for 15 years start next Tuesday with a series of meetings in
Belfast.
They will include bilateral 'agenda-setting' meetings followed about a week
later with plenary sessions on internal government in the province.
Agreement, however, has still to be reached on where talks will be held on
relations between north and south Ireland and between the UK and Irish
governments. Unionists are believe to favour London but the Irish government
is thought to prefer somewhere within the island of Ireland.
A compromise might be a Northern Ireland town outside Belfast - possibly
Armagh, Ireland's ecclesiastical capital.
The prospect of political progress in the province will dominate today's
meeting between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Gerry
Collins, Irish foreign minister.
Mr Brooke will also raise the recent controversy over alleged leaks by the
Irish police to IRA terrorists.
The meeting will be the last conference under 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement
before the start of the wide-ranging talks engineered by Mr Brooke, and
which could see the agreement being replaced.

FT  26 APR 91 / Argentina seeks UK help on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is seeking UK expertise to help with the next stages of its
ambitious privatisation programme.
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, met representatives of
British companies and financial institutions, including Baring Brothers, the
merchant bank, and ICI, in London yesterday, to discuss the privatisation
programme and encourage UK investment in Argentina.
'We are very interested in the British experience of privatisation,' he said
in an interview with the Financial Times. 'Britain has great expertise in
this matter, particularly in the creation of regulatory mechanisms to
monitor companies after privatisation.'
The first phase of Argentine privatisation was criticised for its haste and
dogged by rumours of corruption. The gas, water and electricity industries,
including SEGBA, the greater-Buenos Aires area electricity company, are next
in line, and Argentina is eager to ensure adequate regulatory frameworks and
maximise competition.
Mr di Tella, who met Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, on Wednesday,
was optimistic on relations with Britain. 'We have a specific problem with
the (Falkland) Islands and the fisheries issue, but commercial relations are
excellent.'
Trade with the UK was growing very quickly, he said. 'Exports from the UK to
Argentina, which had been lagging, have been picking up.'
Trade between the two countries had recovered only slowly after the 1982
Falklands conflict. However, after Britain and Argentina established full
diplomatic relations last July, Argentine exports grew quickly to a monthly
average of about Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.7m) by the end of last year, against
only Dollars 3m previously. UK exports stood at about Dollars 13m a month.
Mr di Tella was adamant that Argentina would not relinquish its claim to
sovereignty over the Falklands. 'We think we have right on our side. We
think we will eventually convince the British government and the islanders
to accept a different sort of settlement. However, we are aware of the
peculiarities of the islands and their history and this is something we want
to respect. We are willing to discuss all sorts of arrangements with the
islanders that would be more congenial.'
Guido di Tella, 'Interested in British experience'

FT  26 APR 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Japan suggests SDR issue to
meet finance demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee
will be asked on Monday to consider plans to pump additional reserve assets
into the global economy.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, disclosed yesterday that
Japan has suggested that the Interim Committee should discuss a new
allocation of special drawing rights, the international reserve asset issued
by the IMF, to help meet the world's high demand for finance from the end of
this year.
An SDR allocation could help some countries overcome short-term financing
difficulties. Some developing countries, for example, are so short of
currency reserves that they have problems obtaining much needed imports.
The Japanese suggestion marks a change of heart concerning the SDR by the
IMF's second-biggest member. Until now Japan, along with the US, Britain and
Germany, has opposed new issues of SDRs on the grounds that they would
constitute an unnecessary and potentially inflationary addition to global
liquidity.
It is thought that Tokyo's decision to raise the idea has been prompted by
concern that that there will be insufficient funds to meet the financing
requirements of eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.
The SDR is a basket currency, made up of the US dollar, yen, D-Mark,
sterling and French franc, and is worth about Dollars 1.33. It was
introduced in the 1970s to expand global liquidity and 21.4bn SDRs are held
in the reserves of IMF members. The last SDR issue was in 1981.
Mr Camdessus said yesterday that the world should be able to cover its
financing needs this year. The question was whether it would be able to do
so from next year onwards.
The IMF's management was consulting with the fund's executive board on the
merits and demerits of an SDR allocation and would be 'delighted' if the IMF
membership agreed to launch an in-depth study of the issue.
However, it is uncertain whether the idea will attract the necessary 85 per
cent support among fund members to be adopted.
To be implemented, an SDR allocation must have the backing of the US, but
yesterday Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international
monetary affairs, said Washington would not be able to support such
proposals on the grounds that it would be unconditional liquidity.
It is also unclear how large any SDR allocation should be and how it would
be made.

FT  26 APR 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: McNamara calls for aid to be
linked to cuts in arms spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AID TO developing countries should be made conditional on their reducing
military spending, Mr Robert McNamara, former head of the World Bank, said
yesterday.
In a wide-ranging speech on the consequences of the end of the Cold War on
military spending, Mr McNamara strongly urged the linking of financial
assistance to movement 'toward optimal levels of military expenditures'.
These optimal levels should take into account any external threat being
faced by a country.
When decisions concerning allocations of foreign aid were made, 'special
consideration should be given to countries spending less than 2 per cent of
their gross national product in the security sector'.
Speaking at a World Bank annual conference on development economics in
Washington, he said that the huge savings thus made could be used to address
pressing economic and social needs.
'I am conscious that application of such conditionality will be difficult
and contentious,' said Mr McNamara, a former US defence secretary.
'Nevertheless, it is, I believe, an essential part of the solution to the
waste represented by excessive military spending in poor countries.'
Military spending in the Third World totalled Dollars 170bn a year, 4.3 per
cent of aggregate gross national product. If that were to be reduced by half
over the next decade, it would free up savings equivalent to half current
Third World spending on health and education and more than twice the amount
of development assistance received from industrialised countries and
multilateral financial institutions, he said. By comparison, the US spent 6
per cent of GNP on the military. This proportion could be reduced by half
within six to eight years, at a saving of Dollars 150bn a year in 1989
dollars, Mr McNamara said.
Between 1978 and 1988, the Third World imported Dollars 371bn of arms,
three-quarters of the arms traded internationally. Mr McNamara linked a
reduction of demand for arms in the Third World to a system of collective
security - guarantees by the United Nations Security Council and regional
organisations of territorial integrity.
Governments producing arms should also sharply reduce the availability of
finance for arms. He noted that some countries spent a lot on security for
internal rather than external reasons.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON faces the prospect of a costly, lengthy and highly- publicised
criminal trial unless it agrees to raise substantially the Dollars 1.1bn
settlement it reached with the US and Alaska governments over the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
The oil company's liability for damages from the March 1989 disaster has
been reopened by a US judge's decision to reject as inadequate the Dollars
100m criminal fine which was included in the settlement. The remaining
Dollars 1bn is a settlement of civil damages.
Exxon said yesterday that 'while we are carefully considering the
implications of the judge's decision, we are continuing our preparation for
trial.'
The company has 30 days to decide whether to withdraw its guilty pleas to
four violations of environmental law, and thereby face a criminal trial.
Judge Russel Holland indicated that he would treat the case as a priority,
raising the prospect of a trial as soon as June or July.
The federal justice department warned that the rejection of the criminal
fine also threatens the Dollars 1bn civil settlement. Judge Holland said
that the fine, although the biggest in an environmental case, was not a
strong enough deterrent.
'I'm afraid these fines send the wrong message, suggesting that spills are a
cost of business that can be absorbed,' he said.
Ms Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, a
Washington-based conservation group, predicted that Exxon would return to
the bargaining table on the criminal settlement, but that the justice
department and the Alaska state government might also seek higher civil
damages.
According to Ms Hope, a trial would result in a fine of at least Dollars
700m, with an indeterminate upper limit, especially if the case was heard by
a jury.
Pressure on Exxon over the disaster has increased on several fronts in
recent weeks. The US government earlier this month published a summary of
scientific studies which indicate that environmental damage caused by the
spill was much greater than initially thought.

Bundesbank president, as saying that Germany would resist calls from the US
to cut rates at the G7 meeting. A clash on interest rates therefore appears
inevitable at the G7 meeting, although it is expected that it will end with
a communique that papers over the cracks.
Mr Bush's remarks were yesterday reinforced by Mr David Mulford, the US
Treasury under-secretary for international monetary affairs. He told a press
conference that the US wanted greater awareness in the G7 of the need to
maintain, and where necessary, re-establish growth. He said the US believed
inflationary pressures were subsiding and real interest rates in Europe were
too high.
Underlying the US stance is a belief that America's G7 partners have not
sufficiently appreciated the adverse developments in the world economy over
the past two years.
The changes in eastern Europe and the Gulf war have created a huge demand
for capital that cannot be met from traditional sources now that Germany has
moved into current account deficit and Arab oil producers no longer have
surpluses.
A more cautious approach on interest rates was advocated yesterday by Mr
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
He did not think the main industrial countries could force interest rates
lower.

ELI LILLY, which is facing a deluge of lawsuits claiming its best-selling
anti-depressant Prozac makes patients murderous or suicidal, yesterday said
a liquid version of the drug had been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to treat depression.
Mr Leigh Thompson, vice-president of Lilly Research Laboratories said: 'The
company welcomes this announcement as another affirmation of the safety and
efficacy of Prozac in relieving clinical depression.'
Lilly claims to be the victim of a smear campaign by litigious products
liability lawyers and the Church of Scientology, a cult-like quasi-religious
group which is hostile to psychiatry and has labelled the drug 'a killer.'
Prozac has been favoured by doctors since it hit the US market in December
1987, largely because it lacks many of the side-effects associated with
similar products.
The drug is considered less toxic than other anti-depressants and Lilly
claims it is extremely difficult for patients to kill themselves with
Prozac. Lilly said that of the 3.5m patients who had taken the drug, there
had been only one death by overdose using Prozac.
The publicity and litigation has had some effect on Prozac's command of the
anti-depressant market. Prozac's sales have slid to 21 per cent from about
25 per cent in July.

SOUTH KOREA, taking a strong position on the issue of food security,
yesterday reaffirmed that it will keep its rice market tightly closed to
imports.
A meeting of senior economic officials, headed by Mr Choi Gak Kyu, minister
for economic planning, ruled out liberalising the rice market and reducing
subsidies for rice production.
'We will not allow imports of rice under any circumstances,' a ministry of
agriculture and fisheries official said after the meeting.
The meeting was prompted by a domestic outcry following remarks made earlier
this week by Mr Park Soo Gil, Korea's chief negotiator in the Uruguay Round
of Gatt negotiations. Mr Park said the opening of the Korean rice market was
inevitable, and that Korea would agree to allowing 3-5 per cent of its rice
demand to be met by imports.
The outcry demonstrates the sensitivity of the issue. Rice is the single
most most important crop for Korean farmers, but the inefficiency of
domestic production means they would find it hard to compete with
international producers. Government subsidies and closed markets mean the
average price of rice in Korea is about five times the Dollars 350 (Pounds
205) a ton it costs on the international market.
Exception for rice and a few other staple products, South Korea has been
demonstrating a more flexible approach to the liberalisation of its
agricultural markets. Since the start of this year, it has reduced the
number of products it is seeking to exclude from liberalisation under the
Uruguay Round of Gatt talks.
Korea originally sought to exclude 15 products, citing non-trade concerns
such as food security. But it now wants to exclude only rice and a few other
staple products such as barley.

business

NCM, the Dutch credit insurance company, said yesterday it had a
'substantial' chance of being chosen by the UK government to purchase the
short-term export insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD).
Mr Harry Groen, chairman of NCM, said that if the Dutch company were
selected, it would finance the deal through its own internal resources and
through a placement of shares with its existing shareholders, mainly banks
and insurance companies in the Netherlands, and, to a lesser extent, in the
UK, Germany and Switzerland.
He described the possible purchase of a major part of ECGD as a unique
opportunity which would lead to a doubling of NCM's premium income.
NCM, whose official name is Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij,
is one of four companies on the UK government's short list.
The other three are Assicurazioni Generali of Italy, and Sun Alliance and
Trade Indemnity of Britain.
Bids for the Cardiff-based ECGD division must be submitted by April 30.
The Dutch company yesterday unveiled annual results which showed 1990
after-tax profit up 18 per cent at Fl 33.6m (Pounds 10m). Mr Groen said 1991
results should at least match last year's figures.
Premium income for NCM's own account showed a marginal increase to Fl 271.7m
from Fl 271.4m in 1989. Claims were up 17 per cent at Fl 121.7m.
Apart from insuring commercial risks for its own account, NCM also handles
the reinsurance of political risks on exports for the Dutch government.
Although Mr Groen acknowledged there were some sensitivities among exporters
in the UK about a foreign company buying a former government agency, he said
NCM was fully capable of serving British exporters and there would be no
conflict of interest with its Dutch operations.

CHINA may use Sydney as an entrepot port for expanding trade with the island
states of the South Pacific, Yvonne Preston reports from Peking.
Li Lanqing, China's minister for foreign economic relations and trade, said
yesterday that many Pacific island countries wanted to buy Chinese goods,
but their small markets made direct trade difficult.
In future, Australia could provide an entrepot trade point.
Sydney could offer duty-free storage for Chinese products, enabling small
orders to be shipped to Pacific customers from Australia, obviating the need
for a direct trade relationship between China and the islands.
The Chinese minister was speaking before talks with Senator Gareth Evans,
Australia's foreign minister.
Senator Evans, who has been visiting Peking to normalise post-Tiananmen
relations, has now left China. During his two days there, he met Premier Li
Peng, Jiang Zemin, China's Communist Party chief, and Qian Qichen, Peking's
foreign minister,
Nothing concrete had been decided about the entrepot proposal, Li
reiterated, but the possibilities were being studied.

MEMBER countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt),
including all the leading trading powers, yesterday agreed to re-organise
the international trade talks in the hope they can be concluded by the end
of this year.
But their hope depends on two crucial developments occurring outside the
forum for the talks in Geneva:
The US Congress has to agree by the end of May to the continuation of
President George Bush's 'fast-track' authority to negotiate trade
agreements;
The European Community has to give within the next four months what one
negotiator called 'an unmistakable signal' of its readiness to go further
than it has done so far in negotiating the reform of world farm trade.
Agriculture was the issue which brought about the collapse of the meeting of
world trade ministers at Brussels in December, which was to have concluded
the four-year Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks.
Delegations in Geneva yesterday approved a proposal by Mr Rubens Ricupero,
Gatt chairman, that the 15 subjects, which had been under separate
negotiation in the Round, be concentrated into seven groups under different
moderators.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, will lead the agricultural talks
and also chair the group handling textiles and clothing.
Mr Germain Denis, Canada's assistant deputy minister for international trade
affairs, will take charge of the market access group, which will negotiate
reductions in tariffs and non-tariff barriers and the lowering of obstacles
to trade in tropical goods and in products based on natural resources.
Negotiations on a Gatt agreement to protect intellectual property rights
remain under the guidance of Mr Lars Anell, Sweden's ambassador to Gatt.
Talks aimed at reaching rules governing foreign investment are being
incorporated into a 'rule-making' group under Brazil's Mr Georges Marciel.
This group will deal with a heterogeneous mixture, including anti-dumping
action, subsidies, safeguard measures, technical barriers to trade, rules of
origin and government procurement.
Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro, Uruguay's ambassador, retains responsibility for
talks on improvements to Gatt's dispute settlement system, functioning and
institutional practices, which were already close to success in December.
A seventh group under Mr Felipe Jaramillo, Colombian ambassador, will
continue efforts to reach an ambitious agreement, setting rules for the
worldwide Dollars 770bn (Pounds 452m) trade in services. Mr Jaramillo will
be assisted by Mr David Hawes, Australian ambassador.
The new groupings are expected to meet by the middle of May and set agendas
for the rest of the year. Mr Dunkel stressed that the new negotiating
structure was designed to achieve political breakthroughs.
But many negotiators consider that serious talks are likely to restart only
in September, if by then the US administration has renewed negotiating
authority and the EC has given the required signal on agriculture.

FT  26 APR 91 / Japan's surplus just won't lie down: But the figure bears
some close examination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Japanese trade ministers visiting Washington the agenda may change from
one year to the next but the underlying issue is always the same - the size
of Japan's trade surplus.
It is no different for Mr Eiichi Nakao, the latest chief of the ministry of
international trade and industry (Miti), who sets off for the US today. He
will be faced by complaints from the Administration of President George Bush
over semiconductors, construction, auto parts and rice.
Congressmen will add political spice to the trip with moves of their own -
including a proposed ban on imports of Japanese rice wine to match the
Japanese ban on foreign rice. But all this will be a reflection of the
persistent underlying imbalance in trade.
After falling by more than 40 per cent since 1986, Japan's surplus is rising
again. In each of the past three months, the surplus has been higher than
for the same months last year. The Dollars 8.72bn surplus recorded in March
was the highest since December 1988.
Mr Paul Summerville, an economist with Jardine Fleming, the securities
company, forecasts that after falling from a peak of Dollars 90bn in 1986 to
Dollars 54.6bn in the year to March 1991, Japan's trade surplus will rise in
1991-92 to Dollars 66.5bn.
Japanese Ministry of Finance officials deny that an upward trend is in the
making. But Miti is worried. One senior official said this week: 'We are
afraid this trend might continue this year. It's very important to keep the
surplus under control.'
The figures continue to provoke howls of protest from Washington. But, in
truth, European producers have more reason to worry than Americans. While
the surplus with the US fell by 11 per cent over the last year, the surplus
with Europe grew by the same percentage.
Also, both changes are dwarfed by the growth of the surplus with Asia which
soared 47 per cent to Dollars 24.8bn - exceeding the surplus with Europe for
the first time.
Both short-term and long-term economic forces are at work. The Gulf crisis
boosted the cost of oil and gas last year - increasing Japan's fuel import
bill for 1990-91 by 35 per cent to Dollars 61.4bn. Now that oil prices have
dropped again below Dollars 20 a barrel, the cost of Japan's fuel imports
will probably fall markedly in the current year - expanding the trade
surplus for the next few months, though not beyond that.
The recent slow-down in Japanese consumer demand will also depress imports
in the current year. Consumers buying luxury goods were the great force
behind the expansion of imports in Japan in the late 1980s. But the turmoil
in Tokyo's financial markets last year is dampening appetites.
European companies are particularly badly affected since luxuries -
including German cars, French wines and Italian jewellery - account for a
significant part of their sales in Japan. Imports from the EC rose 20.5 per
cent last year, but this year's increase could be much smaller. In March
imports were up just 0.4 per cent.
Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist of Nomura Research Institute, says the
decline in the growth of luxury imports is a natural result of the cyclical
easing in consumer demand. This is true. But it will do nothing to improve
Japan-EC relations at the crucial time when the community is establishing
new rules for governing entry to its markets after 1992.
Alongside these short-term changes a significant long-term shift is taking
place: Japanese exporters are successfully redirecting their energies
towards Europe and Asia.
Politics has played a part in this shift, with Japanese companies responding
to criticism from Washington. But economics has been the driving force. In
comparison with the US, Europe is still an under-developed market for
Japanese companies. In three important countries - France, Italy and Spain
 -severe restrictions are applied to Japanese goods.
Asia offers even more potential. Asia late last year overtook North America
as the main destination for Japanese exports. Given the high growth rate of
many Asian economies, Asia's importance as a market seems certain to
continue to expand.
Mr Summerville forecasts that by the end of the decade Asia will absorb 45
per cent of Japan's exports. 'For the first time in 250 years, the most
important Asian economic decisions are being made by Asian companies and
Asian consumers.'
The long-term growth of Asia will not reverse the decline in Japan's trade
surplus from its peak in the mid-1980s. But it will probably means that
after increasing this year, the surplus will not fall by much in 1992 or
thereafter. Certainly, the surplus is unlikely to start shrinking again at
the rate it did in the late 1980s. Nomura Research Institute forecasts that
by 1995 the trade surplus will still be Dollars 60bn.
That figure may sound unacceptably high to some politicians in the US and in
Europe. But it could be is misleading: by 1995, the surplus will be much
more equally spread among different countries. Also, the current account
surplus will amount to a much smaller proportion of Japanese GNP than it did
at its peak in 1986. Then it was 4.5 per cent; in 1990 it was 1.2 per cent.
By 1995, it could fall below 0.5 per cent.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA intends to accelerate plans to allow foreign investment in its
fledgling stock markets by opening its exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen to
mutual funds later this year, according to a senior Chinese securities
official.
Mr Wang Po-Ming, vice-president of China's Stock Exchange Executive Council
which oversees the new securities markets, said in Hong Kong that a limited
number of country funds would be allowed to invest in the 'later part of
this year'.
This is believed to be in addition to plans being finalised by Shanghai's
stock exchange to allow direct foreign investment in two local companies,
Shanghai Vacuum which produces television tubes, and Shanghai United
Textile, a joint venture with a Hong Kong company.
Officials at the exchange, which opened last December, hope to announce
regulations for direct investment in these two companies within a couple of
months.
Hong Kong-based securities houses such as IndoSuez Asia, Barings and Jardine
Fleming have been waiting for openings on China's stock markets, but had not
expected until recently to be admitted this year. IndoSuez announced a
Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.8m) Shanghai Fund late last year but has delayed its
launch until the situation becomes clearer.
Development of China's stock markets has been considerably slower than
reform-minded officials have forecast in the past few years. Some officials
are concerned about the possibly destabilising impact of foreign speculators
on the small and unsophisticated exchanges, and there is also resistance
from Peking hardliners.
Mr Wang said that domestic interest in equities would be driven by China's
high level of personal savings and declining bank interest rates. He
predicted turnover on both the exchanges would more than double from last
year's total of approaching Yuan 4bn (Pounds 434m). Private savings of
approximately Yuan 700bn-1,000bn were a 'a tiger in a cage' which could
'come out at any time."

EFFORTS to achieve a common European approach to introducing high-definition
television (HDTV) are close to agreement, European Commission officials said
yesterday.
'Agreement on the principles' of what high-quality television strategy to
adopt has been reached by broadcasters, satellite operators and the
electronics industry, though details have still to be finalised,' they said.
The intention is still to introduce the D2-Mac satellite standard, on
wide-screen television sets.
But Brussels is still considering whether or how to compensate broadcasters
and equipment manufacturers already using other standards.
'It is not clear how this would be organised,' officials said.
Current EC rules require all direct broadcasting satellites to use this
system, as a stepping stone towards an improved HDTV standard in 1995.
But around 2m viewers - including subscribers to British Sky Broadcasting -
already receive pictures from the Astra satellite on the competing PAL
standard. Astra is exempt from the rules because it is telecommunications
rather than a television satellite. The Commission is working towards
getting a memorandum of understanding signed prior to introducing a new
directive, and is seeking a compromise among the interests affected. The new
directive is scheduled to be presented to telecommunications ministers on
June 3.
Brussels is not ruling out compensation for broadcasters on other standards.
But officials would not comment on the Commission's response to BSkyB's
compromise proposal to broadcast simultaneously in both D2-Mac and PAL,
provided the EC picked up the additional costs.

THE European Commission warned yesterday of a crackdown on cartels following
this week's raids on the offices of 15 carton-board-making companies.
'We're getting tougher all the time,' said a senior EC official, adding that
it was a priority of Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner that 'we
should be on the lookout for cartel activities'.
Officials from the Brussels competition directorate, accompanied by national
officials, made unannounced visits on Tuesday and Wednesday to 15 companies,
several of them subsidiaries of non-EC companies like Stora of Sweden,
Cascade of Canada and Mayr-Melnhof of Austria, and took away documents.
The investigation follows an allegation by the British Printing Industries
Federation that producers of carton-board were concerting price rises,
contrary to the Treaty of Rome.
'We are sifting through the evidence, but there's nothing at the moment that
would lead us to widen our investigation beyond carton-board,' said the EC
official.
The BPIF wrote to the Commission on November 22 listing 23 occasions on
which it said its members had been faced with seemingly concerted price
rises of around Pounds 40 per tonne. The supplying companies were in the UK,
France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
The similar dates of the notification of the price rises - from
mid-September to mid-October - and the similar dates of the implementation
of those rises - in the first week of January  - raised the federation's
suspicions.
'Although we must accept that that certain factors relevant to board
producers are common .. we do not believe that the overall impact of all the
various factors is so uniform that the prices should rise by virtually
identical amounts at virtually the same time,' it said.
Backing for the UK complaint came from the Federation Francaise de
Cartonnage, which said yesterday it had received inquiries from the
Commission officials last December. 'We told them that for the past two and
a half years, producers have been announcing identical price rises at the
same time.'
By contrast, Mr Volkmar Wulf, director of the Frankfurt-based international
paper and carton association, CITPA, said he was 'astonished' by the
Commission's action 'because I thought the market was OK'.
In January the Commission raided several EC steel companies suspected of
market fixing practices, and last year ICI of the UK and Belgium were fined
a record Ecu47m (Pounds 32m) for carving up the soda ash market. Other
recent cartel investigations include petrochemicals, plastics, plasterboard
and pulp.
David Goodhart adds from Bonn: The European Court of Justice has ruled that
the German Federal Labour Office's state monopoly in the job placement
market is invalid in the senior management sector. The case was brought by a
Munich headhunting agency, Hofner and Elser, who were not paid by a customer
on the grounds that their work was against German law.

THE British Chancellor's remarks about car telephones being a modern day
scourge came true in Madrid yesterday, when the entire pious panoply of
Spanish politics seeped unceremoniously out of a cellular telephone
belonging to Mr Txiki Benegas, the third most powerful man in the governing
Socialist Party.
Meet 'the dwarf' (Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga), 'el One' (Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez), and 'el Catalan' (his deputy, Mr Narcis Serra).
On April 18 Mr Benegas, administrative director of the socialist party, was
in his car when he made, or received, two calls from party associates during
which they talked about forthcoming local elections and Mr Solchaga's
dismissal of a party proposal to finance cheap mortgages for poor homebuyers
by making banks set aside funds for the project. The issue had poisoned
already delicate relations between Mr Solchaga and the party and an
embarrassed Mr Gonzalez, who also thought the party's idea a poor one.
As is possible with cellular networks, the conversations were picked up and
Spaniards spent most of yesterday listening to them on a commercial radio
station.
Caller: 'What is Solchaga trying to do? He is going to destroy our election
strategy  .. Why? He wants to go into a general election with a new team in
Ferraz (party headquarters in Madrid). He's not stupid.'
Benegas: 'No, he's not stupid. I'll tell you about how cocky he gets with me
 . (but) the problem here isn't Solchaga, its with 'el One'.'
The caller then goes on to say that it is no longer just a personal problem
between Mr Solchaga and Mr Alfonso Guerra, a sworn political enemy and
former deputy prime minister who is still deputy party leader. 'If the
Catalan starts opining as well he'll do it much more carefully, if at all.'
Benegas: 'No, no, the Catalan is on the fence .. what the Catalan knows is
that the problem that this government has is, precisely, The Dwarf.'
Mr Benegas said the broadcasting of his conversations were a form of
'telephonic terrorism' and proved no Spaniard was safe any more. Mr
Solchaga, cornered by reporters, was laughing too hard to say more than that
he did not take the remarks seriously.
But it is becoming increasingly clear that the fight between Mr Solchaga and
the party is widening into one between the government and party and that Mr
Gonzalez will have to act forcefully to stop it. Senior party officials, who
regard Mr Solchaga as too conservative, have been trying to trip him up for
more than a year.

MORE than 30,000 workers from a group of Greek companies due to be
privatised staged a one-day strike yesterday to protest against plans to
speed up closures of plants that are failing to attract buyers.
The workers say the government should instead adopt a proposal by the Greek
Industrialists' Federation to offer some companies to the private sector on
short-term leases.
Only two out of 28 debt-burdened industrial companies due for privatisation
this year have been sold.
The state-controlled Industrial Reconstruction Organisation, which makes
payments on their accumulated debts of over Dr200bn (Dollars 1.05bn), plans
to liquidate another 14 companies shortly.
Among them are several textile plants, white goods manufacturers and a paper
mill. All are considered unlikely to find buyers.
Last year about 6,000 workers from IRO companies were offered a year's
retraining on full pay, but no such provision was made for the remainder.
Just over 8 per cent of the Greek workforce is unemployed. But the
Industrialists' Federation says that one in three workers in the 18-23 age
group cannot find a job.

FT  26 APR 91 / Unification lifts hopes in German crane market: The big
construction build-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESHLY-PAINTED in the black, red and yellow of Germany's national flag, a
small piece of history on wheels adorns the rooftop of a car showroom in
Wilhelmshaven, a windswept refinery town on Germany's north-west coast.
The squat-featured Trabant, one of thousands that chugged into action during
the exodus of east Germans from their country in 1989, might seem an odd
trophy in a town much closer to the Netherlands than the former East
Germany.
But even here the effects of unification are rippling through the local
economy - and nowhere more so than at the town's biggest industrial
employer, Krupp Industrietechnik (KI), part of the Krupp industrial
conglomerate.
In a wartime submarine plant on the shoreline, Germany's second-biggest
mobile crane producer is spearheading an assault on an eastern German market
recast by unification.
The German crane-makers and their customers - rental companies from east and
west, 'cross-border' joint venturers, former east German kombinats that have
become limited companies, and east German entrepreneurs - are being carried
along by a wave of speculative buying ahead of an expected construction
boom.
Nobody can be sure how and when this will happen, although independent
observers of the world construction industry such as the Corporate
Intelligence Group say east Germany will be the major European growth market
in the 1990s.
'The east is so far behind that the construction and reconstruction task has
a size beyond imagination,' said a study by the London-based analyst late
last year. On top of this, the east's machines are 'old, technically very
backward, either too large or too small, too noisy, too polluting and have
very low output levels'.
With the world construction equipment industry's more mature western markets
in varying depths of recession, it is not surprising that producers are
making tracks to east Germany in a big way.
It could be 10 or 20 years before some of the prospects bear fruit,
observers believe. But the crane market is one of the first where words have
been matched by orders, as a result of the happy proximity - and shared
nationality - of the target market and the best-placed suppliers.
The west German producers have a stranglehold on the old domestic market,
which over the past decade has been increasingly concentrated around the two
big domestic producers, KI and Liebherr. Liebherr is technically Swiss-owned
but unmistakably German in its background.
The catalyst for this change has been the heavy spending required to develop
the multi-axle 'all-terrain' crane, with extra large tyres, a shorter
chassis, and all wheels independently driven.
Now German producers have about 90 per cent of the worldwide all-terrain
market which they pioneered. 'We German crane fellows give each other a
tough time at home, and that's the engine for export growth,' says Dr
Frithjof Timm, KI's sales director.
Over the past year the all-terrain cranes have proved to be ideal for east
German conditions - especially its roads, which could more accurately be
described as 'off-roads', Dr Timm quips.
A new Corporate Intelligence report estimates that 150 cranes were sold for
use in east Germany last year. The enthusiastic Dr Timm puts the figure at
180, and says KI sold two thirds of them.
By comparison, annual sales in the former West Germany stuck doggedly at
400-450 units between 1984 and 1988, before picking up in 1989 because of a
housing boom prompted by the flood of refugees from the east.
The 'east German effect' has been a godsend for KI, which has long played
second fiddle to Liebherr. In the mid-1980s the Wilhelmshaven company
adopted a high-volume production policy, investing heavily in new products
and facilities, but it is understood the crane business did not make a
profit until last year.
Already unification has created a domestic market with sales of 1,073 mobile
crane units last year, compared with 1989 sales of 584 in the west and an
estimated 200 in the east.
But this big increase in capacity, spurred more by confidence and tax
incentives than hard evidence of construction activity in the east, may be
too much for the work immediately available.
For the customers operating in the east, the crucial factor in determining
the success of their gamble will be funding for construction work in the
next few years, and how quickly it is organised.
Corporate Intelligence says that, so long as work can reach a satisfactory
starting level by next year, the cranes bought between 1988 and 1992 should
not amount to a great excess of capacity. It warns, however, that there must
be a cyclical downturn at some point after 1992, and forecasts a steady
decline in the new unified market to 705 units by 1995.
One forecast is rather easier: the two east German producers Babelsberg and
Zemag will be hard pushed to sell any of their puny, antiquated
truck-mounted cranes in the uplifting environment of the unified German
market.

FT  26 APR 91 / Hold the line on inflation, says Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday made a powerful appeal to western countries not to
relax their vigilance against inflation and to reject the idea that more
employment could be achieved through steeper price rises.
In its annual report, the German central bank said it was too early to sound
the 'all clear' on inflation. A lasting decline in interest rates could only
occur on the basis of stable monetary policies.
Coming ahead of Sunday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington, the
Bundesbank's statement reinforced its commitment to a tight monetary policy
at a time of growing inflationary pressures. The bank is resisting US
pressures to ease its policies.
Bundesbank officials have expressed concern about the level of domestic wage
settlements - running at about 7 per cent  - and the likely impact of tax
rises on inflation. The bank built in a low price increase level of 2 per
cent into its money supply goal for 1991, but economists now expect the
consumer price index to be nearer 4 per cent by the year-end.
The Bundesbank did not say so in its report, but it has made clear it has no
intention of lowering interest rates for some time. It last raised its
discount and lombard rates by half a point to 6.5 and 9 per cent
respectively on January 31. Economists in Germany and abroad feel a further
rise is possible later this year.
Although countries' different economic conditions provided scope for varying
interest rate developments, the Bundesbank said: 'It should not be
overlooked that inflationary pressure remains high worldwide.' Despite the
cooling down of the world economy, inflation rates in the most important
industrialised countries had been above those of 1989.
The bank also said it saw little chance of success in attempts to stabilise
trends in foreign exchange markets, such as the dollar's movement, through
intervention, though occasional interventions could calm markets.
David Marsh adds from Bonn: Mr Reimut Jochimsen, the German central banker
in the midst of a row over streamlining the structure of the Bundesbank, has
urged the government to compromise to avoid a damaging political flare-up.
Mr Jochimsen, president of the regional central bank of North
Rhine-Westphalia, opposes the plan of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank
president, to lower the number of state (Land) central bankers on the
Bundesbank's policy-making council.
Mr Jochimsen, a member of the council since last August, urged the Bonn
government to support his compromise proposal to increase the number of Land
central banks by one to make allowance for German unification. Mr Pohl, by
contrast, has suggested cutting the number from the present 11 in west
Germany to eight in united Germany - an idea backed by the majority of the
Bundesbank's 18-man council.

FT  26 APR 91 / Slovak PM falls victim to tide of economic reform: The
political demise of a volatile 'hero' who clung to the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEHIND this week's downfall of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the volatile and highly
popular prime minister of Slovakia, lay deep-seated economic differences
with Prague over the future of economic reforms.
Mr Meciar strongly opposed the radical free market reforms of Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the Czechoslovak finance minister. Slovakia, an agrarian backwater
only 40 years ago, was saddled with huge armament factories and processing
industries under the communists. Economic restructuring now threatens mass
unemployment in a region where the standard of living - in sharp contrast to
the Czech republic - has risen since 1948.
Mr Jan Carnogursky, who sought confirmation last night from parliament as
the new Christian Democratic prime minister of Slovakia, is aware that
collectivism and reliance on the government is stronger among Slovaks than
among more individualistic Czechs. Despite deep-seated Slovak fears of
economic reforms, he also realises that impoverished Slovakia, with only
5.5m people, can ill afford to follow a separate economic route from the 10m
Czechs.
He will attempt, however, to squeeze every Koruna he can get for Slovakia
out of the Czechoslovak budget. As the man who first raised the threat of
Slovak independence last year, Mr Carnogursky can be counted on to play the
separatist card, to gain greater economic aid for Slovakia.
His more recent statements on the need for Slovakia to remain in the
Czechoslovak federation give rise to hopes in Prague that he will not
compete with Mr Meciar on the incendiary issue of Slovak independence. There
could be no greater contrast between the shy, ascetic-looking Mr
Carnogursky, who was first deputy prime minister until this week, and the
extrovert, bull-necked Mr Meciar, who is idolised by ordinary Slovaks.
Mr Meciar threatened that after a month of peace for the new government he
would march on Bratislava with the jobless and starving and demand to know
what the government would do for them. More than 50,000 of his supporters -
in the biggest demonstration in Bratislava since the communists' overthrow
in November 1989 - demonstrated on Wednesday evening, demanding his
reinstatement and hurling paving stones at parliament.
Mr Meciar's erratic behaviour as prime minister was an important reason the
main body of his Public Against Violence (PAV) movement - the Slovak
counterpart of Civic Forum in Prague - joined with Mr Carnogursky to oust
him.
Mr Meciar angered the PAV leadership by forming a rival group, PAV-Platform
for a Democratic Slovakia, which aims to put the brakes on the economic
reforms.
Not surprisingly, his main allies are the former communists in Slovakia who
regard Mr Meciar, himself a former communist youth movement functionary, as
a guarantor of social justice.

FT  26 APR 91 / British team to help Chernobyl clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A British industrial consortium has been invited to help the Soviet Union
clean up radioactive contamination in rural areas. The Chernobyl nuclear
reactor exploded five years ago today.
SAC Hitech, part of the Ricardo engineering group, is heading a consortium
which includes Ove Arup and AEA Technology, in a Pounds 600,000
pre-feasibility study of fallout in the Russian Federation, about 250km from
Chernobyl.
It is the first phase of a four-phase programme involving about 110,000
people who may have to be moved to other areas because they are still
receiving too much radiation.
The problem is the radio-isotope caesium-137 in the nuclear fuel ejected in
the explosion, and washed out by rain over large tracts of the Russia.
The fallout emits gamma-rays and fine particles can contaminate people
directly by its radiation, and by being ingested with food or breathed into
the lungs.
SAC Hitech has been negotiating with the Moscow authorities for over a year,
since the Russian Federation first revealed the extent of its fallout
problem, said Mr Mark Ryan, project manager.
The engineers brought in the AEA Technology's environment and energy
activity at Harwell for its radiological experience, and Ove Arup to help
plan new accommodation and work for affected people.
The Russians are providing Pounds 100,000 in hard currency, but SAC Hitech
is adding a further Pounds 500,000 as an investment in what it believes
could yield major engineering business for the UK, Mr Ryan said.
He plans a project office in Moscow alongside a Soviet team, with much of
the local expense expected to be met in roubles.
The pre-feasibility study will take seven months or more and help define
what is currently seen as a Pounds 2m feasibility study. The main objective
is to minimise disruption and improve 'quality of life' for the affected
Soviet citizens.
The complete programme could take as long as ten years, Mr Ryan said.
AEA Environment and Energy will be advising on ways to reduce the radiation
dose to people, said Dr Alan Eggleton of Harwell. He said Soviet assessment
of fallout in Russia had been fairly crude and the project's first step
would be a comprehensive radiological assessment.

FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (7): A policy for youth - Cornwall
pioneers training schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first Training and Enterprise Council, for Devon and Cornwall, was
established just over a year ago at the beginning of April 1990.
The Councils (known as Tecs) are a mechanism for giving local businessmen
and employers a greater involvement in recruitment and training.
They took over responsibility, from the government's Training Agency, for
the two major unemployment schemes, the Youth Training Scheme (YTS) and
Employment Training (ET) for the older long-term jobless. (The Training
Agency, which has its headquarters in Sheffield, was previously the Manpower
Services Commission.)
The Devon and Cornwall Tec consists of a main board in Plymouth and five
area boards (Tabs), including one for Cornwall.
The Tabs also offer a business advisory service, administer enterprise
allowances and run a programme of business seminars.
The two big employment programmes took the lion's share of spending,
probably around Pounds 20m for the YTS in the last 12 months and possibly
Pounds 11m for all the TECs.
Some 7,500 youngsters have been involved in the YTS administered by the
Devon and Cornwall Tec. Other young people from the area, including some in
the Cornwall Tab area, took part in nationally administered schemes.
Precise numbers of people associated with employment training are hard to
assess. Some people have been involved for only a few hours going along and
seeing what the scheme meant. However, at any given time in the last year
there were probably around 5,000 tied in in some way with employment
training.
This year, the Devon and Cornwall Tec has an overall budget of Pounds 49.7m,
of which Pounds 29.6m will be spent on young people and Pounds 9.7m on
adults. The rest will go on management costs, business programmes and local
initiatives. Roughly two-thirds of the total will be spent in Devon and
one-third in Cornwall.
The YTS and the ET have been criticised as being too broad brush and
insufficiently interested in training. They were aimed chiefly at
alleviating unemployment, and some employers, it is said, saw the YTS as a
pool of obtaining cheap labour.
Young people who entered the YTS complained that it was just a way of
denying them unemployment benefit. By giving young people YTS money instead
of the dole the unemployment figures were made to look better. While there
was theoretically a retraining element in the job to which they were
directed, this was not always so in practice.
The YTS gave way to youth training and this in turn is now being replaced by
another more wideranging scheme - Training Credits. This involves the
careers service office, which is part of the local education authority,
employers' organisations, employers, licensed providers, approved trainers
and, of course, the young people themselves.
The process starts when a young person goes to the careers advisory service.
An action plan for work and training is then drawn up. If the youngster is
lucky enough to find a job straight off the employer gets together with the
employee and the approved trainer to organise the job and the training and
the voucher (or 'credit') is triggered. The credit can be anything from
Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 4,500 depending on time and qualifications aimed for.
If no job is immediately on offer the young person takes his action plan
from the career service to a licensed provider. This person makes an
assessment and transitional training is given until the right kind of job is
found, and the voucher is put into effect
In practice the process should be less tangled than it sounds. But there are
problems.
So far in Cornwall, the Tab has appointed six licensed providers and some 90
bodies have applied to become approved trainers. Around 30 have been
approved so far.
One is Cornwall College, a college of further education, which has a
reputation for adapting to the changing needs of education. (It can also
organise some degrees courses in association with the Polytechnic in
Plymouth.)
Its unconventional approach is reflected in its use of a a 60 ft long bus
equipped with a video computer, 12-seat lecture room and some catering
facilities, which physically takes the school to the pupils.
Cornwall has a distinct pattern of unemployment. Its 10 per cent seasonally
adjusted rate is one of the highest rates in the country. It also has among
the lowest wage rates. With the tin mining industry collapsing and English
China Clays, one of the largest manufacturing concerns laying off 750
people, there are particular problems among the older unemployed. The Tab is
trying to address these specific problems. Approved trainers such as
Cornwall College can help by acknowledging that the major industry is now
tourism, and by tailoring its courses and training accordingly.

FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (5): Hopeful but not over-optimistic -
Fishery business becomes more competitive and specialised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK to any fisherman in Cornwall and he will tell you a tale of gloom and
doom about the present, the future and, indeed, the past of the industry.
That is, if he will talk to you. Fishermen across the country are an
introspective breed, little given to talking to outsiders and rarely
divulging the real truth.
More dispassionate observers are less gloomy, though. They point to an
industry which has invested quite heavily in recent years and attracted
younger men into it. They point to higher landings and the fact that Newlyn
is the leading port, in terms of value of fish landed, in England.
'Conditions are not too bad at the moment,' says Miss Elizabeth Stevenson, a
partner in W Stevenson and Son, the leading agent in the county which with
35 vessels also runs the largest privately-owned fleet in the European
Community.
'Quotas are reasonable and it is possible to make quite a good living.
Conditions were difficult at the start of the year with gales restricting
fishing and the Gulf war pushing up fuel prices. But March was not too bad
from a fishing point of view and oil prices have come back a bit from their
peak. We are hopeful about the future if not over-optimistic.'
She is supported by Mr Heugh Symons who with his partner Mr Steve Farrar
runs the Blue Sail Fish company in Looe. 'Fishing is going through a
difficult time. Costs are rising all the time. Diesel, repairs, investment
costs, interest rates all cost more all the time.
'But those who work hard, those who work long hours are those who succeed.
There are people who make a good living from fishing but there are also
those who are finding the going extremely tough.'
A similar sentiment is expressed by Mr Ian Greet, managing director of
Falmouth Fishselling (Falfish) in Falmouth. 'The whole industry has changed
over the last 10 years. Then the skippers went to sea, came back, sold their
catches and went home before the cycle repeated itself.
'Now the whole industry is much more professional. The skipper has to be a
businessman as well as a fisherman to succeed. He has to compete against
subsidised competition and the Spaniards registering as British and taking
part of the quotas laid down by the European Commission that would otherwise
have gone to British boats. He just has to be more sophisticated to exist
given these conditions. Fortunately, he has become more sophisticated. A lot
more sophisticated.'
It is the role of the Spaniards, though, that is causing great concern. A
large number of Spanish vessels, having inadvisedly over-fished their own
waters, have now registered in Britain and fish in Britain's traditional
grounds off the south western coast. Yet they land their catches in Spain.
'About 95 per cent of what the Spaniards catch is landed in Spain,' Miss
Stevenson says. 'Yet their catches are part of the British quota laid down
by the EEC. They are in fact catching part of our quota.'
The industry is waiting to see the result of legal deliberations about this
practice - and it is not optimistic about the outcome. If it goes badly
against Britain then Cornwall could be hit badly and the industry suffer.
There are other concerns. The European Commission has stated that the fleet
of the 12 member nations will have to be cut by as much as 40 per cent in
the years after the opening of the single market in 1992. This comes on top
of an overall European reduction in capacity of 3 per cent in tonnage and 2
per cent in engine power in the years between 1987 and 1991.
Every skipper has also had to come to terms with overfishing in the 1970s,
when the factory ships stood offshore and took almost anything that could be
sucked out of the sea. The setting up of a conservation box around the
coasts of the south west of England drawn up to protect the fish stock,
especially mackerel, was sensible but added to the pressures on boats and
their owners.
Despite these problems the industry is in reasonable shape. Newlyn landed
some Pounds 30m of fish last year and has around 200 boats working the port.
Looe, a very much smaller port, has 40 boats working it and the market there
handles some of the landings from nearby Mevagissey and Polperro.
Landings in Looe last year rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 2.248m and with the
overland catches, that is fish brought in to the market from Mevagissey and
Polperro, there was a 3.6 per cent rise to Pounds 2.799m.
Handling the catch has been much improved following an investment programme
by the harbour commissioners who were assisted by the Rural Development
Commission and Euro money. The auction house was rebuilt and new harbourside
units put in.
Even with all the latest equipment on the boats as well as onshore
improvements, though, a touch of luck comes in handy occasionally. Just
before Christmas some of the Looe boats struck it really lucky. Their catch
one day turned out, to their surprise, to be bass, an upmarket fish admired
in Paris as well as London.
One boat came in with a catch worth Pounds 64,000, enough to give them a
very nice Christmas. For the port as a whole bass catches amounted to Pounds
850,000 last year. Had it not been for good bass catches Mr Symons says the
actual value of fish landed in Looe last year would have fallen slightly
rather than risen. Even so, the actual 2 per cent rise was lower than
inflation and so in real terms the port slipped slightly.
Around the rest of the coast there are a number of smaller ports such as
Padstow and Port Isaac that may have as few as half a dozen vessels based in
them. Many of these will be fishing for lobster and crab, fish on which the
margin of profitability is much greater.
During the season - from about now until October, depending on the weather -
two or three Vivier lorries, which have glass fibre tanks necessary to carry
live shellfish, are in Cornwall every day to take the catch to continental
markets. Once their main destination was Paris but now it is Spain.
Overfishing has, however, cut the catch and volumes, Mr Greet believes, have
probably dropped by about a half over the past five years, a symptom of the
changes with which the Cornish fishermen have had contend.

of the south, few counties in the UK can offer the coastal variety of
Cornwall whether interests focus on fishing out of the picturesque villages
like Mevagissey and Looe on the south or surfing on the huge strands at
Newquay and elsewhere on the northern shore, or building sandcastles or
walking along the rugged cliffs.
The Scilly Islands in the far west also attract great attention. It takes
two hours to reach them by boat from Penzance; 15 minutes by fixed wing
aircraft; and 22 minutes by helicopter. Inland there is the beautiful Bodmin
Moor, and lots of other stunning scenery.
Accordingly, Cornwall remains one of the favourite holiday spots in Britain.
A plan drawn up for the Tourism Action Plan Programme estimates that with
more than 3m visitors Cornwall in 1989 was the seventh busiest holiday
county in England in terms of holiday trips, second after Devon for numbers
of holiday nights; and third largest recipient of holiday spending after
Devon and London.
Following the collapse of tin mining and other manufacturing activities,
tourism is Cornwall's most important industry. A University of Bradford
study undertaken in 1987 reckoned it accounted for 33,042 jobs and the
British Tourist Authority in 1986 put the number at 33,603. This is about 21
per cent of all jobs in Cornwall, more than twice the level estimated to be
employed in the tourism industry in Devon. More than half these jobs were
full time.
In 1989, total tourism expenditure was put at Pounds 585m by the English
Tourist Board. In addition to hotel bills, this included cash spent in shops
and restaurants, on self-catering and ancillary professional services.
In spite of the apparent buoyancy, however, all is not entirely well.
Cornwall clearly continues to attract lots of visitors. For example, almost
one third of all holiday makers are perennial returners. Almost one third
also go to Newquay. These are predominantly young people for its night life
as well as its go long beach.
But historically the industry has been in decline. At the end of the 1970s
there were nearly 4m visitors and Pounds 350m was spent in 1979. . Given
inflation and the more restricted criteria on which spending was calculated
this was probably per capita more than today.
The reasons for the decline, also found in other British resorts, are that
the advent of the package tour to the Costa Del Sol replaced the British old
style, long-stay, bucket and spade summer holiday. People turned to Europe
and beyond.
Partly to arrest the trend long-a three year Tourism Development Action
Programme was set up in 1989 to look at the possibilities.
A joint venture of the English Tourist Board and the local authorities and
tourism organisations, the TDAP, found that while long holidays are not
generally increasing in numbers and value, other types of tourism are.
Cornwall still has an average length of stay of seven days, longer than in
which is long compared to south-east coastal resorts such as Brighton and
Bournemouth.
The TDAP set out to develop short breaks and business tourism markets to
encourage more visitors to stay and develop business outside of the main
season. It has attempted to improve, grade, develop and market accommodation
the visitor needs. It has tried to improve tourist information centres, and
sign-posting to target the wealth of heritage centres, not just ancient
castles, fine old houses and maritime centres but also industrial museums
and artefacts.
It has helped to establish the Cornwall Creative Network which has
identified 136 different kinds of specialist holidays which can be taken in
Cornwall. They range from fishing and bird watching to brass rubbing, flower
collecting and Cornish language courses.
Some developments have taken place independently, such as the upgrading of
Land's End by one of Mr Peter de Savary's companies. According to one of Mr
de Savary's colleagues, when the group bought the 120 acres of Land's End in
1987 for Pounds 7m it was virtually derelict and cliff erosion made many of
the walks unsafe. It has spent Pounds 4m on shoring up the cliffs,
refurbishing the hotel and building a heritage centre.
Land's End still attracts 700,000 visitors a year, its previous total. . But
while they used to stay only eight minutes, during which they might buy
little more than a postcard, they now stay for nearly three hours and spend
Pounds 6 per head.
Another example of value being added to tourism is at Falmouth, where Mr De
Savary has built a marina and flats.
The most striking development, however, has been in the growth of
self-catering holidays. These are no longer taken in the old-style post
second world war prefabs or parked caravans, but in cottages and houses
bought as investments and/or second homes. They are usually renovated to a
high standard. Because of tax concessions some businesses have bought groups
of them, which are managed by agencies.
But even a single cottage owner can run it as a business and set all costs
against income (even interest on loans to buy it) and avoid capital gains
tax until retirement.
The conditions are that the house be let for at least 140 days a year and
that no single tenancy should exceed 31 days in any seven months.
As a result of the mushrooming of these houses and cottages, 60 per cent of
all holidays in Cornwall are now taken in self-catering units and the season
has been lengthened.
The self-catering holidays have become equally controversial for a different
reason. Local people do not like outsiders bidding up property prices
thereby putting them beyond the reach of young residents.
Although Cornwall's tourism is changing and the decline appears to have been
arrested , through self catering and the growth of foreign and other
visitors, it has not been without cost in some Cornish eyes.

THE 9,300-ton cargo ship Crystal Star is this week lying at one of the
berths in Falmouth docks after a fire crippled her as she was passing Land's
End.
With her 28 crew membersairlifted to safety the vessel was brought into
Falmouth while her owners sought tenders for the necessary repairs to be
done.
One of those tendering will be Falmouth docks itself. The docks, a member of
the A &amp; P Appledore group, is part of traditional Cornish industry - not
perhaps as famous as mining but every bit as traditional. Small boat
building and an associated repair sector is to be found at many ports around
the long coastline; Falmouth docks differs only in that it is large.
It has been larger. Today the company employs just over 550 people, a number
that rises to nearer 800 when casuals - workers taken on for perhaps a week
or two at a time to supplement the permanent staff - are included.
Together with the other tenant companies on the docks, such as Falmouth Oil
Services and Pendennis Ship Yard, more than 1,000 are employed within the
yard which is the most important single contributor to the economy of the
town.
Once, it was not only bigger but much bigger. Mr Tom Duncan, Appledore's
chief executive in Falmouth, was not there at the time but he recalls that
the ship repair side alone once employed more than 2,000 men. He also
recalls that British Shipbuilders, who owned it in the early 1980s, ran down
the number to about 75 and wanted to close a port that is a major harbour on
the shipping lanes. Since his arrival in 1985 he has built the operation
back to the point where it has a turnover of about Pounds 20m. a year.
Even more traditional than dockyards within the Cornish industrial sector,
though, is mining. Tin is as linked with Cornwall as whisky with Scotland or
shipbuilding with Tyneside. Most of the great tin names such as Wheal Jane
have now disappeared although some processing continues at South Crofty,
near Redruth.
It is at St Austell, though, that the mining industry continues to exist in
strength and profitability. There, the end product is china clay, or kaolin
as it is known overseas.
Mr Graham Lovering, managing director of the company's mineral operations,
heads the most important single employer in the county with some 4,000
workers.
ECC produces some 3m tons of clay a year and is meeting demand rising by 2-3
per cent a year. Like Appledore, though, ECC has had to come to terms with
changing market conditions which have seen the workforce reduced by about
3,000 over the past 20 years.
Only last year ECC announced 750 job losses and in August it will move its
head office out of the duchy to Theale, in Reading. That switch will not
involve more than 30 staff but is an erosion of decision making out of the
county, a trend that has occurred in other parts of Britain.
At least the restructuring of ECC and Appledore has produced viable
companies. Elsewhere in the county there has been a distressing catalogue of
closures, especially in engineering.
Companies such as Case, Strategic Alloys and Bryants Electrical have shut
down or moved out of the county turning the Redruth-Camborne area in
particular into an economic black spot.
However, bodies such as the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which is
the county's inward-investment arm under its director Mr Ivor Simpson, and
the Devon and Cornwall Development Company, which co-ordinates the private
and public sectors under Mr John Caff, have been instrumental along with the
Cornwall Economic Development Office, a county council-led body under Mr
John Rees-Evans, in switching the emphasis towards lighter, more
high-technology industry.
This switch compensates for Cornwall's distance from markets since the
end-products of the incomers are not nearly as sensitive to transport costs.
A survey undertaken by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte for Mr Simpson's Bureau
has forecast the electronics sector to grow strongly over the next three
years.
Mr Ivor Simpson says that major investment is highly likely to be undertaken
in the region with two companies 'planning to invest more than Pounds 20m
and four planning to invest more than Pounds 5m.
'The evidence contained in the survey should have a galvanising effect on
companies looking to set up European operations to take advantage of the
single European market after 1992.'
The larger part of the growth of electronics has taken place in Devon but
companies such as BT International and Fitzgerald Light and the Goonhilly
telecommunications station on the Lizard peninsula have shown it is possible
to create a high-tech industry in the county.
A further development has been the growth of food processing, led by people
such as Ginsters, which now operates a national distribution chain from its
headquarters at Callington, near Liskeard, and Rodda, the ice-cream
producer, at Scorrier, between Redruth and Truro.
Food and drink as a sector provided work last year for 4,180 people
according to figures produced for Mr Mike Jordan and Mr Peter Fitzgerald of
Cornwall TAB - almost double the number three years earlier.
Mr Caff believes that 'what is still needed is a broader and realistic
public consensus of what can be done and what needs to be done'.
Given that consensus he sees no need to be anything other than optimistic
about the county's industrial future.

Property

A YEAR and a half ago, at the height of the property boom, English Estates
had just four of its 500-or-so properties available. Today, that figure has
risen to more than 100.
Receiverships and insolvencies are an unfortunate occurrence practically
every week now, especially among small firms and Mr Richard Goldring, the
corporation's senior management surveyor for Cornwall, says: 'Times are
difficult.'
English Estates, a quango that builds factories in the English assisted
areas and therefore has similar factory-building powers to those of the
Scottish and Welsh development agencies, is the only major developer of
industrial properties and sites within the Duchy of Cornwall.
Mr Goldring adds: 'There are a number of small builder-developers putting up
a couple of small units on land they have probably bought from a farmer but
most of them don't look further than 10 miles from home and are really
looking to provide themselves with a pension from the income out of
lettings.' The private sector is very cautious, he adds. It wants pre-lets
where possible.
Even so, a number of small privately-owned business parks can be found
dotted around the county - at Launceston, Wadebridge and Bodmin, for
instance. English Estates itself has 30,000sq ft in Falmouth and a much
smaller, 6,000sq ft development in Liskeard. But business parks in general
have been slow to develop reliable roots in the county compared with other
areas of Britain.
Of the 500 properties in the duchy belonging to English Estates a large
number were put up in the 1980s. When the upturn in the economy comes it
will, therefore be well positioned to cater for demand, especially in the
smaller units up to about 1,500sq ft where the casualty list has been
heaviest.
The situation in the industrial market is reflected to a very large extent
in the office and retail sectors according to Mr Steve Lobb, partner in
Chesterton's Plymouth office. 'The only place in the county that can sustain
speculative office development is Truro,' he says. 'The county town is also
about the only place where a healthy demand for retail outlets exists.'
Truro stands out in these two sectors. Office rents have reached Pounds
12.50-13 a sq ft in the city which Mr Lobb describes as 'pretty remarkable'.
Although prices have softened a little this year Maybey Developments South
West has let the whole of Elizabeth House to the Employment Services Agency
in the region of Pounds 12-13 a sq ft according to Mr Lobb.
Another government arm, the Inland Revenue, has bought the freehold of a
45,000sq ft block for Pounds 6.1m but the county's main problem is there is
no investment market so that deals tend to be one-off.
Elsewhere, Sun Alliance has had a scheme on the stocks for some time in
Truro in which Debenhams would be the anchor store and rents generally
approach Pounds 80 a sq ft for zone A properties. This compares with Pounds
40 in St Austell, Falmouth and Penzance and even lower in Newquay.
In St Austell, Guinea Properties had a Pounds 30m scheme for Aylmer Square
but that is understood to have been sold on to Sovereign Land which is
believed to be looking at a more modest scheme.
The retail sector is slightly more healthy and although most of the activity
has again been centred on Truro there are signs that some of the bigger food
chains are now looking more widely around the county. Sainsbury's decision
to build on the old county hall site in Truro is considered a watershed
within the market because it brings in one of the top groups.
Sainsbury is also thought to be looking at both St Austell and Falmouth.
It is in the far west of the county that the greatest difficulty arises in
developing properties, according to English Estates' senior development
surveyor Mr Tony Thomson. The Redruth-Camborne axis in particular has had a
very difficult time over the past year. A number of companies such as Case,
Strategic Alloys, Bryants Electrical and B &amp; J Shoes have pulled out and
filling the factories is made all the more difficult, he claims, because the
local authority, Kerrier, only wants manufacturing industry on sites in the
area.
Mr Thomson believes that if it were possible to open up the market to
distribution concerns it might be possible both to fill some of the
factories and create jobs in an area of high unemployment. 'Rents certainly
become cheaper the further west into the county one goes, which should help
us when the market picks up,' he adds. At the moment industrial units
attract about Pounds 3 a sq ft for those over 10,000sq ft rising to about
Pounds 6 for micro units of about 500 sq ft, though English Estates
introduces an element of charging what the market will bear by charging
slightly less for small rural properties.

MR NEIL ROBERTSON, business development manager of the Cornwall Economic
Development Office, believes that most businessmen who come to look at
Cornwall have only been here once before. 'They remember as kids sitting in
the back of their dad's old Austin car for 14 hours, driving across
Dartmoor, going across Bodmin Moor, in and out of every town and village
until finally they arrived at their seaside holiday.'
They were left with a childhood memory of Cornwall as a far, isolated place,
and may not fully realise that the journey from London or the Midlands is
nowadays a lot shorter.
Admittedly, there is still no motorway. But the A 30, the main spine road
through Cornwall, is dual carriageway for all but 30 miles of its length.
Most of the towns and villages that were once bottlenecks now have
by-passes.
The drive to London, with stops, takes around six hours. That is still a
long time to small children but for businessmen it means only a moderate
extra cost.
A lorry leaving at night can reach Felixstowe or other east coast ports
comfortably in eight hours. This is the maximum time that the tachograph
(the so-called spy in the cab) permits a driver to stay on the road. He can
then rest during the ferry crossing. Once on the continent, he can drive for
another eight hours by when he is in reach of most important north European
places.
Mr Robertson's Development Office recommends that businesses take this route
rather than the westerly crossings from Plymouth to Roscoff in France or
Santander in Spain, which are far from the main European centres.
The additional cost is only marginal since many cargoes are gauged by weight
rather than by distance. Some large hauliers such as TNT and Securicor have
set up in Cornwall because of the new businesses which settled there.
Previously they handled their Cornish business from Plymouth or Bristol.
For high value, low volume operations such as electronics or service
companies, Cornwall's location does not necessarily mean greater expense.
Many such of companies were formed before recession struck in 1990. But
there are also large food companies which find it economic to import food
from Europe, process it in Cornwall and distribute it throughout Britain.
Any extra geographical costs can be offset by savings elsewhere.
Then there is the question of what kind of managerial skills exist there.
Many entrepreneurs have moved their small businesses to Cornwall because of
the quality of life offers their families. But they still needed to keep in
touch with London, and of it still takes four and a half hours by rail from
Paddington to Truro, the duchy's administrative capital, a little too long
for for frequent day trips.
Until recently the answer lay with Brymon Airways, the small airline 40 per
cent owned by British Airways and 40 per cent by the Danish Group Maersk.
Equipped with five executive style Dash-7 aircraft, it offers four flight a
day from Newquay to Heathrow.
The flight takes an hour and the fare is comparable with a first class
ticket on the British Rail. It actually costs more than the Pounds 66 for a
first class ticket from Paddington to Truro, but there is a complimentary
breakfast and a complimentary bar so the price works out roughly the same.
The return flight from Heathrow to Newquay touches down at Plymouth. In the
year to March, the airline carried 75,000 passengers on this route. It has
other routes but because of recession and the Gulf war, which hit most
airlines, Brymon had a very bad year. It expects a pre-tax loss of Pounds
1.3m for its last financial year on a turnover of Pounds 30m.
Usually, however, the Newquay to Heathrow route is very successful. The
Dash-7s fly at 68 per cent capacity and more than 90 per cent of the
passengers are business people.
However, Brymon is worried by the decision of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
Secretary of State for Transport, to take the advice of the Civil Aviation
Authority and throw open Heathrow to new scheduled and charter operators.
Regional airlines such as Brymon have been told they will retain landing
rights at Heathrow. But Brymon is concerned over an earlier statement by the
British Airports Authority, owner of Heathrow, that 'if there is any major
relaxation (of access to Heathrow), we may need to respond with pricing
factors, involving higher Heathrow charges'.
Mr Malcolm Naylor, managing director of Brymon, says 'any self respecting
supplier of a monopoly product with unsatisfied demand would do the same'.
However, Brymon's fees at Heathrow have risen 120 per cent in the past five
years and account for one third of revenue on this route. The airline does
not expect to be physically ejected from Heathrow but Mr Naylor fears it
could be priced out.
'It has got to be Heathrow. Around 75 per cent of our passengers fly on from
there to other destinations in the US and the Far East. Stansted and Gatwick
just are no good for our needs', Mr Naylor says.

FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (1): Battle for recovery - At least 3.5m
people will flock to Cornwall this year to enjoy some of Britain's finest
scenery. But behind the jollity of its famous cream teas, the Duchy is
fighting hard to recover from the collapse of some of its oldest industries,
writes Anthony Moreton

<TEXT>
IT IS one of the great certainties of the British summer that once more the
holidaymakers will flock down the M 5 motorway this year into Cornwall. The
duchy, with its incomparable beaches, magnificent surf, cream teas and warm
weather, is just about everything the average holidaymaker wants from the
annual break. Two fine hot summers in succession have brought back the
attractions of British resorts generally and Cornwall confidently expects a
bumper time especially following the Gulf war, the collapse of companies
catering for the Costas trade and the rise in package-holiday prices.
Some 3.5m people visit Cornwall every year and the indications are this
number will be topped before autumn arrives and the deck chairs are stacked
away, the last ice-cream consumed, the oars put away on the boats taking
trippers around the bay.
What few of the trippers will see, though, is a county in transition, one
that has been badly affected economically and searching, not without
success, for a more diversified economy. 'Cornwall has been hard hit by the
recession,' says Mr John Caff, director of the Devon and Cornwall
Development Company. 'A broad and realistic consensus of what can be done
and what needs to be done is now essential if it is to realise its
potential.'
Mr John Rees-Evans, the county's economic planning officer, goes a stage
further. 'Cornwall continues to be biased towards the primary industries and
tourism but there is a very positive trend towards a more balanced economy,'
he states. 'Growth is coming from manufacturing and financial services.'
The two agree that reducing dependence on traditional industries such as tin
mining, fishing, agriculture and engineering will be made easier by the
increased emphasis being placed on what Mr Caff calls the 'quality of life'
factor.
'Until the late 1980s,' says Mr Rees-Evans, 'industry was all about the
company. Now it is increasingly about where that company exists. This is
where Cornwall will score because the quality of life here is far superior
to that in most of the rest of Britain. This will allow us to attract the
new companies that want a clean environment and a good workforce.' And Mr
John Berry, managing director of the Cornwall Enterprise Board, adds that
the county is 'a serious place from which to do business. It's as cheap to
export from here in small parcels as anywhere else in the country.'
Cornwall's economy is characterised by small firms, low pay, high
unemployment and, because of its dependence on tourism, a seasonal nature to
the work available.
Unemployment is significantly higher than in the rest of the UK. In January,
the figure was 10 per cent against a British average of 6.7 per cent and 6.1
per cent for the south west as a whole. The figure has been sustained by
closures in the Camborne-Redruth area which have turned this part of the
county into a black spot, by ECC International cutting its job force in St
Austell by 750 and several smaller job losses. The nearby Saltash area, too,
has been affected by the run-down in numbers in Devonport dockyard.
Some 90 per cent of the businesses in the duchy employ fewer than 25 people,
the sort of concern that Mr Richard Goldring of English Estates describes as
being in the forefront of the recession.
Between 1984 and 1987, the last year for which figures are available, the
numbers in agriculture and fishing dropped by 6.2 per cent, in mining by
33.7 per cent and in construction by 8.4 per cent, all significantly above
the national average. Mr Rees-Evans believes the trends contained within
these figures have continued.
According to the 1990 New Earnings Survey from the Department of Employment,
men's wages in Cornwall averaged Pounds 241.90 a week last year, 81.8 per
cent of the British average and 87.2 per cent of that of the south west
generally. Earnings for women, at Pounds 166.80 a week, showed a similar
discrepancy and the earnings figures were the lowest for any county in
Britain.
These bleak figures, though, do not show the way in which Cornwall has been
adapting. If tin mining has disappeared, there remains a buoyant china clay
industry. Fishing is producing a good income for its skippers and crew and
the efforts to diversify the economy have been successful.
Banking, finance and insurance as a sector grew by 24.6 per cent between
1984 and 1987 against a national average of 16 per cent and others to
outperform the British figure were distribution, tourism, transport,
printing, communications and 'other manufacturing and services', which
includes the food industry. Newquay Steam Beer, Ginsters' Cornish pasties
and Rodda's ice cream have won national markets. 'We have been able to
attract new companies,' says CEDO's Mr John Rees-Evans, 'through having a
good workforce, a pool of trainable labour and low absenteeism rates.'
The county also has a growing population. Numbers rose throughout the 1980s
and look set to continue to do so, despite the falling school rolls, until
the next century. The present population of 450,000 is expected to grow to
500,000 by the year 2001 and a decade later it could be up to 650,000.
Unlike counties such as Dorset or Sussex, and despite popular
misconceptions, this growth is not coming from pensioners looking to move
into the county at the end of their working lives. The growth is coming from
economically mobile and active people who want to live and work in a clean
environment.
Between 1981 and 1989 there was a net increase of 34,000 jobs to absorb the
growing population and Mr Rees Evans says between 1984 and 1987 'we were,
and we believe we continue to be, more successful than the rest of the
country in creating jobs in manufacturing. We boosted employment in this
area by 3.4 per cent at a time when Britain, climbing out of the depression,
dropped by 4.7 per cent. We are having to create around 3,000 net new jobs a
year just to meet population growth.'
If Cornwall is to take full advantage of this growth then it needs to
improve its infrastructure. The word 'infrastructure' normally conjures up
thoughts of roads and while improvements are necessary it is equally
important to update water supply, sewage treatment and disposal, recycling
facilities and development sites.
Roads, though, are crucial. Cornwall is one of the few English counties
without an inch of motorway. Its most important spine road, the A 30, will
have dual carriageway by the mid-1990s but, as Mr Graham Lovering, managing
director of ECC International, points out, one vital road is not sufficient.
'Roads into and out of the county have improved enormously', he says. 'But
there are still too many businesses within the county that have to use what
are little more than country lanes to get their goods to market. Taking clay
from our 35 pits in the county, and we produce 3m tons a year, to port in
Fowey or Par means travelling along narrow, country roads. It would help
enormously if these were upgraded, too.'
Other links are important. British Rail has just brought forward the last
train of the day from Paddington into Cornwall and there is resentment that
most of the fast services end in Plymouth. There is concern that Brymon
Airways' flights from Newquay might be squeezed out of London's Heathrow.
Greater use of Falmouth as a port would be welcomed - though here
introduction of a Ro-Ro facility is a possibility.
To minimise the economic disadvantages of distance from markets Cornwall has
joined the Atlantic Arc, a grouping of areas on the geographical perimeter
of the European Community. Cornwall College and the county's chamber of
industry have established links with mainland Europe and tourism links have
been encouraged with Brittany, northern Spain, Portugal and southern
Ireland.
Two weeks ago, work began on converting an old gasworks in St Ives into an
outpost of London's Tate gallery. St Ives, with its incomparable bay, was
the home of Barbara Hepworth and a host of other artists and the gallery
will contain 80 of the Tate's collection of 300 works by the St Ives school.
The Pounds 2.75m project is among a number of new investments within the
vitally-important tourism sector. Mr Peter de Savary's Land's End project
and housing schemes at Falmouth and Hayle may have caught the eye but just
as important has been the golf-course-and-housing development at St Mellion
and hotel improvements at St Martin's on the Scilly Isles, Talland Bay,
between Looe and Polperro, and St Keyne.
Cornwall may be looking to new niche industries to transform its industrial
economy but it is not ignoring those activities which, however
unquantifiable, have added immeasurably to the richness of its character.

Correction (published 30th April 1991) appended to this article.
DEPRESSED car markets are affecting performance at Vickers and British
Aerospace, the UK defence and automotive groups.
The chairmen of both companies warned yesterday that interim profits would
be below 1990 levels. Vickers shares slipped 2p to 209p; BAe's were down 6p
at 612p.
Sir David Plastow of Vickers said that the first half would be 'particularly
difficult' due to reduced car sales and redundancy costs.
Responding to questions at the group's AGM, he said that first-quarter sales
of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars were down by 'about 50 per cent.' Vehicle
sales since January totalled 1,049.
The group, which said its other businesses were performing satisfactorily,
is expected soon to receive a long-awaited order for 100 to 200 Challenger 2
tanks for the British army.
Professor Roland Smith of BAe, owner of the Rover Group, said that interim
results would fall short of 1990 levels 'despite the strong performance of
our defence companies.'
Correction (published 30th April 1991).
A total of 1,049 Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars were sold in thefirst quarter
of 1990, and not in the first three months of this year, as stated in the
Financial Times of April 26.

CALSONIC, a leading Japanese automotive components maker, is to set up a
subsidiary in Spain, to make car heaters and air conditioner systems.
Prototype manufacturing is planned to begin in October with full production
in 1992 at a rate initially of 120,000 units a year.
Its first customer will be Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish commercial
vehicles subsidiary of Nissan of Japan, which produces a range of vans,
light trucks and four wheel drive leisure/utility vehicles.
Calsonic is an associate company of Nissan, Japan's second largest car
maker. In 1989, it took over Llanelli Radiators Holdings in the UK for
Pounds 15m (Dollars 25m).
Calsonic has established its European head office, Calsonic International
(Europe), at Llanelli Radiators, Dyfed.
In addition to Llanelli Radiators, it produces heaters and air conditioning
systems in north-east England, where it is increasing production from
120,000 units a year to 300,000 a year by 1992.
It also makes exhaust systems and catalytic convertors in the Netherlands.

Mr Worner told a conference on the future of European security that Nato did

nor could it provide former members of the Warsaw Pact with formal security

'At the moment, what Nato can offer is a multiple and intensive web of

THE SWIFT rise to the limelight of Finnish politics by Centre party leader
Esko Aho, 37, who formed a new government yesterday, has taken political
observers by surprise. Few Finns had heard of Mr Aho before last summer,
when he was elected to the helm of the Centre party leadership.
A father of three who was raised on a farm in western Finland, Mr Aho has
been active in politics since his youth. He was elected to parliament from
his native village of Veteli at the age of 28, and has now become the
country's youngest-ever prime minister.
Views differ concerning the factors behind Mr Aho's success. Some believe
that last month's election victory by the Centre at the expense of the
ruling Social Democrats and conservative Coalition party was in part a vote
against European integration.
Others believe that the economic policies of the Blue/Red government, which
was made up of the Social Democrats, Coalition and Swedish People's party,
helped the Centre to become Finland's largest party after a 25-year reign by
the Social Democrats.
Mr Aho's friends say he is modest, discreet, pragmatic and intelligent. His
adversaries, however, describe him as banal and without any clear political
convictions.
After the end of the war, Finland has maintained a special relationship with
its giant neighbour, the USSR. Friendly relations between Helsinki and
Moscow were mainly forged by one of the main architects of Finnish
consensus, the late President Urho Kekkonen, who also belonged to the
nationalistic Centre Party and ruled the country for almost a quarter of a
century (1956-82).
Even if the aim of consensus has been to set aside political differences for
the sake of national unity, the critics of such a policy claim that it had
subdued political debate within the country to such an extent that it is
difficult to distinguish today between the agenda of the Social Democratic
and Coalition party.
The Centre party has traditionally had a negative attitude towards foreign
investment. This attitude is reinforced by a recent poll, which claims that
only 36 per cent of all Centre party members are in favour of EC membership.
An archetype of the Centre party politician, Mr Aho has toned down his
opposition to Finland's integration with western Europe through European
Economic Area (EEA). He has also stated publicly that he is against foreign
ownership of the country's forest industry.

FT  26 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Acorn Computer falls 38% to
Pounds 1.58m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 27th April 1991) appended to this article.
CONFUSION OVER new legislation concerning school management and uncertainty
over the effects of the community charge have combined to take the shine off
1990 results at Acorn Computer.
Turnover at Pounds 45.5m was marginally up on the Pounds 44.9m recorded the
previous year, while pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.53m in 1989 to
Pounds 1.58m in 1990, a fall of 38 per cent. Earnings per ordinary share
declined to 2.4p (3.8p).
Acorn, based in Cambridge and in which Olivetti of Italy has a majority
shareholding, is a main supplier of school computers, reckoning to have at
least one of its machines in 85 per cent of junior and secondary schools.
Purchasing patterns in schools have changed as a result of the introduction
of local management, and uncertainties over the level of funds available
because of the introduction of the community charge have slowed spending in
what is usually an unspectacular but reliable sector.
Acorn's operating profits last year rose to Pounds 2m compared with Pounds
1.3m in 1989. However, the company sold intellectual property rights in its
advanced reduced instruction set processor chips for Pounds 1.5m to a new
company established between Acorn, Apple Computer and LSI Logic of the US.
In 1990 the company also made provision of Pounds 900,000 against bad debts
due from a customer, resulting in a net exceptional profit of Pounds
561,000.
For the 1989 year the company recorded an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.2m
through selling an option on sales and marketing rights to a particular
product to Olivetti.
Interest charges accounted for Pounds 995,000 in 1990 compared with previous
income of Pounds 9,000 reflecting increases in working capital as the
recession in the latter part of the year began to have an effect.
The directors said that 53 per cent of all computers delivered to UK schools
in 1990 were Acorn, with the new BBC A3000 and Archimedes machines
outselling the earlier technology Master series by two to one.
Correction (published 27th April 1991).
VLSI, US-based semiconductor supplier, is the third partner in a new company
set up with microcomputer companies Acorn and Apple and not LSI Logic as
reported yesterday.

FT  25 APR 91 / Laura Ashley losses jump to Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY, the fashion and furnishings group, yesterday announced
steepening pre-tax losses to Pounds 6.67m in the year to January 26, from
Pounds 1.58m.
However, Mr Mike Smith, acting chief executive, said Laura Ashley had
achieved its main objective to strengthen its balance sheet. 'This was a
year of restructuring, rather than profit,' he said.
Earlier in the year the company was involved in a refinancing. It later
restructured by closing seven factories and its Units retailing chain,
selling its Penhaligon, Bryants, Sandringham Leather and Helmond Printworks
businesses, and cutting overheads.
Laura Ashley also announced a trading link with Aeon Group which resulted in
the Japanese retailer taking a stake.
The rationalisation resulted in borrowings falling to Pounds 23m from Pounds
87m, reducing gearing to 25 per cent from 119 per cent. The disposals and
tighter management controls helped cut stock levels by 38 per cent by the
year end.
Laura Ashley increased sales 10 per cent to Pounds 327.53m but higher costs
and an increased interest charge of Pounds 12.44m, against Pounds 8.64m,
eroded gains.
UK turnover grew to Pounds 143.6m from Pounds 142.6m, although the overall
figure concealed a 4.1 per cent decline in like-for-like sales. Home
furnishing sales remained flat because of the depressed housing market and
garment sales fell as the recession bit.
The company's international operations were more resilient. North American
outlets increased their sales contribution to Pounds 136.2m from Pounds
117.2m, although margins were held back by discounting.
Sales in continental Europe were also strongly ahead at Pounds 40.7m,
against Pounds 28.6m, and the link with Aeon led to the opening of 13 shops
in Japan and an 88 per cent sales boost.
Losses per share amounted to 2.6p compared with losses of 3.38p in the
previous period.
The company is paying a nominal final dividend of 0.1p although directors
and the Ashley family are waiving their entitlements.
The company is reviewing its marketing and has appointed Ms Glenne Gibson
from Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte to help develop the international brand. She
said this would lead to designs reflecting consumer aspirations through the
1990s. 'But we will not be phasing out all our flowers,' she said yesterday.
Laura Ashley expects to appoint a chief executive soon after receiving 500
applications.

FT  25 APR 91 / Dividing the House of Beazer: Why the group is floating its
UK operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Beazer has been characterised as an empire builder who turned a
small family housebuilding operation into a large international business and
mortgaged the company to pay for it.
This week the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive of Beazer
construction group proposed to sell off some of the family silver to reduce
the group's large debts  - the result of its free spending on acquisitions.
On Tuesday, Beazer announced plans to float off its UK housebuilding,
contracting and property businesses. It would then sell up to half the
shares in the new company, raising up to Pounds 250m in the process.
Beazer would be left owning a large US aggregate, cement and concrete
business, as well as a bare majority interest in a separately quoted company
holding its UK and other European operations.
The funds would be used to reduce the group's large US borrowings, most of
which were raised to support the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1bn) acquisition of
the Koppers cement and aggregates business in 1988.
Mr Beazer put a brave face on things yesterday: 'Our primary duty is to
maximise the return for our shareholders. We believe our proposals will do
that and raise cash at the same time.'
They mean, however, that Beazer's strategy of building a transatlantic
business, based on property and contracting in the UK and building materials
in the US, has come off the rails. No matter what gloss the directors put on
the proposal, they would not be planning it unless they had been forced to
do so by an overriding need to raise cash and reduce the strain on Beazer's
balance sheet.
The group's last annual accounts, for the year to June 30 1990, showed net
debts of Pounds 880.5m, compared with shareholders' funds of just over
Pounds 1bn. Debt has fallen since then. However, interest payments of Pounds
40m during the six months to the end of December were only twice covered by
operating profits of Pounds 80m.
Interest cover could reduce further during the six months to June 30, the
end of Beazer's financial year. Other UK housebuilders have warned that
profits will fall steeply during the first six months of this year. Profits
in the US may also have declined.
Beazer has had a meteoric rise. It has grown from a Bath-based housebuilder
with turnover of less than Pounds 20m in 1979 into a multinational business
with annual sales in 1989-90 of more than Pounds 2bn. Beazer is Britain's
fourth-largest housebuilder and the second-largest aggregates producer in
the US.
It achieved this status through a rapid series of acquisitions, financed in
the mid-1980s through the issue of large amounts of Beazer paper. Between
1983  - when Brian Beazer became chairman and chief executive  - and 1988,
the number of shares issued by the company rose from 12m to 300m.
By the mid-1980s investors had become disenchanted with the amount of paper
being issued. A Pounds 183m rights issue by Beazer in the autumn of 1986, to
support the acquisition of Gifford Hill, the US cement group, was less than
three-quarters subscribed.
Beazer had little choice, therefore, but to finance the purchase of Koppers
through debt  - initially in partnership with a consortium of bankers led by
Shearson Lehman of the US and National Westminster of the UK. Beazer
subsequently bought out the interests of its partners, taking all of the
debt for Koppers on to its own balance sheet.
Borrowings remain uncomfortably high, despite the sale of the Koppers
chemicals business and disposals of some of the Gifford Hill cement
businesses. The group has forecast that net debt will fall to about Pounds
750m by the end of June  - equivalent to about three-quarters of
shareholders' funds.
The group's options to reduce borrowings are constrained. It is doubtful
whether a rights issue could succeed given the company's current financial
position. UK shareholders  - familiar with the company's previous record on
issuing paper  - might be reluctant to support such a move. There would also
be technical difficulties in calling on support from US investors, who
account for between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of Beazer's shares.
The alternatives, therefore, are to sell hard assets in weak construction
markets in both the UK and US, or to offer minority stakes in one of the
group's main businesses.
A year ago Beazer raised the prospect of floating off parts of its US
operations, including Koppers. This idea has clearly been found wanting. For
a start, the group would be trying to sell a stake in a business with large
amounts of debt. The UK operations, by comparison, are currently very
lightly borrowed.
A price for Koppers might also be reduced by fears of possible future claims
for environmental damage. The claims could arise from Koppers' former
ownership of the chemical business for which Beazer has already made
provisions of Pounds 300m.
The sale of a stake in the UK business is probably the least undesirable
option considering that the group needs badly to reduce its debts. A sale
only to existing shareholders would be the equivalent of a rights issue,
anyway. Beazer also retains the option to sell some of the stock in the UK
company to new shareholders.
There is also merit in the argument that the current market capitalisation
of Beazer  - the share price yesterday fell from the year's high of 185p to
178p  - substantially understates the value of the group's assets. There has
never been any criticism of the underlying quality of the businesses bought
by Beazer.
The problem has been that the company has been unable to deliver the returns
necessary to justify the level of debt raised to acquire the new operations.

FT  25 APR 91 / Activity on USM dries up in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time in more than 10 years, no companies chose to raise funds
by joining the Unlisted Securities Market during the first quarter.
The drying up of activity is revealed in new-issue statistics published
yesterday by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock. KPMG monitors new
issues on both the USM and the stock exchange's official list.
New-issue activity on both markets was severely depressed during the
quarter, largely due to the UK recession and uncertainties after the Gulf
war.
The statistics also revealed a new low in the steady, steep decline of
companies seeking a USM quotation. The junior market, founded in November
1980, was once a bustling arena for the small and growing company.
Last year, the number of new issues was 47, raising a total of Pounds 40m
worth of new money, down from 87 raising Pounds 303m in 1988.
Some followers of the USM are concerned that its relative decline will
continue, even when investor appetite for new issues improves. Changes in
stock exchange regulations have made it easier for companies to go straight
to the official list.
The first-quarter statistics continue last year's trend. KPMG said the USM
last year suffered a net shrinkage as 29 of its constituent companies moved
up to the main market.
The figures show that the main market saw 12 new entrants. Three of these
were investment trusts which raised funds when they floated. But all nine
companies joining the market came by way of introduction, where a listing is
obtained without shares being simultaneously sold.
The investment trusts raised a total of Pounds 90m in the first quarter. New
entrants to the main market in 1990 raised Pounds 899m.
The comparative figures exclude privatisations, including this spring's
flotation of National Power and PowerGen, the two electricity generators.
Meanwhile, five companies obtained a USM quotation during the first three
months  - the lowest-ever quarterly total. All of these were introductions
and three were transfers from the Third Market  - the arena for the very
smallest and youngest companies which was abolished at the beginning of the
year.
Six of the companies introduced to the official list came from the USM.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: PM braces himself for a year of
living dangerously - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is not hard to see why John Major wants to avoid postponing the general
election until 1992. The charge of ditherer might stick. The winter and
spring would be dominated by messy legislation to introduce the council tax.
Europe could yet re-emerge as a dangerously divisive issue. Then, of course,
there is the unpredictable.
So the emerging consensus in the cabinet is that Mr Major will seek his
mandate in the Autumn. Some ministers are convinced there is a chance still
of a late June election. With the poll tax cauterised, they argue, the
Tories might yet do well in the May 2 local elections. If they then held
Monmouth in the by-election two weeks later, the stage could be set to
secure a 50-seat Westminster majority before the voters departed for the
Costa del Sol.
For most though, October or November looks by far the stronger bet. The
Treasury judgment is that the promise of better times ahead is not enough.
The electorate needs to feel the benefit of lower inflation and mortgage
rates for a few months before they will forgive the government its past
economic sins.
Unemployment will get a lot worse before it even starts to get better. Many
C2 voters whose mood will determine the election have already decided that
this year they will have to forsake Benidorm for Bognor. There is still a
lobby in Great George Street for 1992.
That said, the mood in the Cabinet is remarkably buoyant  - at times almost
complacent. It is partly because his colleagues like Mr Major's style. To
some, cabinet government may look like dithering; to insiders it is what one
likes to refer to as a 'gale of fresh air.' If polls are a guide, the voters
agree.
Ministers believe the government has absorbed not only everything it has
thrown at itself but also the best Labour can muster. The parties are neck
and neck now, but every extra point off mortgage rates should put two or
three points on the Tories' rating.
There is another reason why the prime minister will want to avoid soldiering
on until the bitter end. It is invariably overlooked.
The approaching public spending round is about to provide the first real
test of 'Majorism'. It will tell us whether he can, as promised, be tougher
than Mrs Thatcher on inflation, still deliver tax cuts, and yet give the
public sector enough money to provide a decent standard of services.
He could not have chosen a tougher year to try to square the circle. The
detailed figures, as always, are obscure, the more so because the switch
from local taxation to VAT has distorted the Treasury's cash planning
totals.
But the bottom line could not be more painfully clear. The rising
unemployment which comes with economic recession alongside public sector
wage deals reflecting last year's rather than this year's inflation rates
have wiped out most of the real growth built into the 1990 public spending
settlement.
The latest spending round  - its start has just been signalled by a lengthy
and gloomy Treasury sent to all the main spending departments - will be even
tougher than the last.
Public sector pay settlements averaging 8 per cent have bitten deeply into
the Treasury's contingency reserve for the current financial year. So too
has the sharp rise in unemployment, the Budget concession on child benefit
and a commitment to spend more on training.
Inflation in 1992 will be lower, but every extra pound spent this year
raises the base lines on which spending ministers predicate their bids for
extra cash in 1992/93.
At the department of health Mr William Waldegrave, can argue that his cash
allocation for next year implies at best a freeze and at worst a real cut in
NHS spending. With the NHS reforms likely to make cash shortages more
transparent, we can expect him to bid for an extra Pounds 2bn or so.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, never shy about asking for an extra several billion will
make a similar case at education. Mr Major has promised after all to raise
the status (that means pay) of career teachers. On the most optimistic
assumptions Mr Michael Heseltine will need Pounds 1.5bn to prevent the final
year of the poll tax from turning 1992 into the final year of the
government. It is not difficult to double that.
Back at the Treasury Mr Norman Lamont is looking at a forecast Pounds 8bn
budget deficit which already looks optimistic. And he would, as he reminded
us the ther day, at least make a start on cutting taxes.
It is the sort of circle that Mr Major would do best to try squaring after
and not before a general election.

FT  25 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS bowed under the weight of sell orders ahead of today's annual
meeting and in reaction to a downgrading from US securities house Merrill
Lynch. For the current year Merrill has cut its profits forecast by Pounds
45m to Pounds 320m, increasing, among other things, its provision for
redundancy payments.
Bulls of the stock among the analysts rushed to its defence. They pointed
out that several brokers had already written in the Merrill forecasts. They
said that nerves ahead of the annual meeting were to be expected, given the
stop-start prospects for the company's new trading products since last
summer.
They conceded, however, that with much of the trading in the stock being
conducted in New York, a downgrading from a US broker would have significant
influence.
Reuters dropped 50 at one point before ending at 823p, a net decline of 42.
Trading was heavy for the stock, with 3.3m shares changing hands.
ECC weakens
Two apparently ill-conceived market stories took the spice out of the shares
of ECC, the industrial materials group, yesterday. After outperforming the
rest of the sector for the past month, the shares reacted nervously on hints
both of a rights issue and that a large line of stock was on offer. The
shares fell to 407p before closing 15 down on balance at 410p.
The rights issue speculation probably stemmed from the group's announced
intention to replace some short-term debt. ECC said last year, when
acquiring Georgia Kaolin, that part of the three-year multi-currency credit
facility of up to Dollars 600m necessary to fin-ance the deal would in due
course be put on a longer term basis in international capital markets.
ECC said it did not intend that such funding would be the subject of a
rights issue and, according to finance director Mr Robert Carlton-Porter
yesterday, that position has not changed.
Investigation into the stock-on-offer report revealed the presence of an
eager seller but not in the million-plus quantities suggested by the talk.
Cadbury Schweppes fell 10 to 370p as speculation continued that it was about
to issue a Pounds 400m convertible bond to fund a takeover of Dr
Pepper/7-up, the US soft drinks company. The shares refused to recover in
spite of the company once again ruling out any rights or bond issue.
Asda was a penny lower at 121p on turnover of 4.6m as the market waited for
the company's meetings with brokers which begin today. There has been
widespread speculation that brokers will lower their forecasts after the
meetings.
Argyll dipped 3 to 300p after reports that analysts at some leading
investment institutions had visited the company, while Unilever shed 3 to
758p ahead of its quarterly figures expected on May 17.
SG Warburg added its voice to the chorus of analysts saying that Glaxo
should be bought. Warburg, the company's broker, published a comprehensive
review of Glaxo's products. It was particularly positive on asthma
treatments, where it said that within five years revenues should exceed
those from Glaxo's best selling Zantac drug.
SmithKline Beecham continued to suffer from recent 'take profits' advice.
The shares briefly dipped below Pounds 8 before ending at 807p, a net 10
easier.
ICI weakened again in nervous trading ahead of today's first-quarter
results. Sentiment was not helped by vague talk that the company would
announce a rights issue and maybe a deal to buy a stake in Wellcome - not an
idea new to the market. Level headed traders disbelieved this theory, and
pointed to Wellcome's relatively steady performance yesterday in quiet
trading. ICI, 18 off at one stage, ended 13 down on balance at 1070p.
Wellcome eased 3 to 527p.
Legal &amp; General retreated 13 to 438p on 1.7m, upset by downgradings from a
number of broking firms. London and Manchester was slightly easier at 337p
after new business figures described as disappointing by one trader.
A number of downgrades kept the composite insurances under persistent
pressure. Analysts are now expecting all the big five composites to show
losses for the current year.
General Accident and Guardian Royal are expected to record losses of around
Pounds 100m, Royals some Pounds 90m, Sun Alliance Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m
and Commercial Union around Pounds 30m. The biggest turnover, 3.5m, was in
Guardian Royal, 4 off at 204p, while Royals dipped 7 to 449p, General
Accident 5 to 532p and Sun Alliance 3 to 363p.
Some keen two-way interest was shown in Amstrad, which settled unchanged on
the day at 76p, having eased earlier in the session. The early uncertainty
came as Kleinwort Benson downgraded its profits estimates for the group. For
this year Kleinwort has cut its forecast from Pounds 44m to Pounds 36m and
for next year it has moved from Pounds 60m to Pounds 55m.
Ms Judy Stewart at Kleinwort said the lower forecast followed on from a
number of bearish signs in the computer industry.
It was also pointed out that Amstrad had been selling significant amounts of
stock in Micron, the computer chip manufacturer, where some 3.5m shares were
acquired in October 1988. Amstrad said it had sold 2.2m of these shares.
James Capel, Amstrad's broker, is believed to have downgraded the stock.
Wardle Storeys began to reap the rewards of a series of presentations hosted
by Smith New Court to Scottish investment institutions. Smith believes there
is a more realistic air about the company these days and, in spite of the
downturn, a more robust feel about the potential. The shares bounced 11 to
309p.
Negative comment on the refinancing exercise caused investors to have second
thoughts about Cannon Street Investments and the shares consequently gave
back part of Tuesday's sharp rise to close 12 down at 112p.
Morgan Crucible regained some of the ground lost since last week's rights
issue announcement, ending 8 better at 241p.
Fears that Vickers may tell today's annual meeting of falling sales for
Rolls-Royce cars and warn about profits from the luxury car division put the
shares down 6 more to 211p.
Aerospace Engineering moved ahead 5 to 54p after favourable comment.
Ibex Holdings, the recruitment consultancy and employment agency, plunged 7
to 11p on news that a bid may be made at a level 'materially lower' than the
current market price.
Motor distributor Jessups dropped 9 to 46p after revealing losses and a
dividend cut at the half-way stage.
Investors continued to favour Betterware Consumer Products and, in thin
trading, the price advanced 15 further to the highest level this year of
227p. The annual results are expected in June.
The recent rise in oil shares, stimulated by higher crude prices and the
strength of the dollar, was reversed yesterday. The appearance of a number
of big institutional sellers accompanied a decline in oil prices and a hefty
profits downgrade in BP by Strauss Turnbull, one of the market's big bears
of the oil sector.
Mr John Toalster, oil sector guru at Strauss, cut his current year net
income forecast for BP from Pounds 960m to Pounds 700m and said the group
may well struggle to achieve this figure.
He estimated that BP's first-quarter income, due to be announced on May 9,
would show a loss of Pounds 125m. Mr Toalster said BP would be hard pressed
to pay a forecast increase of 4.8 per cent in its final dividend this year.
Some big selling, much of it by Strauss clients, left BP 4 1/2 off at 349
1/2 p on turnover of 7.6m shares. Shell, where turnover was a more sedate
4.1m, settled 3 easier at 521p.
In a quiet property sector, Brixton Estates climbed 13 to 174p after
publishing results at the top end of analysts' expectations. Full year
profits were more than 15 per cent better at Pounds 23.6m and traders were
impressed by the published net asset value and the dividend increase.
Traders said a cross of 450,000 Percy Bilton shares took place at 404p. It
left the stock 14 down at 394p.
The current series of presentations by Rank Organisation to brokers
generated yet another change of forecast. Hoare Govett trimmed its profits
prediction for 1991 from Pounds 318m to Pounds 305m. The stock lost 19 to
727p in good volume.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Lockheed team rise after
record order for fighters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SPORADIC buying of blue chips and weaker bond rates helped the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to move higher yesterday, although the broader market
remained subdued, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow closed 19.06 up at 2,949.51. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index,
regarded as a better measure of overall market performance, improved only
1.00 to 382.76. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks continued
its recent recovery, rising 2.37 to 498.45.
New York SE turnover was again modest, amounting to 167m shares, while
advancing issues narrowly outpaced declines by 842 to 727.
Analysts expect the market to trade in a narrow range either side of its
present levels, with 2,920 the likely floor on the Dow and 3,000 the
ceiling. Although prices were helped yesterday by a fall in yields on
government bonds, some analysts are worried that the number of market bulls
 -investors who expect prices to continue rising - remains high. This is
often a sign that prices have peaked and sentiment is about to turn.
Defence shares were in the limelight after the US Air Force awarded the
largest contract ever in the defence industry's history to a team led by
Lockheed, to build a new generation of fighter aircraft. The Pentagon is
expected to order 650 fighters to be built, valued at a total of Dollars
95bn. Lockheed's partners are Boeing, General Dynamics and United
Technologies.
The news lifted Lockheed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 on turnover of 2.5m,
Boeing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 , United Technologies Dollars 1 to
Dollars 46 1/8 and General Dynamics Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 . Shares
in the two companies which lost in the five-year competition for the fighter
contract fell sharply. Northrop dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 and
McDonnell Douglas Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 .
Goodyear put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 in spite of reporting a 7.2
per cent decline in worldwide sales in the first quarter and a net loss of
Dollars 90m, mostly due to a Dollars 65m charge against earnings. The shares
rose because the bad news had been discounted.
Fleet/Norstar, the Maine-based bank, continued to benefit from news of its
takeover of the failed Bank of New England, adding Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars
23 1/8 .
Procter &amp; Gamble unveiled a meagre 1.8 per cent rise in earnings per share
for the first quarter, news which pushed the consumer product group's stock
Dollars  7/8 lower to Dollars 84.
NCR moved Dollars 1 1/2 higher to Dollars 103 3/8 on hopes that the computer
group would shortly reach an agreement with AT&amp;T, the telecommunications
giant, ending a five-month long takeover battle. AT&amp;T rose Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 37 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq, the ADRs of Reuters, the UK information group, weakened
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 42 on turnover of 2.2m shares after a Merrill Lynch
analyst in London cut his investment rating on the stock ahead of the
group's annual meeting to be held tomorrow.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed after trading in a thin range throughout the
session.
The composite index inched up 1.7 to 3,504.1, although falls held an edge
over rises by 284 to 271. Volume was a light 21.5m shares.
Canada's leading banks cut their prime rates, but investors are still
waiting for a monetary policy switch by the US Federal Reserve. Some
investors are worried about the Ontario budget to be unveiled on Monday, the
first by the province's socialist government.

FT  25 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar up despite intervention
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rallied yester-day in spite of a second day of co-ordinated
intervention by European central banks. Demand for the US currency increased
as the market continued to take an unfavourable view of the D-Mark. Other
European currencies, such as sterling, did not provide any great attraction,
but the yen was relatively steady.
The German Bundesbank led co-ordinated intervention by European central
banks, selling the dollar at around DM1.7450, but by the end of the day it
had failed to hold it below DM1.7500. By the time trading closed in Europe
there was no sign of the US Federal Reserve joining the action of other
central banks. The Bank of Japan has also stayed out of the market so far
this week, reflecting the better performance of the yen, in comparison with
European currencies.
There was no important US economic news yesterday, leaving the market to
wait for tomorrow's data on US gross national product, and for any official
reaction to the dollar's recent advance from this weekend's Washington
meeting of ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
US GNP figures for the first quarter are expected to be weaker than the 1990
fourth- quarter decline of 1.6 per cent. Economists are looking for a fall
of about 2.5 per cent, amid suggestions that this may mark a low point in
the current recession. The figures will be closely analysed for signs of
economic recovery and, therefore, could have a significant effect on the
dollar.
At the same time, there is likely to be caution ahead of the G-7 meeting for
fear of moves aimed at preventing another surge by the dollar.
At last night's close in London the dollar was up to DM1.7535 from DM1.7420;
to Y138.05 from Y137.90; to SFr1.4715 from SFr1.4590; and to FFr5.9125 from
FFr5.8750.
The D-Mark continued its recent decline against the Japanese yen, slipping
in London to Y78.70 from Y79.15. Concern about the economic situation in
Germany, following unification, and political unrest in the Soviet Union
weighed on the German currency, keeping it among the weaker members of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Sterling weakened in the ERM, but remained the third strongest currency,
behind the Spanish peseta and Italian lira. The pound lost 1.70 cents to
Dollars 1.6945. It also fell to DM2.9725 from DM2.9825; to FFr10.0175 from
FFr10.0550; to SFr2.4925 from SFr2.4975; and to Y234.00 from Y236.00.
Sterling's index shed 0.5 to 91.2. In New York the pound recovered 70 points
to finish at Dollars 1.7015.
The French franc, weakest member of the ERM, was little moved by news that
France's trade deficit in March widened to FFr4.70bn from February's
FFr3.48bn.
In the FT Guide to World Currencies table on Tuesday, the exchange rate for
the Italian lira should have been: sterling 2206.50, US dollar 1303.69,
D-Mark 737.96 and yen 934.96.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: SEC eases rules on foreign
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday offered a partial
exemption from some of its anti-manipulation rules to foreign issuers of
private placements and rights offerings.
The decision should make it easier for overseas companies to attract US
investors when issuing stock in the US, say industry observers. In the past,
foreign issuers and underwriters have been reluctant to make portions of an
issue available to US investors because it would mean operating under much
tighter SEC regulations.
In particular, the SEC forbids the underwriters and issuers of an offering
from trading the securities while an issue is in progress, a rule intended
to prevent the price of an issue from being unfairly inflated.
In some cases this has dissuaded issuers from offering stock in the US, and
in others it has forced issuers to seek special exemption from the SEC, as
was the case with UK privatisation issues.
Yesterday's decision means issuers will now be granted a blanket exemption.
However, in order to qualify issuers will have to have been in operation for
over three years, and must limit their offerings to institutional investors.

FT  25 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Strong demand pushes gilt auction to
success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's first gilt auction in nearly three years was hailed as
a resounding success yesterday. The full amount of Pounds 1.2bn of 10 per
cent Conversion stock 1996 was gobbled up by the market amid signs of strong
demand for the stock.
The Bank of England received bids of Pounds 5.375bn for a total of Pounds
1.2bn in stock, so the issue was covered 4.45 times.
The highest accepted bid was Pounds 98 21/32 , corresponding to a yield of
10.32 per cent, while the lowest accepted bid was for Pounds 98 17/32 ,
corresponding to a yield of 10.35 per cent. The rounded average accepted
price was Pounds 98 9/16 , corresponding to a yield of 10.34 per cent.
Traders said the short 'tail' and the high cover were signs that the auction
was a roaring success. The tail - which is the difference between the
average yield and the yield corresponding to the lowest price - was only one
basis point.
The Bank of England said bids at the lowest accepted price were allotted
46.5 per cent of the amount for which they applied.
The when-issued stock opened at Pounds 48 5/8 , only a couple of ticks above
the average bid price when bidding took place, and was trading at Pounds 48
3/4 by late morning, equivalent to a fully paid-up price of Pounds 98 3/4 .
Demand came mainly from domestic buyers, traders said.
The Bank of England is expected to hold a further two or three auctions this
year.
Otherwise, the gilts market drifted up during the day, but volumes were low.
German bund prices edged up in the morning but slipped back again later.
A statement from Bundesbank board member Mr Otmar Issing, quoted in a German
magazine, did little to reassure the market. Mr Issing said the Bundesbank
would do everything it could to keep the D-Mark stable, but recognised that
the impact of foreign exchange intervention was limited.
Yesterday's auction of Japanese Government Bonds was well received, dealers
said. The auction was for Y800bn of the No 140 ten-year bond with a coupon
of 6.6 per cent. The average price was 100.38, corresponding to a yield of
6.537 per cent while the lowest accepted bid was for 100.30, corresponding
to a yield of 6.55 per cent. The short tail was seen as a sign of strong
retail demand, traders said.
Otherwise, prices in the market slipped during the day with the yield on the
benchmark No 129 bond moving from 6.7 per cent in the morning to close at
6.74 per cent.
US government bond prices firmed in late trading yesterday following a
successful auction of two-year notes and some weak car sales figures from US
manufacturers.
By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was up  19/32 at 96
3/16 , to yield 8.212 per cent, while the two year note was up  1/8 at 100
9/32 , carrying a yield of 6.946 per cent.
Although there were some worries over the market's ability to absorb the
additional supply in the two-year note auction, the sale passed off
smoothly.
The market was also buoyed by the mid-April car sales figures from the
country's big makers. Analysts were looking for the figures to show annual
sales running at 6m cars, up from 5.6m in early April, and based on initial
reports from General Motors and Ford, sales in the period were below that.

that they inform each other more about their borrowing plans in Ecu, so as
to avoid a repeat of the recent flood of Ecu paper by sovereign borrowers.
At its weekly meeting, the 17-member EC executive body yesterday approved a
communication to the EC Council of Ministers suggesting that sovereign
issuers of Ecu bonds should establish an informal network, and more formal
meetings once or twice a year, to put a little more order into the market.
In the second two weeks of February there were 10 Ecu bond issues, totalling
Ecu 8.75bn, or equivalent to one third of all borrowing done in the
composite currency in the whole of 1990. The Commission notes that 90 per
cent of these bonds, Ecu 7.9bn to be precise, were issued by EC
member-states or Community institutions.
The Commission felt itself somewhat caught in the Ecu rush when it found
financial institutions temporarily reluctant to subscribe to the Ecu 1bn it
raised earlier this year as a first loan tranche for Greece.
EC officials say there is a group of government borrowers that occasionally
meets under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD).
But its membership and scope of interest is too wide to focus on the Ecu, in
which Brussels takes a particularly paternal interest as the future single
money of the Community.
'It is surprising to learn that the people in the Bank of England borrowing
Ecus for the UK Treasury don't know the names and telephone numbers of their
counterparts in the Banque de France,' said one official.
For rather different reasons, the committee of EC central bank governors,
headed by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, has been studying why the Ecu has acquired a
premium in the market over the collective value of its individual
components. EC officials explain that while the premium may be small - still
under 1 per cent - its existence is a source of particular concern to
Germany, which opposes any parallel currency.
'The more the Ecu takes on a role independent of its own basket definition,
the more it looks like a currency,' said one EC official. Mr Pohl is also
head of the Bundesbank.

<TEXT>
BULL, the French state-owned computer maker, expects to complete within
weeks its long-expected share exchange with NEC, the Japanese electronics
group.
A Bull official confirmed last night that the group is negotiating a
straight share swap with NEC, under which the Japanese company would take a
5 per cent stake in the loss-making French group. This would be in exchange
for NEC's 15 per cent stake in Bull HN, a subsidiary of the French group
embracing most of its US and Pacific operations.
This is the first time Bull has revealed the precise size of the stake on
offer to NEC, which is also likely to take a seat on the board. The share
swap will accompany a wholesale re-organisation of the cumbersomely
structured group, in which Mr Francis Lorentz, the chairman, has said he
aims to merge Bull's four operating units into a single organisation by the
early summer, in an attempt to curb costs and increase efficiency.
Bull officials say the deal could be completed in the next 30 days.
The deal is likely to be greeted with relief by the French government, which
for all its reservations on Japanese competition is keen to find a private
partner for Bull.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Du Pont turns in profits down by
4% for quarter

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the biggest US chemical company, yesterday turned in first-quarter
earnings that were slightly better than expected due to strong gains from
its petroleum business which offset the erosion in earnings from core fibres
and plastics operations.
Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell 4 per cent to Dollars
590m, or 88 cents a share, from Dollars 615m, or 90 cents, a year earlier.
The 1990 earnings included a one-time charge of 6 cents a share.
Strong petroleum sales spurred a 3 per cent improvement in Du Pont's overall
sales in the first quarter to Dollars 9.7bn from Dollars 9.4bn while the
petroleum business recorded sales of Dollars 4.06bn, up 15 per cent in the
quarter.
However, Du Pont said combined sales from other segments fell 2 per cent in
the first three months of 1991, reflecting a 6 per cent decline in US
volume.
On Wall Street, Du Pont's shares had added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 by the
close of trading.
Strong margins for refined products and higher prices and volumes for crude
oil and natural gas contributed to a 63 per cent improvement in earnings
from Du Pont's petroleum business in the three months, to Dollars 322m from
Dollars 197m.
Du Pont's results underscored the importance of a diverse earnings base to
companies operating in the cyclical chemicals industry. Monsanto, one of the
more diversified US chemicals companies, posted a 14 per cent drop in
first-quarter net to Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.31 a share, on revenues
which fell 3 per cent to Dollars 2.22bn.
Du Pont's chemicals business recorded after-tax operating income of Dollars
78m, against Dollars 129m in the first quarter of 1990. The 1991 figures
include an Dollars 18m charge associated with Du Pont's partial withdrawal
from the freon manufacturing business. Earnings were also hurt by higher
costs for developing alternatives to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and falling
demand for CFC products.
Income from Du Pont's fibres business dropped 17 per cent to Dollars 85m,
including one-time charges of Dollars 27m.
In Du Pont's polymers business, the impact of the slowdown in the North
American vehicle and construction industries was partly offset by improved
results in Europe. After-tax income from the polymers segment fell 17 per
cent to Dollars 68m from Dollars 82m.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the largest US brewer, has weathered both the recession and
a rise in federal excise tax to post a 10.1 per cent improvement in
first-quarter profits, at Dollars 200.9m after tax.
During the three months to the end of March, Anheuser's sales rose by 6.2
per cent to Dollars 2.92bn. Earnings per share were up to 70 cents from 64
cents.
The St Louis-based group sold 20.4m barrels of beer to wholesalers, up by
1.4 per cent on the 20.1m sold in the same period a year earlier.
However, it said sales from wholesalers to retailers were lower in the first
quarter, because of the build-up in stocks which occurred at the end of
1990.
From the start of 1991, the increase in federal excise tax took effect,
causing the price of beer to increase by about 10 per cent, according to
Anheuser.
The beer giant said it reckoned that about 1.2m barrels of industry sales
were switched from the first quarter of 1991 to the last quarter of 1990 as
a result.
'Industry sales for the first quarter are expected to be down by
approximately 5 per cent,' said Anheuser, although it claimed that its
market share had improved by about 1 to 2 per cent.
Elsewhere, the Campbell Taggart food subsidiary - whose products range from
bread to frozen dinners - saw first-quarter profits increase, thanks to the
contribution from international operations, higher volumes and improved
margins.
Results at the can manufacturing interests also improved, but Anheuser said
theme parks nationwide had been affected by the decline in tourist travel
and warned that the weak economy might continue to hit these interests in
1991.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Authorities seize stocks of P&amp;G
orange juice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE that the US authorities are determined to get tougher on food
labelling standards emerged yesterday as the Food and Drug Administration
moved to seize stockpiles of orange juice produced by Procter &amp; Gamble
(P&amp;G), the large US consumer products group.
The action by the FDA is unusual, and comes in the wake of heavy political
debate over food labelling in the United States.
The FDA said yesterday it had warned manufacturers in February that, while
new regulations are being drawn up, it was prepared to bring enforcement
actions.
In this case, the FDA's action stemmed from controversy over the labelling
of P&amp;G's 'Citrus Hill Fresh Choice' brand. The FDA, in a complaint filed in
the Minneapolis courts, said the use of terms like 'fresh choice', 'pure
squeezed', '100 per cent orange juice', '100 per cent pure', and 'fresh'
were false and misleading on orange juice products made from concentrate.
This, however, is denied by P&amp;G. The consumer products company yesterday
insisted its Citrus Hill packages were 'properly labelled', and claimed to
have 'strong consumer evidence to support this'. P&amp;G also said that, apart
from the stockpiles subject to the enforcement action, it did not expect
production and supplies of the juice to be disrupted.
Neither the FDA nor the company had any immediate information about the
amount of juice which is subject to seizure. It is believed to be stored in
a warehouse in suburban Minneapolis, and will be held off the market until
the labelling issue is resolved.
P&amp;G claimed there 'has been lack of clarity' on the use of the term 'fresh'
on food packaging, and said it had expected this issue to be addressed
through new and clearer rules.
FDA officials, however, suggested that its established position was that
heated or chemically processed products should not be described as fresh. It
said that it hoped new draft regulations, defining some of the contentious
terms like 'fresh' or 'light", should be ready by November.
P&amp;G yesterday reported a 5 per cent increase in net profits in its third
quarter to the end of March, at Dollars 424m after tax. Sales rose by 11 per
cent to Dollars 6.8bn, but fully-diluted earnings per share gained only 0.9
per cent, at Dollars 1.09.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Sales decline at Goodyear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last surviving big US tyre-maker, yesterday
unveiled a considerable first-quarter net loss on declining sales.
The Ohio-based company had warned it would post a first-quarter loss, and
shares in the company added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 by the close on
the New York Stock Exchange.
The company, which has cut jobs, restructured and slashed its dividend in a
bid to return to profitability, expects to be back in the black in the
second quarter if the economy in North America improves.
But Goodyear's problems run deeper than the recession and decline in vehicle
production.
The company is struggling under the burden of its disastrous Dollars 1.6bn
investment in the All American Pipeline, an oil pipeline from California to
Texas that is operating at only a fraction of capacity and has had to be
written down. Goodyear expects these operations to eat into earnings for at
least two years.
Stripping out extraordinary items, Goodyear suffered a loss of Dollars 30.4,
or 52 cents a share, in the first three months of 1991, against profits of
Dollars 16.5m, or 29 cents, a year earlier.
In the 1991 quarter, Goodyear took a one-off, after-tax charge of Dollars
59.7m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, related to job cuts and the discontinuation
of its efforts to establish a tyre factory in South Korea. In the 1990
quarter, the company had extraordinary gains of Dollars 4.4m, or 7 cents a
share.
Including the one-time items, Goodyear's net loss for the 1991 quarter was
Dollars 90.1m, or Dollars 1.54, against net income of Dollars 20.9m, or 36
cents a share.
The company said the downturn in the tyre and rubber industry reduced
first-quarter worldwide sales by 7.2 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn.
In the US, operating income dropped to Dollars 30.1m from Dollars 82.8m a
year ago, partly reflecting unusual charges of Dollars 34m in the 1991
quarter.
Sales fell 9.5 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn.
Weak demand reduced Goodyear's tyre sales by 7.5 per cent. Operating income
fell to Dollars 62.8m, including one-time charges of Dollars 46.9m, from
Dollars 129.9m.
The company's oil transportation business extended its operating loss to
Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 14.6m, reflecting losses on oil sales in spite of
reduced operating expenses.

Black &amp; Decker, the home appliances and power tools maker, saw its

Revenues rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Product sales dipped by 7 per

</HEADLINE>

Bombardier, the aerospace group which owns Short Brothers of Belfast and
Learjet in the US, unveiled profit in line with analysts' estimates for
fiscal 1991. Sales were up 35 per cent.
For the 12 months ended January 31, net profit was CDollars 100.1m
(USDollars 86m), or CDollars 1.41 a share, up from CDollars 91.5m, or
CDollars 1.36, in fiscal 1990.
Sales were CDollars 2.83bn against CDollars 2.1bn.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 33.3m, or 46 cents a share, against
CDollars 30.3m, or 45 cents, a year earlier, but sales were down to CDollars
802m against CDollars 837m.
The gain in 1991 sales was due to inclusion of Short Bros and ANF Industrie
for the full year, against only four months in fiscal 1990.

<TEXT>
NEWMONT Mining, the US natural resources company in which financier Sir
James Goldsmith holds a 42 per cent stake, yesterday turned in a 12 per cent
decline in first-quarter net income from continuing operations on sales
which fell 9 per cent, writes Karen Zagor.
For the three months ended March 31, Newmont had net income of Dollars
37.4m, or 55 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 151.3m against Dollars
57.4m, or 85 cents, on sales of Dollars 165.5m a year ago. The 1990 earnings
were distorted by income from discontinued operations of Dollars 14.7m, or
22 cents a share, and a one-off after-tax gain of Dollars 10.4m, or 16
cents.
Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 37.4m in the 1991 quarter
compared with Dollars 42.7m a year earlier, including the Dollars 10.8m
extraordinary gain.
During the first three months of 1991, the average price Newmont received
for gold fell to Dollars 401 an ounce from Dollars 414 an ounce a year
earlier.
Newmont Mining's 90.1 per cent interest in Newmont Gold contributed Dollars
36.2m in pre-tax income, down 23 per cent from Dollars 46.8m the year
before. Newmont Gold received an average of Dollars 373 an ounce for gold in
the latest quarter compared with Dollars 404 a year earlier.

Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GOTHENBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish auto group, is facing 'two extremely difficult years' as
severe competition and depressed margins in its key markets of the US,
Britain and Sweden take their toll, Mr Christer Zetterberg, chief executive,
said yesterday.
The company, the largest in Scandinavia, also announced its first joint
project with Renault, the French auto group, with which it formed a
strategic allegiance last year. The agreement covers the manufacture and
delivery of car engines.
Volvo's policy is not to give financial forecasts. However, Mr Zetterberg's
gloom at the annual shareholders' meeting suggests the company faces
difficult times as it struggles to recover from problems that resulted in a
SKr1.03bn (Dollars 166m) loss last year.
He disclosed the company was set to reduce its costs by a further SKr2bn
next year after this year's SKr3bn savings through rationalisation and
efficiency improvements, mainly in car production. This will involve a 7,000
cut in jobs from the company's 68,000-strong workforce by the third quarter
of 1992. Some 5,000 of these will be in Sweden, where an estimated 69 per
cent of Volvo's employees work.
Mr Zetterberg stressed that Volvo had enough financial resources to cushion
itself against adversity. He said its stock portfolio was worth more than
SKr25bn - SKr10bn more than Volvo's acquisition value.
The agreement with Renault promises to be the first of many joint projects
between the two companies. It covers deliveries of gasoline-powered car
engines from Volvo to Renault from the beginning of 1993. Deliveries during
the first period will be valued at SKr2.5bn. In return, Volvo cars are to be
equipped with diesel engines supplied by Renault.
New calculations suggest that co-operation with Renault could save Volvo
more than SKr800m a year for the next two to five years.

previously. Earnings per share fell to 0.19p (0.4p).
Aran also announced yesterday that it has raised its interest in the Alba
oil field from 3 per cent to 5 per cent through an assets swap with Conoco,
plus payment by the latter of Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.34m).
During 1990 a rights issue to raise some IPounds 37.4m was made to fund
exploration activities.

In spite of the recent gloom in the high street, Shani Group, the USM-quoted
company which manufactures and supplies womens' and children's wear,
yesterday reported a marginal increase in interim profits.
The outcome for the six months to end-January - Pounds 764,000 against

(Pounds 6.52m).
Mr Martin Hollis, chairman, said the performance reflected improved
manufacturing and operational efficiency.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p, payable from earnings of 3.5p

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Warning hits Jessups share price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Jessups tumbled by 9p to 46p yesterday after the Essex-based
vehicle distributor unveiled a first-half loss, a reduced interim dividend
and a warning on prospects for the second half.
According to Mr Alan Jessup, chairman, losses of Pounds 189,000 (profits
Pounds 975,000) for the half-year to end-February were attributable mainly
to a downturn in new vehicle sales to both the retail buyer and the
corporate sector. Profits at the operating level slumped from Pounds 2.81m
to Pounds 1.31m.
Turnover was relatively resilient at Pounds 44.98m (Pounds 48m) although the
effective decline in sales was masked by 'compensations from after-sales
activities'.
Losses per share worked through at 3.94p (earnings of 5p). The interim
dividend is cut to 1.5p (2.25p).

9.85m deal

<TEXT>
CENTRAL &amp; SHEERWOOD, the engineering group which last week requested a
temporary suspension of its shares, is to buy three companies in cash and
share transactions worth up to Pounds 9.85m.
The shares yesterday returned at 4p, a rise of  3/4 p from the suspension
level.
The deals will give Mr Geoffrey Robinson, who has been a C&amp;S director for
nearly four years and has close ties with all the purchased entities, a 28.1
per cent stake in the resulting company.
Interests associated with Mr Robert Maxwell, the media magnate, will hold
about 27.2 per cent of the shares, up from 20.7 per cent previously.
Mr Robinson, who becomes 'the driving force' behind C&amp;S, according to one
adviser, will also replace Mr Maxwell as chairman.
The acquired entities are Transfer Technology, an electronics group owned by
Mr Robinson, Lock International, a maker of metal detection equipment, and
Petroleum Seals and Systems, which manufactures industrial rubber products
and seals.
The deals will create a more broadly based engineering group, to be renamed
Transfer Technology Group.
C&amp;S will pay Pounds 1.7m in cash and will issue at least 235m new shares at
3p to buy the three companies.

The downturn in consumer spending, plus sharply higher interest charges,
pushed losses from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 823,000 at World of Leather, the
upholstered leather furniture retailer, in 1990.
Operating profits of Pounds 70,000 achieved in the previous year reversed
into losses of Pounds 187,000 in spite of increased turnover of Pounds
24.49m (Pounds 23.16m).
Net interest charges jumped to Pounds 636,000 (Pounds 158,000).
Group borrowings have risen to Pounds 3.25m since its net cash position
turned into a net debt position after the acquisition of seven leather
furniture stores in July 1989.
Losses per share were 10.5p (0.8p). There was no dividend payment for the
year (1.6p).

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Interest helps push Lilley down 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLEY, the Scotland-based construction and contracting group, yesterday
reported a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in 1990 after a sharp
increase in interest costs following its failure to take over fellow
construction and property group Tilbury last summer.
Taxable profits fell to Pounds 14.14m from Pounds 19.06m on sales up almost
10 per cent at Pounds 323.04m. Earnings per share fell to 7.99p (9.55p) but
the directors are recommending a maintained final dividend of 1.5p, for an
unchanged total of 2.5p.
The failed takeover left Lilley with a 29.9 per cent stake in Tilbury and
cost it Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 1.58m) in interest before the stake was sold in
November. The Pounds 8.41m loss on the sale appeared as an extraordinary
item.
Interest on ongoing activities also rose to Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 246,000),
largely because of the increased carrying cost of completed development
properties.
Debt fell to Pounds 31m (Pounds 48m) and gearing fell slightly from 114 to
98 per cent, excluding Pounds 17m of guaranteed debt relating to associated
company investments.
Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said the result was 'not unsatisfactory',
given the tough market conditions. The decline had resulted from the
property and housebuilding activities but sales and profits in the
construction-related operations had improved. The group had opened offices
in the Midlands and south of England and was well positioned to take
advantage of a turnround in the economy.
Currently Lilley has a land bank sufficient for four years. Mr Bob Rankin,
chief executive, said the company planned to cut this to two and a half
years, releasing about Pounds 10m of cash for debt repayment.
He also said that Lilley was well positioned on the contracting side because
it concentrated on small-sized 'bread and butter contracting' valued at less
than Pounds 1m.
COMMENT
Judging by the share price, the market views Lilley as something of a bad
penny. But like all coins it has two sides. Operationally, the contracting
side has consistently outperformed the sector in terms of margin. Small
acquisitions since last year when it failed to buy Tilbury have also
positioned it well geographically to take advantage of any upturn in the
economy. The problems lie in the balance sheet. Gearing down marginally at
98 per cent obscures at least Pounds 17m of off-balance sheet obligations
relating to its share of properties in associate companies. Not only do the
two largest properties remain unlet but interest that was capitalised before
their completion will now directly have an impact on revenue from associated
companies. Proposed asset sales will help, as will a reduction in the land
bank. Nevertheless brokers are forecasting Pounds 13m pre-tax profits for
this year, giving 6.3p of earnings and a prospective multiple of about 8.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Amstrad cuts Micron stake to raise Pounds
19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad, the UK electronics group, has sold part of its stake in Micron
Technology, reducing its holding in the US semiconductor manufacturer from 9
to 3.7 per cent.
Amstrad said that the sale raised Pounds 19.1m. Amstrad bought its stake in
1988 for Pounds 45m. Last year the UK company recorded an extraordinary
charge of Pounds 17.4m to account for the fall in value of its Micron
shares.
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad chairman, said two years ago that the investment had
been 'a lousy deal'. He said last month that he intended eventually to
dispose of the entire Micron stake. Mr Sugar said the reason for the sale
was: 'Cash, me old mate. Dosh.'
Amstrad's taxable profits for the first half of 1990-91 rose 33 per cent to
Pounds 40.1m. But Mr Sugar has warned that the company will do well to make
a profit in the second half.
Amstrad bought the Micron stake to ensure a reliable supply of dynamic
random access memory (D-Ram) chips, used in the manufacture of its
computers. Mr Sugar has since concluded agreements with several
semiconductor companies and believes Amstrad will have no difficulty buying
the chips it needs.

Anglo Scandinavian Investment Trust, which already owns 27.5 per cent, has
launched an Pounds 8.4m bid for fellow trust Lancashire &amp; London, which is
linked to several companies associated with the family of Sir Walter
Salomon, writes Philip Coggan.
The bid follows skirmishes in which Anglo attempted to install its own
managers, SG Investment Management, at Lancashire &amp; London.
The bid offers cash equivalent to Formula Asset Value (FAV), subject to a
minimum of 100.75p. Anglo said yesterday that the current FAV would be
104.75p, compared with the net asset value of Lancashire &amp; London of
106.25p. There is also a debenture stock alternative to the cash offer.

<TEXT>
TACE, the environmental control equipment group where a revolt by
institutions last year removed founder chairman Mr Jock Mackenzie, was
yesterday further shaken by the resignations of Mr Michael Beckett from the
board and Hoare Govett as the company's broker.
Sir David Nicholson succeeded Mr Mackenzie as chairman against the wishes of
the institutions who had wanted Mr Beckett to head the board.
Mr Beckett is understood to have clashed with Sir David over group strategy
but was not available for comment.
Less than a month ago Mr Beckett brought Hoare Govett on board as Tace's
brokers ahead of an anticipated reorganisation of the company's capital
structure. Previously Smith New Court was broker both to Tace and Goring
Kerr, its 51 per cent controlled process control equipment affiliate.
Hoare Govett appears to have been reluctant to continue as broker when its
advice was being ignored and would have stayed on had Mr Beckett remained on
the board.
The capital restructuring is likely to require each company to have
different brokers to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
Yesterday, Tace said its planned to close its London head office from which
Mr Mackenzie ran the business and will be moving to the head office of
Goring Kerr in Windsor. The move will save Pounds 750,000 a year.

FT  25 APR 91 / Olivetti suspends dividend as net profits fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office-equipment group, suffered a
severe fall in net profits last year to L60.4bn (Pounds 27.36m) from
L202.8bn in 1989. It is suspending the dividend on its ordinary shares.
The fall in profits, in line with the forecast made by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, earlier this year, reflects pressures facing
Europe's computer manufacturers.
The company blamed currency factors and a sharp fall in demand in Europe and
the US for the decline in earnings. It said it would pay a dividend of L70
and L125 a share on its preference and savings shares, respectively.
Olivetti is obliged to pay a minimum 12.5 per cent return on the L1,000
nominal value of its savings shares.
Mr Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director, said sales in the first
four months of this year were down 4 per cent compared with the same period
in 1990. Turnover last year was L9,037bn against L9,031bn in 1989.
Olivetti's ordinary shares fell by L101 to L3,769 at yesterday's Milan
fixing, which took place before the results were announced. Savings shares
declined L65 to L2,780.
Mr Albert Alonzo, an Italian market analyst at Nomura, said the fall in
profits was in line with expectations, while the share price had already
discounted the earnings announcement.
'There's no room for a dividend when you're asking for financial support
from the government', he said. Earlier this year Olivetti reached agreement
with the government and unions on a package of job cuts and early retirement
involving 7,000 workers.
The restructuring costs for the layoffs resulted in a net extraordinary
charge of L50bn against Olivetti's 1990 pre-tax profits, which fell to
L124bn from L355bn in 1989.
Analysts believe Olivetti has had some flexibility in accounting for job
cuts announced last November. However, it says it has absorbed the full cost
on the 1990 accounts. Olivetti said sales, administrative and general costs
last year had been kept in line with 1989. Nevertheless, net indebtedness
surged to L744.5bn from L406.6bn in 1989.
Prospects for the current year would be overshadowed by increasingly
unpredictable and uncertain market conditions, according to Mr De Benedetti.
'In this uncertain context, it is necessary to reduce structural costs and
to rationalise production activities', he said.

FT  25 APR 91 / Maxwell warns on MCC result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAXWELL Communication Corporation, the media conglomerate founded by the
flamboyant newspaper publisher, Mr Robert Maxwell, yesterday issued a
profits warning to investors.
The warning, which was included in a shareholders' circular on the sale of
Pergamon Press, the scientific publishing company, comes at an eventful time
even by the standards of the ebullient Mr Maxwell.
Last week the controversial publisher launched a lavish marketing campaign
for the forthcoming Pounds 500m stock market flotation of Mirror Group
Newspapers - of which he is chairman. Last month he announced he was
relinquishing the role of chairman of MCC to concentrate on the relaunch of
the New York Daily News, the ailing US tabloid newspaper which he rescued
earlier this year.
MCC has warned investors that profits for the last financial year to March
31 would be lower than in the previous year when it made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 172.3m on turnover of Pounds 1.24bn.
The group attributed the fall in profits to its unexpectedly slow progress
in making disposals. MCC has been trying to reduce its debt through the
disposal programme. This has been hindered by the impact of the US and UK
economic recessions on the international publishing industry.
MCC had originally hoped to reduce its debt by Dollars 750m (Pounds 441m) by
the end of the last financial year. However, it said the 'present economic
climate' was 'not conducive to significant disposals of media businesses'.
It added that it had refused to make disposals at 'other than satisfactory
prices'.
The group recently succeeded in selling Pergamon - the heart of Mr Maxwell's
original business which is based in the grounds of his Oxford home - to
Elsevier, the Dutch publishing group, for Pounds 446m. However, that sale
came too late to affect its 1990-91 results and will be included in MCC's
interim results.
MCC said it was 'confident of a strong profit performance' from its
companies in the current financial year and expressed its 'confidence' about
the future. It said it intended to complete further disposals 'at
satisfactory prices' to cut its debt 'as soon as possible'. Mr Maxwell will
step down as MCC chairman after the Mirror Group flotation.

FT  25 APR 91 / Bonn stands firm against rate cuts: Pohl will resist
pressure from US at G7's Washington meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY will resist calls from the US to cut interest rates at Sunday's
meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Washington,
according to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president.
In an interview with the Financial Times at the central bank's headquarters
in Frankfurt, Mr Pohl said: 'A cut in interest rates in Germany is not on
the agenda. Calls for Germany to cut interest rates are, from our point of
view, difficult to understand. Other countries, for instance in the European
Monetary System, are making use of the relative weakness of the D-Mark to
cut their own interest rates without our having to do so.'
Mr Pohl, a pivotal figure in negotiations on European monetary integration,
welcomed Tuesday's proposal from Luxembourg to set up a European central
bank during the transition to monetary union, but to delay its creation
until 1996.
'This suggestion goes in the right direction, but we will have to study it
carefully before coming to a final judgment.'
Adding an important refinement to the Bundesbank's thinking on a European
central bank, he said: 'It is important that a decision on setting up a
European central bank is not taken until it is clear which countries are
willing to transfer their monetary policy powers to this institution.'
Once this had become clear, Mr Pohl said, 'a European central bank could be
set up two years before it would actually become fully operational, to allow
the necessary time for preparation'.
Commenting on the interest rate controversy, where Mr Nicholas Brady, the US
treasury secretary, has urged Germany to ease policies in recent informal
meetings, Mr Pohl declared: 'German monetary policy has to remain tight'.
The issue is expected to surface during the G7 meeting of finance ministers
and central bankers from the US, UK, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and
Germany.
The US calls have been part of Washington's effort to damp the risk of
worldwide recession. However, Mr Pohl pointed out that parts of the west
German economy were experiencing overheating. Recalling west Germany's
strong growth of 4.5 per cent last year and still-low inflation of 2.5 per
cent, he said: 'The position of the German economy as seen abroad has been
made worse than we deserve. East Germany is an enormous problem, but the
situation in west Germany is basically very satisfactory'.
Easing monetary reins could prove counter-productive as it might weaken
confidence in the D-Mark, he said. 'If we followed an easier policy, and
this had an effect on the D-Mark, the result would be that German interest
rates would not be lower, but higher.'
Mr Pohl, who in unguarded comments last month called the aftermath of German
monetary union a 'disaster', said: 'The situation in east Germany was
portrayed by the government (in Bonn) rather too favourably last year. Now
comes the moment of truth.'
He suggested the Bonn government, through tax increases announced two months
ago, had reacted to the challenges somewhat late. 'Now, the best time to ask
people to make sacrifices is past. In calling for a greater national effort
the politicians could have been a bit more Churchillian.'
'Public sector transfers to east Germany this year will come to around
DM140bn (Pounds 48.2bn). Two-thirds of the gross national product in the
east effectively comes from the west. A lot of the transfers are financing
consumption - unemployment benefits, pensions etc - but there is an
increasing amount of investment too.'
Over the timing of eventual recovery east of the Elbe he said: 'There is not
much sense in trying to predict an end to the period of slump - it will
certainly last some time. But in east Germany they are now drawing the right
consequences from the fact that 80 per cent of the economy there is
uncompetitive. This means of course that a large number of lay-offs are
inevitable.'
INTERVENTION BY CENTRAL BANKS FAILS TO HELP D-MARK
Intervention by European central banks failed to reduce the value of the
dollar and support a sagging D-Mark, writes Peter Marsh. Eleven banks, led
by the German Bundesbank, sold dollars for the second day in an effort to
lift the D-Mark, which has been hit in recent weeks by worries about the
German economy. However, the effort was hampered by the lack of any sign
that the US Federal Reserve was joining the operation. The Fed is thought to
be disinclined to support the campaign, on the grounds that a strong dollar
may make it easier to cut US interest rates. In London, the dollar gained
more than 1 pfennig at DM1.7535 and its strength depressed sterling, which
closed at Dollars 1.6945, down by just under 1 cent. Against the D-Mark,
sterling lost 1 pfennig to DM2.9725. Later in New York, the D-Mark regained
some lost ground against the dollar to close at DM1.7465. Sterling also
strengthened to close at Dollars 1.7015.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parties clash over property tax bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES sought to reinvigorate their local election campaign yesterday
by provoking a battle of figures with Labour over the amounts households
will pay under the parties' poll tax alternatives.
The government focused on the gainers under the council tax plans amid moves
by ministers to restore party morale.
However, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, appeared to hint
that implementation of the tax could be later than the planned 1993 start
date. He said the timescale envisaged would mean taking the 'fast track'.
Labour quickly condemned the possibility of poll tax bills continuing for an
extra year.
Ministers reiterated their view that two thirds of households would gain
under the proposals. They attacked as 'bogus' Labour figures showing that
its own 'fair rates' plan would cost households Pounds 67 less on average.
Labour said its proposals would mean an average of Pounds 333 compared with
Pounds 400 under the government's plans. But Conservatives said Labour was
using different figures for the sums that councils needed to raise. Party
officials also said Pounds 400 would represent the council tax bill on a
median property. The distribution of properties in the seven bands would
mean the average household bill would be Pounds 360.
Labour also attempted to undermine the government's figures with attacks on
its record in predicting poll tax levels and accused it of protecting the
rich.
As MPs and council representatives continue to digest Tuesday's
announcements, Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, was anxious to deflect
attention from the trauma surrounding the poll tax's demise. He called on
colleagues 'to go very firmly on the offensive'. But there were murmurs of
discontent among some Tories.
The Tories are expected to launch a further offensive against Labour at the
weekend but plan only one more press conference before polling day.
In an interview in today's Daily Express, Mr John Major was cautious about
prospects for next week's elections. 'I hope we will see some good effects
on May 2, but you cannot be certain about that because many people, by May
2, will not have got their community charge bills this year.'
Mr Patten again indicated that a June general election had been virtually
ruled out, insisting that the flow of good economic news would ensure that
as 'the days lengthen this summer, so do Labour's faces'.

FT  25 APR 91 / Observer: A plea for the motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a time when a high-powered delegation from the UK-based motor
industry to Downing Street could induce a strong attack of nerves even in
relatively thick-skinned ministers. Not so today. When the gentlemen from
Ford, Vauxhall, Peugeot Talbot and Rover paid a visit yesterday to the
chancellor of the Exchequer, they were clearly anxious not to be seen as one
more lobby group bent on presenting a shopping list. So much so that it is
tempting to wonder whether they may not have undersold their case.
Ostensibly, the visit was made to establish whether there had been an
adverse shift in policy towards the motor industry, following a Budget which
launched a vigorous assault on company car benefits, raised the rate of VAT
and increased fuel tax. Such modest ambition, if that is what it was, looks
entirely realistic. Not only have successive Conservative chancellors
reduced the emphasis upon manufacturing; they have also taken a relaxed view
of balance of payments deficits which are heavily influenced by motor
industry performance and, with obvious exceptions, adopted a robust stance
to-wards special interest groups.
Lamont hostile
Even so, the thrust of the industry's approach hardly looks well directed.
Mr Lamont has already shown himself instinctively hostile to trade
associations that fail to present a strong economic case. And it is hard to
argue with those of his Budget measures that most rankle with the motor
industry, notably the introduction of national insurance contributions for
employers on company cars, together with scale charge increases. For
travelling salesmen, the company car is a genuine business necessity. For
most company executives it is simply a perk and an economically inefficient
perk at that, in that it distorts and diminishes choice. Companies buy more
expensive cars for their employees than those employees would choose to buy
from taxed income. The type of the car may also be dictated by status in the
firm rather than personal preference.
One of the more welcome features of the Thatcher years has been the
reduction in the top marginal rates of income tax that made reliefs for
fringe benefits so attractive in the first place. The system has
progressively moved from one in which people were rewarded with allowances
and reliefs for belonging to particular groups - pensioners, farmers,
parents or senior managers with cars - to one where the rewards are
increasingly granted for the expenditure of productive effort. The real
question is whether the assault on company cars should be extended to other
perks.
Powerful case
So much the better, then, that Mr Lamont told the motor industry leaders
that he would consider doing precisely that. He also indicated that he would
look at the question in the context of the overall tax burden, which makes
equally good sense. And it is here that the motor industry, with support
from the Commons trade and industry committee, has a powerful case to make.
The 10 per cent special car tax, which is charged on the wholesale price of
a car, is unquestionably discriminatory. There is no reason why cars should
be penalised relative to washing machines other than that the exchequer wins
large revenues.
Nor does the tax make wider economic or environmental sense. By choosing to
increase the initial cost rather than impose the burden on fuel consumption
the government simply reinforces the pressure for congestion: once the
purchaser has bought the car at the inflated price, the marginal cost of
road use is insignificant. Shifting the burden on to fuel consumption would
have the additional advantage of encouraging the public to trade up from
older, fuel-inefficient cars to modern vehicles with better environmental
credentials. Ideally such a change should be accompanied by an assault on
industry-restrictive practices that result in retail buyers in Britain
paying up to 30 per cent more than many continental Europeans for their
cars. The opportunity may come when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
reports on the issues later this year.

Dr Peter Williams has made an attractive start as chairman of Oxford
Instruments Group by announcing an order for what may be the world's biggest
superconducting magnet. Doughnut-shaped and measuring about 5 metres across,
it will play a key role in physics experiments by the US Energy Department
at Newport News.
Williams, a physicist of 46, has been Oxford Instruments' chief executive
since 1986. With Sir Austin Pearce's retirement, he also shoulders the
chairmanship of the diversified electrical engineering concern.
The order, due for delivery in 1994, is worth more than Pounds 3m. But
Williams has an ambitious eye on a still bigger American physics experiment
called the superconducting supercollider, being planned by the US government
in Texas. The Oxford Instruments chief says at least half the cost - put at
nearly Pounds 5bn - will go on some 7,000 superconducting magnets.
The US electrical industry looks sure to get the lion's share. But Oxford is
one of seven chosen suppliers of superconducting wire worth about Pounds
295m, and has been approached about building some of the trickier magnets.
They are not expected to pose production problems but Williams would not be
caught defenceless if they did. A customer in Japan once paid Williams the
compliment of saying it had never known a foreigner apologise so graciously
in Japanese for his company's falling behind time.

Why is Stanislas Yassukovich, one of the grand old names of the euromarkets,
joining the board of the Bristol and West Building Society?
After a high-flying international banking career with the likes of White
Weld and Merrill Lynch, his appointment to the board of a second-division UK
building society seems a bit of a come down. Of course, Yassukovich, who has
always had a much wider range of outside interests than the average
Eurobanker, does not see it that way.
His estate is in the Cotswolds and he says he is getting increasingly
interested in retail financial services. For the Bristol and West, desperate
to get back into the race with the nearby Cheltenham and Gloucester,
Yassukovich is quite a catch.
There have been persistent rumblings of discontent among shareholders about
the inbred board and it was expected to resurface at the society's annual
meeting on Monday. Yassukovich's appointment should defuse it once and for
all.

They used to say that behind every Polish minister there stood a Soviet
adviser. It now seems the Soviet official has been replaced by a pin-striped
London merchant banker.
SG Warburg has just been been given the plum job of advising the Poles on
mass privatisation. The UK government has promised to reimburse the costs
through its 'know-how' fund, a gigantic system of outdoor relief for the
City. So the Poles could hardly have chosen a non-British bank such as
Morgan Stanley.
But why Warburg? Since no-one has ever before contemplated returning 8,000
or so companies to the private sector, there is nothing in Warburg's record
to suggest it is any better equipped than any of the other obvious
contenders which also have Polish speakers on the staff.
It sounds like yet another example of Buggins' turn. But if the powers that
be are not careful, the UK government will be accused of having a favourite
merchant bank.

FT  25 APR 91 / America's class act: The significance of US education
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Think about every problem, every challenge we face today. The solution to
each starts with education' - President George Bush unveiling the America
2000 Strategy.
There is a scene in My Fair Lady in which Professor Higgins begins to dance
about, unable to contain his delight. 'I think she's got it]' he exclaims as
Eliza Doolittle, his pupil, starts to talk like a lady.
It would be an exaggeration to claim that President Bush has suddenly got
the hang of educational reform. But the bold strategy outlined last week has
put congressional Democrats on the defensive and delighted some
educationalists. Mr Albert Shanker, of the American Federation of Teachers
(and no particular friend of the White House), was not happy with every
small detail. But he graciously described the package as a 'major turning
point in the history of American education'. No previous US president, he
said, had taken such a detailed interest in the future of school education.
Mr Lamar Alexander, Mr Bush's eloquent education secretary, can claim most
of the credit. Unlike many cabinet appointees, Mr Alexander knows his
subject: as governor of Tennessee in the 1980s, he was one of the first
state leaders to recognise the importance of school reform.
The America 2000 programme bears a striking - if unacknowledged -
resemblance to the UK educational reforms of the last Thatcher government.
The Thatcher strategy had three main elements: a new national curriculum;
measures to promote competition and parental choice; and business-funded
schools to 'break the mould' of bureaucratic local authority schools.
Each element is precisely mirrored in the White House plan. The main
difference is that Mr Bush lacks a British prime minister's powers. The US
constitution grants state and local governments primary responsibility for
education. Federal educational spending accounts for only about 6 per cent
of the total school budget. With few direct powers and little financial
leverage, Mr Bush must rely heavily on his powers of persuasion.
The parallel to the UK's national curriculum is a set of new 'world
standards' to be developed in each of five core subjects: English, maths,
science, history and geography. Mr David Kearns, the deputy education
secretary and former president of Xerox, argues that US businesses began to
make progress in the 1980s only when they started comparing themselves with
'the best in the world'. US schools are now being set the same challenge.
To measure performance in the core subjects, Mr Bush is planning the first
national examination system in US history, to be known as American
Achievement Tests. These will be taken at the ages of about 10, 14 and 18.
National tests could make a substantial difference: for the first time it
will be possible to compare performance not only between school districts
but between states. In future, Mississippi parents will be aware if their
children's results are lower than those of students in New York or
California or - in theory - Tokyo.
Critics argue that national tests will kill educational diversity and
inhibit teachers. They say US children are already burdened with too many
tests. Mr Alexander's response is convincing: the new exams will replace,
rather than add to, existing tests. They are intended to be of a higher
quality than the multiple-choice quizzes on which most American children are
reared: students will be expected to write essays and solve complex
mathematical problems as is commonplace in Europe and Japan. 'Teaching to
the test' may, therefore, promote better teaching. Finally, students in
different states may not need to take the same exams: different tests
calibrated to the same educational standards (rather like different A-level
exam boards in England) may be used.
For constitutional reasons, the national tests will be voluntary. But
colleges and employers will be encouraged to use them for selection
purposes. Presidential citations will be awarded to students who do
exceptionally well.
The second main plank in Mr Bush's strategy mirrors UK efforts to promote
competition between schools. The Thatcher government passed legislation in
1988 giving parents a wider choice of schools within local authorities.
Schools were also given the right to 'opt out' of local authority control
and be funded directly by Whitehall.
Mr Alexander would love to possess such powers. 'I don't know how we ever
got into this situation in America of denying a broad choice of schools to
parents,' he says. 'Everything else in America we choose: our cars, our
cities, our jobs, where we live.' Eight states have already passed 'school
choice' reforms. But the administration intends to inject momentum into the
choice movement by offering about Dollars 200m in incentives to states and
local governments that pass legislation promoting competition. Mr Alexander
also wants to revise the federal government's Dollars 6bn programme for
disadvantaged and under-achieving pupils (known as Chapter 1) so that
'federal dollars follow the child to whatever extent state and local
policies permit'.
Measures to permit greater choice among public schools are likely to be
grudgingly accepted, although there is little evidence that they raise
educational standards. Critics rightly worry that schools may end up
selecting pupils rather than parents selecting schools. If that happens, the
already troubling segregation by race and class caused by distinct black and
white residential districts could be exacerbated.
What most alarms critics, however, is the suggestion that, as a result of
choice policies, public money might flow to private and Catholic schools. Mr
Alexander points out that the GI bill subsidising the college education of
ex-servicemen after the Second World War did not stipulate that the money
must be spent in the public sector. By analogy he would like disadvantaged
children to be able to spend Chapter 1 dollars in private schools. Opponents
say this would wreck the finances of already underfunded inner-city public
schools.
The third main element in the Bush strategy closely parallels the British
city technology colleges initiative. The Thatcher government sought business
backing for the creation of new schools that would act as 'beacons of
excellence' for the public sector.
Mr Bush is doing the same - only on a grander scale. Under the plan, the
business community will raise Dollars 150-Dollars 200m to fund the New
American Schools Development Corporation, a new non-profit organisation.
This will award contracts next year to between three and seven research and
development (R&amp;D) teams drawn from companies, universities, think tanks and
others. The R&amp;D teams' task will be to 're-invent the public school'. The
goal is to have at least 535 new-style schools - at least one for each
congressional district - in operation by 1996.
It is easy to mock the notion of 'reinventing' public schools. But the plan
has real potential: schools are arguably one of the few institutions that
have failed to adapt to great social and economic changes in the 20th
century. Mr Alexander expects the R&amp;D teams to begin by 'erasing all
conventional assumptions and constraints' about schooling, such as the
calendar and schedule, the curriculum, the class size, and the nature of
learning materials. The only constraint is that the new schools should
achieve the standards set in the new national exams at a cost no greater
than that of conventional schools. US ingenuity just might produce an
educational innovation the rest of the world will want to copy.
Mr Alexander carefully describes the reform package as a 'national strategy'
rather than a federal policy. At a cost of only Dollars 690m, the programme
can hardly be said to be usurping the educational role of the states. There
are certainly big omissions: the White House is offering neither new money
nor new ideas in the vital area of pre-school education. It is doing nothing
to reduce vast disparities in educational spending in rich and poor
districts (it is not even trying to shame states into making equal
educational opportunity a reality). But some of the proposals - particularly
national exams and research into new schools - deserve congressional and
state support.
The strategy cannot hope to raise educational standards quickly: no policy
framed in Washington could do that. But there are enough ideas to take the
bite out of criticism that Mr Bush lacks a domestic agenda. To the
consternation of Democrats, the 'education president' is in danger of living
up to his name.

FT  25 APR 91 / Accountancy Column: Caparo chief finds himself in the lions'
den
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY night last week, Daniel paid a visit to the lions' den. Daniel
was Mr James Leek, chief executive of the Caparo Group. The den was
Chartered Accountants' Hall, packed full for the inaugural meeting of the
London Practitioner Board of the London Society of Chartered Accountants.
The Caparo Group, a quoted industrial holdings company, is less well known
for its products than for the legal decision that bears its name. Indeed,
the Caparo decision which was taken in the House of Lords in January last
year has become a landmark case for the profession.
The essence of last year's decision was that a company's auditors do not owe
a duty of care to potential investors in the company or to the company's
individual shareholders.
That decision sharply circumscribed the responsibilities of the auditing
profession to third-party users of accounts. As a Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte
booklet puts it: 'An investor or shareholder who relies on the company's
statutory accounts when deciding to purchase shares in the company has no
claim against the auditors if the accounts are negligently prepared.'
The decision followed a long battle with Touche Ross over the latter's audit
of Fidelity, an electronics company bought by Caparo in November 1985 in a
Pounds 13.5m hostile takeover bid. Soon afterwards it became clear that all
was not well with the stock or the level of reported profits, and the
business was shut down and the Fidelity brand name sold.
Caparo then took legal action against Touche and against Messrs Stephen and
Robert Dickman, directors of the company. The Dickman brothers were found
guilty of fraud in February this year.
The original battle with Touche was fought over the technical legal point of
whether that firm could owe a duty of care to Caparo. Caparo has recently
launched a new legal action against Touche alleging negligence.
Accountants were quick to welcome last year's decision, which in reducing
their responsibilities also reduced their exposure to potential liabilities.
After years of mounting litigation against the profession, that initial
reaction was understandable; but more recently euphoria has given way to
concern. Industry has always resented paying for the audit, which is, after
all, a statutory obligation rather than a business necessity.
The Caparo decision has exacerbated widespread disillusion about the purpose
of an audit. Why have one at all if the auditors cannot be sued by third
parties even if their work is negligent?
Mr Leek, a chartered accountant himself, observed that the profession did
not know how to react to the decision. Many accountants recognised that
public confidence in the profession was at stake, he said, but others were
content to hide behind the letter of the newly defined law.
He complained that there had been no public statement of any significance on
Caparo from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
'They have set up an auditing committee to examine the issues of the
so-called expectation gap (between what the public thinks auditors are doing
and what they themselves believe to be their duties), but the committee's
terms of reference read rather like a PR protection exercise for our own
profession, and in particular there is no mention of the Caparo case
itself.'
He accused the profession of sheltering behind two fine legal distinctions,
saying either 'a shareholder who loses money as a result of my negligent
auditing cannot sue me, but the client company can', or 'you can sue me on a
prospectus (in which auditors explicitly accept liability for their audit
reports) but not on a set of audited accounts'.
Mr Leek had his own suggestions for the reform of the audit law. Here are
the 'Caparo Five'.
Auditors should be made liable for their negligence to those users of
accounts who suffer loss after taking decisions based on those accounts.
That would require a legislative change.
Auditors should have a better defence against the increased liability which
the first reform would bring about. 'That defence is the abolition of the
present three-line 'true and fair' audit report,' Mr Leek argued. 'It has
become meaningless and leaves so much unsaid.' Auditors should be encouraged
to use qualified audit reports more frequently, where there is reasonable
ground for discomfort on either the accuracy or presentation of the figures.
Auditors should be encouraged to make available to shareholders a summary of
their report to management - a report comprising an auditor's statement of
accounting and control deficiencies and the client's response to them. 'This
would enable shareholders to judge the quality and standard of accounting
and control in their company.'
Mr Leek argued: 'The relationship between auditors and their clients should
be made less cosy. To reinforce the auditor's independence there should, for
publicly quoted companies, be a limit to the number of years for which an
auditor may be reappointed, and the amount of fee income from services other
than audit and taxation. It would also be helpful to find a better mechanism
for shareholders' involvement in the actual appointment and selection of
auditors. At present they are merely a rubber stamp for the directors'
recommendation.' There should be an independent review body to hear cases of
auditors' negligence. The new Auditing Practices Board, successor to the
Auditing Practices Committee, will not fulfil this role, although a greater
number of non-accountants will be involved in setting auditing standards.
Mr Leek made clear that the process of reform could not, indeed should not,
be left to the accountancy profession alone. He said it could only arrive as
a result of consensus between institutions, private shareholders, the
government, companies - and the profession itself. Given the difficulties
that the various branches of the accountancy profession have in agreeing
with themselves on anything, such a consensus is unlikely.
Nevertheless, Mr Leek's speech was a rare, constructive contribution to the
expectation gap debate. Coming from the company whose actions prompted the
debate in the first place, his suggestions are all the more welcome.
An eerie calm had descended on Chartered Accountants' Hall by the time Mr
Leek sat down. Only one person dared challenge him. The others appeared
struck dumb by the wisdom of what the Caparo chief executive had had to say
 -Daniel had silenced the lions.

FT  25 APR 91 / Technology: Smart structures top of the class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNTON MCLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intelligent materials that respond to their environment are the basis for an
emerging technology that adapts the substances into structures and products.
These 'smart' structures alter their shape or strength in response to
changes in the conditions surrounding them. They could range from
intelligent artificial bones and intelligent clothes to aircraft that repair
themselves in flight.
These ideas are still at an early stage of development. More immediately,
smart structures are likely to be used in aircraft and in manufacturing
technology where materials will be able to indicate when they have been
formed correctly.
Manufacturers, research agencies and universities in many countries are
pursuing the technology, with the US, Japan and Britain leading the field.
Japan's Science and Technology Agency is promoting work to create new
substances and materials with in-built intelligence. 'It is necessary for
the (Japanese) government to promote fundamental research in these fields,
which represents a challenge with fantastic feasible targets,' according to
the agency.
The Japanese government wants companies to accelerate the development of
intelligent materials, 'as a driving force for technology innovation'.
In Britain, Strathclyde University opened its Smart Structures Research
Institute in February and launched a company, Smart Structures Limited, to
exploit work with industry on the development of intelligent materials for
commercial products.
In the US several organisations and companies are involved, including
Stanford University, Virginia Polytechnic, Florida Institute of Technology
as well as United Technologies, Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas, Hughes
Aircraft and Nasa (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration).
Canada has a fibre optic smart structures laboratory in Toronto.
According to Nabil Zahlan, a researcher with ICI's advanced materials
laboratory on Teesside, smart structures have some of the same
characteristics as people. 'They have signal processors for brains,
mechanical actuators for muscles and sensors for nerves,' says Zahlan.
In intelligent materials for smart structures, the nerves could be in the
form of optical fibres, embedded in composite materials and able to sense
changes, such as cracks in a structure, and send signals to actuators, the
'muscles' in a smart structure.
Smart structures could also be made from intelligent materials such as
'perceptive composites'. These use piezo-electric elements that change shape
when an electric current passes through.
Smart structures can cope with other changing circumstances, such as
additional stress, and can prevent cracks developing that would destroy a
structure. Applications include bridges, buildings and aircraft where
structural failure could be catastrophic.
Fiona Underwood, an engineer with British Aerospace, says smart structures
would also help manufacturers to reduce the life-cycle costs of a product,
by reducing inspection requirements. An aircraft would indicate when a wing
had cracked, for example, and would strengthen itself to cope with the
crack.
BAe is also working on a smart aircraft 'skin', which would have radar and
communications equipment built into the aircraft. Underwood forecasts that
this material could be flying within five years.
The Strathclyde Smart Structures Research Institute has identified
applications for smart structures in transport, civil engineering,
manufacturing and in the design of consumer products from fishing rods and
golf clubs, which could stiffen on contact with a fish or ball, to toys.
In transport smart structures can be used to monitor the structural
integrity of satellites, aircraft, cars, boats and trains. It can also help
in vibration control on spacecraft and active suspension systems for
vehicles.
In civil engineering, smart technology could help in traffic control on
roads, in the real-time monitoring of pipeline integrity and in the
automatic damping of buildings and bridges subject to vibration.

THREATS of industrial action in the electricity supply industry appeared to
recede yesterday as unions arranged ballots of their 70,000 members over the
improved 8.9 per cent offer.
The offer will be put without a recommendation. Mr Eddie Newall, national
officer for the electricity supply industry at the GMB general union, said
he believed a majority of his members would accept the offer if the only
alternative was to take industrial action.
The possibility of industrial-action ballots among 95,000 British Rail
workers will be discussed today at a meeting of the Federation of Rail
Unions attended by Aslef, RMT and TSSA. Recommendations are expected to be
decided on by the executive committees of the unions on Friday.
The latest group poised to threaten industrial action is made up of Post
Office counter and clerical staff. The executive of the Union of
Communication Workers, the union that represents about 14,500 Post Office
staff, is due today to endorse a recommendation from the union's postal
committee for a strike ballot to begin at the end of this week.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Short-time work takes bigger toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of hours lost through short-time working has doubled over the
past year as organisations attempt to hold on to skilled employees during
the recession rather than make them redundant, according to a study
published today.
In January 1991, more than half a million hours a week were lost where
employees were stood off for the whole or part of a week. That was double
the number of hours lost in January 1990, although still far short of levels
reached during the recession of the early 1980s, says the research group
Incomes Data Services.
The study says: 'Many employers are only too aware of the recent
difficulties they experienced in attempting to recruit and retain skilled
employees and they are reluctant to lose these people.'
Short-time working is widespread in sectors such as textiles, footwear and
clothing, and motor vehicles. Service industries such as travel have also
been affected.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions agree to back TUC on pay
bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNION leaders yesterday put aside differences on a pay bargaining
structure under a future Labour government and agreed a common public line.
The compromise was formulated in spite of some strong doubts about the
proposed system.
The general council of the Trades Union Congress unanimously approved a
paper outlining plans for a system, including a national economic assessment
and a national minimum wage, after making alterations to accommodate
concerns of the AEU engineering union that pay differentials might be
eroded.
Potential difficulties in achieving a consensus on the issue were
highlighted yesterday when the AEU's national committee, meeting in
Eastbourne, approved a motion that noted 'with concern attempts to suppress
free collective bargaining with a national wages assessment and similar
devices'.
Mr Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union and a
strong supporter of the co-ordinated bargaining advocated in the TUC
document, admitted there could be difficulties in the future.
He said: 'Problems associated with a minimum wage and a national economic
assessment do not sit comfortably with free collective bargaining if that
mean a wages free-for-all.'
The twice revised TUC document repeatedly rejects the notion of pay norms or
pay restraint. Even so, concern continues that a national assessment,
involving trade unions, employers and government, might lead to restraint.
From the AEU's point of view, one of the most crucial changes was to clauses
involving a minimum wage.
After the revision, the document says: 'Such increases shall not inhibit
free collective bargaining or prevent the appropriate rate for the job being
negotiated by trade unions.'
It adds: 'Any exceptional increase given solely for the purpose of
implementing the provisions of statutory minimum pay legislation will not be
regarded by trade unions as a vehicle for general increases.'

FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Anger over government challenge - How
unions view their Civil Service pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year the government's side in pay talks with the two largest groups of
civil servants was led by two people new to salary negotiations. If the
unions hoped for an easy time through their opponents' inexperience,
however, they have been disappointed.
Ms Gillian Shephard, minister of state at the Treasury, and Ms Anthea Case,
senior civil servant, pitched an offer low enough to provoke the first
significant challenge to long-term pay agreements since they were introduced
into the Civil Service four years ago.
The challenge arose from union perceptions that the 8 per cent pay offer
breaks the spirit of the long-term agreements. It was probably not unwelcome
to a government keen to show the private sector how to conclude low pay
deals but severely constrained in its ability to do so this year because of
clauses in the deals.
The problem for the leaderships of the CPSA and NUCPS unions is that the
offer does not break the letter of the long-term agreements. They were
therefore faced with recommending acceptance of the 8 per cent offer, or
moving towards industrial action which they knew their members were
reluctant to take. The CPSA executive this week decided on acceptance; the
NUCPS recommended rejection, with the possibility of a ballot on industrial
action.
Whatever the result of that ballot, the unions' hostile response has
deflected attention from the potentially embarrassing fact that the 8 per
cent offer could be interpreted as inflationary. The retail prices index is
expected to fall to below 7 per cent this month; the offer is due for
implementation from April 1.
An inflation-plus deal does not look good for a government that is
constantly preaching that employers should make 'affordable' pay rises,
interpreted by most as meaning below inflation.
The government has not escaped without criticism. Shortly after the offer
was announced, Mr John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry, observed that public pay was rising too fast, threatening
'further essential cuts in interest rates'. But the criticisms would have
been worse without the public controversy over the offers.
In the Civil Service negotiations, the government's hand was forced by the
long-term pay agreements through which rises are linked to increases in the
private sector. The Civil Service rises must fall in the middle 50 per cent
of the private sector increases during the previous year.
Rising inflation works to the government's benefit because private sector
earnings tend to track the retail prices index. As inflation falls, as now,
the opposite occurs and the Treasury's comparability concessions cause
difficulties.
The advantage for the government of the long-term deal is that the unions
have allowed the Treasury more flexibility in where to target money. In the
first years of the deals, high performing civil servants in London - where
recruitment and retention were most difficult - were awarded higher rises
than others.
This year the high rises have been targeted at the low-paid who have won up
to 11 per cent. Most of the more than 300,000 civil servants covered by the
offers will receive between 7.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent.
That is what has angered the unions who say the long-term agreements would
only be honoured in spirit if all members were offered at least 8 per cent,
the lowest point of the middle 50 per cent in the private sector.
In spite of their annoyance, there is little support among the two unions'
leaderships for pulling out of the agreements.
Mr John Ellis, CPSA general secretary, said yesterday that the agreements
have stabilised industrial relations in the Civil Service, making strikes
such as those staged in 1981 and 1987 less likely. Until this year they have
also provided fair increases, he says.
He estimates that without the long-term agreements, this year's offer would
only have been about 6 per cent. His union will push for changes to the
agreements, for example to make more use of arbitration.
The NUCPS, the most reluctant of the Civil Service unions to join the
long-term agreements, is less positive about them. It is not hostile,
however, and its leadership will argue against withdrawal at this year's
annual conference.
Significantly, the union's executive did not this week order an immediate
ballot on industrial action. That would only come if members supported the
rejection recommendation and the government continued to reject arbitration.
That means industrial action can be virtually ruled out. A ballot may
eventually be held on industrial action, but it will come at a time when the
inflation rate is considerably less than the value of the offer. In a
recession, when hundreds of thousands of workers are being made redundant,
few workers would strike for an improvement to an inflation-plus offer.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Anxieties over tight timetabling -
Local Taxation Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY valuation experts confirmed yesterday that there should be no
insuperable barrier to banding all 22m homes in Britain prior to introducing
the proposed successor to the poll tax.
However, anxieties were expressed over the tight timetable if the new
council tax is to be introduced by April, 1993, and over some details which
have clearly not yet been considered fully.
There was relief in the valuation profession that ministers had decided in
favour of a rating system based on capital values, rather than returning to
the old, discredited system of rental values or recommending site valuation.
The essential point is that the chosen method does not entail a property by
property valuation, but simply the allocation of each property to one of the
proposed bands.
In most cases this should present no difficulty, as the old rating lists and
valuations have been retained and were updated until the introduction of the
poll tax last year. There is also a wealth of additional information from
local property sales.
'The basic prescription of 22m homes allocated to seven bands is sensible
and, for 90 per cent of properties, readily achievable,' said Mr Michael
Pattison, secretary general of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Mr Charles Partridge of Herring Son &amp; Daw, the chartered surveyors, said:
'It is the ideal approach because everyone understands capital values, and
putting each property into a broad band is not a difficult job.'
The Inland Revenue's valuation office will be responsible for allocating
each property to one of the seven bands, which in England will range from up
to Pounds 40,000 to over Pounds 160,000, with lower levels operating in
Scotland and Wales.
But because its resources are already fully stretched by appeals against
uniform business rate demands, much of the work is certain to be contracted
out to private sector professionals.
According to the RICS, the government could adopt a 'beacon' system of
valuation under which a typical property would be chosen as the basis of
valuation for similar properties in the same area.
A terrace house, for example, could be used to provide a representative
value for all properties in the same terrace, and in some cases whole areas
could be valued in this way.
The assumption is that most householders would be likely to accept the
banding decisions, which because of the amount of information available,
should be consistent with their own views on the market value of their
homes.
This method of valuation would be a rough and ready means of valuation and
so a right of appeal will be vital.
Problems arise at the margin of each band and at the precise point in a
street or estate where the properties have been allocated to the next band.
Mr Pattison forecast that in some cases there could be agitation to get a
property or housing estate into a higher band, despite the cost, because of
the extra social cachet this could provide.
Unlike the rating system, home improvements will not automatically mean a
change of band, and any alterations might only be taken into account when a
property changes hands.
Among questions still to be answered are whether leasehold properties will
be valued at their freehold value; how will 'unorthodox' types of property
such as caravans and houseboats be treated; and will banding be subject to
some form of indexation.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Major proposes UN arms register
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for establishing a United Nations arms register to provide an early
warning system of countries building up excessive arms stockpiles, were
spelt out by Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday, Alison Smith
writes.
In an interview on Sky news, Mr Major said the register would rely the
registration of arms sales by the suppliers. 85 per cent of arms
predominately come from the five permanent members of the UN security
council.
The idea should be considered at the UN and at the Group of Seven economic
summit in the summer, he said.
He acknowledged that the ability to purchase arms through third parties
meant that it would not be a perfect solution.
Even so, it would 'focus minds on the difficulties that arise when there are
too many armaments in too confined a space and in unsafe hands.'
Asked about the future of the Kurds, he said that there must be certainty
that the safe havens were not used as a jumping off point for incursions
into Iraq, but that the immediate question was getting them to come down
from the mountains. Questioned about the allies' attitude to co-operation
from the Iraqi government, he confirmed he still believed that while Saddam
Hussein remained in power, Iraq would be 'a pariah.'
The Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that Britain will have no
frontline ground-to-air missile defences against enemy aircraft attacks for
four years, after the current medium-range Bloodhound missiles are phased
out this year. A replacement would not be ready until the middle of the
decade, officials said.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour challenges tax figures -
Local Taxation Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday began a two-pronged attack on the government's council tax
figures, both challenging their basis and saying that they showed average
households would do better under Labour's plans for 'fair rates'.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment spokesman, said: 'These figures
conclusively prove that most people will be better off under Labour's fair
rate scheme.'
At the same time, he recalled that the original estimates for average poll
tax bills had been Pounds 178, later revised upwards to Pounds 278, while
the average bill last year was Pounds 357.
Similar revisions of council tax bill estimates, he added, would mean
average household bills of Pounds 802.
While such claims are a legitimate part of the numbers game being played by
the main parties, they do not help in a comparison of the figures for
average household bills under a council tax or rates.
For politicians attacking each other's calculations, Labour and Tories share
a surprising number of assumptions on their way to average household bills
of Pounds 333 and Pounds 360 respectively. Both take as their basis the
inclusion of the community charge reduction scheme with the revenue support
grant (although Labour counts it as about Pounds 1bn while the Tories count
it as Pounds 1.25bn); both assume that collection will be much better than
for the poll tax (the Tories calculating on 100 per cent collection and
Labour on 98 per cent - as it was under the rates); and both assume
significant savings on collection costs (Labour of Pounds 400,000 and the
Tories of Pounds 320,000).
Both parties also compare the new system with headline poll tax figures this
year given actual council spending, and no increase in the total from the
business rate.
Labour's attack on the figures will include sustained questioning of the
valuation which formed the basis of the property profile given for each
area.
Party officials doubt that sampling will have been extensive and describe
the exercise as 'pretty spurious'.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, ascribed the difference
in average household figures to the fact that Labour was aiming to raise
only Pounds 6.3bn from local taxes instead of the Pounds 6.8bn government
figures represented.
Tory officials also say the Pounds 400 average household figure is based on
the median house price, reflecting the range of council tax bills to be
paid. Labour's refusal to give details of distribution of bills under its
proposals means that there is no directly comparable figure for the
opposition's system.
Labour offers a different explanation. It says the limit on top band
contributions in the council tax and the 25 per cent discount for
single-person households means that to compensate, the average household
pays more than if the tax were fully progressive.
It agrees, however, that it assumes greater savings from the higher
collection rate than the government is doing - a point where independent
experts thought they had overestimated by Pounds 600,000 - but adds that the
same experts agreed with their conclusions of a Pounds 140 savings for an
average household.
Mr David Blunkett, the opposition local-government spokesman, said: 'Our
figures are robust, real and verified by independent analysts. Their figures
are a fairy tale without a happy ending.'
The ending to both stories looks likely to come only after the general
election.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Authorities still hazy over review
 -Local Taxation Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the government's proposals for the new council tax are well
documented in its consultation paper, details of how the review of local
government will be carried out remained hazy yesterday.
Officials of the Associations of District Councils, County Councils and
Metropolitan Authorities met Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, yesterday for an hour-long briefing, but said little detail had
emerged beyond what was published in the government's consultation paper on
the structure of local government on Tuesday.
Mr Roy Thomason, chairman of the Association of District Councils, which
welcomed the government's announcement that it intended to move towards more
unitary authorities in England, said it was unlikely that the proposed Local
Government Commission would be set up until after the second reading of the
bill. Depending on whether there is a general election, that is likely to be
early in the next session of parliament in the autumn.
He said the local-authority associations had made clear to Mr Heseltine that
they felt they should be closely consulted about the composition of the
commission.
It is not known how many members the commission will have, or who will chair
it.
According to the consultation paper, the review commission will take over
the functions of the Local Government Boundary Commission. Mr Thomason said
he had proposed that the Boundary Commission should suspend making any new
decisions that might affect the local-government review until the review
body has been set up.
Plans for the local-government review seem to be considerably less advanced
than those for the council tax, and the Department of the Environment
emphasised yesterday that it was keen to hear the views of authorities
before proceeding further. Councils have been invited to put their views to
the DoE by June 14.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Half of electorate found to support
system of PR - Electoral Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF the electorate favours the replacement of Britain's first-past-the-post
voting system by proportional representation, according to a 'state of the
nation' survey published yesterday.
Pressure on Mr Neil Kinnock and his shadow cabinet to back the change will
be intensified by the disclosure that it would be approved by more than a
two-to-one majority among Labour Party supporters.
The survey, commissioned by the Rowntree Reform Trust and conducted by
Market &amp; Opinion Research International (Mori), also indicated that
Conservative voters were split almost evenly for and against the switch.
This is seen as reflecting a growing public perception of Mr John Major, the
prime minister, as a more consensual figure than Mrs Margaret Thatcher, his
predecessor, but will make little impact on the Conservative party's
traditional opposition to PR so long as it is able to command a majority in
the Commons at regular intervals.
Mr Robin Cook, principal health spokesman and leading advocate of the
abandonment of the first-past-the-post voting system in the Shadow Cabinet,
welcomed the verdict that Labour voters wanted PR even more strongly than
the rest of the population.
He emphasised: 'This poll shows Labour should stop resisting PR as a threat
and start to recognise it as an opportunity'.
Mr Cook's enthusiasm is unlikely to receive early public endorsement from Mr
Kinnock. The Labour leader, like the majority of his senior colleagues,
fears that a declaration of support for changing the voting system at the
present time would be interpreted as lack of confidence in the party's
prospects for forming a majority government after the next general election.
Even so, a resolution approved by last year's Labour conference requiring
the National Executive to consider alternatives to the first-past-the-post
voting system for elections to the House of Commons ensures that PR stays
high on the party's agenda.
Mr Robert Maclennan, home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats - the
most consistent advocates of electoral reform among the leading political
parties - said the survey showed they were more in tune with public opinion
about how Britain was governed than any of their rivals.
Other findings from the survey are:
More than 50 per cent support fixed term parliaments, thus denying the prime
minister of the day the right to make party advantage the first
consideration in determining the date of a general election.
The introduction of a bill of rights enshrining individual freedom has 72
per cent support, and 60 per cent believe government power is too
centralised.
While majority government is preferred on balance (49 per cent to 45 per
cent), half the public would like to see more co-operation between the
parties.
A devolved assembly is the most popular option among Scottish voters, with
majority support for legislation to establish one in the event of the
Conservative party continuing to hold on to power through the seats won in
England and Wales.
Only 50 per cent of voters know the name of their constituency MP, and only
a third are aware if their constituency comes within the category of a
marginal seat.
Opinion is almost equally divided over political contributions by trade
unions (46 per cent want them banned while 43 per cent do not), and
political contributions by companies (44 per cent want them banned and 45
per cent do not).
Eleven to one favour a Freedom of Information Act (77 per cent for and 7 per
cent against).
Mori interviewed 1,547 adults between March 7 and March 25 in 180
constituencies.
The full State of the Nation computer analysis from Mori costs Pounds 75,
computer disc Pounds 40 and summary Pounds 10.

FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Rules on takeovers attacked - Trade
and Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN Clark, former chief executive of Plessey the UK electronics group,
yesterday attacked UK takeover regulations, arguing bidders should be
required to exercise due diligence and that shareholders' interests should
not be the sole determinant of a bid.
'I do not believe self-regulation is working or can work,' he said,
addressing the trade and industry select committee on government takeover
and merger policy. 'There should be criteria that can overrule the perceived
best interests of shareholders,' he said.
Sir John argued that due diligence performed by companies in bid situations
should include establishing genuine synergy and mutual benefit, showing that
employee benefits can be enhanced and illustrating that extra monies would
be available for R&amp;D and marketing.
Referring to Plessey's Pounds 2bn takeover by GEC and Siemens in 1989, Sir
John said that 35 fund managers 'who did not know one end of a factory from
another' were the sole arbiters of the company's demise.
He described it as 'utterly absurd' that ownership of UK companies was
largely concentrated among 'a handful of institutions.' This 'cannot be
perceived to be in the public interest,' he said.
He agreed that a central registry of undertakings given by prospective
buyers during the course of bids should be established. Cadbury Schweppes,
the UK confectionery and soft drinks group, told the same committee that it
supports lowering the bid threshold for mandatory bids to 20 per cent from
29.9 per cent at present.

FT  25 APR 91 / Trustees win backing for pensions test case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT, Pensions Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has agreed in principle to provide financial backing for
pension scheme trustees in a test case on pensions equality.
It is hoped that the test case, involving the Coloroll Group Pension
Schemes, will resolve ambiguities arising from a European Court judgment
last year. That ruled that benefits paid from occupational pension schemes
counted as pay under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and therefore had to
be equal for men and women.
However, the judgment - in the Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange case -
stated that to avoid upsetting the financial balance of schemes, it would
only apply to pension entitlements arising after May 17 1990 - the date of
the judgment.
The confusion arose over whether that related only to the benefits secured
by contributions made after May 17, or to the date when the pension payments
started, or to all pension payments after May 17.
It is intended to bring the case before the High Court within weeks and have
it referred to the European Court within 18 months. A favourable
interpretation could mean minimal initial cost to pensions schemes, but the
cost rises to about Pounds 30bn on the most unfavourable interpretation.
Coloroll Group went into administrative receivership a few weeks after the
judgment.

THE Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) yesterday ruled out the use of passenger
smoke hoods on aircraft because they risked delaying emergency evacuation of
a cabin on fire, Paul Betts writes.
A CAA report on improving the chances for passenger survival in aircraft
fires favours the introduction of water spray systems in aircraft cabins.
Tests have shown that water sprays would hold down cabin temperatures and
extend the time for safe evacuation in the event of fire. The introduction
of such systems would increase an airline's overall operating costs by
increasing the weight of an aircraft.
The CAA said smoke hoods were likely to increase the risk of death in a
fire. Its opposition to them is likely to provoke fierce controversy because
of widespread calls for the introduction of smoke hoods after the fire on a
British Airtours Boeing 737 at Manchester Airport in 1985.
The Consumers' Association said it was outraged by the CAA's decision.
After the Manchester accident in which 55 people died, including 48 directly
from inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, the CAA was asked to consider
introducing smoke hoods on all UK registered aircraft.

FT  25 APR 91 / Russian works attract little interest: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL and select group of Russian works of art was assembled by Christie's
to auction in London yesterday. However, the market has been scared away
from Russian antiques and the sale made just Pounds 201,355 with more than
40 per cent bought in.
Pictures suffered particularly badly and important works - a study of a
general by the leading Russian 19th-century artist Repin, and a decorative
portrait, 'The lace maker', credited to the circle of the peasant artist
Tropinin but perhaps in his own hand - went very cheaply, at Pounds 7,200
and Pounds 3,850 respectively.
Top price was the Pounds 13,200 which was paid for a Georgian scene by the
20th-century artist Sudeikin. Works of art did better and a Revolutionary
porcelain propaganda dish 'The bellringer. Long live the 8th Congress of the
Soviets' almost doubled its estimate, selling at Pounds 13,200.
Sotheby's had an easier time, disposing of jewels in New York and the
collection of the late Thora Ronalds McElroy, daughter of a family of coal
and railroad magnates, made almost Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.5m) with every one
of the 56 lots finding a buyer. A 19th-century sapphire and diamond
necklace, a family heirloom with 23 sapphires and 20 diamonds, sold for
Dollars 2.47m (Pounds 1.4m).
In London, Sotheby's offered Asian art. A Ghandara grey schist figure of
Buddha, dated to around 200 AD and 31.5 in high, sold just below its
estimate for Pounds 39,600 and a bronze 7th-century figure of the
Bodhisattva Maitreya was on target at Pounds 35,200.
Among the carpets an Agra carpet, a type made by prisoners in Indian jails
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sold well for Pounds 22,000, but
the top price, also way above forecast, was the Pounds 68,200 which secured
a French Savonnerie carpet.
The auction of Scottish pictures at Sotheby's in Scotland was something of a
disaster, being almost 43 per cent unsold. 'Playing in the surf' painted in
1895 by William McTaggart, did best, making Pounds 39,600, above its high
estimate.

FT  25 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Auditor 'urged second opinion on
disclosure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS preparing the accounts of NatWest Investment Bank expressed
'forceful' concern over possible disclosure obligations relating to the
holdings of Blue Arrow shares that the bank's subsidiaries took in the 1987
rights issue, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday.
Mr Kevin MacNamara, a partner with Ernst and Whinney, told the court he had
advised a second legal opinion.
Mr MacNamara, a prosecution witness, said he was asked in November 1987 by
Mr James Riddell, then County NatWest finance director, whether a tranche of
shares could be transferred from County's corporate advisory division to the
parent bank, NatWest, as a long-term investment. He replied that it was not
clear that a holding from a failed rights issue could suddenly become a
strategic investment.
Mr MacNamara was then told of the stakes held by County, its co-subsidiary
County NatWest Securities and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
It was the first time he learnt of the 'enormity' of the matter, he told Mr
Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the
defendants.
He had been told that after the stock market crash NWIB stood to lose Pounds
50m and, expecting trouble from the Bank of England over its liquidity, it
needed a capital injection from the parent.
In January 1988 Mr MacNamara recommended NWIB's management to get a second
legal opinion on the holdings from lawyers other than Travers Smith
Braithwaite, the solicitors who had originally advised the bank on the
rights issue.
The absence of legal clarification meant that both the company and
individuals were at risk, he said. What he thought were forceful points were
met with a 'rather bland' reaction.  'At the end of the day, if they did not
want to take that advice, they did not want to take it,' he said.
Earlier, Mr Brian Winterflood, former head of market-making for CNWS, said
his division would not normally have accepted a holding as large as the 31m
shares worth Pounds 50m it had taken from County's corporate advisory
division.
He told Mr Jones such expansion of CNWS's capital commitment would have
required approval from a more senior level.
Mr Winterflood said he had general discontents about the County organisation
at that time. It was not working as an integrated house, its standing was
going down and the management was 'hopeless'.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of
the Pounds 837m rights issue. The trial continues today.

FT  25 APR 91 / Car export growth is expected to slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MOTOR industry leaders yesterday warned Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor
of the exchequer, that recent strong growth in car exports was expected to
slow in the second half of the year.
Car production has become increasingly dependent on exports in the face of
the sharp downturn in domestic new car demand.
Car makers are concerned, however, that sales in export markets are also
likely to weaken later this year, when the present high level of demand in
Germany begins to fall.
The chief executives of Rover, Ford of Britain, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot
met Mr Lamont and Mr Peter Lilley, secretary of state for trade and
industry, yesterday to express the industry's concern at measures taken in
last month's Budget.
Car makers have become alarmed by what they perceive as an increasingly
hostile attitude by the government towards the motor industry.
Sir Hal Miller, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove and chairman of the all-party
motor industry group of MPs, said Mr Lamont had assured the industry that it
would not be used as 'a milch cow' for taxation.
Sir Hal said the industry had not pressed in particular for the abolition of
the 10 per cent special car tax - which has been a long-standing demand from
the sector.
New car sales fell by 12.7 per cent last year and fell by a further 21.6 per
cent in the first quarter this year.

FT  25 APR 91 / EEF and CBI in talks on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry and the Engineering Employers'
Federation are in talks that might end in the two organisations' merging to
provide a unified voice for the manufacturing sector.
The two bodies said yesterday that they had agreed over the 'absolutely
essential' need for manufacturing industry to have a single, powerful
representative organisation to promote its interests.
The CBI, which was formed in 1965, represents more than 250,000 businesses
employing about half the nation's workforce. Members include most of the 100
largest companies, along with 150 trade association and employers'
organisations.
More than 5,000 businesses are represented by the EEF, the UK's largest
single-industry representative organisation.
Mr Peter Brighton, EEF director-general, said: 'Britain has a unique public
lack of recognition of the importance of engineering and manufacturing
industry to the health of the overall economy.'
Neither party would predict the outcome of a joint working party of senior
officials, which is due to report in the autumn. Mr John Banham, CBI
director-general, said that whatever body emerged, it would be within the
'overall umbrella' of his organisation.
The move, which will replicate recent initiatives among trade unions to
create stronger representative organisations, was originated by the EEF. The
federation's role has been diminished since the end, two years ago, of its
role in national negotiations on minimum pay and conditions.
Mr David Lees, EEF president, said both organisations recognised that
neither the CBI nor the EEF in their present forms could resolve the
difficulties facing manufacturing industry.
The decision to establish a working party was endorsed yesterday by the CBI
Council. Sir Brian Corby, CBI president, said a joint organisation would
improve the effectiveness with which the interests of manufacturers were
represented in Westminster, Whitehall and Brussels.

FT  25 APR 91 / PowerGen to close two plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the UK electricity generator, yesterday announced the closure of
two power stations with the loss of 440 jobs. The company said the stations
were 'inefficient and increasingly unprofitable'.
The 33-year-old Ferrybridge B station in West Yorkshire and the 34-year-old
Hams Hall C station in Warwickshire are due to be shut in November next year
and their output taken on by new installations under construction.
PowerGen has emphasised that replacing coal-fired power stations with
gas-powered plants is a significant part of the company's efficiency drive.
News of the closures follows PowerGen's announcement on Tuesday that it had
awarded the contract for construction of its Pounds 290m gas-powered station
in Hertfordshire to Siemens, the electronic and electrical equipment
supplier. That plant is due to start up in 1994.
In addition, the company's 900MW Killingholme gas-fired station is due to
start up in October next year.
PowerGen said staff levels at the two stations it is closing will start to
be run down from April next year. Some workers will be offered jobs
elsewhere in the company, and other jobs will be lost through natural
wastage and voluntary redundancy.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, commercial director of British Coal, warned against
increasing the UK's energy bill by a rising reliance on imported fuel. Mr
Edwards said that if the short-term view of power station fuel requirements
persisted, it might result in a big rundown in the industry.' Only British
Coal will sign a long contract for a large supply of fuel with prices in
sterling and guaranteed to stay within the UK retail prices index.'

BRITAIN'S Prince Charles yesterday urged Brazilian business to act over
deprived communities, and warned against the social costs of progress.
The prince told business leaders in Sao Paulo, on the third day of a six-day
visit to Brazil: 'Action to address community problems cannot be successful
without full business involvement.
'I cannot help feeling our societies and economies are set on a course in
the name of progress which has already brought us close to ecological
disaster and social disharmony, and now requires urgent remedial action.'
While sympathising with Brazil's problems, Prince Charles urged its business
community to act now or face appalling social consequences of increased
violence and illiteracy. The prince and his wife, Princess Diana, are in
Brazil at the invitation of President Fernando Collor.
'If we do not implement sensible policies, such as better access and a
fairer price for exports from the developing South, we cannot expect
countries such as Brazil to adopt costly measures which . . . risk
compounding existing economic difficulties,' the prince added.

FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Sluggishness of developing
regions seen as likely to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE developing economies of eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle
East contracted last year, and the decline is expected to continue this year
in eastern Europe and the Middle East, according to the International
Monetary Fund.
Its World Economic Outlook suggests overall growth in gross domestic product
in developing countries fell to 0.6 per cent last year, from 3.1 per cent in
1989. It is projected at 0.8 per cent this year, rising to 3.4 per cent next
year.
The IMF estimates the debt of all developing countries rose nearly 6 per
cent in 1990 to Dollars 1,306bn. New borrowing of Dollars 50bn and valuation
changes due to the dollar's fall (Dollars 51bn) more than offset the fall in
debt (Dollars 29bn) due to various operations to reduce the debt of
developing countries.
The amount of debt owed by problem debtor countries to commercial banks is
set to fall to Dollars 257bn in 1992, from Dollars 311bn in 1990, reflecting
both debt reduction deals and net repayments. By 1992, the share of official
debt to these countries will have grown to 52 per cent in 1992 from 47 per
cent in 1990.
Debt reduction operations will contribute to a big drop in debt-GDP ratios
in problem debtor countries.
Among 15 heavily indebted countries, this ratio will fall 7 1/2 percentage
points to 30 per cent in 1992. Debt service ratios will show a temporary
rise this year, however.
The Middle East: Output is estimated to have shrunk by 1.5 per cent last
year, reflecting the sharp contraction of the economies of Kuwait, Iraq and
Jordan.
Total regional output is estimated to decline by a further 3.3 per cent this
year, before recovering in 1992 when 8.5 per cent growth is expected, mainly
because of reconstruction in Kuwait and Iraq.
The combined balance of payments surplus of the Middle East countries is
estimated to have shifted from near balance in 1989 to a surplus of Dollars
14bn last year, mainly because of the rise in oil prices.
It will shift dramatically to deficit of Dollars 50bn this year and Dollars
25bn next, mainly because of economic reconstruction costs.
Latin America: Output declined by 1 per cent last year, compared with a
modest 1.5 per cent rise the year before. Some of the decline was due to
transitional economic adjustments, rather than destabilising macroeconomic
policies - the primary factor in previous years.
If significant delays or slippages in reform programmes are avoided, growth
should resume this year, at about 1 per cent, and reach 3.3 per cent next
year.
Asia: Growth slipped to 5.3 per cent last year in Asian developing
economies, from 5.5 per cent in 1989.
It is expected to remain about 5 per cent this year and next - three
percentage points below the average growth rate for 1983-89. The Gulf war
cost the oil-importing debtor countries of the region almost  1/2 per cent
of GDP last year, with the countries hurt by a loss of remittances.
Africa: The rise in the price of oil and a drop in the price of other
commodities depressed growth in Africa in 1990. Gross domestic product
growth should be little changed at about 2 per cent this year but pick up to
4.8 per cent in 1992. Little progress, though, is seen at alleviating
poverty, and GDP levels per capita are expected to remain at the level of 20
years ago.

European economies this year
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIES of eastern Europe shrank by almost 9 per cent last year,
according to International Monetary Fund estimates.
The fund's World Economic Outlook forecasts that real gross domestic product
will fall again this year, but more modestly: by 1.5 per cent against 8.6
per cent in 1990.
Growth in the region - Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania
and Yugoslavia - should then resume as the private sector expands and
efficiency continues to improve. Growth is estimated at a 2.8 per cent rate
in 1992 and an average 4.4 per cent from 1993-96.
If the Soviet Union is included, the regional economy shrank 3.8 per cent
this year.
It is forecast to decline 4.2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent next.
Growth will average 1.2 per cent from 1993-96.
According to IMF staff projections, the combined current account deficit of
the region, excluding the Soviet Union, will rise to about Dollars 10bn this
year and Dollars 11bn next.
This will reflect the widening of external deficits with the traditional
convertible currency area and deteriorating trade balances with the Soviet
Union, with which they now trade in hard currency.

FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Optimistic global view amid
interest rate warning for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is optimistic that the world economy will
begin to recover this year, and believes that the US should move cautiously
when considering interest rate cuts.
Introducing the IMF's latest twice-yearly Economic Outlook, Mr Jacob
Frenkel, director of the fund's research department, said the IMF was
adopting a 'somewhat positive' tone with regard to the global economic
outlook, despite a clear deterioration in near-term prospects since its last
report in October.
The IMF projects a recovery in the growth of the global economy to 2.9 per
cent next year, from an anticipated 1.2 per cent this year. Its projection
envisages a strong bounce back in US growth to 2.7 per cent next year, from
just 0.2 per cent this year, and a sharp recovery in developing country
growth to 3.4 per cent in 1992 from 0.8 per cent this year.
Mr Frenkel said now was not the time for the US Federal Reserve to pursue an
active monetary policy.
If the US economy grew as projected, the Fed, when considering its interest
rate policy, should 'weigh very cautiously' the balance between the
short-term weakness of the economy and the medium-term strategy for fighting
inflation.
The Fed should not resist market forces, he said. The only circumstance in
which rates could be cut would be if US economic developments turned out to
be weaker than projected. At a time when Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury
Secretary, has been calling for lower US interest rates and putting pressure
on Germany to cut its rates, IMF officials are concerned that an unwarranted
cut in US rates now could lead to too steep a recovery six to nine months
hence.
Underpinning this concern is confidence that the world economy may be
nearing the bottom of the trough.
The IMF bases its relatively optimistic view of the world on the
continuation of relatively strong economic growth in Japan, Germany and
elsewhere in continental Europe.
The current level of US interest rates is also expected to revive demand for
consumer durables. Mr Frenkel pointed out that the federal funds rate, at
which banks lend reserves to each other, has fallen about four percentage
points to about 6 per cent from its most recent peak.

FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Industrial states urged to
increase savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's industrial countries will have to gear their fiscal policies to
increasing national savings, if they are to achieve sustained growth and a
lasting decline in real interest rates, the IMF warned yesterday.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the fund singled out the US, Germany
and Italy as nations where additional measures to curb budget deficits could
be required.
Looking ahead to the mid-1990s, the IMF said that tougher fiscal policies in
the three countries could help boost industrial country growth and
investment, and world economic activity as a whole.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, IMF research department director, said it was important
government claims on savings be cut because of increased investment demand
resulting from the Gulf war and economic restructuring in eastern Europe.
In one scenario, the IMF calculated the possible impact of: the US
eliminating its federal budget deficit by 1995; Italy cutting its state
sector deficit of more than 10 per cent to about 6.5 per cent of gross
domestic product by 1993; and Germany increasing government saving by about
1 per cent of gross national product between now and 1996.
By 1996, the real capital stock in the industrial countries would be 1.25
per cent higher than it would have been in the absence of fiscal action, and
the level of actual and potential output would be almost 0.5 percentage
points higher.
But the nations would not necessarily have to work in concert to help the
world economy, it said.
'Actions in one country to reduce their use of world saving and strengthen
their public finances would have important benefits for the world economy,'
the IMF said.
In the near term, the report said that prospects for global economic growth
had clearly deteriorated since its last Economic Outlook in October last
year.
The economic position of the industrial world was characterised by sharply
different cyclical positions among the major countries. At the same time,
the prospects for inflation had worsened.
It was acknowledged in the report that important questions are being asked
about what economic policies should be pursued, in the light of economic
weakness in some countries, the aftermath of the Gulf war, the fluctuations
of the dollar and worries about financial fragility in several countries.
But it stressed that these concerns 'should not overshadow the overriding
importance of achieving sustained growth over the longer term.'
This would require continued reliance on monetary policies to combat
inflation, pushing ahead with structural policies including liberalisation
of international trade, plus encouragement of savings.
The report warned countries against using monetary policy to alter the
present exchange rates relationships between the US, Germany and Japan. It
also said they should not change macro-economic policies to deal with
fragile financial systems.
The IMF said the Gulf war and reconstruction in the Middle East would
involve the world in a substantial net budgetary cost.
It said last year's temporary rise in oil prices and developments in the
Middle East raised industrial country consumer prices by about 0.5 per cent
last year and cut real gross national product by about 0.25 per cent or
Dollars 25bn.
Stephen Fidler adds: Measures to improve savings in developing countries are
necessary to promote growth but are not sufficient by themselves, the report
said.
Converting higher savings into effective domestic investment also requires
stable policies at a macroeconomic level.
The experience of east Europe - where high investment rates were not
converted into strong economic performance - shows conditions must also be
in place to make sure investment is well utilised.
'If the environment for investment in domestic assets is not favourable,
action to raise domestic saving could turn out to be deflationary or simply
promote capital flight,' the Outlook said.
'Conversely, measures to boost investment will not succeed if the required
financing is not available.'

FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Congress prepares to move on bank
insurance weakness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US CONGRESSIONAL leaders are preparing urgent action to bolster the federal
bank insurance fund which protects depositors. This is in face of new
estimates by the General Accounting Office that the fund's financial
position is worse than thought.
Mr William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
said that the annual GAO audit, due to be released tomorrow, would show that
the fund stood at only Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn at the end of last year,
compared with the FDIC estimate of Dollars 8.4bn, which it still defends.
The difference reflects varying views on when to take account of anticipated
losses from bank failures.
Mr Seidman said yesterday that the GAO figures could increase the pressure
on Congress to act quickly on the problems of the fund and the banking
industry.
Proposals by House Democratic leaders to separate the immediate
recapitalisation of the bank insurance fund from the fundamental structural
changes to the banking system proposed by the administration, threaten both
the scope and the substance of the plan.
After meeting House Republican leaders yesterday, Mr Nicholas Brady,
Treasury Secretary, said the administration still hoped for a broad bill,
but did not expect to 'get everything we want.'
Proposals to allow commercial companies to own banks have always looked
highly unlikely to pass but the Treasury stil hopes that any legislation
include not only the overhaul of deposit insurance, recapitalisation of the
insurance fund and tighter supervision, but also nationwide branch banking
and, preferably, a destruction of barriers between commercial and investment
banking.
The main bank regulators all favour a broad-ranging package. However,
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, Democratic chairman of the House Banking
Committee, has said it will act on the fund recapitalisation 'not later than
May 15.'
Despite assurances by Democratic leaders that broader banking reform would
still be tackled, the Treasury fears that, having dealt with the immediate
problem, Congress will postpone action on the more controversial long-term
issues.
The Treasury may be forced to compromise over the Dollars 70bn insurance
fund recapitalisation, in face of the opposition both of Congressional
Democrats and Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to the proposal
that the fund should be able to borrow Dollars 25bn from Federal Reserve
banks.

FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: IMF urges Britain to cut
benefits for jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMF said yesterday Britain was facing the deepest recession of the Group
of Seven leading industrial countries and urged it to cut unemployment
benefit in order to curb wage increases.
The IMF's suggestion of limiting the period for which benefits are paid is a
part of a package intended to limit wage increases.
In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that action is needed to
increase the responsiveness of British wages to market conditions and to
promote labour mobility.
It also suggests 'increasing training programmes and improving the
functioning of labour exchanges' to prevent a rise in unemployment in the
recession similar to the sharp increase witnessed in the early 1980s.
Britain must maintain monetary and fiscal policies 'conducive to a
substantial downward adjustment in the growth of wages,' the IMF says.
While warning of the depth of the recession, the IMF says there is 'little
scope for a significant reduction in UK interest rates' unless this is fully
justified by sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System and clear signs that underlying inflation is
falling.
IMF projections point to a sharp 2.1 per cent drop in UK gross domestic
product this year. Growth next year is forecast at around 1.9 per cent.
However, unemployment will keep on rising in 1992 and is expected to average
8.5 per cent of the labour force next year compared to 7.5 per cent this
year and just 6 per cent in 1990.
Britain faces several years of slow growth, it indicates. Between now and
1996 the IMF expects GDP growth in the UK will lag slightly behind the
average annual increase of 2.1 per cent which was seen in the 1980s.
The IMF did not elaborate on its suggestion for a cut-off point on
unemployment benefit. The government said yesterday that it was keeping the
impact of the benefit system on the labour market under review but insisted
that it was not considering any proposals to cut the duration of
unemployment benefit payments.
Basic unemployment benefit, currently Pounds 41.40 a week, is paid in
Britain for up to a year, but after that individuals who have no savings can
claim indefinite income support at only a slightly lower weekly rate.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'It would be wrong to
think that a cut in the period of unemployment benefit would, of itself,
bring lower unemployment.'
Mr Blair endorsed other comments in the report, saying: 'I would agree with
the IMF in the importance of better training, a better employment service
and, in particular, we believe it is right now to adopt a temporary work
programme to prevent the unemployed becoming long-term unemployed.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRUSTRATED US secretary of state, Mr James Baker, yesterday sharply
criticised Israel over new settlements in the occupied territories amid
signs that his peace shuttle may be faltering.
Speaking to reporters in Damascus after marathon talks with President Hafez
al-Assad, Mr Baker said he was 'very disappointed to learn .. that there is
yet another new settlement established in the (Israeli) occupied
territories'.
'That points up vividly that it is easier to obstruct peace than to promote
it,' he added, in a departure from his previous muted approach to the vexed
settlement issue during his current Middle East tour - his third in six
weeks.
Mr Baker, who arrived in the Soviet Union last night for a meeting with his
Soviet counterpart, spent nine and a half hours with Mr Assad on Tuesday in
talks that reportedly bogged down on UN involvement in a proposed regional
peace conference.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syria's foreign minister, who was sitting beside Mr
Baker at yesterday's press conference, said 'the Syrian position vis-a-vis
this point is very clear. The UN should play an important role in this
conference.'
Damascus also wants the conference to have European Community involvement
and to be given the authority to oversee the implementation of decisions
reached.
As Mr Baker prepared for today's meeting with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the
Soviet foreign minister, in a Caucasus resort, it was clear that his peace
shuttle was in trouble.
In his efforts to coax all parties to the dispute to accept the need to
begin talking, he is battling decades of suspicion and prejudice. He is also
obliged to deal with an Israel deeply divided on the international
community's central demand - that agreement be based on exchanging 'land for
peace' in the occupied territories.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S caretaker government and the country's election commission decided
yesterday to go ahead with national and state elections in turbulent Punjab
and Assam, in spite of vigorous protests from the big political parties.
The only concession that was announced was that polling in the two states
will not be held at the same time as in the rest of the country, which goes
to the polls to elect a new parliament and five other state legislatures
from May 20 to 26.
Punjab and Assam have long been in the grip of violent insurgencies by
secessionist groups.
Although militants in Assam have announced they will give up violence during
the election, daily killings continue unabated in Punjab, where a number of
Sikh groups are backing the demand for an independent nation they call
Khalistan.
After hearing protests from a delegation made up by four parties - the
Congress party, the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the
two Communist parties - Mr TN Seshan, chief election commissioner, announced
that polling in Punjab will be held on June 22 and in Assam on June 6 and 8.
The decision by Mr Chandra Shekhar, the caretaker prime minister, that
elections will be held in all states except Jammu and Kashmir, where
secessionist groups have also launched a movement, has been strongly opposed
by the main political parties.
Most Delhi politicians fear that fair and free elections are not possible in
Punjab because of intimidation by the militants. Mr Rajiv Gandhi of the
Congress party recently said that if a state legislature controlled by the
militants emerged from the elections, an unstable government in New Delhi
would not be able to tackle a demand for independence by them.
Most of the parties have threatened to boycott the Punjab elections.
However, since their demand for the uncoupling of the Punjab poll from
elections in the rest of the country has been partly met, it is possible
they will review their decision.

PALESTINE Liberation Organisation moderates have prevailed over the
organisation's radicals in a test of wills at a three-day conference in
Tunis called to review the latest US Middle East peace moves.
Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to the Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman,
said the organisation should not rule itself out of the game by opposing the
US initiative. 'We should listen to what is being offered,' he declared.
Militants, including Mr George Habash of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), had demanded the rejection of the US
initiative so long as Washington refused to deal directly with the PLO.
The PLO insists that it retain the right to name Palestinian representatives
at a proposed regional peace conference. Israel rejects contacts with the
PLO, which it says is a terrorist organisation.
Mr Arafat and Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, have called for
Europe to play a leading role in Middle East peace talks.
In separate interviews broadcast yesterday after meeting in Libya on Monday,
both said European involvement would improve prospects for peace. 'I wish
Europe to be part of this conference. Mr Arafat agrees. Palestinians want
it. Arab countries wish it. Americans agree. Israelis need to be persuaded,'
Mr Dumas told French radio.

FT  25 APR 91 / Allies press UN over Kurdish camps in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, SAFWAN, SOUTHERN IRAQ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France opened talks yesterday with the UN
secretary-general, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, to speed up preparations for
a UN take-over of Kurdish refugee camps in northern Iraq.
At the same time, the British defence secretary, Mr Tom King, yesterday
called on Iraq to remove its forces from the northern Iraqi town of Zakho
immediately, and said Britain would not tolerate obstruction of the
so-called safe havens plan.
Mr King told a news conference in London that the lives of thousands of
Kurdish refugees depended on Iraq pulling its forces from the area around
Zakho.
'They have to go now. So great is the fear that, unless we can meet that
concern and fear, we will have provided facilities which will not do the job
for which they are planned,' Mr King said. President Saddam Hussein
reinforced his government's presence in Zakho yesterday, further frustrating
the west's refugee plan, being carried out without his consent.
Residents said that 500 to 700 uniformed Iraqis had arrived to join an
advance party which drove in by bus on Sunday, and which was described by
the Iraqis as armed 'police'. US-led forces have also boosted their strength
in Zakho.
Kurds in Turkey say they will not go to the haven while Saddam's security
forces remain nearby.
The US has also demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the town, but a
US military spokesman denied statements by British military and diplomatic
sources that the allies had given Iraq 48 hours to pull its forces out of
Zakho. A US military spokesman said Zakho had effectively been partitioned
into two zones - the centre, in Iraqi control and the outskirts in the hands
of the US-led alliance.
In calling for the UN to speed up its plans to take over the safe havens,
the allies feel that while the UN has done a great deal of paper work on
relieving the refugees' plight, it has been slow in putting its proposals
into effect.
They consider that it is high time for the UN to start co-ordinating its
efforts on the ground with the allies' own operations.
Meanwhile, US forces in occupied southern Iraq yesterday handed over the
first of their positions to UN military observers in a simple flag-changing
ceremony at an outpost north of Safwan.
However, the remarks of the US officer at the transfer seemed to add to the
confusion about the timing and role of any full UN presence in the area.
Colonel Bill Nash of the US 1st Army said tersely: 'We will continue to
protect the refugees,' appearing to confirm the UN's reluctance to play a
military role.
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, UN delegate in charge of the refugee programme,
told Mr Douglas Hogg, junior British Foreign Office minister, in Geneva last
Tuesday that the UN had no objection to taking over the camps, according to
British officials.
At the same time, it is clear the international organisation is not prepared
to take over the allied military operation in northern Iraq because it feels
that UN resolution 688 does not give it the authority to do so.

JAPAN and Germany yesterday both took significant steps in relaxing the way
their post-Second World War constitutions are interpreted, allowing their
defence forces to play a role in the Gulf.
The German cabinet yesterday agreed to send 300 Bundeswehr soldiers to Iran
to build a camp for Kurdish refugees. This eased restrictions on the
operation of German troops outside the Nato area: such deployments had been
considered politically unacceptable, although it has never been clear
whether they are banned by the constitution.
Japan meanwhile formally approved the despatch of minesweepers to the Gulf
and the grant of Dollars 100m (Pounds 59m) to help Kurdish refugees. The
moves could signal a new willingness by Japan to contribute to world affairs
following international criticism of its passiveness during the Gulf war.
The despatch of six ships is the first time since 1945 that Japanese troops
have been sent on active service overseas. But Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the
Japanese prime minister, said in a rare televised press conference last
night that the move would not set a precedent for sending other Japanese
military forces abroad in future. He insisted Japan remained wedded to its
peace constitution.
He urged the government's critics at home and overseas to show their support
 -an appeal aimed particularly at China, which has expressed concern that
the minesweeping mission might set a dangerous precedent. Mr Kaifu will have
further opportunities to reassure Japan's Asian neighbours during a tour of
south-east Asia next week.
Mr Kaifu spelt out reasons why Japan felt it was now right to send
minesweepers after the government had rejected the idea in 1987 and again
last year. First, since the Gulf war was finished, there was little risk of
Japanese servicemen being drawn into combat,a development which could
infringe the peace constitution.
Next, minesweeping was different from other kinds of military duty so no
dangerous precedents would be set; then, the safety of ships, including oil
tankers bound for Japan, had to be secured; also, the Gulf states needed the
mines cleared before they could rebuild their economies; finally, Japan had
to make a bigger contribution to the world.
Mr Kaifu said: 'It is not right for Japan to stay aloof from the rest of the
world."
Germany's decision to send troops to Iran, following talks with the Iranian
government, comes soon after its own decision to send minesweepers to the
Gulf. Although both operations are described as exceptional, with the action
in Iran labelled as 'humanitarian' rather military, they indicate a
significant redefinition of what had previously been thought possible.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has promised to revise existing restrictions before
the end of the year.
Officials in the Defence Ministry, who have always supported a wider role
for German troops, have privately welcomed the recent decisions.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, for long opposed to
out-of-Nato operations, seems to have relaxed his position.

JAPANESE police and public prosecutors investigating dubious art and
property deals at Itoman, a large but debt-ridden trading company, yesterday
raided 48 homes and offices across the country.
Officials carried away boxes of documents as part of the investigation into
the suspect transactions.
The investigation followed legal complaints made by Itoman, a trading
company based in Osaka, which alleged that paintings were sold to it at
prices well above the market price, a spokesman for the Osaka police and the
Osaka District Prosecutor's Office said.
The Itoman affair has gripped popular imagination in Japan because - to the
disgust of many ordinary Japanese - the company was at the forefront of
speculating in the property boom of the late 1980s.
When it emerged last year that Itoman was in financial trouble servicing a
Y1,300bn (Pounds 5.5bn) debt, Mr Yoshihiko Kawamura, the company president,
resigned, as did the chairman of Sumitomo Bank, Itoman's main bank.
The prosecutor's office is concentrating its investigation on the purchase
for Y55.7bn of valuable paintings, including a Renoir and a Chagall, which
Itoman says were sold to it at two or three times the market price.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN trade unions moved towards open conflict with the centralised
wage fixing system yesterday after a key committee rejected a 2.5 per cent
pay award by the Industrial Relations Commission, a national labour court.
Under Australian law, the commission has the power to prevent employers
agreeing to increase wages by more than the award unless they seek exemption
as a special case. However, the award conflicts with a separate wages
agreement between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (Actu) and the
federal Labor government, known as the Accord.
The Actu's wages committee said the award was unworkable, and said it would
ask a conference next Wednesday to approve industrial action in defence of
the Accord. If the conference agrees, the unions will campaign for payment
of the latest stage, which includes a ADollars 12 (Pounds 5.40) a week pay
rise from May 16, a 3 per cent increase in employers' pension contributions,
and provisions for further productivity negotiations at company level.
Mr Martin Ferguson, Actu president, said that 'if we as a union movement
sought to implement it (the award), it would be rejected out of hand by
Australian wage and salary earners,' he said.
The federal government also said it opposed the award, and would honour the
Accord for public sector workers and employees of government-owned
businesses, such as railways and airlines.
The response to the Industrial Relations Commission award is likely to
accelerate moves towards the replacement of the centralised labour system by
company-level collective bargaining, which has the support of government,
trade unions and employers. However, employers could face short-term
industrial unrest if the unions go ahead with a campaign for an illegal
breach of the commission's award.

FT  25 APR 91 / Mandela holds 'cordial' talks with Major: De Klerk moves on
to Denmark to plead for easing of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress (ANC),
yesterday held what he called 'cordial and productive' talks with Mr John
Major, the British prime minister, but said they 'did not see eye to eye' on
some issues, including sanctions.
Mr Mandela, who arrived in London shortly after President F W de Klerk left
for Denmark on the second leg of his three-nation European visit, also
expressed his opposition to the planned visit to South Africa later this
year by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary.
Speaking at a press conference after the hour-long session with Mr Major,
the first meeting between the two men, Mr Mandela said that Pretoria should
be kept isolated and under pressure during negotiations for a post-apartheid
South Africa.
British officials said that Mr Major stressed that he and the ANC leader
shared a common objective - the ending of apartheid - but maintained that
lifting sanctions encouraged the reform process.
At the press conference, Mr Mandela repeated his threat to break off talks
with Pretoria on May 9 if President de Klerk did not take further steps to
end township violence.
In Denmark, Mr de Klerk failed to persuade parliamentarians to back the
European Community's recent decision in principle to lift the embargo on
imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins.
The minority Conservative government led by Mr Minister Poul Schluter, who
was due to meet Mr de Klerk, is unable to enact Community policy without the
approval of the Danish parliament.
Conservatives argue that Pretoria should be rewarded for its reforms, but
opposition parties in parliament's Market Affairs Committee, led by the
Social Democrats, won a vote to maintain sanctions against South Africa.
In theory, Denmark can exercise an effective veto over implementation of the
Community decision to lift sanctions. But Community officials suggested
yesterday that in practice continued Danish opposition would do no more than
cause a delay.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Fears grow for Gatt disputes system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES are growing in Gatt that the credibility of its dispute settlement
system may be undermined by the number of findings left unimplemented by the
delay in completing the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Peter Montagnon, World
Trade Editor, writes.
Mr Lars Anell, who heads Gatt's governing council, said yesterday he was
starting talks with parties involved to find a way out of the problem.
Resolution of the five long-standing disputes affected hinges on outcome of
the Round.
Adding to trade diplomats' worries is the fact they all involve leading
trade powers whose behaviour sets the tone for the trading system as a
whole.
They include findings against the US that its patent law discriminates
against foreign companies, and that its countervailing duties on Canadian
pork breach Gatt rules.
The EC has failed to implement two findings - against its rules on
circumvention of anti-dumping and subsidies to oilseed crushers. Japan has
failed to liberalise dairy-product and starch imports.
All, except the anti-dumping circumvention case, were raised by parties
concerned in the Gatt Council yesterday, when the US declined for the fifth
time to agree to adoption of the Canadian pork finding.
Japan said it was raising the question of US patent law, because it
understood a new investigation had been started against one of its companies
under Section 337.
No immediate solution has been found, and the view is growing that action
must be taken. Mr Anell told the council the threat to Gatt's credibility
was serious.
South Korea met a frosty reception from its fellow Gatt members yesterday
when it launched a programme to liberalise trade in a further 133 products,
mostly agricultural, as part of a phased move to unwind curbs allowed to
developing countries with balance-of-payments problems.
The US joined other countries including Canada, the EC and New Zealand in
calling the offer disappointing.
Mr Young Woo Park, Seoul's deputy ambassador to Gatt, said his government
faced opposition from farmers to the liberalisation.
South Korea, which returned to current account deficit last year for the
first time since the mid-1980s, has resisted attempts to open its farm
imports in the Round.

The compensation act will give about Ft100bn (Dollars 1.35bn) in bonds and
land to the estimated 1.5m families who had property nationalised after June
1949.
The decision was greeted with relief that the uncertainty over ownership had
been reduced. But few are entirely satisfied by the act's unwieldy
compromise between righting the past and encouraging new investment.
Former owners and their direct descendants will have 90 days to make a
claim. Then they can get up to Ft5m in financial restitution: bonds which
can used to buy into privatisations.
Parliament yesterday rejected giving former owners of shops and flats an
automatic first option on their old property.
But peasants will be able to physically take back land whether or not they
intend to cultivate it, reflecting the conservative government's dependence
on the Smallholder's Party for its parliamentary majority.
The settlement is much narrower than that envisaged in recent Czechoslovak
legislation. The cost of Hungarian compensation is a small part of total
state property, which was worth Ft6,000bn in 1988.

TENS of thousands of supporters of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the ousted Slovak
prime minister, took to the streets of Bratislava yesterday demanding his
reinstatement.
In one of the largest rallies in Slovakia since the overthrow of the
communist regime in 1989 demonstrators accused the regional parliament of
'treachery' and called 'We want Meciar'.
Public transport workers staged a token stoppage and traffic in the city was
brought to a standstill. Workers in several factories called for strikes and
protests also took place in other towns around Slovakia, the state news
agency CTK reported.
The all-party presidium, or steering committee, of the parliament dismissed
Mr Meciar and brought to a head a six-week political crisis which began when
he led a breakaway from the ruling Public Against Violence (VPN).
Mr Meciar was replaced by his deputy Mr Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the
Christian Democratic Movement, who said the VPN split had led to the
isolation of Slovakia both internationally and within the Czechoslovak
federation.
The leading Czech newspaper, Lidove Noviny, expressed the hope that Mr
Carnogursky could lead independent-minded Slovakia to more normal relations
with Prague and greater acceptance of economic reforms.
Mr Milan Sutovac, chairman of the Upper House of the Czechoslovak Parliament
and a former political ally of Mr Meciar, suggested that the ousted leader
might try to rebuild his political position in Slovakia 'via the streets'.
Mr Meciar is by far the most popular politician in Slovakia and recently
formed his own rival movement, Platform for a Democratic Slovakia, which
seeks to slow the pace of economic reforms.

FT  25 APR 91 / Real life upsets the cosy world of EC machinations: The work
of the conferences on political and monetary union risks being overtaken by
events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCONVENIENTLY for Eurocrats, time refuses to stand still while the European
Community redesigns itself.
The Community's two inter-governmental conferences (IGCs) on political and
monetary union, which in nearly four months have produced some tentative
compromises but no firm deals, risk being buffeted by events in the real
world - Chancellor Helmut Kohl's domestic political setbacks, the prospect
of a British general election, and, from the outside, the banging of more
applicants on the Community's door.
Eastern Europe's expectations of what the EC can and should do for it
continue to gallop ahead of the reality of what the Community is offering.
Before the ink was dry on economic co-operation agreements, eastern Europe
was clamouring for fully-fledged political association and free trade
accords.
Last week, Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, bent under
the pressure and proposed 'affiliate' membership for countries craving the
political security of belonging to the Community before being able to meet
the economic test of membership. The IGCs were studiously ignoring the
implications of the Community growing to 24 members, the Commissioner
complained.
Mr Andriessen's idea that countries could select certain EC activities in
which to participate as full members may speed membership bids from European
Free Trade Association (Efta) countries. Just when Efta's frustration is
reaching breaking point at being offered only a voice on the key EC
legislation - that would form the core of the planned European Economic Area
(EEA) - up pops someone in Brussels with a scheme to give them a vote.
Talks are being held today between senior officials and next month between
ministers to save the EEA negotiations; but if they fail, Sweden may not be
the only Efta country this summer to follow Austria in applying to join the
EC club.
In fact, the IGC on political union has now agreed on a kind of variable
ers. This divides Community activities into three:
Standard policies (still largely economic) set by the standard machinery of
the Council/Parliament legislating on Commission proposals.
Common foreign and security policy with a relatively small role for the
Commission and almost none for the Parliament.
A purely inter-governmental area of co-operation on police and judicial
issues such as drugs, crime and immigration.
For all, actual and potential members alike, the most sensitive aspect is
defence, on which there are now three competing drafts. The Luxembourg
presidency proposes that defence matters 'can' be wholly or partly dealt
with by the Western European Union (WEU) with a review in 1996; the
Netherlands, backed by the UK, proposes that all defence matters 'will' be
treated by WEU; and France wants some EC involvement, at summit level, in
defence from the outset and the 1996 review to create a common EC defence
policy.
This internal debate will divide outsiders. East Europeans, frustrated by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's refusal to offer them any formal
association, may want to see a common EC defence policy that one day might
cover them, while neutral Efta countries hope no such policy will emerge.
Another indicator of how supranational the Community may become is the
degree to which the European Parliament is given a say in EC law-making
equal to that enjoyed by the Council of Ministers. Luxembourg proposes
giving MEPs, whose present amending powers depend crucially on Commission
support, a right of 'co-decision' on a new category of framework laws.
This goes too far for countries such as Britain and Denmark, but has been
strongly attacked by the Parliament which (along with Germany) wants
co-decision across the board and by the Commission which sees its brokering
role in legislation disappearing. The Luxembourg plan calls for a
'conciliation committee' between the Parliament and Council - akin to the
Capitol Hill 'conferences' that resolve deadlocks between the two houses of
the US Congress - with the Commission shut out.
In comparison to the feverish discussions on political union, the IGC on
economic and monetary union (Emu) has been more akin to a leisurely academic
seminar. Perhaps because of this, the heat has been taken out of the crucial
transition question for the UK government: how to sign an Emu treaty without
committing itself to a timetable to join in a single currency?
There now seems to be near-consensus on two negative principles, according
to one IGC negotiator, in which no country could be compelled by the others
into Emu, and no country could defy others in insisting on joining Emu. Were
it not, therefore, for approaching UK election fever, Prime Minister John
Major's government could feel comfortable.
This is, however, a side-show for the other 11 countries which are still
arguing about what economic discipline is needed to bolster a monetary
union, and what powers the planned European central bank should have before
it starts running a single currency.
Germany has so far played it tough. Will it soften with the weakening
fortunes of the D-mark and Mr Kohl? Or will the Chancellor feel he cannot
risk further trouble at home by making European compromises? Many in
Brussels fear the latter may prove true.

FT  25 APR 91 / New World Order requires wider and deeper EC: Danish foreign
minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen explains his vision of the Community's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By UFFE ELLEMANN-JENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Europe in the New World Order: that is the issue which the foreign
ministers of the Twelve will discuss at their meeting in Luxembourg this
weekend. It is a much more precise description than talking about the
establishment of a political union in Europe.
We should not underestimate the magnitude of our job. And for one simple
reason: the political and economic landscape in Europe has undergone
significant changes.
After the Gulf war it has become clear that the threats to our societies
have diversified. We should no longer pay attention to the developments in
the Soviet Union only. Crises in the Near and Middle East, mass-migration,
world poverty and threats against the environment should be added to the
list.
Denmark considers the European Community to be the most important block on
which to build our New Europe. It has a true magnetic pull. It is based on
law. It is based on sound principles: basically shifting coalitions between
member states - which make the national interests converge. Not a small
achievement, considering Europe's past.
At the inter-governmental conferences (IGC) we now have to sketch out a way
towards an economic and monetary union (Emu) and towards a political union.
Denmark has tabled proposals which show a way forward. Our goal is to widen
and deepen the Community. We want to enlarge it with new member states: the
Efta (European Free Trade Association) countries and countries in central
and eastern Europe. We also want to strike a balance between growing
internationalisation and regionalism. We want to shape a new relationship
between the over-regulated society and market forces.
Originally, the European Community was set up in order to promote and
enhance French/German reconciliation. The goals were political, the means
economic. History forces us to redress the former equation. We have to
discuss how to handle the questions of a common foreign and security policy,
of the European pillar in the defence of Europe.
In essence, it is necessary to strike a proper balance between the European
Community, WEU (Western European Union) and Nato (North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation). It is the Danish view that the common foreign and security
policy should in principle extend to all aspects where unanimity can be
achieved among the member states. Military co-operation proper should be
undertaken within existing alliance structures with member states' present
defence commitments being honoured. Member states should unanimously
establish the common foreign and security policy.
Denmark and the UK share the view that, whatever the outcome of the
negotiations, one thing will remain certain: without Nato, European defence
arrangements would lack credibility, nor would they inspire confidence in
the remaining part of Europe.
The strength of the security glue, which for 40 years has kept western
Europe together, is being reduced. That is why we consider it a major goal
to avoid a re-nationalisation of defence policies in the new European
Architecture.
Europe's voice in the New World Order should be strengthened - economically,
politically and defence-wise. If we fail and leave a disproportion between
Europe's economic strength and its political resourcefulness, we would also
leave a Europe on dangerous tracks.
The days are gone when it really made sense to talk about autonomy and
sovereignty. The issue before us is about pooling resources. By
strengthening international co-operation you necessarily limit your room for
manoeuvre - but also for making mistakes. To drive my point home: an
economic and monetary union makes it impossible for a member state to pursue
a high inflationary policy coupled with successive devaluations.
We consider Emu a necessity. To some extent it is a natural consequence of
the liberalisation of capital movements. We want to go ahead with the
project after sufficient economic convergence has taken place, primarily
because you can reap all the benefits only in the third phase. Second,
because we want to have a say in the decisions which, in any case, set the
framework for our own national policies.
What does Europe really need then? We need the right blend of visions and
ideas - of prudence and pragmatism. Ideas should be far-reaching, but not
out of step with reality. Otherwise they could backfire and create a
credibility problem.
It may seem odd to hear such words from a Danish foreign minister. After
all, we have for some years been seen as footdraggers in the Community. But
we have reversed our policy. I admit it without hesitation. We have learned
some lessons, and we consider it imperative to strengthen the Community in
order to create our New Europe in the New World Order.

FT  25 APR 91 / Banker tells of fears over Soviet debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET debt could rise from Dollars 65bn to Dollars 75bn or more by the end
of this year, a worrying rate of increase, says Mr Georg Krupp, Deutsche
Bank's director responsible for eastern Europe.
He said banks would now only lend to the Soviet Union against state
guarantees, while exporters faced huge practical problems. As a result of
decentralisation, they now had to deal with more than 40,000 Soviet
companies, compared with 40 central foreign trade organisations previously.
Mr Krupp said the Moscow government's compromise economic reform plan lacked
a clear concept of privatisation and contained only half-hearted measures;
it was neither market nor plan.
Despite the difficulties, Mr Krupp said the Soviet Union needed western
support. The funds to support the move from a planned to a free economy
could only be raised by a joint effort of western countries, private banks,
and institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
He hoped this weekend's Group of Seven meeting would revive the idea of an
Dollars 18bn Marshall Plan for the Soviet Union. The G7 officials will
discuss this, as well as closer links between Moscow and the IMF and World
Bank.
He added that west German banks had unsecured loans of DM10bn (Dollars
5.9bn) with the Soviet Union, with credits backed by the Hermes export
guarantee organisation exceeding DM12bn.
The financing of German exports was now only possible with the backing of
Hermes, which would become more selective; Soviet-German trade was likely to
drop even further, at least temporarily.

FT  25 APR 91 / UK offers to boost investment in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, and President Lech Walesa of Poland
(pictured right) yesterday signed a joint declaration in which Britain
undertook to encourage investment in Poland and expressed its support for
Poland's bid to become an associate member of the European Community.
The declaration was signed in Downing Street on the second day of Mr
Walesa's state visit to Britain and before an hour's talks between the two
leaders, described as 'warm and friendly'.
The four-page document disclosed that Britain had agreed to write off Pounds
750m (Dollars 1.3bn) of official Polish debt as part of the Paris Club's
decision earlier this month to reduce by 50 per cent Poland's total official
debts of Pounds 19bn (Dollars 33bn).
Though Poland welcomed this move, Mr Walesa urged Britain in a speech at the
Guildhall last night to make an even more generous gesture, as the US and
France had done.
The declaration said that Britain and Poland would 'encourage mutually
beneficial economic and industrial co-operation and promote closer
commercial contacts between the enterprises in our two countries.'
Britain recognised the importance to Poland of increased western investment
and would continue to encourage companies to invest there. The UK also
promised to consider granting medium-term credits to Poland.
In welcoming Poland's negotiations with the EC for associate membership,
Britain stressed that the option of full membership should be available when
Poland was able to meet the political and economic obligations involved.
It was announced earlier that the bank SG Warburg had been chosen to act as
consultants to the Polish government for its privatisation of 500
enterprises. The Foreign Office said that it had agreed in principle to
finance this arrangement from the British government's five-year Pounds 50m
'Know-How Fund for Poland.'
In his speech at the Guildhall, where he was the guest of the Lord Mayor of
London, Mr Walesa said Poland had helped to eliminate the barriers which had
divided Europe ideologically for 40 years. 'We do not want them replaced by
economic barriers.'

FT  25 APR 91 / Autocrat who bolstered Bundesbank independence: Obituary -
Karl Klasen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karl Klasen, the former Bundesbank president who died in Hamburg on
Monday, a day before his 82nd birthday, was an autocratic Social Democrat
who presided over the West German central bank during one of its most
turbulent periods.
He joined the Bundesbank when already wealthy after a career in private
banking, spending 13 years on the board of the Deutsche Bank from 1957
onwards, the last three as joint chief executive.
At the Bundesbank he took a lordly pride in leaving day-to-day affairs in
the hands of subordinates. During his time in office between 1970 and 1977
he bolstered the central bank's reputation for independence. He developed a
well-known disdain for colleagues who read the fine print of economic
analyses. But through his natural sovereignty and a few well-chosen words,
he could exert immediate control over a roomful of bankers.
Mr Klasen's relationship with Mr Otmar Emminger, a peppery and egocentric
economist who was his deputy, was cool to the point of frigidity. In
contrast to Mr Klasen, Mr Emminger's attention to detail was minute, even
extending to occasionally drawing some of the Bundesbank's monetary charts
himself.
Mr Klasen formed a close friendship with Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former
chancellor,
and Mr Karl Schiller, the legendary economics minister who helped bring Mr
Klasen to the top Bundesbank job.
He fell out with Mr Schiller during the crisis over the breakdown of the
Bretton Woods currency system. Mr Klasen's refusal to follow Mr Schiller's
suggestion of floating the D-Mark in 1972 led to Mr Schiller's resignation.
Even though the government was later forced to bow to the inevitable and
revalue the D-Mark, Mr Klasen's stature improved after Mr Schiller's
resignation. In 1973 to 1975, in the wake of high pay settlements after the
1973 oil crisis, Mr Klasen surprised many by stepping firmly on the monetary
brakes to curb inflation. He earned the reputation of provoking Germany's
1975 recession. But the lesson that the Bundesbank could act tough when the
economic going was at its most difficult was not lost on the politicians.

FT  25 APR 91 / Economy 'bad and getting worse' says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH wave of gloom over Britain's economic prospects cast further doubt
yesterday on government claims that the recession will begin to lift later
this year.
Mr John Banham, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
claimed parts of manufacturing industry were now in a slump, with order
books in many sectors lower than in any post-war period.
His remarks came as the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering
Employers' Federation also said the recession remained firmly entrenched.
Mr Banham added that the state of the overall economy was 'bad and getting
worse', a picture that will be confirmed when the CBI publishes its
quarterly trends survey next week.
His comments, which followed the Institute of Directors' criticism on
Tuesday of the government's handling of the economy, were noticeably less
optimistic than last month, when he said the economy appeared to have
'ticked up noticeably'.
Mr Banham emphasised that the rate of deterioration was slowing and that
factory gate price rises, together with the rate of pay settlements, had
fallen markedly.
But he said that without further, early cuts in interest rates the prospects
for economic revival remained poor.
Although the CBI agrees with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the
economy should begin to recover in the second half of the year, Mr Banham
said it would be 'well towards the end of the year' before any improvement
became widespread.
The British Chambers of Commerce delivered the first survey of business
confidence since Mr Lamont's announcement that he intended to pay more
attention to such soundings in assessing the shape of economic recovery.
The survey showed that the economy plunged further into recession during the
first quarter of this year, with the service sector rapidly following
manufacturing industry into sharp decline.
The British Chambers of Commerce added that any end to the recession
remained 'faint and elusive'.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, led a renewed Labour attack on the
government's economic record, claiming the survey provided further evidence
that the economy was in 'a deep and damaging recession'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, demanded that Mr
John Major should 'wake up to the damage his economic policies are doing
countrywide'.
The Engineering Employers' Federation added to the bleak picture, following
publication of its own survey suggesting that the engineering sector was
unlikely to experience any recovery until the middle of next year.
With output, productivity, employment and exports all dropping, a further
90,000 engineering jobs could be lost over the next year, it said.

FT  25 APR 91 / Kurdish rebels claim autonomy agreement with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IRAQI rebel leader said yesterday that President Saddam Hussein had
agreed to grant a measure of autonomy to the Kurds, raising the prospect of
a negotiated end to the disaster that has forced more than 2m Kurds to flee
their homes in northern Iraq, write our foreign staff.
Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, announced the
deal 'in principle' after talks with the Iraqi president.
Shortly before the announcement, Mr Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, Iraq's UN
ambassador, said it was his 'impression' an autonomous state might result
from the talks. Asked how far Baghdad was prepared to go towards Kurdish
autonomy, he said: 'They seem to be going all the way.'
Mr Talabani immediately appealed to thousands of refugee Kurdish families
who fled towards Iran and Turkey after a failed uprising to return to their
homes in northern Iraq.
Reaction from Washington and London was cautious. Officials said they had no
confirmation a deal had been signed. One US official said he hoped any deal
'would help facilitate the sense of security for people to return to their
homes', but the US was 'sceptical' because Saddam had previously broken
verbal promises.
Mr Talabani said the deal covered implementation of a March 11 1970 autonomy
agreement between the Kurds, who form 20 per cent of Iraq's population, and
the central government, he added. Negotiations with the authorities in
Baghdad would be resumed on Sunday to flesh out the agreement.
It remains to be seen if Mr Saddam will accept Kurdish demands for a
genuinely autonomous region within a democratic Iraq, for control of oil
revenue from Kurdish areas and for international guarantees to bolster any
agreement that is signed.
Both sides however need a deal. Mr Saddam's army has been weakened by the
Gulf war and he would not be able to use chemical weapons against the Kurds
without angering the international community.
The Kurdish guerrillas are still a force to be reckoned with in the
mountains, but they face an uphill task if nearly 2m refugees - half the
Kurds of Iraq - do not return to their homes.

FT  25 APR 91 / GEC Avionics wins Pounds 300m stealth jet computer order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORDERS WORTH more than Pounds 300m to supply flight computers and cockpit
display equipment for the next generation of US stealth fighter aircraft
will be announced today by GEC Avionics.
The deal will make the company the only large British supplier for the new
US Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) to be built by a consortium including
Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, which was selected by the US Pentagon
on Tuesday.
It also comes on the heels of another contract announced yesterday by GEC
Avionics, which is the aerospace subsidiary of the General Electric Company.
That contract is to supply the primary flight computer system for Boeing's
new wide-bodied commercial airliner, the 777.
Mr Brian Tucker, GEC Avionics managing director, said the potential value of
the combined ATF and Boeing 777 contracts was more than Pounds 500m over 15
years. He added that the orders were initially worth Pounds 60m-Pounds 70m
for the fighter work and more than Pounds 45m for the Boeing 777.
Boeing has so far received launch orders for the 777 from United Airlines
and All Nippon Airways.
The US is planning to commission 650 ATFs, expected to cost Dollars 65bn
(Pounds 38bn) over the next two decades, which would make it the largest
ever aerospace contract.
'The ATF deal places us on both the next generation US tactical fighter
programme and the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme,' Mr Tucker
said.
The UK company has been contracted to supply display and flight control
systems for the EFA and has prime responsibility for the European
three-nation Tornado military aircraft flight control system.
It also supplies computer systems for the European Airbus commercial
aircraft programme.
GEC-Avionics, which is based at Rochester, Kent, where it employs 5000
people, will develop and supply the ATF's pilot's head-up display system,
the pilot's side stick controller and the vehicle management system which
includes the computer fly-by-wire flight controls, hydraulics and
environmental control.
GEC Avionics has become the world's largest supplier of head up display
systems, which enable pilots to see at eye level all their flight manoeuvres
and weapon aiming.
Mr Tucker said the US, the world's biggest aerospace market, now accounted
for about 60 per cent of his company's exports.
Two other British companies, Smiths Industries and Hawker Siddeley, have won
this month substantial orders to supply components for the new Boeing 777.

FT  25 APR 91 / Gorbachev agrees to relax grip on the rebel republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REBELLIOUS Soviet republics will be allowed to pursue their plans for full
independence under the constitution following a landmark agreement between
embattled President Mikhail Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
leader, on a new union treaty.
The deal may open the way for a much broader base of political consensus and
could bring further agreements on a new government composed of different
political forces. It also saved Mr Gorbachev from serious challenge during
the first day of a plenary meeting of the Communist Party's Central
Committee, at which some hardliners were expected to press for his
resignation.
A joint statement, published yesterday after being signed on Tuesday night
by the two men and eight other leaders of Soviet republic, commits them to
an agreement on such a treaty, followed by a new constitution and fresh
union elections, as soon as possible.
The plan agreed yesterday would also explicitly allow the six other
republics - the three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia plus
Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia - the right not to sign a union agreement.
These republics were not represented at the meeting. The agreement in turn
implies, although the phrasing is vague, that the six could instead proceed
to full independence.
The statement warns that those republics would then be expected to settle
their accounts with the union in hard currency. Mr Yuri Kahn, Estonia's
permanent envoy to Moscow, welcomed the declaration as 'progress' even
though it would mean paying more for energy and other supplies.
'Of course, economically it will be very difficult but it is a very
important step in the direction of a market economy. We understand that
sooner or later we must go to world market prices,' he said. Politically, it
had the merit of recognising the Baltic states' 'legal right not to sign the
union treaty'.
Mr Gorbachev's coup in securing agreement on some of the most fundamental
issues facing the Soviet Union opens the possibility of further talks on a
new form of government bringing in different political forces - or, as some
people are calling for, a more powerful Federation Council uniting leaders
of the republics under Mr Gorbachev's chairmanship.
It also suggests that the Soviet president is moving away from the hardline
camp on whose support he has relied in recent months, back to an alliance
with more radical forces. In so doing, he risks the wrath of groups such as
the Soyuz faction in the union parliament, which has already called for a
special congress to review his performance. Mr Gorbachev got the agreement -
published yesterday only in the late editions of Pravda, the organ of the
Communist Party central committee - just as the central committee was
gathering for a plenary meeting at which hardliners had threatened to raise
the issue of his future as general secretary.
First indications were that he had avoided any serious challenge. Members of
the central committee said that specific motions to unseat him had been kept
off the agenda.
The key to the agreement with the republics apparently lies in the final
paragraph which says that its signatories realise that 'these measures are
inconceivable without a fundamental increase in the role of the union
republics.'
A spokesman for the government suggested this would be achieved through
economic agreements between the centre and republics.
The anti-crisis programme spells out 10 types of economic agreement to be
concluded with the republics, in areas ranging from price liberalisation and
privatisation to the formation of the budget.
Mr Yeltsin's press spokeswoman said that she believed the statement would
lead to the start of the 'round table' talks proposed by the Russian leader.
At the same time, Mr Yeltsin has lent his authority to a call for an end to
strikes and for 'strict compliance with current laws'; to a 'special regime'
of work in basic industries; and to a statement which characterised as
'intolerable' any attempts to attain political ends through 'incitement to
civil disobedience, strikes or calls for the overthrow of the existing
lawfully elected state power bodies'.
It was not clear last night whether the agreement would succeed in ending
the current wave of strikes, in spite of Mr Yeltsin's considerable authority
over striking miners in the Russian Federation.
Meanwhile, the Soviet army appeared to be keeping up the pressure in
Lithuania by taking over the Agro-Industrial Bank in Vilnius, the capital,
in spite of the start of talks between the central government and Lithuania
and promises by the Kremlin to resolve disputes by political means.

FT  25 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures slipped lower yesterday on fears of a major rights issue
and nervousness ahead of the ICI quarterly results due today.
For most of the session, the June FT-SE 100 index traded below the level
which brokers calculate is necessary to take account of future dividend
payments and financing cost.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,514, down 13 points on the day but just 27 points
above the spot index, compared with brokers' estimate of a 30-point fair
value premium.
During the early part of the session, the futures market provided some
support to the underlying market. Later in the day, the fears of a rights
issue unnerved dealers and prices were marked lower.
In the traded options market, Hoare Govett announced it had withdrawn from
market making. At its peak, Hoare had more than 12 marketmakers but
yesterday just three were left to be made redundant. Hoare will continue to
broke options to institutions.
Overall turnover on the options market remained depressed, with just 24,499
contracts traded, barely changed on the day and below the level necessary
for the market to cover its costs.
Marks and Spencer was the busiest option, 1,506 changing hands as the shares
receded. GrandMet traded 1,449 and British Airways 1,248.

FT  25 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie again dips below 2,500 level
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FADING HOPES for interest rate cuts, together with underlying fears of
further rights issues from leading UK companies, drove the UK stock market
well below FT-SE 2,500 yesterday. Once again it was lack of support that
undermined share prices rather than selling pressure.
ICI gave ground on nervousness that today's trading statement for the first
quarter could include a rights issue. Other international blue chips were
unsettled by currency concern as central banks continued to sell the dollar.
Optimism on interest rates continued to melt away, discouraged further by
the view of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that current
inflation levels do not justify further cuts in US rates.
Equities opened higher in London and struggled forward briefly until the
premium on the Footsie futures contract began to fade. Then the hints of
impending rights issues, ranging widely across the market sectors, turned
share prices downwards. The Footsie, already more than 15 points off,
extended its fall when Wall Street opened the new session on an uncertain
note.
London rallied when Wall Street reversed early weakness to show a gain of 9
Dow points in UK hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,488.6, a
fall on the day of 15.2 points.
Seaq volume fell to 436.7m shares from the 520.6m of the previous session,
both figures making a poor comparison with the 700m-share daily averages
achieved during the market advance in February and March. The latest daily
figure for retail or customer interest in equities was only Pounds 751.4m, a
return to the unprofitable levels which have concerned the UK market for
much of the past four years.
Rights issue hints were refuelled yesterday by two more relatively small
fund-raising moves; Hardy Oil &amp; Gas called for Pounds 27.6m and Ashtead for
Pounds 5.8m. The list of rights issues continues to lengthen, but this month
has yet to produce the large scale funding move said in the market to be
planned by a leading Footsie company.
Glaxo, the pharmaceutical group, provided a lonely firm feature among blue
chip internationals, helped by a recommendation from a London securities
house. The rest of the sector slipped lower, often in thinnish trading.
Reuters, the global reporting agency, came under pressure from US selling as
soon as Wall Street opened. The focus on Glaxo took the heart out of
SmithKline Beecham.
There was no further support for retail stocks, which brightened briefly at
the beginning of the week on a report from the Confederation of British
Industry that high street spending improved last month. Among the sector
leaders, Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher shaded easier.
Strategists commented that the London market appears to have lost confidence
for the short term outlook, which is now clouded by political as well as
economic uncertainties. Hopes for an early reduction in base rates have been
put on hold, in spite of the confident comments this week by the UK
chancellor of the exchequer at a conference of senior UK business
executives.
The City is also nervous ahead of the UK local government elections to be
held early next month. These could hold the key to the timing of the next
General Election, which the governing Conservative party must hold by July
1992. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew believes that any prospective economic recovery
may not be enough to help the government's re-election next year.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Volume low ahead of
Golden Week holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE stronger yen failed to attract investors to equities yesterday, and
share prices ended weaker after showing initial gains and trading within a
narrow range for most of the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average, which improved 254 points on Tuesday, lost 161.36 to
26,330.21 after a high for the day of 26,585.66 and a low of 26,329.22.
Activity remained slack ahead of the Golden Week holidays, with 350m shares
changing hands. Traders said that yesterday was the last trading day for
April deliveries, and that this also depressed turnover.
Declines led advances by 635 to 329, with 170 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 8.49 to 1,974.03, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up a slight 0.55 at 1,496.72.
The fall on the futures market prompted profit-taking by investors looking
to sell before the holidays. But Mr Dominic Henderson at Jardine Fleming
said many foreign investors were waiting to buy as soon as the currency
market stabilised.
Japanese brokerages tried to revive the market by promoting big companies
with good earnings prospects. Kobe Steel, the most active issue of the day,
rose to a high of Y555 but closed down a net Y7 at Y545. The company expects
its aluminium business to boost its results. Other large-capital issues also
lost ground, with Nippon Steel down Y3 to Y469.
Electricals responded favourably to comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, US
Federal Reserve chairman, that the US economy was recovering. Sharp advanced
Y30 to Y1,580.
Investors turned to small and medium-sized companies with low liquidity for
short-term profits. Tsugami, a medium-sized machine tool maker, climbed Y81
to Y850 on individual buying. The company is expected to increase sales of
its machine tools due to demand for labour-saving equipment.
Taiyo Sanso, an industrial gas producer, gained Y79 to Y1,070, rising over
Y1,000 for the first time since November. Individual investors sought the
stock on the company's growth in gas purification systems for
semiconductors.
Nippon Electric Glass, a cathode ray tube maker, forged ahead Y170 to
Y2,150. It has developed technology to mass-produce boro-silicate glass for
liquid crystal displays. Rumours that a large speculative group was chasing
the issue also buoyed the shares.
Mitsumi, a system components manufacturer, put on Y10 to Y1,640 on reports
that it has received additional orders for Super Family Computer, Nintendo's
new video game.
Nippon Oil rose to Y1,130 on news that it expects pre-tax profits for the
year to end-March to increase by 120 per cent, but closed unchanged at
Y1,090 on profit-taking. Other oil refiners remained firm, with General
Sekiyu adding Y90 at Y1,200 and Mitsubishi Oil Y20 at Y1,160.
Itoman, the trading company in financial trouble due to its extensive real
estate and stock investments, fell Y33 to Y628. The company is now involved
in an art scandal, and reports that prosecutors had started investigations
by searching the company's offices prompted heavy selling.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 77.07 to 29,346.71 on volume of 32.6m shares.
Roundup
MOST Pacific Rim markets recovered yesterday after their recent weakness.
NEW ZEALAND, after three days of falls, rallied on foreign buying interest
and a positive outlook for domestic interest rates. The Barclays index
closed 29.49 or 2.0 per cent higher at 1,473.45 after turnover of NZDollars
20.9m (NZDollars 13.9m). Fletcher Challenge put on 8 cents to NZDollars 3.92
on volume of 1.6m shares, while Carter Holt Harvey regained 6 cents to
NZDollars 1.73 on 2.8m shares traded. The market is closed today for Anzac
Day.
JAKARTA was higher in active trading following a tightening in disclosure
rules. Volume expanded to 7.42m shares from 5.83m and the index rose 4.03 to
419.58.
The Capital Market Supervisory Board, which runs the exchange, tightened
disclosure rules for public companies, including a requirement to present
detailed financial reports and analysis on prospects. The banking sector led
the gains on speculation that the government would soon allow foreigners to
buy banking shares.
AUSTRALIA gained ground ahead of the Veterans Holiday today, mainly as
investors converted expiring options. The All Ordinaries index improved 7.9
to 1,518.5 but turnover fell to ADollars 241m from ADollars 253m.
Australian Consolidated Investments sold 7 per cent or 100m shares in Nine
Network for 55 cents a share to a wide spread of investors. Nine Network
eased 2 cents to 58 cents.
HONG KONG rebounded in moderate trading, but steep early gains were pared by
late profit-taking. The Hang Seng index climbed 63 points shortly after the
opening but ended 35.65 up at 3,605.29 on turnover of HKDollars 1.2bn
(HKDollars 1.3bn).
MANILA finished higher on short-covering and bargain hunting. The composite
index rose 23.48 to 1,046.31 in turnover of 111.4m pesos, against a previous
116.6m.
TAIWAN bounced up in narrow trading, driving the market again to the 5,800
chart resistance point. However, there was concern over power rationing
which could harm industry's productivity. The weighted index rallied 74.65
or 1.3 per cent to 5,806.74. Turnover slipped to TDollars 53.59bn from
TDollars 70.73bn.
SINGAPORE closed at the day's high after a soft start. The Straits Times
Industrial index gained 10.58 to 1,536.67 in turnover of SDollars 188.5m, up
from SDollars 145m.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index firmed 2.46 to 590.84 in volume of 46.7m
shares, after Tuesday's 35.9m.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Olivetti falls 2.6 per cent as
it passes 1990 dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES had a sensitive look about them yesterday, reacting both to company
news, and to speculation about impending results or rights issues, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN saw particular weakness in Olivetti ahead of the announcement of its
1990 results after the market's official close. The Comit index fell 3.95 to
589.22 in thin volume before today's holiday.
Olivetti dropped L101 or 2.6 per cent to L3,769 on strong fears that the
1990 dividend might be halved or worse, omitted. After the market closed the
computer company reported a 70 per cent drop in net profit and passed the
dividend. Dealers said that although Milan would be closed today, the shares
could come under severe selling pressure in London since Olivetti has a
listing on Seaq International. Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, Cir,
dropped L25 to L2,635.
Generali lost another L400 to L37,500. Three state-controlled banks said
they had bought Generali shares recently.
PARIS was enlivened by a busy oil sector and resisted poor March trade data.
The CAC-40 index ended 0.20 higher at 1,782.03 but volume was thin at
FFr1.45bn.
Oil shares were boosted by sparkling first quarter earnings reports from US
oil companies on Tuesday. Total, which has considerable refining capacity in
the US, surged to 12-month high of FFr766 before easing to end FFr28 or 3.9
per cent higher at FFr756 on heavy volume of 251,800 shares. Dealers spoke
of genuine buying interest, although they added that there was also talk of
an imminent rights issue. Elf rose FFr6.60 to FFr343 with 152,000 shares
traded.
Among the second-liners, L'Oreal rose FFr16 to FFr565 with 87,420 shares
traded while Synthelabo jumped FFr58 or 7.34 per cent to FFr848, the
bigrenewed speculation that L'Oreal was about to sell its stake in it.
FRANKFURT ended firmer, but off its highs with the DAX index 6.68 higher at
1603.73 after a rise of 2.16 to 678.92 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume
moved up from DM6bn to DM6.1bn but financials, carmakers and energy stocks
were flat, leaving chemicals, a few retailers and some steels and engineers
to give the market its modest lift.
Ms Barbara Schumacher, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, thought that the market
was just ticking over. Like other professionals, she has seen the DAX attack
the 1,600 to 1,620 level a number of times this year, only to fall back.
Many foreign institutions, she said, have been underweight in Germany for
some months and seem to be happy in that position. That means no big sellers
to test, and perhaps prove market improvements in real volume.
Profit-taking took IG Farben down DM1.10 to DM27.90, after its DM3.20 rise
on Tuesday on east German property compensation prospects. It was thought
that the gains in steels and engineering, with Hoesch up DM7 to DM274,
Thyssen DM5 to DM227.50 and Klockner-Werke DM4 to DM155, might reflect
rotation of compensation speculation out of chemicals and carmakers, and
into the heavy end of the industrial economy.
ZURICH featured a SFr240 rise to SFr5,190 gain for Sulzer after the
engineering company said that it planned to open its share register to
foreigners. However volume in Sulzer remained limited; a 20 per cent stake
in the company is owned by the troubled Omni Holdings, and 10 per cent by
Omni's former chairman, Mr Werner Rey. Sulzer also said that profits could
drop in 1991.
After a rumour of a rights issue for CS Holding, the parent of Credit
Suisse, took its shares down SFr70 to SFr2,110, the Credit Suisse index
closed 0.9 higher at 555.7.
AMSTERDAM had a volatile session, starting off on a strong note then
drifting lower only to recover in the afternoon on the back of a respectable
opening on Wall Street and surprisingly strong results from Akzo. The CBS
Tendency index closed up 0.1 at 95.5.
Akzo closed Fl 5.20 better at Fl 117.30 with 138,523 shares traded after
reporting higher than expected first quarter earnings earnings per share of
Fl 4.33 compared with Fl 4.54 in the same period last year. Market forecasts
had ranged from Fl 3.00 to Fl 3.30. Dealers also spoke of a large buyer in
the stock.
MADRID saw heavy trading in Hidrola, the utility, with around 2m traded. The
price closed Pta14 higher at Pta591 on the prospect that it will merge with
Iberduero. Iberduero finished Pta3 lower at Pta722. The general index closed
off 0.18 at 281.32 in low volume of Pta10.8bn.
OSLO continued to slide in thin volume, the all-share index falling 6.40 to
466.13 in volume of NKr186m.

FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Asia's sick man shows recovery
potential - The recently downcast and still lethargic South Korean market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE RIVAL markets from Hong Kong to Singapore and from Tokyo to Taiwan
have appreciated at double digit rates since the beginning of this year,
Seoul has continued a slump which last year brought its biggest ever annual
fall. Although Indonesia has run it close, it is the only market in the
region to have declined since the beginning of 1991.
At close of trading yesterday the South Korea composite index stood at
632.63, down 5.21 on the day and 9 per cent on the year. Since the beginning
of 1990 it has fallen by almost 30 per cent.
However, the sick man of Asia now seems to be over the worst. It briefly
awoke from its lethargy on Tuesday, when the index jumped by 3.6 per cent;
and yesterday, when turnover climbed from Won142.3bn to Won180bn, investors
revelled in their ability to take a profit. 'The question investors are
asking now is not 'should I sell?', but when should I start to buy?' says Ms
Melissa Brown, director of research at Barclays De Zoete Wedd in Seoul.
The protracted gloom has been due to a combination of fundamental and
technical factors. Inflation, the resulting tightening of credit, and
concern about the source of South Korea's growth have soured sentiment.
While GNP continues to expand at one of the highest rates in the world,
rising by 9 per cent last year, the pattern of growth has shifted
dramatically since 1987 and 1988. Exports, the traditional engine of the
economy, grew by a meagre 3 per cent in 1989 and 1990, while consumption and
the service sector have taken up the slack.
'There is a feeling that the source of growth is still not very healthy,'
says Mr Torquil McAlpine, chief representative of Schroder Securities in
Seoul. 'Investment in manufacturing is still being crowded out.' Inflation,
too, is rearing its head again. In the first quarter of this year consumer
prices rose by 3.7 per cent, nearly half the government's target for the
year.
In an attempt to curb the spectre of double digit inflation, the government
has tightened money. 'The credit crunch is beginning to bite,' says Mr Hank
Morris, chief representative of Kleinwort Benson. He adds that South Korean
companies are finding capital harder than ever to come by.
The resulting liquidity constraint has created adverse technical factors.
When the market rallies, investors, and particularly securities companies
which are hardest strapped for funds, are tempted to sell. Consequently,
upturns have tended to be short-lived.
Trading, too, is subdued. Average daily turnover is in the region of Dollars
120m, about one quarter of the turnover in the salad days of 1989.
Shafts of light, however, are now penetrating the gloom. Exports grew by an
encouraging 10.2 per cent in the first quarter, year on year, a trend which
is expected to be sustained by reviving economic growth in the US and much
of Europe, and by post-Gulf war reconstruction. Oil prices, critical to
South Korea's import-dependent energy sector, have also eased.
The stabilisation fund, inspired by the government and set up by financial
institutions last year to support the ailing bourse, still has estimated
free funds of over Won300bn (Dollars 413m) to stimulate a rally. In
addition, the prospect of direct foreign investment, to be allowed from next
year, will create a boost even before the new capital arrives.
That foreign interest exists is shown by the increased prices this year for
South Korean Euromarket instruments. Korean convertible bonds and warrants
enable investors to gain exposure to the underlying equity market before it
is opened to foreigners. Their recent popularity indicates that foreign
investors are already implementing their entry strategies.
For these investors, the hope is that Seoul will take its time to
convalesce. But with one of Asia's most dynamic economies moving back on
course, they may find that the index does not wait for them on its way back
up.

FT  25 APR 91 / Money Markets: Rates little changed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS little change in London interest rates yesterday, following a
firmer period earlier this week resulting from poor economic news.
An improvement in the day-to-day liquidity position, after shortages in
excess of Pounds 1bn on Monday and Tuesday, led to a slightly softer tone at
the short end of the market.
Three-month sterling interbank was unchanged at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent,
while 12-month money was steady at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range on Liffe, as June delivery
flirted with a strong technical resistance level of 88.57. Dealers warned
that if this is decisively broken, then a fall to 88.35 is indicated by
chart movements. The June contract opened unchanged at 88.59 and closed at
88.56.
The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of
Pounds 700m on the cash market, but revised this to Pounds 650m at noon and
back to Pounds 700m in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 729m was
provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 312m bills outright, by way of
Pounds 150m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 162m bank
bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 327m
bank bills were purchased in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of
around Pounds 90m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 161m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 550m and a rise in the note circulation Pounds 70m. These outweighed
bank balances above target of Pounds 80m.
In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.80 from 8.85 per cent after the
Bundesbank injected a net DM1.5bn into the banking system at this week's
securities repurchase agreement tender.
The central bank accepted bids of DM12.3bn for 28-day money at a fixed rate
of 8.60 per cent. This exceeded an expiring facility of DM10.8bn.
In Brussels the National Bank left its seven-day advances rate unchanged at
8.80 per cent at yesterday's tender for liquidity against government paper
and commercial bills. This followed a cut of 10 basis points in the rate at
Monday's tender.
At that time the central bank said it was eliminating a differential in
short-term rates with Germany. It was regarded as a move to slow the Belgian
franc's advance against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium at lowest level for
four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM'S PRICE fell to Dollars 1,384 a tonne at one stage yesterday, the
lowest level for three-month metal since the London Metal Exchange
introduced its high-grade aluminium contract in 1987.
The price recovered slightly later in the day but some analysts suggested it
would go on falling until substantial output cuts are made by the industry,
which is still producing at close to full capacity.
However, Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque
Indosuez Group, said: 'Producers obviously feel better times are just around
the corner and might be willing to operate at full blast for another three
or four months yet on the assumption that stocks will be eaten up when
demand picks up.'
He estimated that between 10 and 15 per cent of western aluminium smelting
capacity is operating at a loss.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, suggested the price could go on falling to Dollars 1,250
a tonne unless there were production cuts. 'But there are costs involved in
shutting down production and no producer wants to be the first to do so.'
Both analysts pointed out that many producers now had energy supply
contracts linked to the price of aluminium and that this enabled them to
keep going despite weak demand.
Yesterday's price fall was apparently triggered by the release late on
Tuesday of US statistics showing falling durable goods orders in March.
Aluminium for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,357 a tonne,
down Dollars 21 a tonne from Tuesday's close, while three-month metal was at
Dollars 1.388.50, also down Dollars 21.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer says meat industry must
respond to legitimate ccustomer concerns
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The meat industry had to be ready to respond to legitimate customer
concerns, said Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, opening the World
Meat Congress in London yesterday, writes David Blackwell. The industry had
to be able 'to demonstrate that meat is good and wholesome and is produced
to the highest standards of quality, safety and welfare' in the face of
consumer concern over animal health and meat handling.
Mr Gummer also defended the EC decision to ban the import of meat containing
growth hormones as 'perfectly proper'. He denied the EC move, which the UK
had argued against, was 'an undercover trade ban'. The overwhelming belief
within the EC was that its consumers wanted meat without hormones, he said.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to place cap on imports of
east European live calves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC is today expected to place limits on the import of live calves from
eastern Europe, mainly Poland, in response to the Community's growing beef
crisis.
The move will add to the disgruntlement of the post-communist democracies of
the east, whose leaders have accused the EC of blocking access to those
goods in which they have a comparative advantage.
The 227,000 head quota for live calves coming in under the normal import
levy - 93 per cent taken up by Poland, with the rest from Czechoslovakia -
has already been filled, a European Commission official said. No more would
be allowed in under this regime, under a safeguard clause devised by the
Council of EC agriculture ministers last month.
But the EC will allow in an 198,000 head quota agreed at the same time, with
a levy reduced by two thirds from the normal Ecu124 per 100 kilos. Most of
these will also be from Poland. Fattened cattle can also still come in -
'calves' are regarded as under 220 kilos in weight and are imported for
fattening within the EC.
The Commission points out that this regime was started to bridge a domestic
deficit, which has now turned into an expensive surplus. The stockpile of
unwanted beef has reached 750,000 tonnes, and big producers like Ireland are
already talking of having to store meat in refrigerated ships.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said on Monday that if no
action is taken to bring supply into balance with demand, the beef mountain
would reach 1m tonnes this time next year - well over its 1987 peak - in
spite of signed contracts to export 335,000 tonnes from the existing
stockpile.
Beef producers attribute the Community's oversupply to eastern Germany's
incorporation into the EC, which had as one effect the slaughter of 380,000
milk cows (and perhaps 250,000 more this year) to adjust to the Community's
milk quota system. They also blame the loss of lucrative markets in the
Middle East because of the Gulf crisis, and anxiety over 'mad cow' disease,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean earthquake threatens
banana trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANAGUA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world banana trade faces severe disruption following the major
earthquake which struck the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama last
Monday evening.
Approximately 35 per cent of the world's banana exports originate in the
zone worst affected by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter
scale. Some 25,000 hectares of bananas are planted in Costa Rica and 8,000
hectares on the Panamanian side of the border. Bananas are the principal
export of both countries.
'It is too early to say yet how long production will be disrupted. We are
still assessing the damage,' said Mr Joe Hagan, the vice-president of
corporate affairs for the Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands International
company. Chiquita is one of the world's leading banana producers and is a
major exporter from both countries affected by the disaster.
The economic infrastructure of the region has suffered extensive damage:
roads, railways, ports, water and electricity supplies have all been
severely disrupted, according to Costa Rica's National Emergency Commission.
The two banana-exporting ports of Puerto Limon and Almirante have suffered
considerable damage and have suspended operations. According to one
eye-witness 'containers and railway trucks were thrown all over the place'.
However, Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister, said that
the Moin quay at Puerto Limon - which is the main banana-loading wharf -
'has not suffered major structural damage'. The principal problem there
appears to be a reduction in the depth of the water in the harbour because
of the upheaval of the seabed.
According to Mr Antonio Restrepo, the spokesman for the Union of Banana
Exporting Countries (UPEB) based in Panama, one and a half million boxes of
bananas are shipped from Puerto Limon every week, and a further 300,000
boxes every week from Almirante in Panama.
Even if the ports can be put back into operation reasonably quickly, access
will be difficult because of the severing of road and rail links. The
epicentre of the earthquake occured 40km south-east of the port.
Damage to bridges along the main highway to Puerto Limon 'may take a week to
repair, but those to the south will take much longer as many have fallen
into the rivers. It could be quite a while before exports can be resumed,'
said Mr Rojas.
A Costa Rican pilot who has been flying rescue missions to the
earthquake-hit border region between Costa Rica and Panama said: 'Huge trees
look as they have been pulled out by the roots. All the bridges between the
frontier and Puerto Limon are out and the road is destroyed. There is no way
to get the maturing bananas out'.
Adding to the difficulties, many of the plantation workers' homes have been
destroyed or damaged, along with administrative buildings and packing
plants.
It remains unclear to what extent the plantations themselves have been
affected, but it is possible that many banana trees laden with fruit fell to
the ground during the earthquake. It takes between six and nine months for a
damaged banana tree to produce a new stem.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spurt in oil prices drips away
 -Demand for refined products dries up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES were slipping downwards yesterday as fears of a petrol shortage
in the US receded and a short spurt of demand for gas oil in Europe
evaporated. Strength in the price of refined products had pushed the crude
price as high as Dollars 20 a barrel in the Brent market earlier this week.
As the weather turned unseasonally cold in Europe this week, demand for
heating oil rose and helped support the crude price. At the same time, the
low level of gasoline stocks in the US dragged up crude in the New York
market.
But these were fairly shakey foundations for a price rise since underlying
demand is showing few signs of picking up and any tightness in the second
quarter could quickly be relieved by ample world supplies.
As Europe and the US warm up from this week's cold spell, the demand which
pushed heating oil prices up by Dollars 5 to Dollars 198 a tonne is
disappearing as quickly as it arrived.
Traders who had piled into the market to buy oil on Monday were rushing out
again yesterday when North Sea Brent crude for June delivery lost much of
the gain it had made earlier in the week to trade at Dollars 19.30 a barrel.
Crude prices had been strengthened by the decline in the flow of oil from
the North Sea because of heavy maintenance work and the discipline with
which Saudi Arabia and Iran are disposing of their stocks of oil in floating
storage.
But most of the production disruption in the North Sea has now been
reflected in the current oil price, and if output is slightly higher than
expected, as some oil companies were indicating this week, prices could drop
further.
North Sea output is expected to be 400,000 b/d lower in April than in March
at 1.5m b/d, rising again to 1.8m b/d in May. Shell said recently that by
early May it hopes to boost production from its Brent pipeline, which is
currently shut down for the installation of emergency shutdown valves.
In addition, while Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed not to push the oil
they hold in floating storage on to the market, the movement of Iranian
tankers from the Bay of Cadiz off Spain this week has caused concern in the
market. Traders think that Iran may be starting the sale of its oil to the
US.
While concern still exists in the US over the low level of petrol stocks, a
steady flow of imports into the north-east is starting to erode these fears.
Gasoline stocks have sunk to historically low levels in the US, but demand
is also depressed. Petrol prices of around Dollars 250 a tonne for prompt
delivery are almost Dollars 30 higher than futures prices which offer
gasoline for delivery in August, indicating a short-term tightness in the
market but not a sustained rise in demand.
Demand for petrol in the US dropped by 3 per cent in the first quarter of
the year, and although some pick-up is expected in the next couple of months
as the nation enters its peak driving season, consumption is not expected to
be higher than normal.
Fears of a petrol shortage in the US lifted crude prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to over Dollars 21 a barrel earlier this week. But as
some technical buying dried up, the June futures contract slipped to Dollars
20.47 a barrel
US stocks of petrol are currently some 25m barrels below the low end of the
seasonal range and, at 205m barrels, are right at the minimum operating
level set by the government.
Imports of petrol to the US dropped significantly during the Gulf crisis
when high petrol prices and strong demand in Europe sucked in deliveries
that would traditionally have gone to the US. In the first quarter, gasoline
imports dropped from last year's level of 360,000 b/d to 200,000 b/d.
But Mr Ken Miller, a consultant at the US firm of Purvin and Gertz, believes
that fears of a petrol shortage are exaggerated. 'Imports are now starting
to pick up, demand remains low and refineries are increasing their output of
gasoline.'
European refining margins are dropping back after rising to Dollars 3 a
barrel this week on the back of strong gas oil demand. The margin refiners
can claim over crude oil slipped to just Dollars 1 a barrel last week from a
peak of Dollars 11 in February when the Gulf war was still underway.
As the strength in the market for refined products disappears, oil prices
are dropping quickly. While Saudi Arabia and Iran are not flooding the
market with crude from their floating stores, there is still some
competitive pressure between the two which could ease prices down.
The oil market is currently searching for a direction and, if that direction
is not to be overwhelmingly downwards, there needs to be a substantial
pick-up in demand or evidence of further production cutbacks.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Texas fights pioneering swarms
of 'killer' bees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-dreaded invasion of the US by the Africanised 'killer' honey bee
has begun in south Texas, but federal and state officials are prepared for
the assault.
Five swarms were identified and destroyed last week. US agriculture
department (USDA) officials say these were the 'pioneers,' of the main
column, which is now about 75 miles south of the US-Mexican border.
At risk is the state's Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.4m) honey industry and the 240
commercial beekeepers in Texas who move hives around the state to help crop
pollination. They fear that the Africanised bees will take over the hives of
the more compliant domestic bees.
They worry too about a crop of anti-bee legislation from lawmakers
responding to public fears, and mass killings of domestic bees mistakenly
identified as Africans.
As long as the weather and food supplies remain favourable, south Texas can
expect to see honey bee swarms. Officials are trying to quiet public fears,
pointing out that the sting of the Africanised bee is no more poisonous than
their European cousins.
However, they become dangerous if their hives are jeopardised. Unlike the
European honey bees - who send a few warriors out to frighten off invaders -
the African bees swarm out by the thousands and pursue their prey for up to
a mile.
The bees have demonstrated their restlessness ever since 26 swarms escaped
from their keepers in Brazil, which imported them in 1956. The hybrids have
been moving north ever since.
In appearance they are similar to the less aggressive European bees, but
they are small and carry less venom. They produce only enough honey to
sustain themselves before they wander off to new fields.
After the first Africanised honey bees were found in Texas last October,
USDA and Texas state officials, aided by experts from Texas A&amp;M University,
began a survey of the areas around the first landing site.
The state established a quarantine around the second find and prohibited the
movement of managed honey bee colonies in and out of the area. Eight
counties extended the quarantine 100 miles north but permitted managed
colonies to move into the area.
One plan under consideration would pacify the 'killer' bees by killing their
queens and replacing them with Europeanised rulers.

FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Private metal trader to go into
liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPP &amp; LION, one of the last privately-owned international metal-trading
groups left in London, ceased trading yesterday and said it intends to seek
voluntary liquidation.
Mr Michael Lion, chairman and chief executive, said that the company
recently ran into financial difficulties and this week entered into
discussions with its bankers. But, in spite of being offered additional
facilities, it was not possible to arrange satisfactory terms.
Mr Lion said the company's immediate problem was an extreme liquidity
shortage which, with the best will in the world, it was not able to solve
with its several banks. No one loss caused the difficulties, 'it was a
cumulative thing'.
All 40 employees in London have been made redundant but some will stay on to
help with the liquidation. Philipp &amp; Lion has called in accountants Touche
Ross to advise on the liquidation and there will be a creditors' meeting on
May 15.
Mr Lion is one of the two largest shareholders in the company, along with Mr
Melvin Sheinbein.
The company's operations in the US - Philipp &amp; Lion International and
Philipp &amp; Lion Trading, which between them employ about 20 people - remain
active and operational, Mr Lion stressed.
The company's trading activities were mainly in non-ferrous metals, both
primary and scrap.
Metal traders suggested yesterday that there were some signs that many banks
were now unwilling to keep a high financial exposure in volatile commodity
markets.
The physical merchanting business had contracted in recent years and this
trend was likely to continue, traders added. Other merchants were believed
to be in difficulties.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Bonds: Investors snap up Spain's offer as
ratings improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN's second and largest Ecu bond offering was sold out almost instantly
as pent-up demand for sovereign benchmark issues fuelled investors'
enthusiasm.
Unlike Italy, whose triple-A credit rating is under review, Spain, rated
Double-A2 by Moody's, the US agency, is considered an improving credit.
The five-year bonds were priced to yield 9.08 per cent, the same level as
Spain's outstanding Ecu500m issue due 1995, launched a year ago. The old
issue was quite tightly held by investors, so there was little paper
available in the secondary market.
Although the deal was easy to sell, underwriters in London were unhappy at
the handling of the offering.
First, the indicated range for the yield was changed, when demand proved
firm. Then, allocations of bonds were smaller than underwriters had been led
to expect.
Some underwriters had shorted the issue, that is, sold bonds they did not
yet have; when allocations were reduced, they were forced to cover their
short positions by buying them back at higher prices, given the strong
demand, traders said.
Nearly 20 per cent of the deal has been reserved for placement in Spain,
where an extensive marketing campaign is currently under way.
However, only 5 per cent of the first deal was placed in Spain, so more
bonds could find their way to international investors in a few weeks' time.
Spain had been expected to extend its maturity profile, but instead chose to
bring a second five-year deal.
According to lead manager Banesto, Spain did not wish to lock in Ecu rates
over too long a maturity, because Ecu yields are likely to fall in the
longer term.
An Ecu300m deal, fungible with an outstanding Ecu335m issue, for the
European Investment Bank, was largely pre-placed in Japan. Lead manager
Nomura International said the issue was targetted at Japanese retail
investors in an attempt to widen the investor base for Ecu bonds.
Consequently, there was no clash with the Spanish issue.
In the dollar sector, a Dollars 250m three-year deal for Compagnie Bancaire
met firm demand, but put tightly priced issues for two other European
financial institutions, Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg and Credit Local,
launched on Tuesday under further pressure.
The Compagnie Bancaire deal was priced to yield 82 basis points above the
three-year US Treasury, compared with 48 and 47 basis points respectively
for the LKB and Credit Local deals.
Although Compagnie Bancaire is a slightly lesser credit, the 35 basis point
differentiation was considered excessive. The LKB spread widened to 58 basis
points, and the Credit Local spread to 56 basis points.
In the equity-linked sector, Merrill Lynch introduced its LYONs (liquid
yield option notes) structure to the Eurobond market, issuing a Dollars 150m
European tranche of a Dollars 1bn US offering for WR Grace, the chemical,
healthcare and energy group. The zero-coupon 15-year notes are convertible
into shares, and puttable after five and 10 years.
Sumitomo Bank, the world's third largest bank, has had its Aa1 credit rating
put under review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service.
Sumitomo lost it's top triple-A rating from both Moody's and IBCA, the
European rating agency, last year. The bank has Dollars 4.3bn of long-term
debt outstanding.
The French government received close to 50 per cent acceptances for its Ecu
OAT exchange offer. Holders of Ecu950m 8.5 per cent OATs maturing 1997, out
of a total issue size of Ecu1.9bn, opted to receive in exchange new 8.5 per
cent OATs maturing 2002.
Additional acceptances from retail investors, who have until April 30 to
exchange, should give the new issue an initial size of around Ecu1bn.
The new bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points more than the old
shorter-dated issue.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Few tears shed for open
outcry - The options market's own Big Bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX years after the UK stock market disappeared from its trading floor in
the Stock Exchange tower and moved to a screen-based dealing system, the
London Traded Options Market is about to undergo its own Big Bang.
Huddled in a corner of the Stock Exchange's old dealing floor, the traded
options market is all that is left of the old world of jobbers and brokers
where securities were once bought and sold on a face-to-face basis.
All that is about to change. After behind-the-scenes prodding by the Bank of
England, the options market and the London International Financial Futures
Exchange took the plunge and announced last year that they would merge.
This was greeted with a huge sigh of relief by options dealers who saw
merger as the only hope for a market which has failed to compete with its US
and European counterparts. The hope was that the success of Liffe would rub
off on the options market.
So the letter which options traders received this week from the LTOM and
Liffe boards will have come as nothing less than a tremendous bolt from the
blue. Rather than rescuing options floor trading, the new market is to be
screen-based and threatens to put many dealers out of work.
Only the FT-SE 100 index option is to remain as an open-outcry market and
will be joined by the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index when it is launched.
'Everyone was taken by surprise. We thought it would be five or 10 years
before stock options moved onto the screens,' said a manager of an
independent options brokerage.
But the speed with which LTOM is to be restructured is a reflection of the
desperate state the options market has reached. The daily options turnover
is regularly less than the 30,000 contracts needed for LTOM to cover its
costs and for brokers to break even.
A round of redundancies has just been completed at a number of leading
securities houses and yet costs are still out of control. Just yesterday,
Hoare Govett announced it is to pull out of options market-making. The lack
of business leads to less competitive quotes for options and an irregular
updating of prices, which in turn discourages investors.
As one options executive said: 'The quality of prices leaves an awful lot to
be desired. There are 2,500 options series but on average day just 32 are
updated.'
Mr Tony de Guingand, managing director of LTOM, and Mr Michael Jenkins,
chief executive of Liffe, believe that the openness of trading options
discourages investors. A broker who buys options is letting the whole market
know he or she has a certain position and is then at the mercy of the market
when that trade needs to be unwound.
The success of the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options
market, and the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange, both of which
are screen-based, has encouraged LTOM into its own Big Bang.
However a number of uncertainties remain:
The cost of entry into the new market. Sophisticated computer technology
will be required and it is not clear whether smaller independent traders
will be able to afford this.
Whether the new trading system will be a genuinely competitive market or
will just display indicative prices for nominal amounts of options. The
proponents of the new scheme vow to avoid the Stock Exchange quote machines,
which suffer from these defects. But the suspicion remains that unless there
are safeguards and strict supervision the options market will become
dominated by a handful of large securities houses.
If an anonymous market will actually encourage business. Larger institutions
said the current open outcry market rarely leads to them being caught out by
market-makers. As one fund manager who uses the options market said: 'Every
now and again you have a problem when a trade is visible and it gets
spotted. But normally there is no problem.'
The number of jobs under threat. Liffe and LTOM believe it may lead to an
expansion in employment. On LTOM one person can make a market in up to five
stocks options. But screen-based systems need at least one market-maker per
stock and there are currently 72. However, if liquidity does not pick up,
there could be a drastic reduction in the number of stocks that are
eventually quoted. In any case, it seems certain that the floor brokers, who
can deal on behalf of Stock Exchange members, are at risk. Unless they can
turn their hands to selling options, the 75 or so brokers would not appear
to have an optimistic future.
In spite of these reservations most options traders do not see any
alternative to Liffe and LTOM's proposals and there seems little doubt that
a screen-based system will emerge from the consultation of members that is
under way.
More importantly, the changes underline the dominance of Liffe in what looks
more like a takeover than a merger. But if this increases London's
importance in the growing European derivatives markets, the Bank of England
is unlikely to shed any tears for the open outcry market.

<TEXT>
HISPANO Americano, one of Spain's largest commercial banks, is hoping to
complete a share swap with the big Italian bank, Banco di Roma, which could
result in each bank holding about 5 per cent of the other by the end of this
year, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid.
Mr Jose Maria de Amesategui, Hispano's president, said yesterday the
operation could go ahead once the merger of Banco di Roma and Banco di Santo
Espirito is finalised.
The two banks, along with Commerzbank and Credit Lyonnaise, are members of
Europartners, an informal banking consortium.
The share swap was first mooted a year ago, but has been complicated by
efforts to restructure the Italian banking industry.
At the time, Commerzbank was also considering joining in an interchange of
shares.
Commerzbank owns 10 per cent of Hispano which, in turn, bought 5 per cent of
the German bank in 1989.
The two have just agreed to establish a new bank in Gibraltar.

MR CHRISTIAN KJOELAAS, the president of Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest
bank, yesterday stepped down, just two months after the announcement that
the bank had run up a big loss for 1990.
Last December, Fokus was given a three-year NKr1.5bn conditional guarantee
with renewal options by the banks' guarantee fund which forced the bank to
write down its share capital by 50 per cent. Fokus lost NKr992m last year
after a net profit of NKr101.9m in 1989. A new board was appointed one month
ago, headed by Mr Stein Holst Annexstad, a former executive with Hafslund
Nycomed.
In a terse statement. Mr Kjoelaas said he agreed to resign following the
board's recommendation.
The board said that the bank was facing such great challenges connected with
its demanding economic situation that it felt Fokus should be led in future
by someone without historical ties to the bank.
'The bank needs a new president and this will make it easier for the new
board to implement the right strategy for the bank's future,' Mr Kjoelaas
said.

TOKYU store chain, part of Japan's Tokyu retail and railway group, yesterday
reported a 7.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y4.77bn (Dollars
34.31m) in the year ended February 1991, citing strong demand for fresh food
items as the reason for the rise.
Sales increased by 6 per cent to Y256.85bn, with a 9.6 per cent rise in
fresh food sales and a 0.6 per cent increase in clothing sales, which were
affected by an unusually warm winter.
The company said profit margins were improved by a streamlining of stock
control, but higher interest rates increased payment burdens. For the
current year, the company expects a marginal increase in pre-tax profit to
Y4.87 on sales of Y265bn.
Life Stores, another supermarket operator, reported an 8.6 per cent increase
in sales to Y158.5bn and a 15.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profit at Y3.8bn.
The company expects pre-tax profit for this year to increase by 5 per cent
to Y4bn on sales of Y175bn, a 10.4 per cent increase.
ASCII Pictures, a subsidiary of computer Japanese software and chip
manufacturer ASCII Corporation, has reached an agreement with Edward R.
Pressman Film Corporation, based in Studio City, California, to buy 33.3 per

CRA, the Australian mining group, will report lower profits this year
because of weak metals prices and slack world demand, Mr John Ralph,
chairman, said yesterday.
Mr Ralph said profits earnings would be lower 'but not by much,' and
stressed that forecasts were dependent on movements in metals prices and the
strength of the Australian dollar.
CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, reported net profits of
ADollars 472m (Dollars 365m) last year, compared with ADollars 648m in 1989.
Mr Ralph said he was confident that CRA's hostile ADollars 435m bid for Coal

AUTOLATINA, the Brazilian holding group for the Volkswagen and Ford marques,
blamed state measures and a crippling strike for an inflation-adjusted 75
per cent fall in net profits for last year.
Net profits dipped to 11.6bn cruzeiros (Dollars 45m) which represents just
3.5 per cent of sales. In 1989, the group's return on sales was 15 per cent.
The numbers reflect the operations of Volkswagen for the first 11 months of
the year and include the December profits of Ford, following the group's
merger.
According to the company, production capacity was down to 60 per cent with
the group operating for little more than 10 months of the year. The company
halted production for a month after the the government's anti-inflation
measures were put into effect last year.
Subsequently strikes, both at Autolatina itself and among suppliers of
parts, further interrupted production.
As well as sending profits into steep decline, the difficult economic
situation has pushed Autolatina heavily into debt. At the end of 1990, the
group's ratio of liabilities to net worth ratio had risen to 78 per cent.
However, despite its financial troubles, the group plans to push ahead with
substantial capital spending. This year alone, Autolatina will invest
Dollars 550m.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), formerly Bell Resources,
yesterday sold a 6.6 per cent stake in Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network for
ADollars 55m (USDollars 42.3m), cutting its holding to around 15 per cent.
The sale conflicted with an undertaking given to the Australian Stock
Exchange in February that ACIL had no plans to reduce its shareholding in
Nine Network, formerly part of Mr Alan Bond's Bond Media.
However, ACIL is understood to have decided to reduce its stake to help fund
its acquisition of 50 per cent of National Brewing Holdings, formerly Bond
Brewing.
Bond Brewing was sold to a joint venture between ACIL and Lion Nathan, the
New Zealand brewer, as part of a sale of the assets of Bond Corporation, Mr
Bond's flagship company, which is being restructured.
ACIL had hoped to finance payments due to Lion Nathan as part of the deal
without reducing its holding in Nine, but recently reported an interim loss
of ADollars 90m.
Mr Colin Henson, an ACIL director, said the proceeds of the sale of Nine
Network shares would be used for 'internal funding requirements,' but
declined to give details.
He said there were no plans to dispose of the rest of ACIL's holding in the
Nine Network, which was regarded as 'a long-term investment'.
Shares in the Nine Network have doubled in value since the company was
acquired eight months ago by Consolidated Press Holdings (Conspress), Mr
Packer's privately-owned master company.
The shares closed 2 cents higher on the day at 58 cents on the Australian
Stock Exchange yesterday. ACIL shares closed 1 cent higher at 22 cents.
Conspress, which has a controlling 38.8 per cent stake in Nine Network, has
also given an undertaking to the stock exchange that it has no plans to
reduce its holding.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Inter-Continental Hotels takes a
long view - Saison Group's plans for the 102-unit chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Saison Group, the Japanese stores and leisure combine, bought
Inter-Continental Hotels in 1988, critics said the Dollars 2.3bn purchase
price was too high.
On paper, they have a point. Over the past two years, Inter-Continental has
failed to cover its financing costs, losing Dollars 60m in 1989 and running
some Dollars 7m into the red last year.
But the company points out that its projections made at the time of the
purchase were overtaken by rising world interest rates and, more recently,
by the impact of the Gulf crisis.
Mr Yuji Takaoka, chairman of Seiyu, the trading company at the core of the
Saison group, insists that Inter-Continental's performance is satisfactory.
He draws attention to the hotel chain's operating profits which grew 20 per
cent last year to Dollars 87.5m.
Mr Takaoka expects the investment to pay off in the long run. 'For the first
few years we have not set a prime goal of making profits. Of course, we
don't want to see red ink. But rather than just achieve a big profit we want
to develop a good network.'
Mr Takaoka denies suggestions that the Saison group's finances are being
stretched by the acquisition which was funded with bank borrowings totalling
more than Dollars 1.2bn. 'Inter-Continental is not a burden,' he says,
adding that the hotel chain is expected to cover its interest payments and
make a pre-tax profit in 1991.
Saison Group, which used to be called Seibu Saison until late last year, is
one of the best-known companies in Japan, with a portfolio of high-profile
businesses and a colourful corporate history.
The group is a network of 130 companies, including seven which are publicly
quoted, with interests ranging from Seibu Department Stores, Japan's biggest
chain, to helicopters, banking and travel. It is controlled by Mr Seiji
Tsutsumi, whose brother Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi has an even larger business
empire based on railways. The two men, who inherited their fortunes from
their father, are said to be bitter rivals.
Mr Takaoka says Saison companies are managed independently but co-operate on
large projects such as the purchase of Inter-Continental. The bulk of the
finance for the deal was raised by the group's listed companies.
Mr Takaoka concedes the increase in interest rates made the Japanese
financial markets 'very tight' and so made it more expensive than expected
to finance the purchase. Saison group originally intended to replace its
bank lending with long-term funds. But the difficulty of using the capital
markets obliged the group last year to extend its bank loans.
The Japanese media say this arrangement also forced Saison group to revise
its plans for Inter-Continental to squeeze more profits out of the operation
in the next few years. According to Diamond Weekly, a business magazine,
this will include more property sales than originally planned, among them
the disposal of the Mayfair, in central London, one of Inter-Continental's
top hotels.
Mr Takaoka says financial projections have been revised but not by very
much. He declines to give figures. Also, far from selling hotels, Saison
group has expanded the Inter-Continental chain from 95 in 1988 to 102, plus
nine properties under construction. If hotels are sold in future it will be
to streamline the chain, not to raise funds.
As for the Mayfair, which might be worth Dollars 400m, Mr Takaoka says the
group is only considering selling it because a 'very old friend' has offered
to buy it. If the Mayfair is sold, it would allow the London
Inter-Continental Hotel to be refurbished.
Mr Takaoka says that the disposals the group has made also show that critics
are wrong in claiming the original purchase price was too high. He says
top-class hotel rooms in the US are now trading at Dollars 0.4m-Dollars 0.5m
each, compared with an average of Dollars 0.2m paid for Inter-Continental
Hotels.
The group wants Inter-Continental to be a 'European-style' chain, with a
greater emphasis on individuality and personal service than is apparent in
large US-owned chains, says Mr Takaoka.
The chain will also be developed inside Japan, starting with the opening of
an Inter-Continental in Yokohama in July.

BLACK &amp; DECKER, the home appliances and power tools maker, saw its
first-quarter earnings halved, but it hoped that an economic revival and low
retailer inventories would boost profits later this year, writes Bernard
Simon.
Net earnings tumbled to Dollars 4.1m, or 7 cents a share, from Dollars 10m,
or 17 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn,
thanks to the inclusion of information systems business acquired as part of
the 1989 purchase of Emhart Corp. Product sales dipped by 7 per cent.
Financing costs fell by 9 per cent to Dollars 78.5m, reflecting lower
interest rates.
The company said business conditions remained difficult in the US, the UK,
Canada, Brazil and Australia. Temporary plant closures are squeezing
margins, but are expected to bolster cash flow.

WANG Laboratories, the faltering US computer maker, reported another
quarterly loss, but expressed confidence that improved liquidity, further
belt-tightening and a new product strategy boded well.
Wang, which has been in the black for only one of the past 10 quarters,
suffered a Dollars 48.9m loss - 30 cents a share - in the three months to
March 31. It lost Dollars 146.6m (90 cents a share) a year earlier.
Revenues fell by 16 per cent to Dollars 500m, in line with earlier warnings
that a tailing-off in sales of the company's word processors and
mini-computers would more than offset advances in its new electronic-imaging
products.
Mr Richard Miller, chairman, blamed the third-quarter slump on the recession
in general and in the computer market in particular. But he noted that cash
reserves of Dollars 194m were at their highest for 18 months.
He said the downturn had slowed the momentum of Wang's turnround efforts,
and that further austerity measures were being considered.
Mr George Elling, analyst at Merrill Lynch, noted yesterday that Wang had
been late in adjusting to changes in the computer industry. 'It has a major
challenge to restructure its overall business,' he said. 'The question is
how long the transition will take.'
This year, Wang unveiled a strategy called Office 2000, designed to
computerise many paper-intensive office jobs.
A product line will be designed to allow financial institutions, government
departments and other large paper users to scan documents, and then store
and retrieve them electronically.

PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the large US consumer products group which recently agreed
to buy the Max Factor and Betrix businesses from Revlon for Dollars 1.14bn,
yesterday announced a modest 5 per cent improvement in after-tax earnings
during its third quarter, at Dollars 424m.
Sales for the three months to end-March were up more sharply, at Dollars
6.79bn - an 11 per cent rise on the Dollars 6.12bn scored in the same period
a year earlier. But earnings per share rose only marginally, by 1.8 per
cent, to Dollars 1.16.
With the figures at the lower end of expectations, the company's shares
eased by  7/8 to Dollars 84.
P&amp;G acknowledged its US business - where brand names range from the Cover
Girl cosmetics line to detergents such as Tide and Bold - had been affected
by the economic recession. It said the international operations 'remained
very healthy'.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said the relatively small earnings improvement
'reflected substantial investment in new products, principally the expansion
of compact detergents in the US, as well as heightened competitive activity
in the coffee business'.

The Dollars 159m stake in Chase, the second biggest US commercial banking

Unlike Prince Alwaleed, who had been a private customer of Citicorp for

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Crescent said it
bought 1.2m shares between March 1 and April 15 at prices ranging from
Dollars 14.37 to Dollars 20.
The Olayan Group, founded by Mr Olayan in 1947, holds stakes in JP Morgan,

BOMBARDIER, the aerospace group which owns Short Brothers of Belfast and

fiscal 1991. Sales were up 35 per cent.
For the 12 months ended January 31, net profit was CDollars 100.1m
(USDollars 86m), or CDollars 1.41 a share, up from CDollars 91.5m, or
CDollars 1.36, in fiscal 1990.
Sales were CDollars 2.83bn against CDollars 2.1bn.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 33.3m, or 46 cents a share, against
CDollars 30.3m, or 45 cents, a year earlier, but sales were down to CDollars
802m against CDollars 837m.
The gain in 1991 sales was due to inclusion of Short Bros and ANF Industrie
for the full year, against only four months in fiscal 1990.
Fourth-quarter sales were pulled down by problems in the business jet
market. The recession and higher loan losses hit CT Financial Services, the
biggest unit of Imasco, in the first quarter. Profit was CDollars 52.6m, or
42 cents a share, down from CDollars 59.9m, or 49 cents, a year earlier.
CT Financial operates Canada Trustco, one of the country's two biggest trust
companies.
Sears Canada had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 25.8m, or 31 cents a
share, against a loss of 12 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.
Sales dipped 10 per cent to CDollars 817m, mainly because of the recession

<TEXT>
EXXON, the world's biggest oil company, posted record earnings in the first
quarter due to unusually wide refining margins.
Despite a halving in income from US exploration and production operations,
earnings soared by 75 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn, or Dollars 1.78 a share,
from Dollars 1.3bn (Dollars 1.01 a share) a year earlier. Revenues grew by
almost 15 per cent to Dollars 30.7bn.
The amount of oil that Exxon refined edged up by only 3.5 per cent in the
past three months. But, like other US oil companies, it benefited handsomely
from high refining margins, especially outside North America.
Earnings from foreign refining and marketing operations surged fivefold to
Dollars 1.1bn, compared with Dollars 219m a year earlier.
US operations turned to a profit of Dollars 256m from a Dollars 28m loss.
The foreign component includes Dollars 160m from the sales of an Australian
refinery and a supertanker.
The huge first-quarter refining profits were caused by a coincidence of
factors, including loss of capacity in the Middle East, falling crude oil
prices and high winter production of heating oil rather than high-octane
grades.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman, noted that refining profits began to shrink
during the first quarter, and were approaching more normal levels.
However, Mr Ivan Obolersky, analyst at Shields &amp; Co in New York, predicted
that the industry's margins would be underpinned for some time by the trend
towards low-pollution, high-octane fuels.
Low crude oil prices also helped Exxon's chemicals business, where earnings
jumped by 23 per cent to Dollars 223m, despite a 5 per cent fall in sales
volumes. The company cautioned that some softening in margins was apparent
at the end of the quarter. Higher sales of petroleum products also
contributed to the surge in earnings.
The sharp fall in earnings from US exploration and production was ascribed
partly to write-downs on properties earmarked for disposal. North American
natural gas output slipped to 2.2m cubic feet a day, from almost 2.5m cu ft.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Armco slips into red and sees
year loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER indications of the troubled times facing the US steel industry were
revealed yesterday as Armco, one of the large integrated producers, posted a
first-quarter loss of Dollars 39.6m after tax.
This compares with a Dollars 12.9m profit in the same period of 1990.
Armco also warned that, despite steps being taken to cut costs, it would
probably make a loss in the second quarter and in the full year. The company
said that it 'does not anticipate an economic upturn in the second quarter,
nor expect steel to recover significantly in the second half'.
Its pessimism echoes that of Bethlehem Steel, which also unveiled a
first-quarter loss earlier this week and said it expected to remain in the
red in the second quarter.
A number of smaller, specialised steel companies have also reported
first-quarter losses.
The bulk of the losses reported by Armco stemmed from Armco Steel Company, a
joint venture with the Kawasaki Steel Company, which makes carbon
flat-rolled steel and tubing for the automotive, construction and industrial
machinery industries.
This lost Dollars 61.6m in the first quarter, of which Armco's share was
Dollars 31.6m. Sales for ASC were Dollars 334.3m, down 16 per cent on the
previous year. The venture made a Dollars 50.5m operating loss last year,
and a reorganisation of operations is under way.
Elsewhere, Armco operations made a Dollars 900,000 operating profit overall
in the first quarter - down from Dollars 28.2m in the same period a year
earlier - although there were small losses in fabricating and processing,
and bar, rod and wire products. After interest charges, this became a
Dollars 8.4m loss.
Inland Steel, the Chicago-based steelmaker which last week reported a
Dollars 40m net loss for the first quarter, has passed its quarterly
dividend. It cited a 'severe depression' in its primary markets, but said it
would restore payments 'as soon as possible' after the company moved back
into profit and the steel industry recovered.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Refining side boosts Chevron
earnings
</HEADLINE>

A JUMP in Chevron's first-quarter refining and marketing income more than
offset a decline in US exploration and production, resulting in an 18 per
cent rise in net earnings for the San Francisco-based energy producer.
Earnings climbed to Dollars 557m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, from Dollars
473m, or Dollars 1.33, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.8bn from
Dollars 9.3bn.
Despite the sharp increase for the period as a whole, Mr Ken Derr, Chevron
chief executive, noted that earnings slid at the end of the period as crude
oil prices settled at lower levels, US refining margins began to erode and
prices and demand for natural gas fell.
Refining and marketing income soared to Dollars 233m from Dollars 130m. This
year's profits would have been higher without a Dollars 47m charge for
environmental provisions and asset write-offs.
Sales of natural gas in the US edged down to just less than 3m cubic feet a
day, from 3.1m cu ft last year.
Income from chemicals dipped to Dollars 73m from Dollars 123m, but last
year's figure included a Dollars 59m gain from chemicals licensing
agreements. Operating earnings increased by 14 per cent.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Eni posts annual profits of
L2,072bn

ENI, the Italian state-owned energy and chemicals group, made consolidated
net profits of L2,072bn (Dollars 1.61bn) for 1990 compared with L1,613bn in
1989. Sales rose to L50,033bn from L36,470bn in 1989.
However, the increase in last year's net earnings is a mere 0.8 per cent
when adjusted for the full ownership of Enimont, the former public-private
chemicals joint venture.
Eni bought Montedison's 40 per cent stake in Enimont last November, and has
since tendered for the remaining 20 per cent of the shares floating in the
market.
Restated for the full consolidation of Enimont's figures, net earnings in
1989 amounted to L2,057bn. Similarly, sales in 1989 were L44,503bn, meaning
that turnover rose by only 12.4 per cent in 1990 on an adjusted basis.
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, said a good performance in the group's
energy sector last year had offset poorer results elsewhere, notably
chemicals.
Plans for the current year include a substantial rise in investment,
especially on the energy side. While higher business volumes could offset
lower margins in the oil sector in 1991, he warned that higher taxes and
borrowing costs meant that group profits this year could fall.
Adjusted net borrowing went up by L4,047bn to L23,735bn.

FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom chief attacks
Brussels - William Dawkins finds Mr Pierre Suard (right) prepared to defy
the European Commission over its conditions on his company's link-up with
Italian vehicle group Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
ALCATEL Alsthom, a partner in the first merger to attract a European
Commission inquiry under its new powers to vet cross-border deals, yesterday
accused the Brussels authorities of discriminating against European
businesses.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the French telecommunications, transport and
energy company, said the strict conditions demanded by Brussels for his
company's wide-ranging alliance with Fiat, the Italian automotive group,
created 'a strong distorting element' in his markets.
'Today, it is harder for a European company to buy another one than it is
for a non-European company to buy into Europe,' said Mr Suard. The
Commission was in danger of turning the European single market into 'a
shifting marsh, open to all currents, with the two economic citadels of the
US and Japan standing on either side,' he said.
The link-up between Alcatel Alsthom and Fiat, one of Europe's biggest
cross-border deals to date, was announced in October. It was the first deal
to attract a full Commission inquiry under its six-month-old merger control
regulation. As such, it makes a discouraging test case for the way in which
the Commission can be expected to use its new powers, said Mr Suard. The
French company will do its best to satisfy the Commission's demands, but Mr
Suard gave no guarantee that he would comply with all of them. This is among
several delays experienced by the complex deal, Mr Suard revealed yesterday.
Alcatel Alsthom and Fiat have agreed to postpone another part of the accord,
under which the French partner would take control of Fiat's rail equipment
division, because they cannot agree on price. Nevertheless, Mr Suard
emphasised that he was satisfied with the general progress of the link-up.
The main part of the complex deal, which came into effect a few weeks ago -
delayed six months by the Commission inquiry, says Mr Suard - gives Alcatel,
the French group's telecommunications unit, control of Telettra, Fiat's
telecommunications business.
Fiat, meanwhile, is waiting to take control of Alcatel Alsthom's car
batteries business, once the Commission has pronounced on the impact on the
French market. Finally, the pair have agreed to exchange share stakes, with
Fiat taking 6 per cent of Alcatel Alsthom and the French partner taking 3
per cent of Fiat.
sion about the telecommunications part of the accord was that Alcatel and
Telettra's Spanish subsidiaries together hold 80 per cent of the Spanish
market for transmission equipment. Alcatel is the European Community's
largest supplier of telecommunications equipment, with 29 per cent of the
market.
The Alcatel-Telettra merger could only be allowed, said the Commission, if
they broke their shareholding links with Telefonica, the Spanish telephone
operator, which, like some of its equivalents around the world, likes to
keep minority stakes in its main suppliers. The aim is to curb any
temptation for Telefonica to give Alcatel and Telettra special treatment.
Mr Suard said he was happy to buy Telefonica's shares in Telettra's Italian
and Spanish subsidiary, since that was part of the original Fiat agreement.
However he was less than keen on the Commission's demand that Alcatel buy
back the 21.14 per cent stake that Telefonica holds in the French group's
Spanish subsidiary.
'We are negotiating in good faith to do so, but we can only do it if the
purchase conditions are acceptable to us,' he said.
'If we cannot agree the price, there will be no acquisition,' said Mr Suard.
Alcatel Alsthom will not indicate what that price might be, though
Telefonica's books value its stakes in Alcatel Standard Electrica - the
French group's Spanish offshoot - and Telettra Espanola at Pta4.4bn (Dollars
40.5m). Telefonica is likely to argue that this is a fraction of their real
value.
Mr Suard found the requirement to buy back Telefonica's stake in Alcatel's
Spanish unit all the more surprising given that Telefonica continues to hold
shares in the local subsidiaries of Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications
group, and AT&amp;T of the US, both competitors of Alcatel, without being
challenged by Brussels.
'We are all in favour of competition, but it must be balanced,' said Mr
Suard, normally known for his liberal economic views.
'Applying this requirement only to Alcatel sets up a strong distortion in
the single market.'
Mr Suard does not plan to contest the decision. However, his outburst does
show that France's general unease over the application of EC competition
policy has spilled over from the traditional wrangling over state subsidies
into a new area for dispute; mergers.
