RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, and SNIA
Fibre, a unit of Fiat's SNIA offshoot, plan to merge their European
activities in polyamide carpet yarn (BCF) and polyamide staple fibre, Reuter
reports.
Rhone-Poulenc said the merged unit, held 50-50 by itself and SNIA, will have
estimated annual turnover of FFr1.8bn (Dollars 322.8m) and employ about
1,500 people.
The joint venture will be Europe's largest carpet staple fibre and BCF
polyamide producer. It will be a leading producer of polyamide staple fibre
for textile and industrial uses.
Mediobanca yesterday revealed that gross profit fell to L340.4bn (Dollars
274.7m) in the first half, from L354.7bn in the previous year.
But in the eight months to the end of February this year, gross profit stood
at L409.8bn, slightly up from L407.9bn in the same period the year before,
the bank said.

A SWISS national has been arrested in Tehran on charges of illegal contacts
with Iranian military personnel, the Iranian news agency IRNA said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
It quoted a statement by the Tehran military prosecutor as saying Mr Hans
Bohler was arrested on March 18 along with two Iranians described as a
manager and a clerk in a trading company.
Iran is at loggerheads with Switzerland over the arrest in Berne of a member
of the Iranian embassy on suspicion of involvement in the murder last August
of former Iranian prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar in Paris.
The IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, said the three were arrested on
charges of 'illegal contacts with the personnel of the Iranian armed
forces'.
It said the case was under investigation but gave no other details.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Danish referendum frays Brussels nerves: The first popular
judgment on Maastricht is a close-run race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MR Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the country's foreign minister of the past 10
years, puts it: 'Such is the Danish character that if we politicians tell
them that they ought to do this and that, they will turn round and reply,
'That's for us to decide'.'
And this is the attitude which the politicians are up against in the
campaign to persuade the Danes to back the Maastricht treaty in the
referendum to be held on June 2.
Maastricht has to be ratified by all 12 EC parliaments; if it fails in one,
it effectively fails in all. Denmark will be the first to pass judgment on
the treaty, thereby ensuring that the very first obstacle for Maastricht
will also be one of the hardest. It would have been safer tactics, say
diplomats and officials in Brussels, if the Danes had delayed their
referendum so that countries like Belgium and Italy, where ratification is a
foregone conclusion, could give them a lead.
Although parties representing 144 out of the 179 seats in the Folketing
support European Union, opinion polls over the past month have shown
majorities against the treaty. However, it is too early to make any firm
predictions: about a third of voters have yet to make up their minds.
This time, the issue is at once vague - 'an ever closer union of the people
of Europe' - and exhaustively detailed.
Mr Morten Jersild, whose advertising agency conducted a campaign for
membership of the EC in 1972, was quoted as saying that trying to sell the
Maastricht treaty to the public is 'a hopeless task'. 'The price of the
product is unknown, and so are the side-effects. If anyone asked us to
inform the Danes ahead of the referendum in June we'd decline.'
The grandiose vision of a European union holds little appeal for most Danes.
Polls show that they attach great importance to maintaining the country's
'Danishness' and right of self-determination.
They are sceptical of devolving sovereignty to Brussels, and larger
proportions of the electorate than in other EC countries, including Britain,
are against a common foreign or defence policy and against a common
currency. A factor which may contribute to a vote against Maastricht is the
leadership dispute in the opposition Social Democratic Party, where the
deputy chairman, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has challenged the present
chairman, Mr Svend Auken.
The contest will be decided at an extraordinary congress of the party on
April 11. The SDP's internal problems are caused by widespread disillusion
with Mr Auken's qualities as leader and have distracted the party from
campaigning.
The SDP helped agree the Danish negotiating position for Maastricht and the
party leadership is solidly behind the agreement which was reached. But
there is a two-to-one majority against Maastricht among the party's
supporters, according to opinion surveys.
Three of the eight parties in the Folketing are against Maastricht, the
Socialist People's Party, which in its time was against Nato, EC membership,
and the internal market; the right-wing Progress Party, and the centrist
Christian People's Party, which is so badly split that in a recent debate on
Maastricht it fielded both pro and anti spokesmen. Additionally, between now
and mid-May, minor or uncontroversial amendments to the treaty are possible,
if all 12 agree.
It is, for instance, highly likely that Ireland will change the wording of
its special anti-abortion protocol and that, if the UK has a Labour
government after the April 9 poll, Maastricht's separate social policy
protocol will be abandoned. But Copenhagen has asked its EC partners for all
such changes to be agreed before it sends its final version to press on May
14. The features of Maastricht causing such a large chunk of the Danish
electorate disquiet are too large to be re-negotiated, either before the
June 2 referendum or probably even after.
No one in Denmark seems clear on the consequences of a Danish 'no' but Mr
Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, and Danish voices
from Brussels, including the budget commissioner, Mr Henning Christoffersen,
and Mr Niels Ersboll, the secretary general of the Council of Ministers,
have all said that it will be the beginning of the end for Denmark's
membership.
The Euro-sceptics in the Folketing argued in a debate on March 17 that if
there is a Danish 'no', it merely means that Maastricht will have to be
renegotiated.
However, the government thinks it is highly unlikely that the EC's other 11
members will undo a delicately balanced deal in order to accommodate 5m
Danes.
The Socialist People's Party spokesmen, Mr Gert Petersen and Mr Sten Gade,
pointed out that the Rome Treaty contains no provisions for throwing out
members of the EC and that Maastricht requires unanimity.
A possible future for Denmark would be some kind of associate membership.
One of the paradoxes of a Danish 'no' is the risk of isolating itself from
its Nordic neighbours, assuming that Sweden and Finland, which have both
applied for membership, actually join. Perhaps the Nordic argument is the
one which will finally convince the doubters that a 'yes' is probably the
best alternative after all.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rural vote no longer true blue
 -Tories face the erosion of support previously taken for granted / Farmers'
Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH FARMERS do best under the Labour Party but can always be relied upon
to vote Conservative. That, at least, has been the received wisdom of UK
political parties as they have fought every general election since the
second world war.
It has meant that the Conservatives have not felt much need to court the
farm vote because they perceived it was theirs anyway and that Labour has
regarded time spent on farmers as a bit of a waste, since they were unlikely
to persuade them to depart from established custom. Liberals, the Alliance,
or the Liberal Democrats as they now call themselves, have sometimes been a
threat to the other two parties in places like the wilder areas of Wales and
Scotland and the East Anglian Fens but by-elections apart, have been of
little consequence elsewhere.
A survey commissioned by the magazine Big Farm Weekly recently, however,
appears to indicate these rural traditions may be modified somewhat on April
9. Of the 500 or so farmers surveyed, 83 per cent said they had voted
Conservative at the last election but only 63 per cent said they intended
doing the same this time.
In 1987 only 1 per cent had voted Labour; this time 6 per cent said they
would do so. But the main beneficiaries of farmers' disillusionment with the
Conservatives would seem to be the Liberal Democrats. Five years ago they
received 13 per cent of the votes of the farmers surveyed; this time 26 per
cent of them said they would vote for the centre party.
The reasons for this apparent swing in farmer allegiance are not difficult
to find. Over the course of the three Conservative administrations UK farm
incomes have declined, in real terms, by more than 50 per cent and the net
worth of the industry has fallen by a similar amount.
Farmers, many of whom freely admit to usually making more profit under
Labour, have always justified their electoral support for the Conservative
party by pointing to its consistently lower levels of taxation on both
income and capital. Falling incomes and a slump in the value of land over
the last few years have meant that neither of these forms of taxation have
recently been a significant factor in their lives.
Moreover, the priority in many farmers' minds is to bring their incomes back
to levels that will save their businesses from going bust. Farming's new
floating voters presumably feel that any change of government would be to
their advantage. But there is little in the manifestos of Labour or Liberal
Democrats to justify that faith.
Like the Conservatives, both other main parties are committed to the
fundamental reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.
There are slight differences of emphasis but essentially all seek to cut the
cost of agricultural support, to provide payments to enhance the
environment, to reduce the intensity of farming methods and to force farmers
to rely more on market forces than on guaranteed prices.
In other words, on basic attitudes it looks like the mixture as before,
whichever party or alliance of parties rules over us at the end of next
week.
Many of the agriculture-related plans disclosed in the manifestos are
predictably geared more to the perceived demands of consumers of food than
to those who produce it. The Liberal Democrats, for instance, say they would
transfer responsibility for food standards from the Ministry of Agriculture
to a new Food and Drugs Commission and that there would be much tighter
labelling requirements for all foods.
Labour would create a Food Standards Agency and replace the entire Ministry
of Agriculture with a new Department of Food and Farming, the emphasis
clearly being on food. Meanwhile, the Conservatives would press for the high
standards of animal welfare already in force in the UK to be adopted across
the rest of the European Community and, subject to EC agreement, offer
financial encouragement for organic farming.
In a clear attempt to attract the more traditional farming vote, the Labour
Party has promised (although not in its manifesto) to reject the much
criticised MacSharry plan for the reform of the CAP, to retain the UK
marketing boards for milk and potatoes and to make no changes in farm
tenancy laws.
It may forfeit some of the support it might have derived from that quarter,
however, by advocating public access to open mountain, moor and heath land
and the opening of all footpaths across farmland. Labour has also promised
to debate, yet again, the vexed question of hunting with dogs and to allow a
free vote in the House of Commons. But they plan no new limitations on the
much more popular country sports of fishing and shooting.
The other two main parties are silent on such emotive matters but both the
Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats say they would liberalise the laws
on farm tenancies and introduce limited term agreements.
Alongside the main problem of falling farm incomes, however, all these
details are peripheral. As Mr David Curry, the former Minister of State at
the Ministry of Agriculture, conceded at the National Farmers' Union's
annual meeting a few weeks ago, 90 per cent of all the decisions affecting
UK farmers' incomes are taken in Brussels these days. Furthermore the
outcome, if any, of current negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt
will have far more real influence on British farm prices and profits than
any policy likely to be adopted by any of the UK political parties.
Add to this the fact that farmers and farmworkers now account for a mere 2
per cent of the British electorate and that they are spread over an enormous
number of rural constituencies, and it is clear why large sectors of the
industry feel impotent in the face of mounting difficulties.
Indeed, as Big Farm Weekly suggested, there are only seven constituencies in
which the farming vote might have a decisive effect on the selection of a
member of parliament. They are Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, Lancashire
West, Cambridgeshire North-east, Hereford, Pembroke, Devon North and
Cornwall North.
All are currently held by Conservatives; all have between 10 per cent and 25
per cent of their voting populations working in agriculture; and all are
officially classified as marginal seats. A significant swing either towards
Liberal Democrat or nationalist candidates would oust the sitting members.
Who can tell in a situation in which a hung parliament has to be a distinct
possibility what such a result might do to the balance of power?
Perhaps the farmers in these constituencies at least have a bit more
political clout than they realise.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Non-discounting Alexon down to Pounds 11.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXON GROUP, the specialist fashion retailer, suffered its first fall in
profits since 1985, as it refused to join the legions of discounters in a
high-street price war. It demerged from Claremont Garments, the Marks and
Spencer supplier, in July last year.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 11.3m for the year to
January 25. However, the previous year's figures comprise just 43 weeks to
January 26 1991, as Alexon changed its year-end to fall into line with the
retailing sector.
The effort to hold margins and the dearth of business in the high street
resulted in an 8 per cent like-for-like drop in sales. Operating profits,
cushioned by a Pounds 400,000 gain on a pension charge reduction, dropped by
19 per cent to Pounds 12.6m on an annualised basis.
Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said Alexon was serving the long-term
interests of its three brands - Alexon, Eastex and Dash - by refusing to
join the discounters. However, the drop in sales as buyers went for bargains
had depressed operating margins from 12 to 11 per cent. Gross margins
remained unchanged.
Mr Snyder said it was unlikely the company could increase margins through
more cost-cutting. 'The opportunity is not there,' he said. 'We need sales
growth this year to increase profits.'
Alexon took a Pounds 6.32m extraordinary charge, largely due to ending Dash
Junior, the ill-starred foray into the children's leisurewear market.
Of the three brands, only Eastex, the relaunched clothing range aimed at the
shorter, older woman, had increased sales and profits. It was trading well
following its move towards the younger - aged 50 - target consumer.
Alexon, the classic womens-wear range, suffered its first decline since
1983, said Mr Snyder. Turnover in Alexon, which caters to the working woman
aged 30-plus, fell by 10 per cent and profits slightly more. Of the three
brands, margin defence was most important to this upmarket range, Mr Snyder
said.
Finally, Dash, the men's and women's leisurewear brand, also reported a
decline. Mr Snyder said Alexon planned to increase the range of clothing,
including a new collection by Ms Rosemary Conley, author of Hip and Thigh
Diet.
During the year, the company increased floor space by 4 per cent. Capital
expenditure of Pounds 4m would remain about the same this year.
Fully diluted earnings per share, including the Pounds 1.5m exceptional gain
in 1990/91, fell from 31.24p to 22.11p, on an annualised basis. The final
dividend was 7.6p, making a total of 10.6p.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) off 13% despite rise in
house sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILSON (Connolly) Holdings, the Northampton-based builder, sold more houses
last year than in the booming late 1980s.
But its pre-tax profit fell 13 per cent from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 27.1m,
half the 1989 figure.
Group turnover inched ahead to Pounds 198m (Pounds 196m) in spite of falls
in the construction and property divisions.
Mr Ian Black, managing director, said a record 2,750 homes had been sold,
400 more than in 1990 and nearly 1,000 more than in 1989. But the average
price had come down to Pounds 54,400, from Pounds 59,500 in 1990 and Pounds
64,500 the previous year. He warned that prices could fall further this
year.
Two thirds of the 16 per cent decline in average prices was caused by
deflation, the rest from the greater emphasis on one and two-bedroomed
homes.
Small houses accounted for 65 per cent of sales last year, 'whereas the
normal level would be 45 to 50 per cent'.
This year the group had seen some welcome signs after a 'diabolical' fourth
quarter.
Customer interest had picked up in the first two months and the ratio of
house prices to earnings was in better balance.
Wilcon Homes had spent nearly Pounds 30m buying land last year after virtual
inactivity in 1990.
'I would be disappointed if we did not spend Pounds 30m again this year
because it would mean a lack of opportunity,' said Mr Black.
In spite of this increased outgoing, net debt had only risen to Pounds 25m,
giving year-end gearing of 13 per cent compared with 7 per cent.
Off-balance-sheet debt was Pounds 4m.
Construction profits fell to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 4.43m) on reduced turnover
of Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 48.1m). The squeeze on margins was expected to get
tighter.
Property made just Pounds 380,000 profit, down from Pounds 5.56m. It would
continue to be a struggle to break even, he said, although Pounds 15m cash
had been released.
Earnings per share fell to 10.2p (11.3p).
An increased final dividend of 2.66p makes a total of 3.93p (3.74p).
COMMENT
Housing analysts seem to be going into a decline ahead of the general
election. One said the average income of a new house-buyer was Pounds
22,000, just the level at which Labour's national insurance extension would
start to bite. This is fuelling fears that house prices could fall further,
just when land bought at higher prices is feeding through. Hence the erosion
of margins. Wilcon's 17 per cent last year, which included a couple of
respectable quarters, looks vulnerable to a further squeeze. Pre-tax profit
is forecast to fall below Pounds 25m this year, giving a prospective p/e of
just over 19 times. It remains one of the safe players, with a strong
balance sheet and long land bank, making a case for holding the shares. But
the price is unlikely to make progress until the political dust has settled,
and the multiple is high enough to carry risk of a further downrating along
with the sector.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Inchcape beats rights issue forecast with
6% improvement to Pounds 185.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, increased pre-tax profits
by just over 6 per cent to Pounds 185.2m in 1991 in spite of tough
conditions in several of its vehicle markets.
The profit figure was about Pounds 5m ahead of the forecast made with the
1-for-3 rights issue in December. That raised Pounds 376m to buy Tozer
Kemsley Millbourn, the motors and retailing concern, from Brierley
Investments of New Zealand.
With the TKM deal not completed until this month, it made no contribution to
the 1991 figures.
These included a 10 per cent advance in turnover to Pounds 3.64bn and a 9.6
per cent increase in earnings per share to 28.5p (26p), after a reduced
minority charge.
Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, was confident of further progress this
year, even though he saw no economic recovery in the UK until 1993. Domestic
sales only accounted for 30 per cent of the group total.
Pre-interest profits of Pounds 192.1m (Pounds 193.4m) were affected by a
Pounds 17m fall in property profits and reduced contributions following the
sale of a stake in the Assam tea business. The tea disposal helped to reduce
interest costs by Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 6.9m. Net debt stood at Pounds 99m
at the year-end, giving gearing of 18 per cent.
Motors, including the Mann Egerton dealerships and Toyota distribution,
accounted for almost 60 per cent of sales, while operating profit inched
ahead to Pounds 112.1m (Pounds 110.6m).
Toyota (GB) increased its market share from 2.1 to 2.6 per cent. During
1993, the first year of production at the Burnaston factory in Derbyshire,
Toyota will increase its stake in the UK distribution business from 5 to 25
per cent.
Mr Mackay said that last year 150,000 of the 220,000 vehicles sold by the
group were Toyotas. TKM would add about 150,000 non-Toyota sales.
The strongest performance came from the services side, including Bain
Clarkson in insurance, shipping and environmental testing. Divisional profit
grew by 51 per cent to Pounds 42.1m.
Marketing contributed Pounds 57.2m, up from Pounds 52.7m. with the best
progress in Japan, Hong Kong and China. A proposed final dividend of 7.5p
makes a total of 12.5p, up from 11.8p.

FT  31 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling and gilts override poll
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a steep opinion poll-driven slide in London's equity market
proved no more than a gentle early morning mark-down and was followed by a
confident rally which left share prices with widespread, albeit modest,
gains yesterday.
Backing up the overall stability in London was a relatively steady
performance by sterling. Gilt-edged stocks delivered the best performance of
the day and posted rises of a half-point and sometimes more at the long end.
The general election obviously remained the big story in the market but,
after the initial mark-down, which was accompanied by pockets of small
selling pressure, it failed to trigger any substantial swings in sentiment
as the day progressed.
Helping the stock market shrug off the poll worries was a surprisingly
strong showing by the March Footsie future, which traded at a premium or
parity to the cash market throughout the session ahead of its expiry today.
There was determined buying of the March future, which was said to have
sustained the primary market. One of the big integrated houses was said to
have played a big part in keeping the future at a premium. The traded
options market, on the other hand, was subdued.
Share prices began the day on the retreat, with traders wary of the market's
reaction to the weekend opinion polls, and continuing unease over the debt
burdens being carried by the Olympia &amp; York property development group and
Heron Corporation, among the UK's biggest privately owned companies.
Very little selling ensued, however, and marketmakers quickly altered tack,
hoisting prices to accommodate small institutional buying orders. Wall
Street gave no real cause for concern, opening marginally firmer and
maintaining a positive stance during London trading hours.
Down just over 11 points within minutes of the official opening of business,
the FT-SE 100 Index gradually crept up to end the day a net 5 points higher
at 2,452.9, having reached a session peak of 2,453.5.
Official statistics revealed how thin the day's business had been, however.
Turnover was recorded as 402.7m shares, substantially down on Friday's
500m-plus figure. Seasoned traders see little hope of any big expansion in
genuine customer business ahead of the election. 'Volumes are dreadful and
still shrinking and you can't blame the institutions; they can't get big
sizes done with the marketmakers keeping their heads down,' said one trader.
Among the big movers in the market, Midland Bank was prominent on the upside
as more commentators took the view that a price of 400p-plus would be needed
to ensure control of the bank. Barclays shares declined as analysts pondered
the bank's exposure to the troubled Heron group.
The big overseas-earning groups were among the Footsie's best performers,
notably RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, ICI and Inchcape.
Eurotunnel shares endured another painful session, after confirmation of
increased payments to TML, the consortium building the Channel tunnel.

FT  31 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Forecast cuts hit Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWINGEING forecast cuts by two securities houses knocked Barclays as concern
over the clearing bank's exposure to property debts at Heron Group and
Olympia &amp; York continued. The shares lost 5 to 317p on turnover of 5.7m.
County NatWest chopped its 1992 profits estimate from Pounds 650m to Pounds
475m and Mr John Aitken, County's banking analyst, sent out a very bearish
note to clients headed: 'The nightmare continues'. In the note he suggests
that a further round of forecast cuts is imminent. He added yesterday that
Barclays' exposure to O &amp; Y's debt could be as high as Pounds 400m, far
higher than most observers' estimates of around Pounds 250m.
Also, Kleinwort Benson lowered its 1992 estimate by Pounds 150m to Pounds
540m, although the house sees the stock as a buy at these levels.
Midland optimism
Optimism over its proposed merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking helped
Midland Bank to escape a general drubbing in the sector. The shares also
gained from a press report suggesting that Lloyds Bank had been prepared to
bid for Midland on a one-for-one share exchange basis when its own shares
were above 400p.
County NatWest reigned in its 1992 profits estimate for Midland by Pounds
38m to Pounds 222m, but the stock closed 7 up at 357p on heavy turnover of
7.3m shares.
National Westminster Bank was initially firm after announcing that Mr Tom
Frost, its chief executive, had resigned. Widely expected, the move reflects
a link between NatWest's merchant banking arm County NatWest and the Blue
Arrow affair.
However, a positive response to the management change was offset by reaction
to NatWest's bad debt exposure. This prompted profits forecast cuts by
County and Kleinwort Benson. County lopped Pounds 200m off its 1992 figure
to Pounds 300m. Kleinwort came down by Pounds 50m to Pounds 500m. The shares
closed a penny lighter at 279p.
Fresh Lonrho gloom
Dark clouds continued to hang over Lonrho, the shares finishing a further 8
down at 79p, after touching 76p. Some 7.9m shares changed hands.
The gloom surrounding yesterday's trading followed reports that Fidelity, of
the US, the group's second largest investor, may be forced to sell its
shareholding in Lonrho if the United Nations decides to impose sanctions
against Libya.
Fidelity now holds a 9.81 per cent stake in Lonrho. Last week Lonrho sold a
third of its Metropole Hotel group to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment
Company for Pounds 177.5m.
Sentiment was further hurt by an announcement that the proposed sale,
announced last month, of Lonrho's Scottish newspaper group to Trinity
International Holdings for Pounds 45m is to be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission for investigation.
Eurotunnel tumbled on news that the company would have to pay an additional
Pounds 50m per month to TML, the tunnel building consortium, following a
decision by a disputes panel investigating a Pounds 1.3bn claim by TML.
The shares, which opened 15 down following a report in Paris of the
decision, retreated further to end a net 33 off at 405p. Turnover in London
was reasonable at 1.1m shares, but heavy in Paris where some 3.5m shares
changed hands.
Inchcape moved ahead 13 to 428p after the company surprised the market with
a 6.4 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 185.2m. Mr Robert Morton at BZW
was among analysts to upgrade his profits forecast following the results. He
lifted his current year prediction by Pounds 5m to Pounds 260m. Turnover
reached 1.2m shares.
Lucas Industries, which reported figures in line with expectations, receded
7 to 112p as dividend worries surfaced after the company said the
second-half redundancy costs would at least equal those of the first half.
In spite of cutting his full-year forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m, Mr
John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney remains positive about the outlook
for Lucas, 'particularly given the increased penetration in all European car
markets'. GKN eased 2 to 343p in sympathy with Lucas.
Smith New Court downgraded Cable and Wireless following an analysts' meeting
on Friday at which the telecoms group discussed restructuring costs of
Pounds 50m. The house is now looking for profits of Pounds 645m (down Pounds
50m) for this year and Pounds 750m (down Pounds 30m) for 1993. Smith
believes that C and W's proposed rate of earnings growth of 10 to 15 per
cent in 1993 will not be reached until 1994. The shares declined 6 to 523p.
A perception that RTZ would be among the Footsie constituents liable to
attract strong support in the event of a Labour victory in the general
election, because of the mining group's big overseas earnings and assets,
boosted the shares by 13 to 575p.
MB-Caradon climbed 9 to 259p with 2m shares traded after well received
end-of-year results. The company held its dividend and announced higher
profits of Pounds 106.4m. Analyst Mr David Taylor of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
lifted his profits forecast for 1992 to Pounds 135m and reinforced his buy
stance on the stock.
Supermarket group Asda was the most active stock yesterday, on turnover of
23m shares, but there was little effect on the price, which ended a penny
off at 32 1/2 p. An agency cross was reported to have been largely
responsible for the volume.
Stores, which have been on the slide during the three weeks since the UK
Budget, showed a limited bounce. Disappointment at the Budget's lack of
political impact, and the failure to cut interest rates, have depressed the
shares of companies such as Kingfisher, which recently produced better than
expected results. Shares in the Woolworth to B &amp; Q holding company have
fallen about 50p since the Budget, but recovered 3 to 483p yesterday.
The persistent market rumours concerning a possible bid by Airtours for
Owners Abroad - complete with anonymous notes to newspapers and brokers -
are under investigation by the Stock Exchange. Both companies deny the
story. Meanwhile, Airtours eased a penny to 263p and Owners slipped 1 1/2 to
106p.
A big agency cross in Rank Organisation - 1.5m shares at 645p - saw the
stock appreciate 4 to 650p. Euro Disney continued to weaken after last
week's bearish comments, losing 13 to 1510p.

FT  31 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG futures sector driven by both technical and market factors gave
support to the underlying equity market, although volume, particularly in
options, was quiet, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE future expires at 10.10am today and yesterday's session was
dominated by traders trying to close positions, with at least one big
trading house being caught short. Consequently, March was in demand for most
of the day, with its opening level of 2,435 turning out to be its low point
of the session.
The contract was also helped by a positive performance in the gilts and
short sterling markets. After its recent spate in the doldrums, it traded at
a premium or parity to the cash market for most of the day. March had an
unexciting afternoon session, with a quiet Wall Street failing to impact,
although it picked up in late trading.
March finished at 2,453, up 9 from the previous session and at a slight
premium to the cash market. Volume came to 5,739 contracts.
In the traded options market, there were few large lots traded in the total
of 27,462 contracts. British Steel was the most active stock option with
1,551 lots transacted. Prudential had 1,254 dealt.

Wall Street
UNCERTAINTY about the economy and corporate earnings continued to plague US
stock markets yesterday, and at the end of the quietest trading session this
year share prices were virtually unchanged, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 3.80 at 3,235.24.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.50 at 403.00,
while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks slipped 2.60 to
602.07. Turnover on the New York SE was extremely light at 134.2m shares.
The market continues to search for a new direction, but the lack of
convincing news that the economy was on the mend and that corporate profits
were rebounding kept investors on the sidelines yesterday.
The only economic data released during the session was disappointing - a 2.7
per cent fall in new single-family home sales during February. The market
had expected a rise in home sales, and the decline reversed the recent
pattern which appeared to show a decent recovery in the US housing market.
Chrysler rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 5/8 in active trading after
Prudential Securities, the broking house, upgraded its rating on the car
maker's stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'. General Motors was up Dollars  1/8
at Dollars 36 3/4 and Ford Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 38 3/4 .
Banks were weaker, especially those leading issues still troubled by reports
of financial problems at Olympia &amp; York, the property developer, which last
week admitted that it faced a serious cash flow problem because of its
billion-dollar debt burden. Among the biggest declines were two banks said
to have some of the greatest exposure to O &amp; Y: Chemical, down Dollars 1 1/4
at Dollars 33 3/8 , and Citibank, Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 17.
Boeing firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 on news of an order for 15
twin-jet 757s from USAir (off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 17 1/2 ), which should
be worth about Dollars 900m to the aircraft manufacturer.
Varian Associates dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 39 as the market digested
the news late on Friday that the company had failed to reach an agreement on
the sale of its vacuum-making operations.
Helene Curtis advanced Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 39 1/8 in the wake of a big
improvement in the healthcare and beauty products group's fourth-quarter
profits, which rose from 28 cents a share a year ago to 69 cents a share in
the final quarter of 1991.
On the over-the-counter market Intel fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 53 1/4 and on
the NYSE Advanced Micro Devices eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 3/8 after
the two stocks were downgraded by PaineWebber semiconductor analyst Mr John
Lazlo because of the threat of competition from a chip produced by Cyrix.
Canada
WEAKNESS in banks and real estate and construction stocks more than offset
gains in other indices in Toronto, sending the market moderately lower.
Nervousness over Olympia &amp; York's cash flow problems and the constitutional
squabble continued to weigh on the market.
The composite index was finally 10.1 down at 3,406.7. Declines outnumbered
advances by 270 to 230 after modest volume of 23.7m shares valued at
CDollars 234.4m.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar recoups Friday's losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR edged a little higher in London yesterday, recouping some of
Friday's losses, ahead of a welter of economic statistics due out this week.
It crept up to a close of DM1.6500 from a DM1.6430/40 start and a
DM1.6400/10 New York finish on Friday. It firmed to Y133.45 from
Y132.95/133.05 and Y133.00/07.
Traders said the buying interest was enough, in a thin market, to overcome
the negative effect of poorer than expected data on new home sales in the
US. Sales declined 2.7 per cent in February after economists had predicted a
rise of 2.1 per cent. Meanwhile, January home sales were revised down to an
11.1 per cent monthly rise from a provisional 12.9 per cent.
However, analysts pointed out that positive revisions to past numbers meant
the actual level of sales, at an annual 613,000 units, was fairly consistent
with forecasts. Furthermore, many still expect the rest of the week's data
to provide evidence that the US economy is picking up and hence to favour
the dollar.
In late Asian trading the dollar had been a shade lower against the yen but
slightly firmer against the D-Mark.
In New York yesterday it opened  3/4 pfennig higher at DM1.6480/85 and ended
at DM1.6460, after Friday's weak close of DM1.6400/10.
Dealers said there was some interest in the French franc amid intense
speculation that Prime Minister Edith Cresson was on the verge of stepping
down. Since the ruling Socialist party's bad showing in recent local
elections, rumours of her resignation have stalked the markets. The franc
hovered around last week's seven-month high of DM3.39. It closed at
DM3.3906/08.
The uncertainty left the currency markets unruffled. Dealers said the
markets were counting on Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, and his
tight economic strategy to weather the storm.
The pound remained mired in political uncertainty after weekend opinion
polls failed to give either of the two main political parties a clear lead.
By midday sterling was stuck at DM2.8559/76 after a DM2.8548/81 start. It
closed at DM2.8570. It fell to Dollars 1.7315 from a previous Dollars
1.7380, but firmed in New York to a Dollars 1.7360 close.
A sterling trader commented: 'The prospect of a minority or coalition
government is hardly one that endears itself to investors who value
stability above all else.'
Continued strength in German interest rates underpinned the D-Mark, which
ended slightly firmer against most key currencies. Dealers said the market's
confidence that German rates would remain high was backed by comments from
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who said on German television that the central bank
would maintain current monetary policies.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading still quiet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET dozed yesterday after indecisive weekend opinion polls on the
general election failed to excite traders.
A mixed bag of polls, which showed the Labour party unable to extend its
small lead over the Conservatives, pointed towards a hung parliament on
April 9, or as some dealers put it yesterday, 'no parliament'.
'The market seems fairly sanguine about the election,' said one dealer.
'Perhaps they are just rather bored with it all. At the moment everybody
seems inured to a hung parliament.'
Rates remained soft throughout the day. The key three-month interbank rate
eased slightly to 10 13/16 -10 3/4 per cent from 10 7/8 -10 3/4 per cent.
At the longer end, however, the one year rate firmed from 11-10 7/8 to 11
1/8 -11 per cent. Generally the long dates were consolidating and
threatening to mount a more decisive move beyond 11 per cent, suggesting
that the markets are looking for a rise in base rates after the election.
The June sterling contract opened down two basis points at 88.96, and after
low volumes of trading climbed to 89.08.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn but
revised its forecast twice during the day, ending with a forecast liquidity
shortage of Pounds 1.75bn.
In the morning the Bank bought bills totalling Pounds 710m for resale to the
market on April 13 at 10 7/16 per cent.
It operated in the market again in the afternoon, purchasing Pounds 752m
outright, including Pounds 652m of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent
and Pounds 100m band two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, with a further
Pounds 300m for resale on April 13.
With bill operations finally amounting to Pounds 1.76bn, the shortage
appeared to have been fully serviced.
The expectation was that the authorities would pursue their course of
fostering inexpensive funding with the objective of calming troubled waters.
Money was generally cheap, with the overnight rate dipping to 9 per cent
during the morning from an early 9 7/8 - 3/4 per cent. It finished around 10
per cent in thin trading.
German call money rates edged higher yesterday to 9.60/70 per cent from
Friday's 9.60/65 per cent as bank liquidity came under pressure from
end-of-month pension payments.
Dealers said the March reserve requirement was set by the Bundesbank at
DM75.9bn.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bright future awaits wines of
quality in a changing world - Robert Graham samples the FAO's world wine
consumption forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of stocking a decent cellar is likely to rise by the turn of the
century, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation.
For the less discerning, the cost of a bottle of plonk is forecast to remain
stable at best.
Quality wines should meet rising demand, while production of common table
wine will exceed market requirements, the FAO suggests in papers prepared
for a meeting of its intergovernmental group on wine and vine products to be
held in conjunction with the International Vine and Wine Office in Sienna,
Italy at the end of the month.
The papers show that despite a continued trend to hold down output, overall
production by the year 2000 will exceed potential demand.
Taking 1985-87 as the benchmark year, world wine production is expected to
increase by 37m hectolitres to 338m hectolitres by the end of this decade.
World annual wine production will grow on average by 0.8 percent compared
with annual increases of 2.1 percent in the sixties and 1.5 per cent in the
late 1870s and early 1980s. Global demand is estimated to attain 334m
hectrolitres by 2,000, with direct consumption of wine accounting for 80 per
cent of this quantity.
The FAO recognises the problems of forecasting production figures, given the
enormous potential variable of weather conditions.
Uncertainty also surrounds the fate of production in eastern Europe,
especially in the republics of the former Soviet Union. It is unclear how
demand patterns will evolve and to what extent anti-alcohol campaigns will
erode an already declining trend in consumption among the main wine-drinking
countries. Even with these variables, the FAO concludes it will be necessary
to pursue policies to reduce and stabilise production levels.
With 60 per cent of global wine produced by the EC, world output is
sensitive to major changes in the Community. For instance in 1990-91 EC wine
production increased 7 per cent to 184m hectolitres as a result of large
vintages in France, Portugal and Spain.
That helped explain last year's 4 per cent rise in world production to 294m
hectolitres. For the current year, the FAO projects a 20 per cent world
production fall, mainly because of expected declines in France (34 per
cent), Germany, Portugal and Spain.
The main trend identified by the FAO is a switch among developed countries,
which account for 90 per cent of wine production, away from cheap table
wines to higher quality. That allows producers to take advantage of an
expansion of the quality end of the market while also earning added value.
The quality market is also considered price elastic.
France, with its significant concentration in quality wines, accounts for
more than half the world's Dollars 8.5bn wine trade. However, in volume
terms, France is responsible for only 28 per cent of exports. Italy exports
30 per cent in volume terms but its earnings only represent 20 per cent of
world wine sales. To correct this imbalance, the Italian authorities are
trying to encourage producers to increase the percentage of quality
products.
The effect of converting more Italian vineyards to higher quality is
expected to produce a 0.4 percent annual average decline in production, but
offset by higher sales returns. With the process at a mature stage in
France, French annual production is expected to stabilise at about 70m
hectolitres increasing annually by 0.3 per cent to the end of the decade. In
the case of Spain, another major producer, an annual growth of 0.7 per cent
is predicted, reaching production levels of 38m hectolitres.
German production prospects remain unpredictable, according to the FAO; but
the inclusion of former east Germany may produce an enlarged domestic market
stimulating greater output. Production in the former Soviet Union may grow
at an annual average of 3.2 per cent.
Elsewhere in eastern Europe production may rise by 6.8m hectolitres by the
year 2000. Eastern Europe's production rose by 34 per cent in 1990-91 with
good vintages in Hungary and Romania.
The North American market is expected to rise annually by 1.2 per cent from
late 1980s levels of 17m hectolitres and with marginally greater rises from
Australia and New Zealand.
The FAO believes the next decade will see developing countries occupy a
slightly increased share of world production, largely because Latin America
producers will raise output to accommodate their own expanding domestic
markets. Latin America currently provides almost 9 per cent of world
production. Argentina could increase its production by 4.3m hectolitre,
growing at 1.5 per cent a year; while Chile, which has switched many vines
to table grape production and concentrated on quality wines, could increase
output by 1.7 per cent. The small Brazilian output may grow by 2.4 per cent
annually.
Algeria is expected to continue its marked downward trend in production,
which was inherited from French colonial rule and used for 'coupage' with
French wines. That will be offset by Morocco raising production by an annual
2.4 percent and Tunisia with a more modest 0.8 per cent.
The FAO concludes: 'Social attitudes towards alcohol consumption, health
concerns and changing life-styles have influenced the per capita consumption
in major wine consuming countries, especially in the large wine consuming
countries of western Europe such as France and Italy.'
Average world per capita consumption among adults is expected to almost
halve by the end of the century against the levels of the mid 1970s.
Paradoxically, absolute non-consumption of wine is most common in high
consumption countries (like Italy and Spain), while there are few
non-consumers in countries where overall consumption is occasional and
relatively low (Denmark and Switzerland).
Demand continues to be dominated by national habits. One third of the
American population never drinks wine; a proportion which has remained
stable for 10 years, while 90 per cent of all wine drunk in the US is
consumed by only 15 per cent of the population concentrated mainly in six
states.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Matif recovers after morning political
jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government bond prices set the tone for the rest of continental
Europe yesterday, first trading lower as the market focused on political
uncertainties before recovering to close higher on the day.
The early tone of the French market was negative following the poor
performance by the ruling Socialist party in the weekend's second round of
regional elections. The government bond futures contract on the Matif, the
Paris futures exchange, fell to a low of 106.78 from an opening level of
107.20.
Both cash bond and futures prices recovered during the afternoon. Traders
ascribed the rally to speculation that Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime
minister, would soon resign, although the rumour was denied by the Socialist
party.
By the close of trading, the bond future stood at 107.40, just below the
day's high of 107.44. Volume was 17,975 contracts.
The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent 10-year French government OAT closed on a yield
of 8.71 per cent, against the 8.73 per cent seen on Friday.
GERMAN government bonds were dragged lower by negative sentiment in France
during the morning session, the gloomy mood compounded by statements from
prominent monetary officials which suggested German interest rates could
rise.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member and head of its economics division,
was quoted in the German press as saying inaction by the authorities would
give 'the wrong impression' to trade unions. Taken with earlier statements,
this was interpreted as a warning that interest rates could rise to counter
the effects of inflationary wage settlements.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened
at 87.15 and fell briefly below the psychologically important 87.00 level
during the morning, touching a low of 86.92 before finding support. The
market later rallied in line with French government bonds, the bund future
trading up to 87.33 by the close. Volume was an active 66,850 contracts.
AFTER posting solid early gains on a weaker-than-expected US new-home sales
report yesterday, Treasury prices fell back to approach the end of a quiet
session little changed.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 100
5/8 , yielding 7.938 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer,
however, up  3/32 at 100 9/32 , yielding 5.583 per cent.
Prices moved higher after traders welcomed the morning report that new
single-family home sales fell 2.7 per cent in February, after rising a
revised 11.1 per cent in January.
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday. The gains were concentrated at
the longer maturities. The benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 gained
15/32 of a point on the day to close at 94 7/8 for a yield of 9.58 per cent.
The June gilt futures contract on Liffe rose from 93.19 at the opening to
94.12 by the close, with trading volume a respectable 25,000 contracts.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Intel shares slide on
competition fears

INTEL'S stock price continued to fall sharply yesterday on concerns that the
leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips will face new competition from
Cyrix, a small Texas semiconductor company, that has launched its own
version of Intel's 486 chip, a device used in high-performance personal
computers.
Intel shares lost 15 per cent of their value last week, stock and yesterday
were trading at Dollars 53 1/2 , down from Friday's close of Dollars 55 1/4
.
On Friday, Intel filed a patent infringement suit against Cyrix and also
accused the company of 'patent laundering'. Intel officials acknowledged,
however, that they have not seen the Cyrix chip, or specifications for the
device.
'We do not believe that it is possible to produce a chip that is compatible
with our 386 microprocessor without infringing our patents,' said Mr Thomas
Dunlap, Intel general counsel. Intel is seeking a preliminary injunction to
prevent Cyrix from selling its microprocessor chip.
Cyrix denies any infringement. The Intel suit 'amounts to legal harassment,'
said Mr Jerry Rogers, Cyrix president.
Mr Rogers revealed that Cyrix had earlier filed suit against Intel asking
the court for a declaratory judgment that its microprocessor chips do not
violate any Intel patents because they are manufactured, on behalf of Cyrix,
by SGS Thomson, a European chipmaker licensed to use patented Intel
technology.
Yesterday, Cyrix officially introduced its product, a microprocessor that
offers performance close to that of Intel's 486 microprocessor while fitting
into the much smaller socket used by Intel's earlier 386SX.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York bonds attract
bargain-hunters

<TEXT>
LONG-TERM securities issued by Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened Canadian
property developer, are attracting the attention of bargain-hunters in the
North American bond market.
Real estate and corporate finance specialists at several Toronto securities
firms are suggesting investors should buy any O&amp;Y bonds which come on the
market at the deep discounts at which they have recently been traded.
One parcel of bonds secured by First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's flagship building
in Toronto, changed hands at a discount of 22 per cent to par last week.
The chief bond trader at one leading Toronto securities firms said yesterday
that several other small transactions had taken place, but that not all sell
orders had been filled.
One corporate bond specialist said the O&amp;Y bonds 'are probably a good
gamble'. Mr Brian Berner, chief executive of Berner and Company, a Toronto
investment firm which specialises in securities issued by companies in
financial difficulty, said his firm was preparing bids on behalf of its
institutional clients.
O&amp;Y has been caught in a liquidity crunch and is in the early stages of
restructuring its debt. But the publicly-traded bonds, which were mostly
issued in the mid and late 1980s, are secured by specific buildings.
Besides First Canadian Place, securitised projects in Canada include the
690,000 sq ft Shell Centre in Calgary, and 240 Sparks Street, an Ottawa
building occupied by federal government agencies. Several O&amp;Y buildings in
the US are also securitised, including 55 Water Street and 58 Maiden Lane in
Manhattan.
The analysts who recommend purchases of the bonds are confident their value
is more than covered by the buildings which secure them, even allowing for
the recession in the North American office property market.
According to one analyst, the value of First Canadian Place is almost
certainly high enough to cover the CDollars 475m in outstanding bonds, even
allowing for CDollars 100m in higher-ranking debt and the fact the building
has a vacancy rate of about 20 per cent.
He said even in a 'worst-case scenario,' in which O&amp;Y was liquidated,
holders of the First Canadian Place bonds could expect to retrieve a minimum
of 85 cents per dollar invested.
In a report issued in mid-February, Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto
assumed First Canadian Place's appraised value at CDollars 700m.
There is, however, a cautious side to the interest in the O&amp;Y bonds. One
Toronto trader said his firm would not quote prices to sellers until it had
found a serious buyer. O&amp;Y's secrecy and its penchant for complicated
transactions is also giving cause for caution.
O&amp;Y has postponed a meeting due to be held in London yesterday with its
bankers and participants in the Docklands Canary Wharf project.
The meeting was to have been attended by Mr Tom Johnson, O&amp;Y's new
president, and by its financial advisers. No new date has been set.
Olympia &amp; York has asked an international syndicate of banks for a one-year
extension of a CDollars 450m (USDollars 378.1m) loan which falls due
tomorrow, writes Bernard Simon.
The loan, arranged four years ago to finance construction of Toronto's
Scotia Plaza complex, appears to be a key reason for the moratorium on
principal repayments requested by O&amp;Y from its senior creditors last Friday.
O&amp;Y asked the lenders to freeze its obligations until April 6, when it
expects to present an interim plan to restructure its debt, estimated at
about CDollars 20bn.

German capital markets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors returned to the German capital markets last year,
contributing DM62bn (Dollars 37.5bn) of the total DM275bn business volume,
the Finance Ministry reported yesterday.
They were drawn back, after pruning their portfolios by DM2.9bn in 1990, by
'faith in the stability of the D-Mark, attractive interest rates and the
prospect of exchange rate gains,' the ministry said.
The ministry said continued stability of the currency was crucial if markets
were to continue to flourish and federal finance policies were to withstand
testing times in the coming years. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, urged
the 16 state governments to protect the D-Mark by following Bonn's example
and reining in their budgets.
Overall volume was down from the record DM293bn of 1990, due mainly to a
drop of DM16bn in domestic securities business. Share issues fell to DM13bn
from DM28bn.
Virtually all the growth in foreign dealings was in the bond markets, which
recovered strongly from April after a spell of relative weakness for the
D-Mark, fears of increased inflation and concern over the future of the
former Soviet Union, the ministry said.
Falling bond yields in the US and Japan, coupled with the second-half 17.5
per cent appreciation of the D-Mark against the US dollar helped pull in
investment.
Domestic dealings benefited from increased private sector savings. West
Germans salted away DM221bn during the year compared with DM210bn in 1990.

SOFFEX, Switzerland's futures and options market, tumbled into loss last
year because of the dull trading climate in the Swiss equity market for most
of the year.
The loss in the market's fourth year of activity was SFr860,000 (Dollars
574,000) compared with a profit of SFr990,000 in 1990.
Trading volume continued to grow well, with the number of option trades in
shares and indices rising 14 per cent to 10.3m contracts, with some 60 per
cent of the trades in SMI options.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Write-downs mar Santos year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday reported a net loss of
ADollars 111m (USDollars 85m) for the year to the end of December after
writing down the value of its Timor Sea and US activities by ADollars 225m.
Santos said its pre-tax operating profit of ADollars 223m was a record, with
the exception of 1985 and 1990, when oil prices exceeded ADollars 40 a
barrel for part of the year. Oil prices averaged ADollars 28 in the year to
December.
The group said net profit before abnormal items was ADollars 114m, compared
with ADollars 137m in the previous year. However, the result was struck
after foreign exchange losses of ADollars 11m, compared with ADollars 1m in
the previous year. The 1990 result also included a profit of ADollars 12m
from the sale of UK operations.
The write-downs, which were foreshadowed in the 1990 annual report, follow a
disappointing exploration programme in the Timor Sea. Of 12 wells scheduled
to be drilled during the year, eight were dry and the remainder were
postponed or abandoned.
The biggest write-down was ADollars 154m against unsuccessful exploration
expenditure in a number of permit areas which will be relinquished this year
or next. A further ADollars 80m related to producing licences acquired with
Peko Oil.
The group said it would maintain an active exploration programme in the
Timor Sea. However, it plans to drill only five exploration wells and carry
out 15,000 kilometres of seismic testing this year.
Santos said it would begin exploration efforts this year in the North Sea,
Cambodia and Colombia, where interests had been acquired since June 1991.
Exploration would continue in the US and Malaysia, but would be reduced in
the Timor Sea and the Cooper Basin in South Australia.
The US write-down of ADollars 40m reflects a lower valuation for the group's
gas assets. The board said the group's US assets were now centred on Weeks
Exploration, a growing exploration company with good growth potential.
Sales revenue fell 7.6 per cent ADollars 656m from the 1990 record of
ADollars 709m. The fall was caused by lower crude oil prices compared to
1990, when the Gulf war inflated prices, and lower volumes for all products
except naphtha.
The directors declared an unchanged final dividend of 10 cents per share,
fully franked.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUTLAND Trust, the financial services group and property surveyor, yesterday
revealed a 20 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.2m for the
year to December 31.
The result, struck on turnover 26 per cent lower at Pounds 94.6m, was
further depressed below the line by a Pounds 3.3m charge (Pounds 4.9m
profit) for losses on the sale of the computer equipment leasing arm,
Technology Group.
The group's three divisions - corporate and asset financing, and
professional services - had all returned profits. However, losses in the
building surveying arm held back growth in professional services where
profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3.3m.
Mr Michael Langdon, chairman, said costs in building surveying had been cut
and the division was now breaking even. Loss adjusting, meanwhile, enjoyed
increased turnover and the division had been expanded with three new
offices.
Asset financing, most of which is the company's vehicle leasing business,
saw the sharpest drop in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.56m.
The corporate finance/head office division saw a 21 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3m.
Rutland ended the year with net cash of Pounds 19.5m. Mr Langdon said the
group had seen 'a number of opportunities in the business services sector .
. . We are not going to sit looking at a cash pile forever.'
Earnings per share fell from 2.38p to 1.8p. A maintained final dividend of
0.53p makes a same-again 0.8p total.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Edinburgh Fund Managers rose from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 4.78m
pre-tax for the year to January 31.
The 15 per cent improvement was achieved on the back of a near 20 per cent
rise in turnover to Pounds 9.26m.
Operating profits rose by 53 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. The rise mainly
reflected a 19 per cent increase in fund management income, with a rise in
costs of only 7 per cent. Funds under management totalled Pounds 1.9bn
(Pounds 1.4bn).
Mr Colin Ross, chairman, said the upward momentum had come from falling
interest rates rather than corporate profits which had generally been in
decline.
He added that the continuing sluggish trend in share prices led the
directors to view EFM's income prospects for the current year with a degree
of caution.
Earnings emerged at 18.6p (15.9p) and a proposed final dividend of 8p makes
a 13p (12p) total.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho's brokers consider resigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S JOINT brokers Phillips &amp; Drew Securities are considering resigning
in protest at the international trading group's lack of consultation over
its big deals.
The brokers, the main market makers in Lonrho shares, were particularly
irritated by the group's failure to notify it of its decision to sell a
third of its holding in Metropole Hotels to the Libyans.
This lack of dialogue has made it difficult for Phillips &amp; Drew to act for
Lonrho in dealing with the group's institutional shareholders, many of which
criticised the Libyan deal. The decision to contemplate resigning the
account was not taken simply because Lonrho is in trouble.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnball, Lonrho's other joint broker, is to
continue to act for the company.
Lonrho has had talks with representatives from US-based Fidelity Management
and Research, which with a 9.8 per cent stake is its second-biggest
shareholder, after FMR voiced concern that it may be forced to disinvest
from the company if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against
Libya.
Lonrho is confident that Fidelity will not sell, even if sanctions are
declared. However, although the Department of Trade and Industry has
confirmed UN sanctions would not affect businesses dealing with or investing
in Libya, Fidelity's concern stems from the US ban on Americans dealing with
Libyan institutions.
The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Control, which enforces the ban,
yesterday confirmed that it is still considering whether the Metropole hotel
chain should be included on the list of proscribed Libyan businesses.
In a separate move the DTI announced that Lonrho's proposed sale of its
Scottish and Universal Newspapers to Trinity International Holdings for
Pounds 45m would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;G trust misses targets after political
intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G, the fund management group, has raised just Pounds 129.8m for its
Recovery Investment Trust.
The group had expected to raise Pounds 300m when the trust was launched last
month, and had capacity to accept Pounds 1bn. Promotion costs, which
included extensive press advertisements and a television campaign, was about
Pounds 3m.
M&amp;G admitted the figures fell far short of expectations. It blamed this on
two political announcements which, it said, would ultimately be to the
group's benefit.
In February, the Labour party announced that, were it to win the general
election, it intended to maintain personal equity plans, which allow
investment in equities free of income or capital gains tax. Previously it
had said it would allow existing plans to continue, but prevent new plans.
Marketing for the trust had centred on the ability to put the shares into a
Pep, and the announcement of continuity dampened demand for the 1992-93 tax
year, which had previously been heightened by the risk of a Labour
government closing this opportunity.
Then, the chancellor announced in the Budget that the maximum which could be
put into a unit or investment trust Pep - more attractive to small investors
than direct equities because of their diversified risk - would rise from
Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000 a year from 1992-93. This announcement, by
lifting the ceiling on the amount that could be invested in a Pep, made a
loophole in the Pep regulations, which M&amp;G hoped to exploit, irrelevant.
Mr Roger Jennings, marketing manager of M&amp;G, said these moves could be good
news for the company in the long term, but were 'rather average news' for
the Recovery Investment Trust launch.
M&amp;G took solace from Pounds 114m which was raised on the retail side - from
direct sales and independent intermediaries - rather than from institutional
investors. The group remains convinced that the launch was timed correctly
to catch a significant rise in 'recovery' stocks.
Trading in the shares will begin on April 3.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hickson focus pays dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON International yesterday showed signs that its concentration on core
chemicals manufacturing was paying dividends despite reporting profits down
14 per cent.
After years of unfocused acquisitions, the Yorkshire-based chemicals group
produced pre-tax profits for 1991 down Pounds 4m to Pounds 23.7m on sales
down by 10 per cent at Pounds 367.4m.
Earnings per share fell to 12.64p (16.42p) after last year's Pounds 70m
rights issue and the sale of businesses. A proposed 5.15p final gives a
maintained total payment for the year of 8p.
In the latest revolving door board change, Mr Ken Schofield is stepping down
as chief executive in May, after serving only 18 months in the position. An
entrepreneur who sold his business to Hickson, he said he had completed the
task of turning round the company and had never wanted to stay longer than
necessary.
He retains a 5 per cent stake in the company and is not being replaced
directly. Mr Dennis Kerrison, who joined last year from Rhone Poulenc, is to
become chief operating officer for the group.
The group made a Pounds 2.44m exceptional charge that included an Pounds
11.7m gain on the sale of William Blythe. This was offset by a Pounds 6.56m
provision to cover a potential Pounds 5m litigation relating to the supply
of fire retardant chemicals in the US and a potential Pounds 1.1m cost for
environmental clear-up costs in the Netherlands.
Below the line, the group for the first time took a Pounds 12.7m
extraordinary charge covering goodwill previously set against reserves.
There were also Pounds 8.51m provisions against losses on the disposal of
the Merchant Distributors division.
COMMENT
This year's accounts demonstrate just how dreadfully Hickson acquired
businesses over the last eight years, only to have to sell them off at the
bottom of the cycle. This unhappy spending binge is largely, if expensively,
behind them, thanks to the efforts the new management team. Problems may
remain in the applied chemicals division, which is to be split into two. But
the company - which should be viewed as a growth stock starting from a
smaller base rather than a recovery play - is heading in the right direction
again. This year it will be helped by lower interest costs and a degree of
cyclical recovery. But pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m, giving earnings of 14p
and a prospective multiple of 13, suggests the group is fully valued.

LONDON International Group, the condoms, rubber gloves, health and beauty
products company, has repaid almost all of a Pounds 50m convertible bond
which had a put option.
Holders of Pounds 49.9m of the 4.5 per cent bonds exercised their option to
put the bonds back at a price 20.7 per cent above the principal amount,
giving them a yield of 8.5 per cent. LIG has paid Pounds 60.3m. The bonds
are in bearer form so LIG does not know who holds the outstanding Pounds
70,000.
LIG expected the bonds to be put because the shares are well below the
conversion price.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Panel freezes bid for Wilkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER Panel last night took the unusual step of freezing Petrocon's
hostile bid for fellow engineering company James Wilkes while it made
inquiries, Petrocon's advisers, Robert Fleming said last night.
The ruling means that Petrocon's Pounds 35m bid will not lapse until the
result of the inquiry and neither will Petrocon be able to receive anymore
acceptances unless it manages to receive an extension to the offer.
The Panel's move is a highly unusual finale to a bid marked by unedifying
claims from both sides about each other's inability to manage.
Petrocon and Robert Fleming, appear to have complained to the Panel that
Wilkes and NM Rothschilds, its advisers, had passed additional information
to two shareholders who had previously backed Petrocon's bid in an unusual
public letter.
Rothschilds and Wilkes have denied the charges.
One institutional shareholder, Baring Brothers, which had signed the letter
of support for Petrocon was understood to have reversed its decision and
decided to stick with the Wilkes management.
Another of the institutional signatories, Edinburgh Fund Managers, appeared
last night to remain supporting Wilkes, a decision which should allow the
Midlands-based group to maintain its independ-ence.
The Panel's ruling was made more than seven hours after the bid should have
lapsed and at least three hours after Robert Fleming should have announced
the result of the bid.
The institutions appear to have changed their views of Wilkes once Mr
Stephen Hinchliffe stepped down as chairman in February.
Mr Hinchliffe had presided over a company where head office costs had
mushroomed and included a helicopter company for the use of senior
executives, even though the company made profits of only Pounds 1.9m last
year.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Pearson profits fall to Pounds 173.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, is actively looking
for possible publishing acquisitions in Asia and the Pacific region, Lord
Blakenham, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday.
He was announcing better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 173.8m for
1991, compared with Pounds 226.3m for 1990 - a fall of 23 per cent.
In most areas of Pearson's business, organic growth was considered a more
profitable way to expand but deals for the oil services division were
possible, he said.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, promised recovery in the second
half of 1991 after profits in that year's first half fell 58 per cent to
Pounds 41m, compared with Pounds 98m in 1990. 'In the event our optimism was
justified,' said Lord Blakenham.
Turnover rose to Pounds 1.6bn compared with Pounds 1.535bn in 1990. There
was a 23 per cent fall in earnings per share from 58.5p to 45.3p, although a
final dividend of 12.5p was paid, making an unchanged total of 23.25p. The
company also announced a one-for-one scrip issue.
Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director, said the turnround at British Sky
Broadcasting, in which Pearson has a more than 16 per cent stake, had been
remarkably quick. 'I would be very surprised if BSkyB doesn't start to turn
out an overall profit in the second half of 1993,' he said.
'The result is rather better than expected,' said Mr Eric de Bellaigue,
publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, who is now looking for
Pounds 200m this year.
He described Pearson as 'a very sound business' and noted dividend cover of
1.9 times, interest cover of 9.9 times and a debt/equity ratio which fell
from 57 per cent in 1990 to 12 per cent in 1991.
Pearson increased trading profits in two of its sectors - oil services rose
15 per cent to Pounds 34.7m and books rose 7 per cent to Pounds 59.7m.
Newspapers fell 38 per cent to Pounds 29.7m.
Entertainment fell 37 per cent to Pounds 12.7m partly because of the effects
of the Gulf war; investment banking fell 32 per cent to Pounds 26.1m; and
fine china suffered a 23 per cent fall in trading profit to Pounds 17.5m.
The Pearson share price rose 8p to 794p.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Allianz awaits order on Dresdner stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN federal cartel office is poised to order Allianz, Europe's
largest insurance company, to reduce its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's
second biggest bank.
The move, which is likely to be resisted by the Munich-based insurance
group, follows an investigation by the Berlin-based authority last year. It
emerged then that Allianz had taken its stake in Dresdner to more than 22
per cent while Dresdner had itself bought a 10 per cent stake in Allianz.
With an investment portfolio worth an estimated DM400bn (Pounds 140bn),
Allianz dominates the domestic insurance market and exercises considerable
influence over German industry and finance through an extensive network of
shareholdings. The cross-holding with Dresdner grew out of an agreement in
1989 to sell each other's products.
Under German anti-trust rules, companies are obliged to report to the cartel
office stakes in other companies only when they reach 25 per cent or more.
At this level, the shareholder is deemed to exercise significant influence
over management decisions and is in a position to block acquisitions and
capital-raising exercises.
In this case, however, the cartel office has concluded that Allianz
exercises greater influence over the management of the bank through a
network of shareholdings than is suggested by the 22 per cent it owns
directly.
A report at the weekend in Der Spiegel magazine said the authorities had
decided that Allianz spoke for 47 per cent of the shares in the bank. This
was at first confirmed by a cartel office spokesman, and then denied later
in the afternoon.
Allianz issued a statement yesterday afternoon saying that its direct stake
stood at 22.3 per cent, and even if all its indirect holdings were taken
into account, the stake still fell below the 25 per cent threshold.
It said it had no direct shareholdings in three investment companies -
Frankfurter Gesellschaft fur Finanzwerte (FGF), Vermo and Frankfurter
Gesellschaft fur Chemiewerte (FGC) - which between them own 21 per cent of
Dresdner Bank.

FT  31 MAR 92 / French want new PM, poll shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of French voters wants a new prime minister and a new government.
Nearly half of them want a new president.
A Liberation poll yesterday said 60 per cent of voters surveyed want Edith
Cresson, the prime minister, to go, 61 per cent want early general elections
and 49 per cent want President Francois Mitterrand to resign.
The poll reinforced the message of popular rejection which emerged in
regional elections 10 days ago in which the ruling Socialist party suffered
humiliating losses. The party's fortunes were further battered in
departmental elections on Sunday.
Most commentators predict that Mrs Cresson is likely to be the first
casualty of a government shake-out expected in the next few days.
Further opinion polls indicate growing disenchantment with the government. A
poll in the weekly Le Point showed that three-quarters of the electorate
regard the regional election result as a condemnation of Mr Mitterrand as
well as of Mrs Cresson.
The Socialists lost control of five departments in Sunday's elections,
leaving them in control of 20 - less than half the number they ruled in
1979. The conservative domination of local government is now overwhelming,
with 75 departments.
Detailed results of Sunday's voting indicate that large numbers of potential
National Front voters swung behind the conservatives, who appear to have
stuck to their undertaking to do no deals with the extreme rightwing party.
Only one NF candidate was elected, as its share of the vote shrank to under
7 per cent, compared with almost 14 per cent in the regional elections a
week earlier.
Mr Jacques Delors, often tipped as the frontrunner to head a new French
government, wants to stay on as European Commission president, at least
until the end of his current term this December, David Buchan reports from
Brussels.
An official said Mr Delors felt it 'his first duty to stay and finish the
work already started' - ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European
political and monetary union by EC parliaments, agreement on Community
financing over the next five years and decisions on admitting new member
states into the EC.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Eurotunnel ordered to pay more: Contractors win FFr750m a
month towards disputed cost overruns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DAVID BARCHARD

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator, was ordered yesterday
to pay contractors building the project FFr750m (Pounds 77m) per month
towards disputed cost overruns, starting from the end of April.
The order, which would treble Eurotunnel's present progress payments to
contractors, was made by an independent arbitration panel, set up six months
ago to help settle the dispute over contractors' demands for FFr14bn (at
today's prices) of extra payments for design changes.
Eurotunnel said it would review the decision to see which parts it could
accept, and was preparing an appeal for arbitration at the international
chamber of commerce in Brussels.
The ruling was seen by analysts as a clear vindication of the claims by
Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of five UK and five French
construction companies building the tunnel.
Eurotunnel's share price fell by 33p to 405p in London, and by FFr3.10 to
FFr40.20 in Paris.
The increase in overall costs, from FFr48bn to more than FFr80bn since 1987,
is due to extra safety requirements, higher specifications for
greater-than-expected traffic forecasts and other design changes.
The tunnel is now due to open in autumn next year, instead of in June as
planned. Eurotunnel blames the contractors for the delay. Eurotunnel's
decision to appeal is unlikely to cause an immediate cash crisis for the
project, since TML has enough cash in hand to keep working until May or
June.
The arbitration panel said Eurotunnel must pay TML an extra FFr500m per
month for an indefinite period, on top of the FFr250m monthly payments it
now makes for work in progress and those cost overruns on which the partners
have managed to agree.
Eurotunnel noted that the panel confirmed the validity of its contract with
TML and said it would establish by the end of next month that there was no
legal basis 'arbitrarily to demand that Eurotunnel should treble its
payments'.
Claims for cost increases 'will be negotiated, valued and paid once
substantiated under the contract', Eurotunnel added.
Members of the banking syndicate which put up Pounds 6.8bn in financing for
the Eurotunnel project yesterday said it was too early to say how it would
be affected by the ruling.
Mr Colin Comery, who represents National Westminster on the syndicate, said:
'It is a very complex ruling, and it will take a long time for our technical
advisers to evaluate it'.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Aid refused for Maxwell pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has rejected private attempts by representatives of Maxwell
company pension schemes to secure compensation for funds stolen by the late
Mr Robert Maxwell.
Solicitors for the pension schemes met Mr Tony Newton, social security
secretary, and Mr John Redwood, consumer and corporate affairs minister,
recently to ask for compensation on the grounds that government-backed
bodies failed to regulate the pension funds' investment activities properly.
Imro, which regulates the fund management industry, had authorised
Bishopsgate Investment Management, a Maxwell-owned entity, to manage the
pension funds of other Maxwell-owned companies.
The funds argue the government bears some responsibility because pension
funds are specifically exempted from the Financial Services Act, which set
up the self-regulatory system, and because pensioners are excluded from the
government-sponsored Investors Compensation Scheme.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pension Action Group, said that of
the Pounds 695m originally missing from the pension funds, Pounds 237m had
been recovered by the provisional liquidator for BIM, while it was 'hoped'
that another Pounds 217m would be recoverable.
Meanwhile, solicitors for the new trustees of Mirror Group Newspapers
Pension Scheme, Travers Smith Braithwaite, have produced a report evaluating
potential targets for legal action.
MGN's pension scheme has assets of between Pounds 115m and Pounds 150m, but
needs assets of Pounds 315m to meet current projections of liabilities.
Solicitors are seeking a clause in the scheme's trust deed which would
require any purchaser of Mirror Group to make good any shortfall in assets
should the scheme be terminated.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Premature push into a financial hot seat: Robert Peston on
the appointment of a new boss at NatWest, the UK high street bank embroiled
in the Blue Arrow affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The porter working in the chairman's suite of National Westminster Bank was
phlegmatic in response to the news that Mr Tom Frost was standing down as
NatWest's chief executive.
'I've seen it all before,' he said as he operated the controls of the
comfortingly antique lift reserved for the use of the chairman, Lord
Alexander. However the porter, who took up his job in 1973, long before any
of the current board, cannot claim to have witnessed any banking banana skin
to compare with NatWest's involvement in the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights
issue of 1987.
Mr Frost has become the 11th senior executive of NatWest whose career has
taken a sharp turn for the worse as a result of the bank's involvement in
the rights issue. He is giving up the post of chief executive more than a
year earlier than planned and will be replaced by Mr Derek Wanless,
currently the bank's deputy chief executive. The reason for the change is
that the Deparment of Trade and Industry re-opened its investigation into
the Blue Arrow affair just over two weeks ago.
However, Mr Frost is not leaving the group. He has been appointed a deputy
chairman, to give him more time 'to deal with the DTI investigation', in the
words of Lord Alexander.
'We were hopeful that after four years that would be the end of Blue Arrow,'
Lord Alexander said yesterday. However, it was not to be.
During the recent Blue Arrow trial - in which two subsidiaries of NatWest
together with seven individuals and UBS Phillips and Drew, the securities
house, were accused of conspiring to mislead the market over the outcome of
the Blue Arrow issue - a number of allegations were made against Mr Frost,
who till then had escaped all criticism relating to the affair.
The central allegation was that Mr Frost had withheld important information
about his involvement in the issue from DTI inspectors during their first
investigation in 1988.
There were three other specific allegations against him:
He was accused of being involved in redrafting a memo on the Blue Arrow
issue to NatWest's board in order to tone down any implications of
malpractice by NatWest in the issue.
He was said to have dragged his feet when asked by the previous chairman,
Lord Boardman, to take advice from a new firm of solicitors on the legality
of NatWest's role in the issue.
It was also alleged that he was complicit in withholding relevant
information on the rights issue to an internal NatWest inspector who was
examining the bank's behaviour in early 1988.
The nub of these accusations is that Mr Frost was involved in a cover-up. He
says however that the court had access to only limited information. He
declares himself innocent and says he is confident of vindicating himself.
However his solicitors have advised him that he should not give details of
his rebuttals before talking to the inspectors.
Mr Frost's departure from the top job is not a response to shareholder
pressure, Lord Alexander said, even though the Blue Arrow allegations have
been widely publicised and some analysts have also criticised Mr Frost's
performance.
Lord Alexander added that he had informed the Governor of the Bank of
England of the impending change, but that the Bank had played no role in the
changes.
Mr Frost's main legal adviser is Mr Nick Wilson, a former partner of
Slaughter and May, the solicitors. Mr Wilson has discussed with the DTI
inspectors their likely requirements in this new investigation.
As a result, Mr Wilson is convinced that Mr Frost will have to spend a
considerable amount of time working with the inspectors. Mr Frost said he
therefore came to the conclusion that he could not cope with both the
inquiry and working as chief executive.
So Mr Wanless, at the age of 44, is getting his opportunity earlier than
anyone expected, though Lord Alexander confirmed yesterday that he has been
the front-runner to succeed Mr Frost for some time.
'Before it all blew up. Derek was the preferred candidate,' Lord Alexander
said.
Mr Frost is bequeathing a bank where morale has been battered not only by
Blue Arrow but also by an inexorable erosion of profits over the past three
years.
Only four years ago, in 1988, NatWest made bigger profits - Pounds 1.4bn
before tax - than any UK bank had ever done before or has since. At the
time, it was the country's biggest bank on most measures.
In 1991, however, its pre tax profits collapsed to Pounds 110m, the lowest
since 1975. In the second half of the 1991, the other three clearing banks -
Lloyds, Barclays and Midland - all made bigger profits than Natwest.
Though Mr Wanless has worked all his life at NatWest - and was a NatWest
scholar at Cambridge - he is regarded by colleagues as representing change
within the group.
For a start, he is the youngest ever NatWest chief executive. He is also a
graduate and took a first in mathematics. Till recently, most UK bank
executives joined straight from school at the age of 16.
He takes over at a time when NatWest is facing difficulties in three main
areas:
Its US operations have made big losses for the past two years, because of
their exposure to the property market in the north-eastern states.
It has failed to make a respectable return on its investment, made mainly in
the mid-80s, in securities trading and merchant banking.
It has suffered from a colossal level of losses on loans. Its charge for bad
and doubtful debts in 1991 was Pounds 1.99bn, the second highest such charge
ever made by a UK bank.
Mr Wanless's main experience to date has not been in these areas. Prior to
his appointment in February to run a new division, NatWest Markets - which
combined commercial lending and securities businesses - his most senior jobs
were as a director of personal banking services and as the general manager
for the UK branch business.
His management of services provided to individuals is generally praised by
analysts. Profits from these activities have been strong, though would
probably be bigger still if the bank had followed Lloyds bank's example by
acquiring a life insurance company several years ago, rather than waiting
till last year when it set up a joint venture with Clerical Medical.
As the UK branch general manager he was responsible for lending to small and
medium size businesses, which last year were responsible for hundreds of
millions of pounds in bad debt charges. However, when he became general
manager, in January 1989, NatWest was already the leading lender to this
sector, which has been hit hard by the recession.
He describes his management style as 'analytical' and said yesterday that he
puts his faith in training and new technology to increase the board's
control over the business.
Mr Wanless was coy about saying anything which could be seen to be a
criticism of his predecessor. If he is planning changes - and some say the
bank needs an overhaul - he may be constrained by the continuing presence
within the bank of Mr Frost.
As a deputy chairman, Mr Frost will continue to have considerable influence,
though he said yesterday that he would be careful to stand back to ensure
that Mr Wanless did not feel cramped.
Other NatWest executives said they were optimistic about the management
reorganisation, though two rivals for the top job, Mr John Tugwell and Mr
John Melbourn, may be disappointed. One executive said: 'There is a story in
the bank that at Cambridge Mr Wanless would play chess while blindfolded
against 20 opponents and still win.' Mr Wanless may find managing NatWest a
bigger challenge.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden has never been one of the world's great gambling dens. The maximum
bet allowable on the roulette wheel is a measly two kronor (about 20p).
Indeed, it sometimes seems that the only way Swedes can fritter away really
large sums of money is through the financial system where the savings banks
have spent several billion kronor on dud loans.
However, change is in the air. A taskforce has been sampling the nightlife
of northern Europe and has recommended that Sweden should be allowed to have
three or four big international casinos. Last year, Swedes frittered away
over SKr 20bn on lotteries, football pools and betting on the horses, so
clearly there is a market.

So familiar is the seemingly unchanging screen presence - lined face, silver
hair, clear voice - that it is a shock to discover that Charles Wheeler, the
veteran BBC TV reporter, reached 69 last week. He is nearly twice as old as
most of the competition, and twice as good.
He began work as a tape boy at the old Daily Sketch in 1940 before joining
the Royal Marines. After a spell in naval intelligence - during which he
developed a suspicion of George Blake, later unmasked as a Soviet spy - he
joined the BBC in 1947.
These days he is employed as a freelance for 'Newsnight', so he doesn't have
to retire. In the back-stabbing world of broadcasting, he is one of those
rare people for whom respect is universal. Speak to the top people in BBC
current affairs, or politicians like Mrs Thatcher, and the impression is
that Wheeler would be their first choice on practically any major story
anywhere in the world.
Viewers still remember his years in Washington, where he and Gerald
Priestland shared the job, not entirely amicably, but he has also been the
BBC's chief correspondent in Berlin, Europe as a whole, and Southern Asia.
There has been no shortage of offers to come in off the road. But like James
Cameron or Alistair Cooke, he has always seen himself as just a reporter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something rather unsettling about the speed with which Dudley
Eustace, British Aerospace's finance director, has found a new job while his
old employer is still searching for his replacement.
If he was not a great hit at British Aerospace, how come Philips Electronics
has made him point man for its relations with the international financial
community?
Admittedly, Philips has more than its fair share or problems, like BAe. But
Philips' workforce of 270,000 is more than twice as big as BAe's, and in
terms of turnover Philips is Europe's 13th biggest company, whereas BAe is
number 34. As an old Alcan hand, Eustace has worked in North and South
America as well as Spain, and has plenty of the right kind of international
experience. Even so it is highly unusual for a conservative multinational to
pick its top finance man from outside its own country and reward him with a
seat on the management board.
Eustace must carry some of the blame for the City's loss of confidence in
BAe. However, until the pedigree of his replacement is revealed, it is
beginning to look as if BAe has sacrificed the wrong man.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malcolm Edwards, recently deposed commercial director of British Coal, today
beats his former employer into the private sector by launching himself as
Edwards Energy.
As a consultant to suppliers and purchasers of fuel, he will offer advice on
strategy and contract negotiations, making use of 'the latest expert
knowledge of production and use of energy'.
Could that mean competing with the industry which employed him for the past
35 years? 'I wouldn't undermine British Coal's position in the market
place,' he says diplomatically.
For a man forced out of his Pounds 90,000-a-year job 12 months before his
contract expired, Edwards sounds surprisingly cheerful. 'I feel about 20
years younger having got that lot off my back.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since NatWest chairman Lord Alexander asked for the re-opening of the
DTI inquiry into the bank's role in the Blue Arrow affair, the writing has
been on the wall for poor old Tom Frost. How could he continue to fulfil the
role of group chief executive and devote sufficient time to keeping the
inspectors happy?
Nevertheless, the scale of NatWest's break with the past is breathtaking. It
has leapfrogged two generations and appointed a young man as chief executive
who was not even on the board a year ago. Derek Wanless is younger than John
Reed was when he took over the reins at Citicorp in 1984, and that
experiment in rejuvenating the top management of a big bank can hardly be
regarded a total success.
If NatWest is so desperate to find an executive untainted by the Blue Arrow
affair then Wanless is the right man. His other plus point is that he has
made his name in UK retail banking, the very area that should be NatWest's
greatest strength. He has not been long enough in the higher echelons of the
bank to be seduced by some of NatWest's more wayward dreams.
The downside is that he is undoubtedly clever and this is not always good in
a straightforward business like banking. Equally important, it is not clear
that he has the leadership qualities to rebuild morale of this once great
bank.

FT  31 MAR 92 / A check on the boss's cheque: US shareholders have won new
powers to limit executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A priest in Evansville, Indiana, a hardware store owner in Boonville,
California, and an 'irate and discouraged stockholder' from Dallas are set
to write a small but significant chapter in US corporate history.
Over the next two months these small, individual investors, along with seven
others, will become the first shareholders in the US allowed to raise
directly the controversial issue of executive pay at companies' annual
meetings.
They will do so thanks to a recent policy switch by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the government agency which oversees the securities
industry, which will have important repercussions.
The change will give investors more power to stand up to boards to ensure
executive pay is more closely aligned with corporate performance than is
often the case.
Second, it could restrain the overall levels of US executive pay, which are
far higher than those in Europe and Japan. And it could stimulate debate on
these issues in Europe - especially the UK.
Third, it will give shareholders more information on just what their board
members are being paid, and why. Finally, it will intensify a mounting US
controversy over companies' increasing reliance on share options to reward
executives.
Two factors, coalescing into a single political imperative, lie behind the
SEC's policy change. One is the ever-increasing stake in corporate America
held by large, institutional investors and the related rise over the past
decade of an influential 'corporate governance movement'. This seeks to make
boards more responsive to shareholders' wishes.
The other is sheer public outrage at the eye-popping sums of money paid to
top executives of some leading companies over the past year or two. In 1990,
for example, Mr Steve Ross, chairman of Time Warner, netted Dollars 78m
(Pounds 45m) and Mr Stephen Wolf, his counterpart at United Airlines,
received Dollars 18m.
Headline sums like these can be misleading for, as in the two cases above,
they often include the exercise of share options awarded for a manager's
work over many years. But the fact remains that executives are rewarded
handsomely. This month, Coca-Cola announced plans to give its chairman, Mr
Roberto Goizueta, shares currently worth around Dollars 80m provided he
stays with the company until 1996.
According to Mr Graef Crystal, an academic and a leading authority on
executive pay, chief executives at top American companies earned 109 times
the pay of the average US worker in the late 1980s. This compares with just
17 times in Japan and about 35 times in the UK. At a time when recession is
prompting tens of thousands of lay-offs, fat cats cause resentment.
The Democratic hopefuls in the US presidential race have been quick to spot
votes in attacks on 'boardroom greed', while Congress has also worked up a
head of steam.
Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, introduced a bill last summer
to increase shareholder power over executive pay which attracted strong
backing. The prospect of this becoming law has helped push the SEC, which
was already considering policy changes, into adopting its own package. This
bears a close resemblance to the Levin legislation, most of which looks like
being shelved.
Until now, US shareholders have been prevented from directly questioning pay
at company annual meetings. This is because the SEC, which decides what
proposals can be included on ballot papers for a vote at shareholder
meetings, always deemed this to be 'ordinary business' - in other words,
day-to-day matters best left to the discretion of directors.
But Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC's politically ambitious chairman, says that
from now on pay proposals covering top management can be included in the
'proxy' ballot material sent to investors, although these must be advisory,
rather than binding on a board.
The SEC, Mr Breeden explains, is obliged to allow significant 'policy'
issues facing a company to appear on the ballot, and he thinks the executive
pay controversy has now assumed such proportions.
The most immediate impact of his switch is on 10 companies where individual
shareholders had already filed pay proposals in the hope of getting them on
the proxy papers for the current annual meetings season, which extends until
May.
The SEC has now told the 10 they must include the proposals in their proxy
material. The companies include the Baltimore Gas and Electric company,
which is being asked to cap executives' pay at 20 times that of the average
employee; IBM, where a shareholder is demanding better disclosure of
officers' pay and justification for these sums; and telecommunications group
Bell Atlantic, where the Indiana priest wants to get a short-term incentive
plan abolished.
With the floodgates now opened, many more companies will find themselves
facing similar demands in future years.
A large proportion of these proposals is likely to come from small
investors, but heavyweight corporate governance groups and institutional
investors may also put in pay resolutions, or use the threat of them in
behind-the-scenes negotiations. The United Shareholders Association, a
Washington-based shareholder rights group, has done so already. It announced
last autumn that it would introduce pay resolutions at 10 big corporations -
including ITT and Woolworth, the stores group - in the current proxy season.
However, it dropped its threat after what it termed 'successful dialogue'
with each company.
The California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the largest
public pension fund in the country, has also been a pioneer on executive
pay. During the 1991 proxy season it submitted, but then withdrew, proposals
calling for independent board committees to handle compensation at both ITT
and conglomerate W R Grace. It also took the unusual step of voting against
re-election of the directors of ITT in protest at chairman Mr Rand Araskog's
Dollars 11m pay package.
The changes at ITT since last year's annual meeting show how effective
institutional protest can be: the company is introducing a pay scheme for
500 senior managers which ties their rewards more closely to the company's
share price performance and return on equity.
However, recent surveys of institutional investors by both the Investor
Responsibility Research Center, an independent information agency, and
Georgeson &amp; Company, which advises on proxy issues, found that most do not
want to take part in routine compensation decisions. 'Shareholder democracy
is a bad idea for compensation,' Georgeson quoted one money manager as
saying. 'No pay raises and terrible compensation attract mediocre people.'
What the institutions do want, however, is greater and clearer information
on what a company's directors are paid. The elements that make up an
executive's compensation are scattered through proxy statements and Mr
Breeden acknowledges that it sometimes 'requires a PhD in finance' to figure
out how much executives get.
The SEC wants to change this, too. Mr Breeden, while stressing that market
forces rather than government regulation should determine pay levels, says
shareholders need to be given pay information which is easier to understand.
The agency is proposing that companies be required to set out clearly in a
table the cash payments given to top executives, as well as the estimated
value of stock or stock options granted during the year.
Boards would also have to compare changes in the pay of chief executives
over recent years with the company's performance, describe the criteria they
use in incentive pay and explain the reasons for specific awards.
This would help to remove the muddle, although there would still be
controversy over stock options - an element of pay that has become
increasingly important in recent years, thanks to a 1980s fashion for
granting options to managers and to booming stock markets, which greatly
increased their value.
Stock option plans give an executive the right to buy shares in the company
at a certain price at some future date. The idea is to encourage him or her
to work hard and boost the company's share price. However, there is mounting
concern, both within the accountancy profession and among shareholder
activists, that companies do not usually have to treat grants of options as
a compensation expense, even though these will reduce the amount of earnings
available for distribution to other shareholders.
Mr Crystal estimates that 274 US companies made 1990 stock option grants
worth Dollars 3.8bn and claims that by ignoring them companies are
overstating their earnings by 2 to 3 per cent a year.
Mr Breeden has asked the SEC's chief accountant and the national Financial
Accounting Standards Board to look into the issue. No early resolution seems
likely, since the FASB has been grappling with the issue for years.
In any case, investors already have it in their power to block grants of
options, since these have always been subject to a shareholder vote. But it
is only now that most investors are waking up to the huge profits being
generated by options, and questioning whether too many managers are getting
too much for mediocre performance.
Irrespective of options accounting, the SEC's other changes mean that
shareholders should now have enough power to challenge excessive pay, and
this may encourage boards to take a fresh look at compensation policies. The
changes will also give a fillip to the corporate governance movement, which
has long campaigned for reforms. That said, the movement's leaders are
realising that proxy proposals are a fairly crude weapon.
Far better, they say, to ensure that corporate boardrooms are filled with
independent-minded directors who will put the interests of shareholders
before those of managers. That battle is only just beginning.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Labour and the trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REFORMS imposed upon Britain's recalcitrant labour market over the past
decade stand as one of Mrs Thatcher's most important achievements. The
Labour party is committed to retaining a significant part of the
Conservatives' trade union legislation. But Labour's own agenda of
'partnership' and 'fair treatment' for individuals at work calls into
question much of the wider deregulation of the Thatcher years, and could
radically change UK industrial relations.
The Conservative programme of union reform is now largely complete and has
been revived in the past few months in response to political not industrial
priorities. Judging by the government's white paper on industrial relations,
published in February, Mrs Thatcher's successors believe the UK is
approaching a near perfect labour market in which unions and collective
bargaining are marginalised.
That is wishful thinking. Britain's industrial relations are more tranquil
than they have been for decades and pay setting has become more flexible.
But easier hire and fire for employers has made only a small dent in
Britain's structural unemployment. Further, despite unemployment at more
than 2m for most of the decade and the toughest labour legislation this
century, Britain's employed 'insiders' still pay themselves too much.
Collective bargaining
Mr Michael Howard, the secretary of state for employment, points to the New
Earnings Survey figures, which suggest that collective bargaining no longer
pays.
In 1983 those covered by bargaining earned Pounds 3 a week more than those
not covered. By 1991 those covered were earning Pounds 7.50 a week less.
These figures reflect the fact that real pay for non-manual workers rose 33
per cent between 1979 and 1989, while for manual workers, who form the bulk
of those covered by collective bargaining, real pay rose only 11 per cent.
In other words Britain's pay problem is not, mainly, a collective bargaining
problem.
One aim of Labour's National Economic Assessment is to exert pressure for a
better trade-off between pay and employment. An intended reform of public
sector pay to iron out lags and spurts could also be helpful, if it were
achievable, although it is worth noting that Labour does not face an
immediate public sector pay catch-up problem. Average pay in the public
sector is now higher than in the private sector.
Review body
For the longer term Labour has hinted that it might extend the principle of
the pay review body, which now covers nearly half of all public sector
workers. If it does it must ensure that it is done in a way which offers as
much flexibility as possible for public sector managers, while discouraging
leapfrogging of the kind which caused such problems in the 1970s.
The big worry is that Labour's neo-corporatism over pay would mean a new
status for the unions. State funding for political parties, to which Labour
is committed, could eventually loosen its political ties with the unions,
but that will take time. In office, the party would need to demonstrate that
the unions' success in getting potentially damaging policies - such as the
minimum wage, a union recognition law, and repeal of some of the 1980s union
legislation - close to the top of Labour's agenda in opposition does not
mean legislation will be introduced as they demand.
Encouragingly, Labour has recognised that the legitimate aim of a left of
centre party to improve the rights of people at work can no longer be
pursued through empowering unions. Hence the commitment to a raft of
'positive' rights for individuals at work, which will bring Britain closer
to the continental model of industrial relations. The sort of rights
embodied in the European Community's Social Charter, such as a commitment to
works councils for consulting workers, equal rights for part-time workers,
and improved sex equality measures, do not have to imply a rebirth of raw
union power.
But business is right to be worried at the damage a Labour government could
do to British labour costs and flexibility. Labour would be wise to
recognise these anxieties and to be prepared to adapt policy in the light of
them.

The chaps in ITV who succumbed to the feminist demagogues in the 80s and
took Benny Hill off the air because he was 'sexist' must have felt a little
silly come the 90s and Hill's growing international esteem. He is now seen
in the US and much of Europe as one of the world's great clowns, so ITV is
quietly slipping him back on the air. The Benny Hill Show (8.30) is the
first in a new series of 'compilations from past shows' . . . well, yes,
repeats, but it is one step towards sanity, and no doubt the ratings will be
enormous.
C4's arts magazine, Without Walls (9.00), offers a promising two-part
programme. Michael Dibdin goes for Agatha Christie in the 'J'accuse' slot,
claiming that she perverted the form of the British crime novel, and in
'Reel Secrets' the qualities of horror movies are discussed by Robert McKee.
Last week the BAFTA award for best arts programme went to this series for
McKee's excellent piece on 'Citizen Kane'.
BBC1 starts a new drama series called Resnick: Lonely Hearts (10.00) which,
we are promised, is all about police detectives. Where do the broadcasters
get these astoundingly fresh ideas?

FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: A light grace and effortless intuition - Rembrandt in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great Rembrandt Circus has reached London at last, via Berlin - where we
first reviewed it on this page - and Amsterdam. With its sideshows and
diversions, it makes for a wonderful show, cumulatively as important as any
we could hope for, or are ever likely to see. Yet in its very strengths,
unless we take care, lies a threatening if but temporary weakness. For
Rembrandt scholarship is currently such a hot-bed of controversy, that the
debate on authenticity and reattribution may all too easily mask this unique
opportunity to confront the undeniable work of the master himself.
Plus c'est la meme chose, as it were, plus ca change: as in Berlin and
Amsterdam, here at the National Gallery we have the bulk of the show drawn
from those three principal holdings of Rembrandt's work, with particular
additions. And though the show consists of more or less the same things, its
feeling and emphasis are necessarily different, the ample spaciousness of
the Berlin display, for example, or the unrepeatable proximity of The Night
Watch in Amsterdam, giving way to more close and intimate a display.
Indeed, it may be argued that large as some of the works are, they are hung
here, in the new galleries of the Sainsbury Wing, in rooms more like those
they were made for than before. Certainly the group portrait of the Sampling
Officials of the Drapers' Guild seems more at home than in the draughty
spaces of the Rijksmuseum. The transition, too, from the undisputed to the
reattributed paintings, with their comparative works, is less confusing than
before.
With the Rembrandt Research Project now at the mid-point in its sceptical
trawl through the oeuvre, this joint exercise by the three museums in
setting an independent bench-mark of authenticity, was more than a good
idea: it was necessary and right. And how good it is to learn that at least
one of the demotions, the National Gallery's own Anna and the Blind Tobit -
given to Gerrit Dou, by whom it manifestly is not - is under active
reconsideration.
However, the extent to which the Project has bedevilled the whole field of
Rembrandt studies is nicely pointed by the coincidental display at the
Wallace Collection, which by statute cannot lend its works, of its 12
putative Rembrandts, all but one of which are now discounted. It is only
right that any truly gifted pupil, such as Willem Drost, should be given his
due at last, but to be given the Frick's Polish Ride is something else.
These things can go too far.
So it continues at the British Museum, where London's unique contribution to
the Rembrandt festival is to be found. Instead of the loan group of drawings
that travelled with the etchings to Berlin and Amsterdam, the prints are
shown by themselves at the National Gallery, while the Museum is showing its
entire collection of drawings by Rembrandt, some 80 in all and the largest
in the world. Alongside these are displayed drawings from his a circle,
again many of them uncertain and controversial.
The problem with the drawings is, if anything, even more contentious than
with the paintings, given the essential immediacy of the medium, the images
so often transient, perfunctory and incomplete, caught on the wing. Once
material contemporaneity is established, the question can only be resolved
by eye and intuition, qualities in which scholars are by no means certain of
distinguishing themselves. When it comes, as sometimes here, to a matter of
identifying a drawing as one by a pupil but retouched by Rembrandt, the
convolutions are infinite, every question begged.
Of a reclining lion, c1648 (no. 88), we read in the catalogue that 'the
generally cautious draughtsmanship. . . betrays the hand of a pupil. . . Yet
the broader lines. . . with a reed pen. . . are more vigorously executed and
with a superior comprehension of the forms depicted. These retouches have
been interpreted as corrections to a pupil's work by Rembrandt himself. . .'
Yet it is not beyond probability for an artist to use two sorts of pen on
the same drawing, nor for him to pull it all together at the last. Why
should not Rembrandt here be correcting himself?
Ink, which he used so much, is by its nature a committing medium, the mark
once made difficult to change or modify, let alone remove. It bespeaks
caution, at least initially, and there are very many of the uncontested
drawings of which we can say as much. And in a drawing, the artist is not on
oath. If it goes wrong, it goes wrong and hardly matters, yet too often the
instinct of the scholar is to remove it from the canon. So we read, of the
tethered lion (no. 92), that 'the surmise that Rembrandt retouched the
darker outlines. . . is not convincing: some of the least secure parts. . .
including the front paw, are executed in the darker ink.'
The miracle with Rembrandt, as with any great artist, is not so much the
success, beauty or indeed security of the particular drawing, as that it is
there at all, and we so close to his touch and presence and visible thought.
That the image that results should indeed be beautiful and convincing is
merely a miraculous bonus, a function of the artist's process and engagement
with his subject and material. That it should be carried off with so light a
grace, as Rembrandt so often does, is for us to wonder that these things can
be done at all. A sleeping girl, a self-portrait, he conjures on to the page
in a few strokes of the brush. He draws a landscape as he would write a note
to tell you the way, with effortless intuition - 'you go down the lane', he
would seem to say, 'over the bridge, on past the inn and into that wood. .

FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: The Chalk Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a bold revival, especially for this theatre. Enid Bagnold's The
Chalk Garden was written in 1956, almost at the same time as John Osborne
was writing about Jimmy Porter and the English stage was putting the old
upper middle class traditions behind it.
Ms Bagnold, as I suppose we would call her now, though she was in fact Lady
Jones, the wife of the chairman of Reuters, belonged firmly to the old
school of plot, characters, servants and masters, an element of suspense,
some symbolism, no swearing and a few witty lines of dialogue. She was
different from what came after.
Or was she? Watching The Chalk Garden I had an uneasy sense of continuity.
The play reminds you of Terence Rattigan, whom the King's Head has also had
a shot at reviving. But, in technique, it is not so far apart from Look Back
in Anger. It is the social attitudes and the language that have changed.
In the Bagnold world it was possible to talk about Aden without guilt and
without even mentioning - remember 1956 was the year of Suez - that it was a
British colony. There were miscarriages of justice by eminent judges: people
went mad, couldn't stand their mother, abandoned their children and went off
with lovers. But they referred these matters in an articulate way, sometimes
even in front of the servants.
The Chalk Garden is a bit heavy on symbolism. Essentially it is that some
plants grow on chalk and some do not. 'Whoever tried to grow rhododendrons
in a chalk garden? Soil cannot give what it has not got.' says Miss
Madrigal, the possible murderess who has served 15 years in prison for a
crime we do know if she has committed, or even wholly what it was. And so it
goes for people: they need the right environment (not incidentally a word
much used in the Bagnold vocabulary).
Maitland, the manservant, has been in prison too - for being a conscientious
objector. He and the abandoned daughter are fascinated by murders, but so
not so much the crime itself as the motivation behind it.
In the end it all ends happily enough, though not without a final lump in
the throat. The old judge who sentenced Miss Madrigal comes to lunch, the
mother returns from the Middle East to pick up her daughter who has been
loosely in Miss Madrigal's charge and Miss Madrigal decides to stay with the
grandmother determined to grow unexpected plants on chalk.
Sentimental perhaps, but dated only in the sense that it belongs to a
period. As a vehicle for acting, it is superb. Robert Austin is a marvellous
Maitland, Constance Cummings plays the eccentric grandmother in the
tradition of the best of English grandes dames and Jean Marsh is full of
fluttering feeling as Miss Madrigal.
Everyone shines and the piece is directed by Mark Rayment.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: Some Singing Blood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heidi Thomas's latest new play is a weird brew of the louche, the lapidary
and the loquacious. The situation is of the louchest: from Blackpool, a
bereaved young daughter brings her father's ashes in a biscuit-tin to
scatter them at the Zimbabwe retreat of an old Army friend, who proves to
have been his lover in Korea - and whom she then decides to marry. (Little
crunches are to punctuate the evening as the cinders get trodden underfoot.)
Her mother arrives from her dress-shop in tepid pursuit, with a crisp
wedding-gown and a limp uncle in tow.
Mostly they deliver themselves in archly compacted phrases. Describing her
(transvestite) father's terminal decline, Alison remarks: 'Empathy became a
habit to us'. Later, her unlikely fiance tells her 'You have laid waste the
map'; and widowed Iris declares that 'Disasters run piggyback through my
life'. But often the laconic sentences come in long paragraphs: sooner or
later even the most tight-lipped characters - Anton Rodgers' impeccably
curdled old lover, Gary McDonald's gentle, sullen Man Friday-figure - get
their arias and duets, visionary, reminiscent and/or confessional.
As with Christopher Fry and Joe Orton, the verbal high-wire exercises are
very nearly the substance of this piece. Indeed, a side revelation of Ms
Thomas's play is how much Fry's manners and Orton's have in common. Julia
Ford's Alison, frail and plucky, speaks like a younger sister to the Fry
lady who was not for burning; yet when Prunella Scales' Iris arrives with
the comic relief (absurd stiletto heels in the bush), we slip into Orton
territory without any gear-change in the diction.
Everybody is wryly, articulately self-aware. That has its drawbacks. For one
thing Iris, who irresistibly dominates the play, has to invite regular
laughs at her sub-middle-class gentility, but is so sharp and knowing that
we cannot credit her fussy pretensions (though Miss Scales straddles her
split character with delicious aplomb, and Christopher Ettridge's Uncle
Dermot makes an amiable foil).
For another, the trajectory of the story prescribes a hard, gory end, and
the hyperconscious language is not up to sustaining that. The operatic final
turns reveal secrets disappointingly less lurid than the original situation,
and they cut no believable dramatic ice.
Jules Wright has directed the whole affair with close sympathy, and if the
play has precious little to do with real-life Africa, Fotini Dimou has still
devised a fine, weather-beaten bush-cottage to set it in. Next time Ms
Thomas must find herself a less exacerbated, inflammatory story, one where
her artful language can stand up to carrying the dramatic crises.

FT  31 MAR 92 / MPs oppose closure of Department of Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to close the Department of Energy were condemned yesterday
amid warnings that the move would stifle public debate in the formulation of
UK energy policy.
The Commons energy committee rejected Conservative party claims that
privatisation of gas and electricity had made the department redundant. The
all-party committee argued in a report that may be its swan-song that it
should survive even if the department was closed.
The committee's plea was directed at the Conservatives because Labour has no
plans to close the department.
The MPs noted that the regulators appointed to monitor the privatised gas
and electricity industries were answerable to parliament. But that would be
'little more than a constitutional fiction' if they were not interrogated
regularly by the committee, the MPs added.
The committee said it had made useful recommendations in the past. It had
corrected the government's tendency to plan large new power stations rather
than considering alternatives such as controlling demand through energy
efficiency.
The government had often made mistakes by acting against committee
recommendations, the MPs said.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Court move by Fayed brothers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAYED brothers yesterday renewed their attempt to block disciplinary
proceedings launched against them by the City Takeover Panel. The
proceedings followed publication of a government report on their acquisition
of the House of Fraser stores group in 1985.
They asked the Court of Appeal to allow them to seek a judicial review of
the panel's refusal in December to adjourn the proceedings, at which the
central issue will be statements made by the brothers about the source of
funds used for the acquisition.
A similar application was refused by the High Court in January. Mr David
Oliver, QC for the Fayeds, said the disciplinary proceedings should be
deferred until after a pending High Court action against the brothers by
Lonrho, the conglomerate headed by Mr Tiny Rowland, which lost the battle
for House of Fraser.
The case continues today.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO, the supermarket chain, said yesterday that it was contracting out
security operations at its seven distribution depots even though its 86
staff involved had offered to take pay cuts. Sata, the white-collar section
of the Usdaw shopworkers' union, said the staff were willing to accept about
4 per cent less than the Pounds 4.86 an hour agreed last month.
Mr Frank Murphy, national officer of Sata, said the offer had been a
desperate attempt by the security staff, mostly ex-servicemen or
ex-policemen, to keep their jobs.
Mr Murphy said that Tesco was making contracts with a company advertising
for staff to work between 48 and 60 hours a week for Pounds 3.23 an hour.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Gallery has acquired Holbein's portrait, Lady with a Pet
Squirrel and a Starling, for Pounds 10m. The deal with the owner, the
Marquess of Cholmondeley, is expected to be confirmed today, Antony
Thorncroft writes.
Christie's had estimated its auction value at Pounds 15m but on that sum
Lord Cholmondeley would have had to pay a substantial tax bill. The Pounds
10m deal means, however, that the gallery has pledged almost all of its
purchase grant from the government for the next three years.
The painting was due to be sold at Christie's on April 15, but the
likelihood that it would be bought by a foreign buyer and leave the country
created a campaign, led by the gallery, to organise the private treaty sale
with the marquess.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Sluggish growth in bank lending confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDING by banks and building societies continues to grow at a sluggish
pace, according to figures released yesterday by the Bank of England and the
British Bankers' Association.
The Bank's final monetary statistics for February showed that bank and
building society lending increased by only Pounds 284m on a seasonally
adjusted basis last month, compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 400m
growth and actual average growth of Pounds 2.4bn over the previous six
months.
In its latest quarterly analysis of sterling lending by the main UK banking
groups, the association said seasonally adjusted lending grew by Pounds
2.06bn in the three months to February against Pounds 1.9bn in the previous
three months. That represented an annualised growth rate of 4 per cent.
The association's breakdown of lending, which is not seasonally adjusted,
showed that Pounds 1.14bn, or just over half the increase in lending in the
latest quarter, was to the financial sector. Lending to individuals grew by
Pounds 952m and accounted for much of the other growth in lending.
Lending for house purchase grew by Pounds 1.05bn in the latest quarter
compared with Pounds 1.48bn in the previous three months, reflecting
seasonal factors and the depressed state of the housing market. The
association said there was a small Pounds 102m net repayment of lending for
consumption.
The association said the strong growth in lending to financial companies may
have reflected the need of securities houses to finance increased activity
on the market for UK government gilt-edged stock, as well as increased
leasing activity.
Manufacturers and construction companies repaid bank lending for the fourth
successive quarter. The repayments of Pounds 365m and Pounds 113m
respectively suggested that those companies were still using the proceeds of
rights issues to repay bank debt.
Last year was the worst in living memory in the business lending and leasing
markets, Mr Brian Hassell, chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association,
said yesterday.
Demand fell and lenders to most business sectors suffered a sharp increase
in the amount of bad debt. Small businesses were particularly badly
affected.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Gold will be used to pay some MAI staff: Scheme at
subsidiary avoids National Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services group, said yesterday that its board, which
includes Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, and Sir Graham Day, chairman of
British Aerospace, had sanctioned payments to some employees in gold bullion
to avoid National Insurance contributions.
The admission is politically embarrassing for Lord Hollick, MAI's managing
director. He has been the most prominent member of the business community to
support the Labour party's election campaign.
Last week he arranged a meeting between Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,
and a group of Labour-supporting business executives. He has been tipped for
ministerial office if Labour wins the election. MAI yesterday denied press
allegations that Lord Hollick or other senior executives at the company had
benefited from the scheme. It said press articles to that effect had been
politically motivated, involving wilful and malicious disregard for the
facts.
However, the company admitted that about 300 staff at Harlow Butler Ueda,
MAI's money and securities broking subsidiary, would receive bonuses in the
form of bullion paid in Jersey. It insisted that such schemes were widely
used, entirely legal and perfectly proper.
Remuneration in gold is not subject to National Insurance. The payments need
to be made in locations outside the EC such as Jersey to avoid paying value
added tax on the gold. An advantage of such schemes is that employees can
defer tax for up to 18 months if payment is timed for the end of the tax
year.
The bullion scheme has only recently been set up. A similar scheme,
involving the payment of bonuses through unit trusts, was abandoned when the
Inland Revenue closed a loop-hole last October. MAI said its board had
authorised the bullion payments.
MAI said it and Harlow Butler Ueda would issue writs today against the
editor of The Mail on Sunday, a journalist at the paper and Assoc-iated
Newspapers, its owner. The Harlow Butler Ueda writ will deal with
allegations concerning local authority swap deals.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Rival to BT wins national licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL NETWORK, a private UK telecommunications operator based in Marlow,
Buckinghamshire, is to receive a full domestic telecommunications licence
from the Department of Trade and Industry, putting it in direct competition
with BT and Mercury.
It is the first important implementation of the government's policy of
liberating the domestic market further.
National, which already provides a telephone service over the Post Office's
internal network, expects to take about 4 per cent of the UK market by the
end of 1996.
The company plans to invest about Pounds 150m in the next few years to build
up its own fibre-optic network, the first phase of which may be completed by
the end of 1994.
National uses the Post Office network, the UK's biggest private network, to
connect callers to about 40 countries at rates that are up to 30 per cent
below BT's and 15 per cent below Mercury's.
Its services have however been restricted to large companies with
substantial telecoms traffic. That is because the lack of a full domestic
licence has meant that customers have had to be connected to its network by
private lines installed by BT.
The domestic operator licence will enable National to extend its service to
smaller customers by reducing the cost of signing up for its services and
making them more quickly available.
Mr Michael Davis, National's chairman and majority shareholder said: 'The
government (has) put National Network on an equal footing with BT and
Mercury domestically.'
National has yet to obtain a full international licence. It offers services
to North America and Japan but not to the Continent, for example.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Pension plan trustees scheme found wanting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 3 per cent of pension schemes have appointed an independent trustee and
only 7 per cent have disclosed the appointment of an independent custodian
of assets, according to a survey of pensions schemes published yesterday.
Forty per cent of schemes have only directors and senior employees as
trustees, and only 16 per cent explicitly state that no self-investment of
assets in the company's own shares takes place. The analysis covered 134
pension schemes with 2.8m members and was conducted by Clark Whitehill, the
accountancy firm.
It shows that 93 per cent of pension funds do not disclose whether
investments are registered in the name of outside nominees in spite of a
recommendation from the Commons pensions committee that they should do so.
Almost 25 per cent do not distribute either full or summary accounts to
members unless requested to do so.
Mr Zahir Fazal, a partner with Clark Whitehill, said: 'All the evidence
tends to suggest that the use of independent custodians is fairly limited.'
No scheme disclosed the fees paid to professional advisers such as actuaries
and auditors, or whether those advisers also served the employer. None
disclosed the quorum for meetings of trustees or the majority required to
reach decisions.
Clark Whitehill calls for the appointment of independent trustees, clearer
and more informative pension accounts and greater disclosure.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Dock work reform 'is step back'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOLITION of the National Dock Labour Scheme has in some respects taken the
industry back to an operational and employment structure similar to that of
the 1950s and 1960s, according to an analysis by Cardiff Business School,
Michael Smith writes.
It finds this has happened through a proliferation of small 'labour-only'
stevedoring companies in a more competitive environment. 'There has been
reappearance of practices that during the 1960s were perceived to be
detrimental to industrial peace', it says.
The Dock Labour Scheme, which was set up in 1967 to end the use of casual
labour, was abolished in 1989. It reserved certain types of work for
registered dock workers who were in effect guaranteed jobs for life.
According to the report, 34 per cent of former scheme ports now employ
temporary workers.
Disputes over redundancies and working practices abound, the report says.
'Deregulation and more intense competition in the industry have therefore
generated greater instability and in many respects made it more difficult
for management to cultivate employee loyalty and commitment, other than
through the fear of losing traffic and consequently jobs.'

FT  31 MAR 92 / BSkyB and BBC seek joint football rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SKY Broadcasting and the BBC are to try to acquire jointly the
television rights to cover the games of the new football Premier League
being formed out of the old first division.
Negotiations are expected to get under way in the next couple of weeks.
The attempt to try to get access to the new league follows the success of
BSkyB's exclusive coverage of the World Cup cricket in Australia in boosting
sales of dishes.
Under the arrangement, the BBC would at least get the rights to recorded
highlights of the Premier League games, and also possibly some live
coverage.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC Television, is determined that
football should stay with the BBC. In a three-way auction for live games
between ITV, which has the rights to current league games, and BSkyB, it is
unlikely that the BBC would be able bid highest.
BSkyB, the satellite television network in which Pearson, publisher of the
Financial Times, has a stake, already has a shared coverage arrangement with
the BBC over FA Cup games. That was inherited from British Satellite
Broadcasting when it merged with Sky.
Under the deal the BBC has live coverage rights from the semi-finals
onwards.
Negotiations might be further complicated by the arrival of Full Time
Communications, a new company offering Pounds 50m a year for 10 years for
football rights. The company wants to launch a 24-hour satellite football
channel covering all the English games.

FT  31 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y's Riverbus Company to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPANY running the riverbus service that travels along the Thames in
London said yesterday it was pushing ahead with expansion plans in spite of
the financial difficulties surrounding its owners, the property developers
Olympia &amp; York.
Mr William Edgerley, managing director of Riverbus Company, said the
business been in discussions with O&amp;Y over the past week and had been
'reassured' about its future.
Riverbus refused to specify the nature of this reassurance or the details of
the partnership agreement between O&amp;Y, the developer of Canary Wharf in
London's Docklands, and the property division of P&amp;O, the developer of
Chelsea Harbour. P&amp;O manages Riverbus, but has no liabilities.
Riverbus said it was taking delivery over the next two months of two
62-seater catamarans, and planned to extend its services at weekends by mid
April. The two catamarans will increase its fleet to nine, plus two private
executive launches managed on behalf of O&amp;Y.
The riverbus service was started in the mid 1980s by Thames Line as an
environmentally friendly service, but ran into financial difficulties when
demand, particularly by City employees, failed to meet expectations.
It was briefly taken over by a consortium of five property developers, which
was then reduced to a partnership involving O&amp;Y and P&amp;O.
The service has made continuing losses over the past two years after a
capital injection of Pounds 2.5m by members of the consortium and a
government grant of Pounds 500,000.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Machine tool output lowest since 1984
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION of machine tools in the UK fell 22 per cent last year to about
Pounds 730m - the lowest in real terms since 1984 - confirming the
difficulties caused by the recession.
The figure is the latest estimate from the Machine Tool Technologies
Association, and is based on data for the first three quarters of last year.
The association said a 16 per cent decline in exports last year, to Pounds
411.1m, was clearly 'a matter of concern', although it should be viewed
against the background of a 10.5 per cent fall in world exports of machine
tools.
For the first time last year, the European Community accounted for more than
half of all UK exports, with Germany dislodging the US as the largest single
market.
Imports fell by 13.7 per cent to Pounds 451.2m, with Germany and Japan
accounting for more than half the total.
Although the trade deficit increased slightly to Pounds 40m, there was a
small surplus on trade with other EC nations.
Combining production and trade figures, the UK market for machine tools is
estimated at Pounds 770m, down 21 per cent from Pounds 975m in 1990. For
technical reasons, the association warns, last year's figure probably
over-estimates the true level of demand.
The figures show that the UK has retained its position as the world's
seventh-largest producer of machine tools.

<TEXT>
INSURANCE brokers yes-terday placed risks electronically with underwriters
at both Lloyd's of London and London market companies for the first time as
the Electronic Placing Support system (EPS) came on stream.
Combined with the existing electronic claims payment, accounting and
reinsurance systems developed over the past few years, the system is
expected to improve efficiency.
Mr Steve Abrahams, underwriting manager of Sun Alliance International, who
insured one of the first pieces to be offered electronically yesterday,
said: 'It will cut out a lot of administrative work and is a major step
forward. Sending risks down the line is going to cut out a lot of leg work.'
Mr Chris Trickett, managing director of Sedgwick Professional Indemnity,
which placed the risk with Sun Alliance, emphasised that the real cost
benefits would be reaped 'in the future' when all information is captured
electronically, reducing the need for 're-keying' of information.
Mr Max Taylor, chairman of London Network Management Committee, which has
arranged co-operation between Lloyd's and the associations representing
London market companies, said: 'We think this is enormously important and
significant.' Both underwriters and brokers stress however that electronic
placement will not end the need for face-to-face negotiation of more complex
and larger risks.
Mr Taylor said that 'the successful implementation of EPS will depend on
'(combining) the best of traditional practices with the benefits that modern
technology can offer'.
Mr Taylor's company, Willis Corroon, is one of four brokers that began
placing risks electronically yesterday.
CE Heath, Minet and Sedgwick are the others. CT Bowring, Alexander Howden
and Greig Fester will join this month and nine other brokers will join later
this year.
Immediate participation in the system among insurers is much wider. At
Lloyd's, more than 100 of the market's 278 syndicates representing more than
four fifths of the market's capacity are taking part and more that 100
insurance and reinsurance companies are also involved.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Structural flaws put cracks in the surveying business: David
Barchard and Neil Buckley find smaller companies are struggling for survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRACKS are appearing in a profession better known for detecting structural
flaws for its clients. Surveying and valuation, the business that lives off
the housing market, is threatening to split apart as the recession depresses
property demand.
With the British housing market going through what is generally held to be
its worst depression this century, many small surveyors and valuers feel
they are in a desperate battle for survival against the larger firms. One
Scottish surveyor and valuer says: 'When I set up on my own, I didn't
realise that, unlike the big surveyor firms, it would be practically
impossible for me to get on the lenders' panels. And unless you are on the
panel, you can really forget about doing much residential business.' Similar
complaints from smaller surveyors have already prodded the Office of Fair
Trading into making a preliminary inquiry, although an official at the OFT
says privately that there have been few, if any, complaints from the public.
The main grouse of smaller surveyors is that mortgage lenders, meaning
mostly the high street building societies, deliberately restrict access to
their panels.
'It seems to be very hard to get on to these panels,' the same Scottish
surveyor says. 'And of course you lose face if you have to tell your
customer that some banks and most large building societies will not accept
you.' Larger surveyors and valuers seem generally to be included on the
panels of most large UK mortgage lenders. Yet, is size what determines
eligibility for joining a panel? There is a widespread suspicion that the
large lenders want only surveyors who can put mortgage business their way.
One small surveyor says: 'They (the building societies) say 'You must be on
our panel', so you say to them 'Fine, how do I get on to your panel?' and
they say 'We expect reciprocal business'.'
Mr Paul Wisbey of Wisbey Associates at Ware, Hertfordshire, says: 'Quite
honestly, it will not be very long before there are few sole traders left in
surveying because, if you are not on the panel and cannot get the valuation
as a result, then the instructions walk away from you.'
Providing reciprocal business is supposed not to be a precondition for
membership of a panel, although some large surveyors say that passing on
mortgage business is quite natural once a firm gets on to a panel.
Building Societies are in theory subject to instructions issued by the
Building Societies Association in 1979 telling them that reciprocal business
should not be a 'driving condition' for selecting a valuer for a panel.
Halifax and Abbey National deny that they make finding mortgages a
prerequisite of accepting a surveyor on to a panel. Surveyors claim the
practice may be imposed by individual managers rather than laid down by head
office.
Either way, building societies seem committed to operating through panels of
surveyors. Abbey National says: 'There are considerable advantages to
confining our surveys to surveyors that we know, and who understand our
training and reporting methods. With a known panel of surveyors, we can
ensure that we get high quality.'
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's chief surveyor agrees. Many large lenders go a
step further and try to handle surveys and valuations themselves where they
can, and some say they are already doing more than half their business that
way.
Another reason widely given by lenders for not working with small surveyors
is that in the past some small surveyors have colluded with solicitors in
mortgage fraud.
House buyers who chose their own surveyor may end up paying substantially
more, because they are instructed by a building society to use another firm
for the valuation.
The buyer may also be at risk from conflicts of interest. With estate
agencies in many cases owned by lenders, different arms of the same
organisation may find themselves acting for the vendor and offering the
buyer a surveyor. To avoid that, the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors is considering a scheme under which purchasers would receive a
letter warning of the possible conflict. The buyer would then give consent
for the work to go ahead.
That solution is criticised by the small firms outside the panels. They
claim that the rules over conflict of interest cannot be changed without
consumers suffering. 'The purchaser is not going to get genuinely
independent advice,' says one surveyor. 'He will be caught up in a cartel.'
Mr Robin Shipton, of Associated Surveyors of Swindon, Wilts, sums up the
views of smaller surveyors. 'The business is being concentrated in the hands
of fewer and fewer players. But it is very hard to see how it can be
stopped.'

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: First-time voters could make lasting
impression - Almost 3m young people will take part in their first election
on April 9. Catherine Milton explains why their votes could prove decisive
</HEADLINE>

MIKE HOOPER, 20, plans to ignore his first opportunity to vote. No candidate
in marginal Exeter deserves his support, he says. 'Anyone who thinks they
should run the country is not exactly the person you want running the
country.'
He is single, lives with his parents and has been unemployed for most of the
last four years, though he is prepared to move. He does not know which way
his parents vote. 'We don't talk about it.'
Mike is in many ways a typical first-time voter (FTV); he is single,
unemployed and mobile, and is one of a substantial minority who will not
vote - 65 per cent of FTVs voted in 1987, as opposed to 85 per cent of all
people of working age.
There are almost 3m FTVs, about 7 per cent of the electorate, and
politicians regularly do embarrassing things in the quest for their votes.
John Major recorded a nine-minute cassette which splices politics with pop
and sent it to 150,000 young people who turned 18 last year. Neil Kinnock
rocked around on a 1984 video by singer Tracey Ullman.
Politicians go to such lengths for two reasons. First, the way people vote
in their first few elections is often the way they vote for the rest of
their lives. Second, the low average turn-out of FTVs means that successful
appeals could have a marked effect.
Historically FTVs, and young voters generally, favour the Labour party.
Daniel Cray, 19, studying for A-levels at Exeter College, intends to vote
Labour. 'I come from a Labour background and I am left-wing. I want to get
the Tories out.'
His voting intentions fit a pattern confirmed by Dr Andy Brown, a visiting
fellow at Harvard university, in his thesis Patterns of First-Time Voting in
Great Britain, to be published later this year.
Dr Brown says all FTVs are influenced by their parents, but that influence
is most enduring on children of Labour parents. It is a significant reason
for Labour's advantage among young voters.
'You are only talking about a small number of voters compared with the
population as a whole,' he says. 'But that small number can also sway an
election result - especially if the election is tight. Given the relative
advantage that they give to Labour, it could prove very important.'
In 1983 FTV support for Labour fell to 33 per cent from 40 per cent in 1979,
while the Tories attracted 44 per cent. Labour climbed back to 39 per cent
in 1987, one point ahead of the Tories.
At this election, opposition parties may benefit from increased disaffection
among young voters because of a recent rapid rise in unemployment,
particularly among young men.
Among 18-to-24-year-olds, Labour enjoyed a lead of 10 percentage points in
1991 - 46 per cent to 36 per cent - according to Mori, the polling
organisation. But this natural advantage disappears when voters reach their
mid 20s
The political centre has suffered since the mid 1970s, when the then Liberal
party had a high-profile youth organisation. In 1974, 27 per cent of FTVs
supported the Liberals, against 42 per cent for Labour and 24 per cent for
the Conservatives. The Tories have been the main gainers from the slump to
10 per cent in Liberal Democrat support last year.
The political volatility of the small group makes it an important target for
all parties. Just under two-fifths of FTVs switched parties during the last
campaign. In Exeter, a three-way marginal, the views of even 100 young
people could be a factor.
Tom Nestor Smith, 21, a politics student at Exeter university, is trying to
get the manifestos to help him make decide: 'I have been affected by the
enterprise philosophy. If you are better at your job than someone else then
you deserve to be paid more.'
Tom, who describes his background as farming gentry, will not be voting
Labour: 'Kinnock is very unappealing. His appearance in that Tracey Ullman
video was just sad. Paddy Ashdown has a lot of charisma, and the Tories
don't do enough to help those who can't help themselves,' he said.
Mori's figures for February show that young people are six percentage points
more concerned about pollution and the environment than the people generally
(11 per cent against 7 per cent) and seven points more concerned about the
poll tax (16 per cent against 9 per cent).
On other issues - education, nuclear weapons, inflation and Europe - young
people's views are broadly similar to those of most people.
However, in 1987 nearly two-fifths of FTVs felt that the outcome of the
election was irrelevant, compared with some 22 per cent of the working-age
population.
Nicky Tuckett, 18, an Exeter shop assistant, may vote if she feels like it,
but does not believe any party does enough for young people. In common with
thousands of others, she has few specific demands - apart, that is, from
youth clubs.
'They say it's always kids who do car crime. What do they expect? There's
nowhere else for them to go.' She wants a clear manifesto commitment to the
provision of more youth clubs.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An opinion poll published last night suggests that Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, is set to lose his seat in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, to the
Scottish National party. He had a majority of about 3,500 in 1987, James
Buxton writes.
The poll, taken by System Three for Scottish Television and the Glasgow
Herald, puts the SNP on 40 per cent, a rise of 8.5 points compared with the
general election; the Conservatives on 33 per cent (down 7.4); Labour on 18
(up 6.1) and the Liberal Democrats on 9 (down 5.6).
The poll in the rural constituency in southwest Scotland was taken between
March 27 and 29, with a sample of 1,045 people.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: SNP at sharp end in battle for steel - Bethan
Hutton on nationalist hopes in Motherwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Scottish National Party is to have any chance of winning independence
for Scotland it has to make inroads into Labour's vote in the industrial
heartlands around Glasgow. That means winning seats like Motherwell South.
The SNP stands at about 27 per cent in the Scottish opinion polls, almost
double the 14 per cent of the vote it won in 1987. This indicates that it is
likely to win a few rural seats from the Tories and the Liberal Democrats,
but there has been little sign of its support increasing further.
It needs to win nearly 40 per cent to take more than a couple of seats from
Labour - standing at about 42 per cent in the polls - and win half the 72
Scottish seats, which it says would give it a mandate to negotiate
independence.
Motherwell South is one of the seats the nationalists are pinning particular
hopes on. It is dominated by British Steel's massive Ravenscraig steelworks
and Dalzell plate mill. The SNP has for years made the fate of the Scottish
steel industry one of its biggest issues. Its task is to persuade
traditional Labour voters in Motherwell that it can save the Scottish steel
industry.
'We're all converts here,' said Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate, waving
her arm to indicate the party workers crammed into two smoke-filled rooms
above a greengrocers, which act as the party's campaign headquarters.
The conversion has been of Labour supporters to the SNP. With all the usual
converts' zeal they are attempting to persuade the people of Motherwell to
break a 47-year tradition of returning a Labour MP.
Mrs Ullrich is a more established believer than most of her campaign staff -
she joined the SNP in 1965. For many years the SNP's fight for independence
seemed hopeless. Now she sees herself returning from the wilderness as the
prospect of home rule for Scotland seems closer than ever.
Mrs Ullrich claims that canvassing returns give her good reason to be
confident. But she has to overturn a majority of almost 17,000 to unseat Mr
Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for the constituency since 1974 and only the third MP
for Motherwell South in 47 years.
The SNP has achieved that kind of turn-around before, in the 1988 Glasgow
Govan by-election when Mr Jim Sillars, another convert from Labour, turned a
Labour majority of almost 20,000 into an SNP majority of 3,500. But that was
a well-publicised one-off chance for the electorate to startle Labour out of
its complacent position as the top party in Scotland.
Can it really be repeated all over the country on April 9? After all, in
another three by-elections in 1989 and 1990, Labour kept the SNP safely in
second place.
Mr Bray has never needed to campaign seriously in Motherwell before. He is
an Englishman, an academic who acts as his party's spokesman on science and
technology. He has long experience of industry - he took Motherwell South
after losing his seat in another steel-producing area on Teesside. But his
English origins may count against him now that nationalism has captured the
imagination of many voters.
The SNP feels it has got its teeth into Mr Bray on the issue of steel - they
say he has betrayed his constituents by giving up the fight to save
Ravenscraig.
One convert paraded on an SNP platform this week was Mr Alan Raby, convener
of the shop stewards at Dalzell, whose closure may not come for several
years. There has been a split between the Labour-led unions at Ravenscraig,
which are resigned to its closure, and the Dalzell union leaders, who have
switched allegiance to the SNP and are still fighting for a future.
The SNP has promised to nationalise the Scottish assets of British Steel,
keep Ravenscraig going and expand its capacity. It argues that Scotland
should compete to supply the North Sea oil industry, which it says is the
biggest European market for steel.
But the question remains of whether Ravenscraig could compete successfully,
unsubsidised, with new plants planned by British Steel.
On the streets the recurring theme is: 'It's too late for Ravenscraig now.'
The people of Motherwell have seen the decline of steel over the years, as
the unions and politicians fought a losing battle. Few are convinced that
the SNP can deliver its promises.
Mr Jim Law, a former steelworker who has been unemployed for eight years, is
just the kind of person the SNP needs to convince. He has always voted
Labour. Although he supports independence, he will be voting Labour again
this time. 'The only reason I am not voting SNP is there is no chance of
getting them in,' he says.
There is still a large credibility gap to bridge.
The SNP also has to battle against voter apathy instilled in people who have
consistently voted for one party but been governed by another.
The Scotsman newspaper still tips Motherwell South as a safe Labour seat.
Mrs Ullrich says she knows independence will happen, but Mr Bray says he
isn't losing any sleep over it yet.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hi-tech replaces rap of the knocker - David
Butler looks at the big changes taking place in constituency campaigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a new kind of election. I have been writing about campaigns for 40
years.
None of the phenomena now manifest is original. Every bit of technology and
strategy deployed in the past two weeks was in existence five years ago.
What is new is the comprehensiveness of its general adoption. A difference
in degree can be a difference in kind.
In March 1992, as in every previous campaign, there are two different
elections in progress - one at the centre, one in the constituencies. They
hardly meet.
The leaders may flit out to the marginals for their publicised visits, and
the marginals - and the safe seats - may report daily, via their regional
offices, to Smith Square and Walworth Road.
But the plodding activity in the constituencies, canvassing, delivering
addresses, organising registers and preparing poll-cards, bears little
relation to the frenetic agitation in party headquarters and in the
broadcasting studios.
In local offices the manifestos lie unread and the telecasts stay unwatched.
The nineteenth century routine of getting a full marked-up register for use
on polling day continues - but with a difference. What is new this year is
not that it didn't happen anywhere in 1987 but that it happens almost
everywhere in 1992.
There are four big areas of innovation:
Virtually every party in with a chance in any marginal has a sophisticated
computer system. It has programmes that address envelopes, prepare direct,
targeted mail, organise canvass cards, and annotate the electoral register
with details from past years and with information about ethnicity,
occupation, and response to financial appeals or questionnaires.
Almost every marginal has acquired a fax machine in the past two years. Many
candidates have mobile faxes and portable phones in their cars. The party
headquarters, national and regional, deluge the contestants with press
releases and daily campaign notes, seeking (usually in vain) a nationwide,
co-ordinated response to any new development. The facilities of Telecom
Gold, BT's computer network service, are being fully employed.
Agents and candidates have been schooled, to an altogether new degree, to
co-ordinate their operations to the needs of the media, local and regional,
to give absolute priority to their requirements and deadlines.
The number of party workers willing to go out on the door knocker has fallen
in all parties, but 85 per cent of electors are on the telephone. The cost
of local calls is greater than the election expense permitted for each
voter. But volunteers often choose to canvass by telephone, even though, if
co-ordinated, it falls under the law that limits expenses. Certainly this is
being conducted on a new scale and no one seems to worry too much about the
formal provisions of the Representation of the People Act.
In theory these developments could transform constituency electioneering. In
practice they may amount to very little. Some candidates, even some area
agents, are sceptical or mutinous.
In the end most people go to the polling booths under the stimulus of the
national campaign. The margin for even the most effective use of the new
technology is small, manpower is short and skilled manpower is shorter.
Constituency campaigning is very different this year but its impact may be
just as small as in previous years. The same may not be quite so true at the
centre. It was only in 1987 that Peter Mandelson dragged the Labour party
reluctantly into the new, Americanised world that had been developing over
the past 20 years.
The planning of photo-opportunities, the exact timing of press conferences
with their well-honed sound-bites, the elaborate attempts to manage the
news, to cap the other side's headline offerings, the orchestration of
meetings and walkabouts, all have their precedents in the 1960s and even
earlier.
But the scale and thoroughness with which they are pursued today makes even
1987 seem antediluvian.
But are the innovations effective? Let us not be bemused by the health
service fracas. The main impact of the ever more sophisticated campaign
strategies may be alienating and counter-productive.
In the fetid atmosphere of headquarters, professional partisans talking all
day to other professional partisans can lose their perspective.
Their principal outside contact is with journalists who seem to be becoming
ever more resentful at the expert attempts to feed them and to fool them.
The successive headlines pass over the heads of a bored and sceptical
electorate.
Currently the coverage of the campaign on the air and in the quality press
has attained an altogether new standard of thoroughness and excellence. But
editors have to remember that elections are, for a minority, a spectator
sport.
The enthusiastic watchers are taught, with increasing subtlety, to
appreciate the mores in the game and to watch the pollsters' scoreboard,
with its indirect assessment of the success of the players. But does it help
the voters to a rational choice?
There never was a golden age when elections were feasts of reason. This is,
God help us, by far the most sophisticated campaign we have seen. But it
seems no nearer than its predecessors to offering an ideal way of selecting
the best politics and the best people to rule us.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Persuading parties to give up seats to women
 -Radical changes would be needed to avoid male bias in proposed assemblies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN TORY MP Mrs Teresa Gorman recently put forward a plan to stop the
'mother of parliaments' being composed overwhelmingly of fathers, she was
met with derision.
Her private member's bill, introduced in January, would have created new,
bigger constituencies, each with one male MP and one female MP. But Mrs
Gorman's fellow Conservative, Mr Patrick Cormack, said he had never heard 'a
more silly proposition' in more than 20 years in the House. Colleagues
around him indicated their agreement.
Those plans for sex equality at Westminster were still-born, although Labour
has pledged that its proposed Scottish parliament and Greater London
Authority would have equal numbers of men and women.
The changes could be radical. New voting systems would have to ensure sex
equality and proportional representation for all parties.
As chairman of a Labour working party on electoral reform, Professor Raymond
Plant, from Southampton university, has been wrestling with the
complexities. His brief includes elections to the European parliament, the
proposed elected second chamber and the proposed new assemblies for
Scotland, London and the English regions.
Labour has already decided on the 'additional member' form of proportional
representation for Scotland. The electoral system for London has yet to be
agreed, but could be along similar lines.
Prof Plant concedes that it will be difficult to combine the commitment to
PR with a system that guarantees equal male and female representation. The
additional member system could work by giving each elector two votes - one
for a constituency member and one for a political party.
The constituency MP would be elected on a first-past-the-post basis, as now.
Additional members would be drawn from lists provided by the parties and
allocated to each party so that its total number of seats is proportionate
to its vote. In effect, there would be two types of representative -
directly-elected constituency members and party appointees.
Labour intends to use the 'additional member' to balance the sexes. PR list
systems normally require parties to list candidates in order of preference,
so all the top names would have to be female, or male names would have to be
skipped - in effect, de-selected - until the required number of women had
been appointed.
There would be a political row if a government instructed parties to submit
women-only lists, so Labour's plan may have to be modified. . A Labour
government may have to hope that PR would, of itself, improve women's
chances. At the same time, it could exhort other parties to improve their
selection policies, and do much itself to improve Labour's practices.
If the Liberal Democrats were to wield influence in a hung parliament, the
Labour plan would be dead. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Scottish Liberal Democrat
leader, says weighting in favour of women would interfere with the
democratic process, and could turn the proposed Scottish parliament into an
'object of ridicule'.
Baroness Sally Hamwee, Liberal Democrat leader on the London Planning
Advisory Committee, is equally scathing. Quotas have the effect of
marginalising women, she argues; an objection she also raises against
Labour's proposed ministry for women's affairs.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A burning debate that fizzled out in
Maastricht - The Issues: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paddy Ashdown's weekend trip to Boulogne was a rather desperate attempt
to remind voters that Europe is an election issue: one on which he believes
his party, with its unashamedly federalist programme, has an advantage.
That voters should need reminding of the European issue would have seemed
extraordinary six, or even four, months ago, when it was widely expected to
be central - possibly decisive. The desire to avoid that may have been one
reason for the prime minister deciding not to call the election last autumn.
Certainly Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, made no secret of his
preference for delaying the election until after December's Maastricht
summit. He felt that having the election still to come strengthened his
negotiating hand - because, he believed, 'none of the people round that
table (Britain's European partners) seriously want to see a Kinnock
government'.
Had the election been held in the run-up to Maastricht, Britain's
negotiating stance would almost inevitably have become an election issue,
with opposition parties claiming that the government was isolating Britain
and wrecking the EC by its opposition to monetary and political union and to
the 'social chapter'.
The battle lines would have been similarly drawn now, and the argument
probably even fiercer, had Maastricht ended in failure. The Conservatives
would have been obliged to fight the election as, in effect, the
anti-European party.
But an agreement at Maastricht could also have posed problems if, for
example, Mrs Margaret Thatcher had led a significant backbench revolt.
In the event, by excising the word 'federal' from the treaty's preamble, by
persuading his partners to adopt the social chapter as a separate protocol
to which Britain is not a party, and by inserting an 'opt-out' clause for
monetary union, Mr Major kicked the European football into touch.
Only seven Tory MPs, led by former party chairman Mr Norman Tebbit, voted
against the Maastricht agreement on December 19, while Mrs Thatcher and 23
others abstained or did not vote.
Both Mr Tebbit and Mrs Thatcher have now retired from the Commons, but both
are actively supporting the Tory campaign. The constituencies in which they
appear tend, not surprisingly, to be those where the Conservative candidates
share their views on Europe, but that issue is not emphasised in their
speeches.
Still less does it seem to be uppermost in the minds of the voters. Last
Thursday, when Mr Tebbit was in Grays, Essex, questions focused almost
exclusively on the health service, more especially on the closure of wards
at the local Orsett Hospital.
Only a question from the Financial Times obliged Mr Tebbit to mention
Europe. He said: 'I felt, at the end of the day that I couldn't support the
government on the outcome of the Maastricht negotiations, but I have made it
plain that I think it was a very good rearguard action.'
Mr Tebbit expressed anxiety, however, that 'in the event of a Labour
government or a Lib-Lab pact', Britain would accept 'a whole range of
measures to give trade unions greater power', which parliament would not be
able to repeal because they would be part of EC law.
Mr Tim Janman, the candidate Mr Tebbit was supporting, passes this test
without difficulty. His campaign newspaper carries an endorsement from Mr
Enoch Powell: 'With all the big parties poised to give away parliament's
power to manage Britain, the electorate has still one weapon left. Vote for
the candidate whose record, like Tim Janman's, proves he will defend your
rights.'
Mr Janman abstained in the December vote ('John Major did get a good result
at Maastricht: I felt it would have been unkind to vote against John'), but
says he would 'probably' vote against ratification of the treaty if he is
re-elected.
It is a considerable 'if'. He is defending a majority of only 690 in
Thurrock which used to be a Labour seat, and his views are not precisely
calculated to win over middle-of-the-road voters.
The only point in his campaign literature which could perhaps be construed
as a favourable reference to Europe is the statement that he 'believes in
chemical castration for premeditated rapists and sex offenders (as in the
USA and Europe)'.
He does not specify in which European countries this enlightened practice
has been adopted.
His Labour opponent, Mr Andrew Mackinlay, is a self-styled European 'zealot'
who last year staged a mass signing of the social charter as a
tongue-in-cheek contribution to the 'Euro Week' organised by Essex's
Tory-controlled county council.
Mr Janman attracted attention last year when he described Mr Jacques Delors
as 'the devil incarnate of European politics' and warned immigration
officials to 'be on the lookout for a short, bespectacled, horrid little
French socialist coming to Britain for subversive and treasonable motives'.
But even he seems mildly embarrassed by the views of his agent, Mr Ted
Attewell, who says that if the pound is sacrificed there should be 'a
revolution, and people's courts to try those responsible and execute them
for high treason'.
Those may be considered authentic views of 'Essex man'. But the issue is not
a burning one for most voters in Essex. Or, probably, anywhere else.

While the rest of the country is concentrating on April 9, it seems John
Major is thinking about April 5, when one of his favourite pop groups, The
Supremes, are due to perform in London.
According to Hello] magazine, Major recently wrote to the group saying he

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lost Lilley - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Likeable and clever though he is, Peter Lilley, trade and industry
secretary, is not the sort of man you would let loose on an election
campaign. So far he has not been much seen. Yesterday he appeared at an
Edinburgh press conference to demonstrate why.
He appeared to backtrack on assurances made early in the campaign by Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, on the relocation of civil servants dealing with
oil exploration to Aberdeen.
The issue is a vote-winner in Scotland, backed by all the other main
parties, and one of the few popular Tory proposals. Evidently no-one had
told Lilley that it is included in the Conservatives' manifesto for
Scotland.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lab-Lab pact - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a series of attacks by senior scientists on the government's science
policy, the Tories seem to have written off the laboratory vote. Save
British Science, the scientific lobby group, has held two election meetings
 -one at Manchester University last week and another at University College
London yesterday. Labour and Liberal Democrat science spokesmen were
represented at both debates, but the Conservatives did not send a speaker to
either, despite what the organisers describe as 'two weeks of letters and
intensive phone calls to national, area and local Conservative
organisations.'
Derek Roberts, UCL provost and former GEC research director, opened the
London meeting by attacking the Tories' 'pathetic' failure to attend. 'I had
believed that what Kenneth Clarke (education and science secretary) lacked
in understanding he made up in bravery,' he said to loud applause from a
hall full of angry scientists.
The Conservatives put in an appearance of sorts half way through, when a
messenger brought in a fax from Alan Howarth, the minister responsible for
science. 'I don't propose to read it out, if they can't take the trouble to
come themselves,' said Roberts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dick Spring, the leader of the Irish Labour Party, has been drafted to rally
the Irish vote for Neil Kinnock's hopefuls in some of London's marginal
seats.
The British Labour party reckons that around 1m Irish have emigrated to
Britain in the past 10 years, of whom around 50 per cent are Labour-leaning.
The party has identified 23 marginal constituencies where the Irish vote
could be decisive, about half of them in London.
Spring will spend Wednesday to Friday campaigning from Hornsey to Highgate,
emphasising the British Labour Party's policies of Irish unification by
consent, its rejection of the Unionist 'veto' and the repeal of the
Prevention of Terrorism Act. He will accompanied by Kevin McNamara, the
British Labour Party spokesman on Northern Ireland, and the local candidates
including the actress, Glenda Jackson, in Hampstead and Highgate.

One party not doing any knocking in the election - and that includes
knocking on doors - is the Natural Law Party. Instead, they are
transcendentally meditating for victory and holding a series of press
conferences this week in Manchester, Skelmersdale - home of the Maharishi's
Golden Dome - Liverpool and London.
The 11-day-old party is fielding 311 candidates, each accomplished in 'yogic
flying', or levitation, and is certain it will form a minority government on
April 10 with 310 members. It cannot have 311 because one candidate, Peter
Leadbetter, is standing in both Chorley and Fylde and will have to step down
from one of them after his dual victory, causing an immediate by-election.
'Standing in more than one constituency is legal, but representing more than
one isn't,' David Saunders, the candidate for Stockport told the media
audience of three in Manchester yesterday.
The 17 candidates on display declined to demonstrate yogic flying because
the carpeted floor at the Midland Hotel was considered too hard. World
harmony is too poor at present to allow anything more than what NLP members
call 'hopping'.
Saunders said people can take off all right, but they keep crashing down to
earth.

Mrs Thatcher's triumphant progress through Essex ran into a technical hitch

The trained chemist took her minion's advice with a large pinch of Maldon's

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown campaigns for the positive vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown last night attacked head-on the charge that a Liberal
Democrat vote was a wasted vote and predicted that neither Labour nor the
Tories would govern Britain alone if their vote fell as low as 38 per cent.
At a rally in Rochdale, Lancashire, Mr Ashdown sought to build on the
advance in his party's poll standing, saying: 'It is the Liberal Democrats
who can make the difference in this election.'
Pre-empting the counter-attack he expects from the Conservatives, the
Liberal Democrat leader said it was 'nonsense' to say a vote for his party
would let Labour in - he cited Rochdale as an example, where the retiring
Liberal Democrat MP, Sir Cyril Smith, had kept Labour out.
'A vote for the Liberal Democrats will stop a repetition of the poll tax and
stop Labour's renationalisation plans. A Liberal Democrat vote is a positive
vote.'
Earlier Mr Ashdown came the closest yet to forecasting a coalition
government. He said: 'It seems to me practically inconceivable that someone
would seek to govern the country on 37 per cent or 38 per cent of the vote.'
Liberal Democrat strategists are privately jubilant at the apparent dip in
Labour and Tory support and their own upswing. But they were forced to
counter reports of divisions in the party over the timetable it would insist
on for electoral reform - the absolute pre-condition for their support.
They said a promise of legislation in the Queen's Speech for a system based
on proportionality remained essential.
Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, and Mr David Steel, former Liberal
leader, had appeared to indicate at the weekend they might accept a slower
process.
Mr Ashdown - who is determined to avoid Liberal Democrat policies becoming
overshadowed by detailed, but so far hypothetical, arguments about PR - is
publicly indifferent about whether a pact is more likely with Labour than
with the Tories. Yesterday he hinted he may find it easier to work with
Conservatives on a pro-European policy.
'John Major would have no difficulty in ditching the (Maastricht) opt-out
and make it clear that he is going for monetary union,' he said.

LABOUR would capture Stockport from the Conservatives with a swing of nearly

LABOUR'S spending pledges would total Pounds 27bn rather than the Pounds
38bn claimed by the Conservatives, according to an analysis by the

Summers writes.
Neither party has much room for manoeuvre if targets for public borrowing
agreed at the Maastricht summit are to be reached, it finds. 'The fiscal
policy aspirations of the two main parties have not caught up with the
deterioration in the economy which has occurred over the last two years,' it
says. It adds that a Tory government would relax borrowing targets in order
to avoid reversing tax cuts.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher gets out the clubs at the 19th hole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher rounded off her part in the election campaign in Essex
yesterday, urging voters to elect a majority Conservative government but
leaving listeners in no doubt of her less-than-wholehearted endorsement of
her successors' appetite for borrowing.
In a vintage but slow-starting speech at a packed Chelmsford golf club, she
appealed directly to voters' pockets, arguing that 'the best hope' for lower
interest rates was 'a good, sound Conservative majority'.
The only alternative, she warned, was 'a socialist Labour government
consisting of the Labour party and the Liberals which would be socialist. It
is socialism that is falling the world over . . . just when it is falling
the world over, we don't want it back here in any of its guises -
full-blooded or wet.'
In an address which at times took one back 10 years, the former prime
minister, dressed in Tory blue, splashed vitriol on the EC social charter
'from socialist Delors and a totally non-elected non-accountable
commission', and defended her National Health Service record.
The charter's European advocates wanted to 'saddle' British employers with
costs similar to those which they had to bear, she argued, in order to
remain competitive. Family credit was a better way of supplementing the
incomes of the low-paid than Labour's proposed minimum wage because it did
not add to industrial costs. 'We have different ways of doing things,' she
said.
As in her previous campaign speeches, however, Mrs Thatcher's main theme was
the necessity of 'sound finance' in government. Without it, she said, the
Falklands campaign of 1982 could not have been financed from the
government's contingency reserve. Her government 'did not have to borrow a
penny-piece for four years in order to meet our outgoings'.
In an especially pointed rejection of the Keynesian economic theories that
appear to be regaining currency, she recalled that her first government had
been 'very very tough' about not raising public spending 'although when you
have a recession expenditure rises and income doesn't'.
She said: 'To coin a phrase, you have to say no, no, no. And to coin a
double phrase, you have to go on and on and on saying no, no, no.'
Questioned later as to whether any of the three main parties currently
espoused 'sound finance', she responded: 'We are in trouble if they don't'
She added as an afterthought: 'I think we are the only one which does.'
What developed into an ebullient and punchy address had got off slowly with
Mrs Thatcher having to coax the first of several rounds of applause from her
well-heeled and well-behaved audience. 'Come on, clap] aren't you pleased
with me?' she asked. The roar which followed gave her the answer she
required.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Large shift seen in Lancashire support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE of optimism is spreading among Labour party workers in north east
Lancashire as they claim to detect increasing evidence of their ability to
capture several Conservative marginals.
Hyndburn, based on the old Accrington seat, and Pendle, formerly Nelson and
Colne, are vulnerable to swings of 2.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent
respectively and seem almost certain to fall to Labour. The defending
Conservatives, Mr John Lee in Pendle and Mr Ken Hargreaves in Hyndburn, are
campaigning heavily on their local appeal and achievements while in office.
Labour workers in both constituencies were yesterday expressing what
appeared to be genuine surprise at some of the canvass returns.
Mr Tim Ormrod, the experienced Labour agent in Nelson, yesterday used the
emotive word 'landslide' to describe returns from what he said were wards
with mixed voting records. An unscientific straw poll in Colne by the Nelson
Leader newspaper four days ago showed similarly strong support for Labour.
Mr Gordon Prentice, the Labour candidate, was more cautious but believed
that he was on the road to victory.
Mr Greg Pope, standing for Labour in Hyndburn, is forecasting victory by at
least 3,000 votes based on canvassing returns which rated all undecided
voters as non-Labour.
There has also been a slight but distinct shift of attitude among
Conservative party workers. Two weeks ago the mood was relatively positive.
But expressions such as 'we have not given up hope' have now begun to slip
into assessments of party prospects.
The vulnerability of Hyndburn and Pendle increases doubts about the ability
of Mr David Trippier, the environment minister, to retain Rossendale and
Darwen, where a 4.2 swing to Labour is needed to unseat him.
Labour is feeling sufficiently confident of holding on to nearby seats such
as Blackburn and Burnley to begin switching workers to these marginal
Conservative constituencies.
The bookmakers have few doubts about voting trends. William Hill has Labour
4-9 on to win Pendle with the Conservatives at 15-8 against and Liberal
Democrats at 8-1. Mr Pope is quoted at 2-7 on in Hyndburn. But few fortunes
are likely to be made. The betting shop manager in Nelson said no one had
yet placed a bet on the result.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Unpalatable facts sink in at Central Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNCOMFORTABLE truth has slowly dawned on Conservative Central Office: in
the propaganda war over taxes and middle-income C2 voters, the government
was upstaged by Labour's shadow Budget and has failed to regain the
initiative.
The Tories must persuade these lower-income and middle-income voters that
Labour is the party of high taxation. But Labour has ensured that these
voters gain more from its Budget package of benefit and tax increases than
from the Conservative Budget.
Moreover, by releasing the precise details of its tax and spending
assumptions Labour has ensured that their impact can be independently
verified. Labour can both assert that eight out of 10 families will gain
from its Budget and cite the Institute for Fiscal Studies as the source of
this claim.
The IFS analysis shows that the majority of families will be better off
under Labour than the Conservatives. The richest 10 per cent of the
population will be much worse off with Labour's top tax rates. But they
would still be taxed less than they were in 1979.
The Tory strategy relies on persuading the electorate that Labour's plans
are not what they seem. Yesterday they relaunched their 'Labour's
tax-bombshell' campaign, claiming that Labour intends to increase the basic
tax rate from 25p to 37 1/2 p.
Conservative Central Office claims to have discovered 37 uncosted spending
pledges in Labour's manifesto which it believes add up to an extra Pounds
37.9bn annually by the last year of a full parliament, at current prices.
They then assume that Labour plans to finance this extra spending by raising
the basic rate of tax.
Labour denies this will be the case. Its shadow Budget pledged only Pounds
3.3bn of extra spending in 1992-93 and Pounds 6.8bn in 1993-94 - mainly on
higher pensions and child benefit - financed by a 19 percentage point
increase in the top marginal rate of tax. Extra spending would be permitted
only as economic growth allowed.
The Conservatives have to persuade the voters that Labour will not be able
to contain its spending ambitions. It can only succeed if the gainers from
Labour's Budget can be persuaded that they will actually be worse off under
Labour.
If the Tory claims are true, extra tax would be paid by lower-income and
middle-income earners. A married couple with two children on Pounds 14,000 a
year would lose Pounds 551, while the average Sun-reading family earning
Pounds 14,200 would be Pounds 697 a year worse off.
Labour has also supplemented its analysis with specific examples designed to
show its proposals in the best light. Labour tends to focus on families with
two moderate income earners because the rise in higher tax rates hits
single-earner families harder.
The 'Robinsons in Hampstead', for example, have two children and a combined
income of Pounds 43,500. If this gross income is earned equally by the two
parents the family is more than Pounds 150 a year better off under Labour.
But a single-earner family with an income of Pounds 40,000 a year would lose
under Labour. Tory tax comparisons always highlight single-earner families.
The opinion poll evidence suggests that the Tories' 'bombshell' has failed
to explode, in spite of repeated launches. The problem for the Tories is
that both parties have made promises during the campaign which they will
find difficult to keep over the next few years. Labour's aim to increase
public spending does not look any more or less realistic than the Tories'
desire to cut taxes.
Yesterday Mr Major said that the government plans to 'make progress - year
by year - towards a 20p basic rate for all' by increasing the width of the
new lower tax band. Yet the government's Budget plans allowed no room for
tax cuts until 1995-96 unless it were to cuts spending or increase borrowing
further.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Dewar denies delay in devolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party in Scotland yesterday denied Scottish National party
charges that it was backtracking on its promise to create a Scottish
parliament as soon as possible after it was elected.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said a Scottish parliament could
be established in the autumn of next year. Legislation would be announced in
the first Queen's Speech of a Labour government and would be passed by July
of next year.
Mr Dewar was responding to a claim by Mr Jim Sillars, SNP deputy leader. He
quoted Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, who said on Friday that the
Scottish parliament would be created in 1994.
Mr Sillars pointed to Labour advertisements saying 'a Labour government this
year, a Scottish parliament next year'. He warned people not to trust Mr
Kinnock - he had always opposed devolution and would find some way to
wriggle out of the commitment.
Mr Dewar said that once the act setting up a Scottish parliament was law,
the procedure for setting it up would begin and elections would be held with
time allowed for the parties to campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for Fife North-East,
said a Scottish parliament would be law within six months of a election
victory by Mr Paddy Ashdown.
Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish National party leader, yesterday said an
independent Scotland would honour existing North Sea oil licences.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock spells out limits for tax burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK last night moved to end concern that Labour would push up
the general level of taxation by offering specific pledges that the most
important tax rates would not be raised.
Speaking on BBC television's Panorama, the Labour leader said he would
resist all pressures to increase the 25p basic rate of tax and the present 9
per cent level of National Insurance contributions.
In the interview with David Dimbleby, he also pledged not to introduce a top
rate of income tax above the 50 per cent proposed in his party's Budget nor
to raise the present 40p rate paid on taxable incomes of over Pounds 23,000.
In a confident performance which contrasted with his less-sure display in a
weekend television interview with Brian Walden, Mr Kinnock insisted a Labour
government's economic strategy would be bound by a set of fixed
'perimeters'.
Those perimeters would include a commitment not to devalue sterling within
the European exchange rate mechanism and a longer-term objective to meet the
requirement for budget deficits set out in the Maastricht Treaty on European
monetary union.
Closely questioned on his party's stance on tax thresholds, Mr Kinnock
insisted that these would remain indexed to the inflation rate.
'It is essential that they are because they have a terrible impact on people
on average and below-average incomes, as we saw when Geoffrey Howe didn't
index in one year and by that means gave a great thrust to the tax burden
which the Tories never managed to get better,' he said.
Mr Kinnock said Labour's economic strategy would produce investment-led
growth 'greater than the growth of the Conservatives; that's been the
historical record'.
Earlier Mr Kinnock had dismissed Tory attacks on Labour tax plans as 'a
little pathetic', claiming they reflected mounting despair in government
ranks.
Visiting a shopping complex in Dudley, West Midlands, Mr Kinnock said
repeated charges that his manifesto commitments would require Pounds 38bn in
additional spending had been judged 'absurd' by independent commentators.
He added: 'Every time they repeat these ridiculous figures, the level of
absurdity rises.'
Insisting that he would not lift basic tax rates, Mr Kinnock said it was not
in Labour's interests to alienate voters. 'The idea of us waiting to pile a
great burden of taxation on the British people is patent nonsense,' he said.
Labour used its morning news conference in an attempt to 'spoil' the Tories'
expected return to the tax issue.
Last night, in a party election broadcast, Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, sought to give a reassuring account of the effects of his
alternative Budget.
Asked whether a rise in public spending would be possible in the light of
recent analysis of revenue and expenditure forecasts, Mr Smith said
published figures did not suggest that cuts would be necessary.
The emphasis throughout the day was on the caution of Labour's programme,
with Mr Smith insisting that prudence had persuaded him to limit his
spending plans in the light of the gloomy economic outlook.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major adopts tougher style on his soap box
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday predicted a 'nightmare on Kinnock Street' for
British families under a Labour government - marking the adoption of a
tougher election campaigning style.
He told 1,000 Tories at a rally in Birmingham: 'Don't believe for a second
that it doesn't matter who wins. It matters desperately. It matters to
Britain and it matters to you.'
Mr Major sharpened his attack on Mr Neil Kinnock, saying the Labour leader
was unfit to protect Britain's interests on defence and in Europe. 'You
can't go back into the conference chamber and say: 'Sorry, boyo, I got it
wrong.' '
He balanced the negative picture of five years of Labour with his own vision
for Britain, and urged people to take pride in the achievements of the 1980s
under the leadership of Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Major's new-found aggression showed as he pledged to 'take the gloves
off' in proclaiming the Tory record on education and the National Health
Service.
The harder approach was apparent earlier when he took to his soap box on the
streets of Cheltenham to underline his warning that the choice at the
election was crucial.
Party aides emphasised that the decision to use the soap box was Mr Major's
own, and he later confirmed that it was reminiscent of his early years in
politics in Brixton, south London.
'It's fashionable to say that for security and other reasons you can't get
up on a soap box, but I think you have to and I'm going to do it,' Mr Major
said.
This further change of tactic followed renewed criticism of a lack-lustre
Tory campaign.
At the rally Mr Major contrasted the effects on an ordinary family of five
years of Labour with a further Tory term. He highlighted the differences on
inflation, taxes, choice in schools and wider home ownership.
In Cheltenham Mr Major harangued a largely docile crowd and engaged in some
badinage with the few hecklers. When someone shouted 'Rubbish]' to his
assertion that Labour would cost the average taxpayer an extra Pounds 1,250
a year, he replied: 'Rubbish promises, but the taxes would be real enough.'
His impromptu performance was effective, but one or two lines may still need
polishing.
'Where was he during the last Labour government?' Mr Major asked about a
heckler who queried his estimate of higher taxes under Labour. 'In work]'
came the response from another voice in the crowd.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS BY the Conservative party to raise the profile of defence as an
election issue were foreshadowed yesterday by Mr Tom King, the defence
secretary, who accused Labour of 'spinning webs of deceit' about its plans.
The Conservatives are expected to use their party election broadcast on
television tonight to focus on defence policy, which was seen as a weak
point for Labour in the last two general elections.
Mr King, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute in London, accused
Labour of setting out to say as little as possible about defence in its
manifesto.
A Labour government, he said, would imply the 'wholesale closure' of
military units and factories and could destroy a number of defence
companies. Labour's proposed Defence Diversification Agency was a 'piece of
Elastoplast designed to cover the gaping wound which would be caused by the
cancellation of a lot of projects'. The idea that it could immediately
replace the jobs lost was 'manifest nonsense'.
Another defence review, proposed by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
would be 'the worst thing you could possibly do at this time and the
cruellest thing for people in the armed forces' following the Conservative
government's Options for Change reforms.
The Liberal Democrats' plan to halt the signing of contracts for equipment
while a review was under way was 'grossly irresponsible', he added, and
could be 'the final straw' for many suppliers.
Mr King ruled out a further round of cuts if the Tories were re-elected. The
Options for Change review was properly funded, more than had perhaps been
the case for many years, and was standing the test of time, he said. 'We're
set on our course now,' he added.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Public-sector pay makes up ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLEDGE by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that his government would
not allow public-sector pay to fall further behind the private sector
reflects a general assumption that public servants invariably fare less
well. But in recent settlements they have done comparatively well.
From tomorrow, 1.5m public-sector workers whose pay is determined by
government-appointed review bodies will receive rises averaging 6.5 per
cent. Private-sector settlements are running at between 4 per cent and 5 per
cent.
Average gross weekly earnings in the public sector this year are expected to
overtake those in the private sector.
An analysis by the Public Finance Foundation shows that the rise in
public-sector pay was 2.5 percentage points above private-sector settlements
in 1991-92. It predicts a 1 percentage point advantage in 1992-93.
This will restore public-sector earnings to where they were relative to the
private sector 20 year ago, according to the foundation. However there have
been marked variations between public-sector groups in recent years. Since
1979, nurses and police officers have done comparatively well. Civil
servants and BBC workers have been less fortunate.
Annual public-sector pay rises tend to lag behind the private sector for
some years and then catch up. As the last few years have generally seen a
catch-up, government willingness to pay large rises is likely to be less
marked than it would have been, say, three years ago, when the public/
private gap was growing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN unusual attempt to influence public policy, some 100 leading US
economists, including six Nobel prizewinners, yesterday demanded immediate
action to stimulate the US economy.
In an open letter to President Bush, members of Congress and Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, the economists called for:
A further cut in interest rates by the Fed;
More federal assistance to states and localities of at least Dollars 50bn;
The restoration of an investment tax credit to encourage spending on new
plant and machinery.
The group, led by Nobel laureates Robert Solow of MIT and James Tobin of
Yale University, said the US economy faced two problems: shortage of demand
and, longer-term, the need to increase productivity growth, which had
slumped since the early 1970s. The measures advocated would help solve both
problems.
Income tax cuts advocated by many congressmen were 'exactly the wrong
approach.'

FT  31 MAR 92 / Brazilian ministers offer resignations: Collor given chance
for clean sweep after series of corruption scandals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government and presidential staff resigned en masse yesterday
amid a wave of corruption scandals, to offer President Fernando Collor the
chance of a clean sweep of his administration.
In a note to the president the ministers, many only recently appointed, said
they were placing their jobs at his disposal 'as an act of loyalty' to allow
him to 'rethink the composition of his government in view of political
imperatives and important decisions ahead'.
But Mr Jarbas Passarinho, the law minister, who co-ordinated the mass
resignation, said it was in reaction to Mr Collor's complaints over
allegations of corruption in his government.
Mr Marcos Coimbra, secretary general of the presidency, said Mr Collor had
decided to retain the three military ministers and Mr Marcilio Marques
Moreira, economy minister, Mr Jose Goldemberg, education minister, and Mr
Adib Jatene, health minister.
However, none of the other six ministers, 24 federal secretaries and seven
presidential advisers have so far been confirmed in their posts. Last night
the foreign minister was flying back from New York where he had been
defending Brazil's position for the Earth Summit, to be held in Rio in June,
to see if he was still in office.
The news comes after a flood of corruption allegations involving senior
figures in the administration. Three ministers sacked in January are under
police investigation. Mr Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos, secretary for strategic
affairs and head of domestic intelligence, is being investigated for
allegedly having friends appointed as directors of state pension funds and
of Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, and using them to secure contracts.
Mr Luis Themudo, the co-ordinator of the Earth Summit, resigned last week
after allegations of irregularities. News stories have implicated the
agriculture and law ministers in scandals. Mr Romeu Tuma, the police chief,
said at the weekend that there were not enough police to investigate all the
allegations. Yesterday Mr Passarinho said he had asked the army to
investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Mr Tuma.
Mr Carlos Garcia, federal administration secretary and organiser of the
Earth Summit, said the decision to resign had been reached unanimously in a
meeting yesterday morning.
Mr Collor last week told reporters of his frustration with the scandals.
Talking emotionally of corruption, he said: 'It is lamentable that ministers
were involved.' Referring to the case of the sacked labour minister who had
been recorded boasting of a Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 17,300) bribe he had
received, Mr Collor said: 'Just to have heard that conversation is enough to
shake the strongest emotional structure.'
Although Mr Collor had already sacked 11 ministers in his two years of
office yesterday's news was the biggest cabinet shakeup to date. The effect
of the resignations on the financial markets was tempered by Mr Collor's
immediate decision to retain Mr Moreira as economy minister and Mr Francisco
Gros as governor of the central bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have
finally agreed on something. Mr Jerry Brown asserted on Sunday night that Mr
Bill Clinton's confessed use of marijuana while a student at Oxford in the
late 1960s was 'not relevant' to the current campaign.
In response to a question in a televised debate shown in New York, which
holds its primary a week from today, Mr Clinton said: 'When I was in
England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it,
and I didn't inhale and I never tried it again.' He added he had never
broken any US state drugs law.
Mr Brown, appearing via satellite from Wisconsin, said he had never used
marijuana but went on: 'I agree with Clinton, why don't you lay off this
stuff? What you did 20 years ago is not relevant.'
There was some criticism yesterday that Mr Clinton had chosen to defend
himself on the narrow grounds that he had broken no US law, not mentioning
that smoking marijuana was still illegal in Britain.
A more general concern for the Arkansas governor may be the extent to which
his admission reinforces other well-aired doubts about his 'character' -
less among his generation but more among older Americans to whom the 'sex,
drugs and rock n'roll' revolution always was unpalatable.
His confession attracted front-page treatment yesterday in the mainstream
media, with the New York tabloids typically having a field day.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLEET of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia trawlers is today due to claim two
areas of the high seas for Canada, in protest at overfishing by foreign
vessels.
The deep-sea trawlers, which left from St John's, Newfoundland, at the
weekend, will anchor a fishing boat near the 200-mile limit in a symbolic
assertion of rights over valuable fishing grounds.
Canada's continental shelf extends beyond the 200-mile limit at two points.
Canadian officials say this has left its fish stocks, which straddle the
limit, prey to the unregulated activities of foreign vessels.
In February Canada reduced its quotas for northern cod in its own waters for
this year to 120,000 tonnes from 185,000 tonnes, warning of environmental
catastrophe unless catches were reduced and the stocks allowed to recover.
The federal government is coming under political pressure to act against
foreign vessels. Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, warned last week that
Canada would press the issue at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UN to set deadline on Libyan suspects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council is expected today to set a deadline of
April 15 for Libya to surrender the alleged Lockerbie bombers - or face
punitive sanctions.
Council members put off a vote yesterday at the request of Arab leaders as
it was an Islamic holy day.
The sanctions would include cutting air links with Libya, an arms embargo, a
reduction in Libyan diplomatic missions and restrictions on Libyan
diplomats' movements. Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, would be
required to give evidence that his regime had renounced terrorism.
In private consultations yesterday, a majority of Security Council members
agreed there could be no further postponement of UN action, which has been
under consideration for almost a month.
They rebuffed a move by the Arab League, supported by the Islamic
Conference, to put off a sanctions vote until the International Court in The
Hague had ruled in the case brought by Libya against Britain and the US.
But in deference to requests by the Egyptian president, Mr Hosni Mubarak,
and some other Arab leaders, it was agreed not to vote on sanctions during
an Islamic holiday being observed yesterday, the 27th day of Ramadan.
Mr Diego Arria, of Venezuela, the council president, told reporters there
would be no further delay and a vote was certain to be taken today.
Western diplomats voiced confidence that the sanctions resolution would be
adopted by a respectable majority, although probably not unanimously. China
and Morocco are among members expected to abstain.
Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate, stressed last night that the 24-hour
delay did not imply any expectation of a last-minute change of heart that
would remove the threat of sanctions.
Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Egyptian officials, who have led a rearguard
action to save Libya from international censure over the Lockerbie bombing
appeared to have resigned themselves last night to passage of UN sanctions.
Officials were signalling that Cairo would reluctantly fall into line with
some of the sanctions provisions, such as an arms and air embargo, but they
were vague as to whether Egypt would also downgrade diplomatic links with
Libya.
'My understanding is that we will comply with the resolution,' said a
well-placed official. 'Egypt supports international legality and the role of
the United Nations.'
But there is no doubt that western determination to press ahead with
sanctions is causing acute discomfort in Egypt, whose diplomacy has for the
past six months been engaged in efforts to head off just such a development.
Egyptian uneasiness, and misgivings among the pro-western Arabs generally,
stems from a fear that western pressure against Libya will be portrayed
throughout the region as another example of the west seeking to bully a weak
Arab state.
'To Arabs, it appears like the strong imposing its will on the weak under a
new Pax Americana,' said Professor Saad Ibrahim of the American University
in Cairo. 'People are unhappy about the precedent that is being established
and ask where will it end, not that anyone has much sympathy for Gadaffi
himself.'

FT  31 MAR 92 / Jakarta believes it has turned the tables on critical
donors: William Keeling examines the international and domestic implications
of Indonesia's decision to reject all Dutch aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S decision last week to reject all aid from the Netherlands, its
former colonial master, and to disband the donor forum through which it was
pledged Dollars 4.75bn in 1991, has turned the tables on the donors. Many
took the high moral ground after November's killing of protesters in
Indonesian-annexed East Timor; now the donor country which went furthest in
stressing the linkage between human rights and aid may be left high and dry.
Indonesian government officials described the decision as bilateral in
nature. The official statement talked of 'centuries of inhuman colonial
subjugation' and the 'barbarous atrocities carried out by the colonial
forces during the war of independence' in the late 1940s.
Mr Moerdiono, the state secretary and close adviser to President Suharto,
cited Dutch criticism of the killings, after which The Hague began a review
of future aid, as the latest example of intimidation.
The Dutch are among Indonesia's most vocal critics, second only to Portugal,
which still claims authority over East Timor, the colonial territory which
Jakarta forcibly annexed in 1976.
The Netherlands' position since 1968 of chairing the Inter-Governmental
Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the now-disbanded donor forum, gave the country a
leading role among donors. Indonesia has asked the World Bank to create and
chair a consultative forum to replace the Inter-Governmental Group.
Jakarta denies that the decision will interfere with private trade, although
many Dutch companies benefiting from the aid programme, totalling Dollars
93m last year, will be affected. Dutch companies bidding for public
infrastructure projects may also be vulnerable. Prominent Dutch business
interests in Indonesia include the Anglo-Dutch conglomerates Shell and
Unilever, and ABN bank.
In its official response, the Dutch government said that it respected
Indonesia's decision but that it objected 'in the strongest terms' to
Jakarta's 'wording and reproaches.'
Although many donors expressed their outrage at the killings in East Timor,
last week's move is unlikely to grow into a wider confrontation. Most donors
have followed Indonesia's lead in portraying the affair as bilateral.
Dutch diplomats said at the weekend that, since it was not the Netherlands
which had cut off aid, the country was not asking its European Community
partners to withdraw their own bilateral assistance to Indonesia.
However, the Netherlands is likely to be supported on the East Timor issue
by its Community partners, EC diplomats said.
The EC presidency, held by Portugal, said that what Jakarta described as
intimidation by the Dutch 'is the general policy of the Community and its
member-states.'
(Where some dissent could be sown may be over Indonesia's request to the
World Bank to form a new consultative group. Such a move might be viewed as
undermining the Dutch and Community's stance on East Timor.)
The World Bank, which pledged Dollars 1.6bn to Indonesia at the
Inter-Governmental Group meeting last June, said it respected Jakarta's wish
to establish a consultative forum and would be approaching donor
governments. A spokesman for Japan's foreign affairs ministry said that
'Japan will not change its mind in providing economic aid.' Japan pledged
Dollars 1.3bn last year and is Indonesia's largest bilateral donor.
Western diplomats in Jakarta deny that they have broken ranks on the linkage
between good governance and aid. They argue that since the East Timor
massacre the authorities have moved significantly on human rights.
'The Indonesian government has gone far beyond what we would have expected
them to do in criticising Abri (the armed forces),' said one European
diplomat. In February, six soldiers, including two generals, were found
guilty for their role in the massacre, and eight others are being
court-martialed. 'The Dutch were too confrontational,' said the diplomat.
Domestically, President Suharto's move against The Hague has been welcomed.
In addition to appealing to latent nationalism, it has helped appease those
in the military unhappy with the recent criticism of Abri. The government's
position has also given it more latitude to control any civil unrest before
the general election in June.
Some diplomats also concede that Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous
country with a gross domestic product (GDP) of Dollars 107bn in 1990, is too
important to isolate. European, American and Japanese companies compete for
lucrative business; in the power sector alone contracts worth Dollars 6.4bn
will be completed within the decade.
Indeed, the donors' main concern appears to be who will exploit the loss of
Dutch influence. 'The Japanese will take up any shortfall in aid, despite
their economic downturn. Europe will be the loser,' said one diplomat.

FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo may resume insurance for dealings

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is close to resuming the provision of trade insurance for dealings
with Vietnam, but remains wary of offending Washington, which has yet to
lift its economic sanctions against Hanoi.
The dilemma over dealing with Vietnam has become an important test of
Tokyo's claim that it is developing an independent foreign policy, as
Japanese officials have already decided, in principle, to resume trade
insurance.
Officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
indicated yesterday that they were pleased with Vietnam's 'attitude' over
the repayment of about Y10bn (Pounds 43m) in commercial debts outstanding
since the late 1970s, and they are encouraged by the country's economic
reform programme.
A Japanese delegation visited Hanoi in January to discuss the commercial
debts, most owing to trading houses, and another Y28bn in arrears on
Japanese government loans. Repayments were stopped when Japan and other
countries suspended aid after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978.
The expected settlement of the debt question and the likelihood of
government assistance resuming in the near future has encouraged Japanese
companies to take a greater interest in Vietnam, but they, too, are
concerned about causing offence to the US.
Mr Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, has taken a personal interest
in the Vietnam issue, but he and Miti fear that a US decision on lifting its
embargo has been delayed by the unexpectedly close US presidential race.
Japanese officials believe that the Bush administration would like to lift
the embargo, but is concerned about the political costs in an election year.
That delay has prompted Tokyo to consider resuming trade insurance coverage
in advance of the lifting of the US sanctions.
Japan is also considering opening a trade information office in Vietnam next
year, but a public announcement of the proposal has also been delayed out of
deference to Washington.

FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Nafta talks make steady progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE officials from the US, Canada and Mexico wrapped up a week-long
bargaining session recently with no word on how much progress they made in
completing a North American free trade agreement.
However, officials did agree to continue talks at a lower level this week.
They said US trade representative Carla Hills and her counterparts from the
other two countries would convene for high-level negotiations the following
week.
President George Bush's administration has been pushing to conclude the
negotiation by mid-April. The April 6 date set for Ms Hills, Canadian trade
minister Michael Wilson and Mexican commerce secretary Jaime Serra Puche to
resume meeting could be a sign that negotiators believe enough progress is
being made to reach final agreement next month.
The Nafta is one of the few issues to attract enthusiasm on both sides of
the congressional aisle. Although Democrats may baulk if a final draft fails
to deal satisfactorily with the concerns for the environment and
environmental and workers' rights, Congressmen Richard Gephardt, the House
majority leader, may simply attach an amendment to the implementing
legislation requiring US companies in Mexico to abide by US work and
environmental rules.
Energy is one of the thorniest issues at the bargaining table. The Mexican
constitution prohibits foreign participation in strategic sectors such as
oil, but the possibility of ultimately developing an affordable supply of
energy for a self-sufficient North America has captured the imagination of
many in Congress.
There are benefits for all three negotiating partners. Mexican industry
desperately needs US and Canadian investment capital and technology for its
natural gas sector. US imports have soared from 2.3bn cubic feet in 1988 to
35.6bn in 1990. In the short term, the Salinas government seems willing to
accede to the demands of its negotiating partners to develop a regulatory
commission mechanism for rates and contract terms, transportation terms and
the freedom of foreign companies to negotiate directly with its customers
rather than going through Pemex, the Mexican national oil monopoly.
Mexico also has been importing US electricity. Talks promoting trade
liberalisation could provide cheaper, cleaner, more reliable electricity for
both countries.
'California could provide electricity for the entire (Mexican) state of
Baha,' said one congressional aide, who also talked enthusiastically about
sales of US oil rigs and anti-pollution technology.
Less easy is the question of US and Canadian investment in oil refineries
and ownership of petrol stations. Joint ventures could be an acceptable
alternative.
Even more difficult is foreign investment in oil exploration. The Mexican
government has shown a willingness to hire foreign companies on a contract
basis to bring in drilling technology and turn over the oil found to Pemex.
But this would fail to bring in the investment risk capital Mexico
desperately needs.
For all its potential, US energy companies recognise that Mexico will not
fully open this protected sector in the current Nafta negotiation. However,
they hope enough trust can be built to permit exploration and development
later on to the mutual advantage of all.

FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US urges Japan to increase semiconductor
imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday warned the Japanese government of its 'serious concern'
over the 'stagnation' of foreign makers' share of the semiconductor market
and advised Japanese companies to increase their purchases of imported
chips.
The warning by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, followed release of
jointly calculated statistics showing that the foreign share rose only
slightly from 14.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent in the last quarter last year.
In a semiconductor agreement signed last year, Japan recognised that foreign
chip makers expected a 20 per cent share of the market by the end of this
year, although it did not guarantee a 20 per cent share.
However, Mrs Hills indicated the frustration of both Washington and the US
semiconductor industry with the marginal growth of the foreign share. The US
industry recently raised the prospect of sanctions against Japanese
products, if the market share target is not met.
'It is critical that the Japanese government and industry intensify their
efforts to improve access to their semiconductor market over the coming
months,' Mrs Hills said.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) blamed the
stagnating share on a downturn in domestic demand for semiconductors, which
has led to 'inventory adjustment.' But the ministry, conscious of
Washington's impatience, said that 'it is important for Japanese users to
strengthen effort's' to expand purchases of foreign chips.
The countries released two figures, with the 14.4 per cent not including
'captive' sales, semiconductors manufactured abroad, but used internally by
the same company, in particular, IBM Japan. The second figure, which does
include captives, showed a fall in foreign share from 16.2 per cent to 16.1
per cent.
Meanwhile, the Electronic Industries' Association of Japan, yesterday
released a report forecasting that international demand for semiconductors
will reach Dollars 92.8bn in 1995, up from Dollars 53.2bn in 1989. The
association predicts that Japan will be the largest market in 1995, worth
Dollars 32.6bn, followed by north America Dollars 30.7bn, and Europe Dollars
21.8bn, up from Dollars 12.9bn in 1989.

A SURVEY released yesterday shows that unemployment in the former Soviet
Union this year may reach the level of the 1930s US depression, AP reports
from Washington.
The study by the International Labour Organisation, including interviews
with government statisticians and visits to 500 factories, said more than
15m workers will be unemployed this year in former Soviet states, 12 per
cent of the work force.
Another 30m workers in state-sector jobs risk being made redundant because
they are kept on the payroll despite being under-employed. If only half of
the excess workers are laid off, the unemployment rate would double to 24
per cent, the report said.
In 1934, at the depth of the great depression in the US, 24.9 per cent of
the work force was out of a job.
'It is a genuinely chaotic situation,' Mr Guy Standing, the ILO's labour
market research co-ordinator who led the survey, said.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Pearson close to buying Outram from Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, owner of the Financial Times, is close to a deal to buy George
Outram, publisher of The Herald newspaper in Glasgow.
Negotiations are at an advanced stage with Mr 'Tiny' Rowland's Lonrho, owner
of George Outram. It is believed that a price for the deal has been agreed,
although no formal agreement has been signed.
An initial bid from Pearson, which yesterday announced better-than-expected
pre-tax profits of nearly Pounds 174m for 1991, was rejected by Lonrho as
being too low. It is believed that the early bid was in the region of Pounds
70m and that a higher offer has since been made.
Although the Observer newspaper is technically part of George Outram it is
not part of this deal. Apart from The Herald, which changed its name from
the Glasgow Herald in February as part of a redesign, the deal covers the
Evening Times, the Glasgow evening paper, and a number of magazines,
including the profitable Scottish Farmer.
Circulation of The Herald is more than 124,000 as it competes increasingly
against its Edinburgh-based rival, The Scotsman. If, as seems likely, the
deal goes ahead, it will be the latest part of the Lonrho empire to be sold
to reduce debt.
Last week the company announced that it had sold a one-third stake in its
Metropole Hotels chain for Pounds 177m to the state-run Libyan Arab
Investment Company.
A Pearson purchase of The Herald would automatically be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission but is unlikely to be blocked. Pearson's
regional newspaper division, Westminster Press, has no titles in Scotland.
Last night Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director of Pearson, declined to
comment.
Yesterday Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of Pearson, firmly
ruled out once again any interest in acquiring Mirror Group Newspapers.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said last night: 'We have not sold
our newspapers to Pearson, nor are we negotiating to sell our newspapers to
Pearson.'
However, since Lonrho signalled its intention to make a series of big
disposals, the market has expected the sale of the George Outram subsidiary.
Mr Spicer refused to comment that negotiations had taken place, or were
about to take place, with Pearson, or whether Lonrho was negotiating the
sale of George Outram.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Japanese emergency package to stimulate economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government early today approved a package of emergency economic
measures that will increase public spending by at least Y4,000bn (Pounds
17bn) in the first half of the fiscal year, which begins tomorrow.
The measures - largely an acceleration of present spending plans - are a
response to rising concern at the slowdown of the Japanese economy.
Industrial output is falling sharply and money supply growth is at an
historic low.
Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, director-general of the Economic Planning Agency's
co-ordination bureau, said the measures would give a strong stimulus to the
economy, arrest further decline, and allow the government to reach its
economic growth target of 3.5 per cent in 1992.
It was not immediately clear whether the Bank of Japan, the central bank,
would support the measures with a further cut in the official discount rate
from its current level of 4.5 per cent. But Mr Yoshitomi said the package
underlined the need for flexible monetary policy.
Announcement of the package, which was widely anticipated, had little
immediate impact on financial markets. Share prices in Tokyo opened higher,
with the Nikkei average up some 150 points at around 19,800 in early
trading. The dollar was little changed, and was quoted at Y133.05 after an
hour's trading.
Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'The market still
needs something more concrete and more immediate. The market is really
waiting for any move by the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates.'
The bank is expected to act shortly to lower rates, but a cut of just half a
percentage point is likely to disappoint markets, where sentiment is
extremely depressed.
Although the fiscal package may provide a longer term stimulus to the
economy, it does little to ease the difficulties of the securities industry.
Under the government's measures, 75 per cent of public works expenditure
budgeted for the entire fiscal year is to be spent in the first half of the
year, leading to increased spending of 15.7 per cent, or Y1,500bn. Local
government spending, which is roughly twice as much as that of central
government, is to be accelerated at a similar pace.
Spending by public utilities is also to be increased and moved to the first
half of the year. Investment by the electricity industry for the year is to
be increased over budget by Y300bn to Y4,600bn, with Y1,000bn moved forward
to the first half of the year. Spending in the first half of the year by the
telephone utilities will be increased over budget by Y90bn to Y1,290bn. The
gas industry will adopt similar front-loading measures.
Additional plans include special low-interest loan programmes to support
investment in labour-saving equipment by industry and steps to boost
consumer spending.

Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator, was ordered to pay
contractors building the project FFr750m (Pounds 77m) per month towards
disputed cost overruns, starting from the end of April.
The order, which would treble Eurotunnel's present progress payments to
contractors, was made by an independent arbitration panel set up to help
settle the dispute over contractors' demands for FFr14bn (at today's prices)
of extra payments for design changes. Eurotunnel said it would review the
decision to see which parts it could accept.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Major signals annual tax cut: Kinnock rejects Tory attack by
pledging no increase in basic taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR held out the prospect of annual cuts in income tax targeted at
the lower paid yesterday in a drive to regain the initiative for the
Conservatives in the final 10 days of the general election campaign.
Dismissing the prospect of a post-election crisis in public finances, the
prime minister pledged also that there would be no emergency package of
spending cuts to rein back borrowing if the Conservatives won.
But as a parallel Conservative onslaught on the impact of Labour's spending
commitments on individual tax bills moved the election battle back to the
economy, Mr Norman Lamont offered a more cautious assessment.
The chancellor said the projections for economic growth and borrowing
indicated there would be 'very, very little' room for manoeuvre for either
tax cuts or further spending increases before 1995-96.
Mr John Smith, his Labour shadow, seized on the remarks to charge that Mr
Lamont had 'blown apart' the prime minister's 'promise' of a sustained
reduction in income taxes.
Last night Mr Neil Kinnock offered a series of pledges designed to counter
charges that Labour would preside over a general increase in taxation.
Mr Kinnock told BBC's Panorama programme that there would be no increase in
the 25 per cent basic rate of tax, that national insurance contributions
would be held to 9 per cent and that the top rate of tax would be no higher
than 50 per cent. He gave also a commitment not to devalue sterling in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
The clash over taxation coincided with a new opinion poll giving the
Conservatives a one-point lead over Labour. The Harris poll for the Daily
Express put the Conservatives at 40 per cent, Labour at 39 and the Liberal
Democrats at 17. Recent Harris surveys have tended to favour the
Conservatives and the latest compares with an average of other recent polls
suggesting a 1.5 point Labour lead.
Mr Major's attempt to refocus his campaign came after weekend inquests at
Conservative central office had concluded that the promise of an end to
recession and of rising living standards offered the best route to winning
uncommitted voters' support.
His optimistic assessment of the prospect of a 'year-by-year' extension of
the new 20p band of income tax was followed by a stark warning of how family
incomes would be hit by the 'nightmare on Kinnock Street' of a Labour
government.
In a speech to a rally in Birmingham, Mr Major combined a sharp personal
attack on the Labour leader with the charge that his spending pledges would
take Pounds 1,250 a year from the average taxpayer.
That was rejected by Mr Kinnock, who insisted that eight out of 10 taxpayers
would be better off from the tax and benefit changes set out in his party's
shadow Budget.
Mr Kinnock today will seek to move the battle on to education by detailing
his party's plans to add Pounds 600m to the education budget. Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has seen his party's standing rise
strongly on the back of a pledge to inject an extra Pounds 2bn into
education, paid for by a 1p increase in the basic rate of income tax.
Mr Major signalled that he saw the extension along the income scale of the
lower rate band, introduced in the Budget for the first Pounds 2,000 of
taxable income, as his preferred route to the eventual goal of a 20p basic
tax rate.
Stressing that incremental extensions in the band would cost significantly
less than the Pounds 2.3bn bill for each 1p reduction in the present 25p
basic rate, he said widening the band concentrated gains on the lower paid.
Mr Major was dismissive of concern in the City of a looming crisis in public
finances. Asked if he might be forced into spending cuts, he replied: 'I do
not think it is an economically sensible thing to do and there is no need
for us to do it whatsoever.'
Mr Lamont's comments, however, reflected the Treasury's more sober
assessment of the recession's impact on public finances. Under its
projections, the first opportunity for tax cuts would not come until
1995-96.

FT  31 MAR 92 / NatWest chief steps down to work with DTI probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank announced yesterday that Mr Tom Frost had stepped
down as chief executive so he could give 'sufficient time to the
investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry' into the Blue Arrow
affair.
Mr Frost was replaced by Mr Derek Wanless, who at 44 is the youngest chief
executive of NatWest, which is the second-biggest UK bank on most measures.
Mr Frost will remain with the bank as a deputy chairman.
The replacement of Mr Frost came only a fortnight after NatWest said that
any suggestion Mr Frost should stand down during the DTI inquiry was
'complete nonsense'.
Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, yesterday said he and Mr Frost had
decided the management changes were necessary after their legal adviser, Mr
Nick Wilson, had told them that Mr Frost was likely to be very occupied over
the coming months with answering DTI inspectors' questions.
On March 12, the DTI said it was taking the unusual step of re-opening its
inquiry into the Pounds 837m rights issue in Blue Arrow, the employment
agency, in 1987. The focus of both the original inquiry and the new one is
how NatWest failed to disclose for several months that it had acquired a
substantial exposure to Blue Arrow's shares through the rights issue, even
though in normal circumstances its exposure should have been disclosed to
the Stock Exchange.
Lord Alexander had written to Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary,
on March 9 asking him to reopen the inquiry. He did this after allegations
were made - during last year's Blue Arrow trial and in the press - that Mr
Frost had misled the DTI inspectors during the original investigation about
his own role in the affair.
At the time, Lord Alexander said he was asking for the inquiry to be
re-opened so that Mr Frost's name could be cleared. When the DTI duly
re-opened the investigation, NatWest implied that this was in response to
Lord Alexander's request.
However, Lord Alexander said yesterday that he thought the DTI might have
already been preparing to launch a new inquiry when he wrote the letter.
'The speed of their response tends to support that view,' he said. Lord
Alexander stressed that he had not been contacted by 'a single shareholder'
demanding management changes in the wake of the new Blue Arrow allegations.
A leading investment institution, with a substantial shareholding in
NatWest, said yesterday that the position of deputy chairman was 'important'
and that it wanted NatWest to explain why Mr Frost had been given this
position.
Mr Wanless said that as new chief executive he would continue to follow the
strategy set by NatWest's board. In 1991, NatWest made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 110m, which was its lowest level of profit since 1975. In the
previous year, it had made Pounds 504m before tax.

FT  31 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz and Dresdner fall on
cartel office decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES reacted to domestic influences yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT recovered after dipping to a five-week low on news that the cartel
office had ordered Allianz to cut its stake in Dresdner Bank. The insurance
group denied it had a 47 per cent holding in the bank, putting the stake at
22 per cent. Allianz immediately dropped DM120, closing down DM121 or 5.3
per cent at DM2,154, ex-rights. Dresdner fell DM5.70 to DM349.50.
The DAX index fell to 1,700.34 at the start but then closed just 1.14 lower
at 1,710.31. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, eased 0.34 to 695.85.
Turnover rose to DM4.5bn from DM4.1bn.
The market welcomed Mr Ferdinand Piech's appointment as Volkswagen's chief
executive, although the shares initially lost DM2.50 on news of lower parent
net profit, but then closed DM5 higher at DM356. Daimler advanced DM1.50 to
DM755.80 and Porsche shed DM3 to DM552.
Veba's announcement that 1992 earnings would remain static sent the shares
down DM2.70 but they recovered to close unchanged at DM381.30.
PARIS accelerated towards the close on speculation that Prime Minister Edith
Cresson was about to be replaced in a government reshuffle. Firmer bonds and
activity linked to futures expiry also boosted share prices. The CAC 40
index ended up 1.05 per cent or 20.21 at 1,943.75.
Trading in Perrier resumed after being suspended on March 20, and accounted
for FFr1.3bn of the total turnover of FFr3bn. The stock jumped FFr154 or 9.9
per cent to FFr1,700, Nestle's new bid for all the shares in the mineral
water company, as shareholders sold into the market rather than waiting to
sell directly to Nestle. Dealers said Cheuvreux was on the bid all day,
suggesting that it was snapping up Perrier shares for Nestle.
Eurotunnel fell FFr3.10 or 7.2 per cent to FFr40.20 after Eurotunnel said it
had been ordered to pay an additional FFr750m per month to TML, the tunnel
building consortium, from April 30.
Saint-Gobain rose FFr22 or 4.1 per cent to FFr562 after a positive analysts'
meeting in Paris, which was likely to result in a general upgrading of 1993
earnings forecasts. The company is due to hold an analysts' meeting in
London tomorrow.
Hachette dropped FFr6.70 or 4.1 per cent to FFr158.30 after it said it would
take a FFr1.8bn net charge because of losses linked to the troubled
television station, La Cinq.
MILAN plumbed a new low for the year in minimal trading. Open outcry trading
was over by 12.25pm and only legal requirement kept screen-based trading
ticking over until its closing time. Dealers expect trading to remain
subdued until the general election at the weekend. The Comit index fell 1.25
to 496.49, its lowest close since December 27 last year, in turnover
estimated at not more than L70bn after Friday's L75.8bn.
The merchant bank Euromobiliare dropped L350 or 8 per cent to L4,000 in thin
volume after reporting a consolidated loss of L976m last Friday.
There was some interest in telecoms, in anticipation of good results from
Sip. Sip rose L10 to L1,400 in decent volume of 4.1m shares before
announcing that it expected net earnings to rise 19.5 per cent to L480bn in
1991. Benetton, which announced a 24 per cent rise in 1991 earnings last
Friday, rose L60 to L13,240.
ZURICH concentrated on the chemicals sector. The SMI index rose 10.5 to
1,839.2. Roche remained firm ahead of its results which are now expected at
the end of the week. Its certificates closed up SFr20 at SFr3,090 while
bearers gained SFr70 to SFr4,380. Although there is general agreement that
profits will be good analysts are divided about the company's prospects in
1992.
AMSTERDAM was barely changed with some activity noted in cyclical stocks.
The CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.1 at 124.6 in turnover of Fl 321.6m.
Daf fell another Fl 1.20 to Fl 21.20 while ABN Amro, which is to offer ADRs,
gained 10 cents to Fl 45.50.
BRUSSELS was lifted from the day's lows by the retailer Delhaize, which
closed up BFr210 or 2.3 per cent at BFr9,360 after Friday's announcement of
an unexpected five-for-one stock split. The Bel-20 index rose 0.79 to
1,187.88, in turnover of BFr1.3bn.
MADRID declined with the general index closing 0.6 lower at 256.11.
STOCKHOLM was depressed by falls in the US on Friday. The Affarsvarlden
General Index fell 4.50 to 1,002.40 in turnover of SKr305m after SKr452m.
COPENHAGEN saw Hafnia Holding B lose Dkr3 to Dkr267 after announcing that it
had dropped a bid for its domestic rival, Baltica. The CSE index slipped
0.38 to 330.74.

THE NIKKEI average scored a marginal gain in low volume, as investors
remained sidelined ahead of today's announcement of the government's package
to stimulate the economy, which is expected to include a cut in the official
discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 32.32 up at 19,669.31. The index set a day's low
of 19,445.91 on light selling, but rose to the day's high of 19,807.31 late
in the afternoon on index buying.
Volume eased to 170m shares from 180m, remaining below the 200m level for
three consecutive trading days. Overall declines were just ahead of rises by
475 to 454, with 190 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks put on 2.02 to 1,430.15, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
up 0.93 to 1,121.29.
Market participants remained inactive, expecting some volatility today, the
last session of the fiscal year. A reduction in the discount rate by the
Bank of Japan is also thought likely for today, along with the government's
economic measures.
Traders said investors were now focused on the size of the interest rate
cut. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said a 50 basis points cut, the market
consensus, has already been discounted in share prices, and could prompt
disappointed investors to sell. On the other hand, a 75 basis points
reduction could give some strength to the market.
A decline in short-term money market rates encouraged hopes of an imminent
cut. The unsecured overnight call rate, which is heavily influenced by the
Bank of Japan's money market operations, fell below 5 per cent for the first
time since early 1989.
The Nikkei remained volatile due to trading in low-liquidity component
stocks in the index. Some traders with short positions on the Nikkei futures
were seen trying to pull the index down by selling these issues. Daito
Woollen Spinning and Weaving dropped Y79 to Y981 and Shimura Kako lost Y40
to Y740.
Speculative issues, sold off heavily last week on rumours of financial
difficulties at a non-bank financial institution, rallied on bargain hunting
by short-term traders. Minebea, the most active issue of the day, rose Y24
to Y489, while Nippon Carbon added Y100 at Y1,200.
Blue chips, depressed by selling for book-closing purposes last week, also
gained ground on light bargain hunting. Fujitsu improved Y10 to Y674 and
Nippon Steel Y5 to Y320.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 107.14 to 21,161.89 in volume of 249.9m
shares. Cross-trading by companies trying to realise profits ahead of the
fiscal year-end pushed up activity. However, investors remained wary due to
the lack of news.
Roundup
WEAKNESS on Wall Street on Friday and only a small improvement for Tokyo
depressed the Pacific Rim yesterday. Taiwan was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG retreated in active trading as investors took profits following
last week's blue-chip earnings reports. The Hang Seng index shed 29.31 to
4,978.27 and turnover declined to HKDollars 2.03bn from HKDollars 2.39bn.
Hutchison Whampoa slipped 40 cents to HKDollars 15.30, Jardine Matheson 50
cents to HKDollars 47.50 and Cheung Kong 40 cents to HKDollars 21.80.
MANILA responded positively to the announcement that Senator Joseph Estrada
had abandoned his bid for the presidency, which reduced the probability of a
minority government after the May 11 polls. The composite index rose 5.08 to
1,091.19 as turnover fell to 35m pesos from 56m pesos.
The market was led by Manila Electric (Meralco) and the newly listed
International Container Terminal Services. Meralco gained 4 pesos to 154
pesos, while ICTSI put on 70 centavos to 7.80 pesos.
SEOUL slipped below 600, but shares with low price/earnings ratios continued
to attract buyers. The composite index lost 4.97 to 597.69 in turnover of
Won310.4bn, after Saturday's half-day Won256.4bn.
SINGAPORE fell sharply in thin trading. The Straits Times Industrial index
closed 13.02 down at 1,425.74 in turnover of SDollars 60m, down from
SDollars 90.2m.
KUALA LUMPUR extended last week's losses and sentiment was depressed by
speculation that bank reserve requirements will be raised. The composite
index finished 5.02 weaker at 597.69 in volume of 32.5m shares, after 42.3m.
Tan Chong, the motor group, fell 22 cents to MDollars 3.20 after reporting
lower 1991 earnings.
AUSTRALIA saw quiet trade and the All Ordinaries index dipped 3 points to
1,573.4 in turnover of ADollars 125.5m.
Santos, the oil and gas group, eased 2 cents to ADollars 2.59 on reporting a
net loss of ADollars 110.9m. News Corp fell 24 cents to ADollars 17.54.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index shed 5.03 to 1,407.80 in estimated turnover of
NZDollars 14m.
BOMBAY soared on heavy buying, the BSE index hitting a record 4,159.53
before closing at 4,091.43, up 300.25.

FT  31 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Gloomy skies broken by sun over Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment was depressed last week in most of the markets covered in the
FT-Actuaries World Indices, with Mexico the sole bright spot.
The cheerless mood was again emphasised on Friday as the Nikkei average sank
to its lowest close for five years and there was talk on Wall Street that
some institutions were switching out of equities and into bonds. The world
index fell 1.3 per cent on the week.
European bourses failed to shake off the gloom, with Italy particularly
under a cloud. Poor banking results, fears of a devaluation of the lira and
a decline in fiscal revenues drove the market down. On Thursday the Comit
index set a new closing low for the year, and throughout the week turnover
remained undemanding.
One analyst described the Italian market as 'totally lethargic', with the
general election to be held on April 5 adding to the uncertainty.
Scandinavia caught the chill, as an absence of foreign interest was clearly
felt. Finland and Denmark were the worst hit.
Mr Peter Bradshaw, Scandinavian analyst at Robert Fleming, said Finland had
been affected by three factors: the raising of stamp duty on share dealings,
expected in July; an increase in interest rates; and the downgrading of debt
of the country's three main banks by Moody's, the US credit rating agency.
He added that the losses of Pohjola, the insurance group, were worse than
expected.
A slide in shipping rates and weakness in the oil market also weighed on
Scandinavian markets. Denmark was further undermined by political
instability which emerged last week.
Mexico's positive tone continued - in spite of a correction on Friday - as
sentiment remained strong ahead of the share offering by Celmex. Analysts
report that the sound macro-economic outlook and high demand by foreign
institutions for Mexican paper were driving equities higher.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and zinc growth slower
than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND GROWTH for lead and zinc this year will be much slower than
previously expected, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study
Group, the UK-based intergovernmental organisation. Last October the group
forecast demand for both metals would jump 4 per cent this year. It now
suggests zinc consumption in 1992 will rise only 1.6 per cent from last
year's record 5.34m tonnes and lead by 1.5 per cent, from 4.40m tonnes.
The study group says zinc demand should show an 8 per cent increase in the
US this year, rising sharply in the second half, and that demand in South
East Asia is continuing at a high level. However, conditions in Europe are
'fairly flat' and Japan's consumption is down more than expected.
Refined zinc output is forecast to rise by 1.7 per cent, from last year's
5.37m tonnes, with lower output in Belgium balanced by increases in Germany
and Spain, but little change in other countries except India.
The study group points out both zinc and lead markets will continue to be
affected by exports from the former eastern bloc to the west. However, 'if
these show some reduction as the year progresses, the anticipated
strengthening in consumption in North America and further growth in South
East Asia should result in an improvement in the balances between western
world supply and demand during the latter part of the year.'
Lead metal production in the west is planned to expand by 4 per cent from
4.3m tonnes but the study group suggests 'this will be subject to any
interruptions in output or delays in bringing new capacity into operation
and in the secondary (scrap) sector to availability of scrap materials'.
In January the study group warned that it seemed to have 'lost' about
100,000 tonnes of zinc when drawing up preliminary estimates of consumption
for 1991. The consumption figures have now been revised upwards from 5.2m to
5.34m tonnes. Mr David Evans, the study group's chief statistician, said
European demand last year was stronger than anticipated and 10,000 tonnes
more zinc was consumed in the US than indicated in the preliminary
estimates. Demand in South East Asia was also much stronger than previously
expected: 'it took us completely by surprise'.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers extends Russian
diamond links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELEAGUERED diamond market was cheered yesterday by news that De Beers,
the South African group that controls 80 per cent of world rough (uncut)
diamond trade, had signed an exclusive sales agreement with Yakutia, the
gold and diamond-rich area of eastern Siberia that is an autonomous republic
in the Russian Federation.
At the same time Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for the
Russian business, revealed that, although output from the republic's
existing diamond mines seemed to be going smoothly, development of a huge
new mine in Yakutia, called Jubilee, was delayed by at least two years.
Shortages of construction materials such as steel and cement had caused the
set-back at Jubilee, which was originally scheduled to start up last autumn.
De Beers' Central Selling Organisation signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year sales
contract with the Soviet Union in 1990 and at the same time advanced a loan
of Dollars 1bn. Diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as
collateral.
Recently Russia took over the diamond deal but repayments had continued
without interruption, said Mr Ralfe. So far Dollars 250m had been repaid in
capital and interest via sales from the diamond stocks.
In December Yakutia, which produces nearly all of Russia's diamonds -
estimated by the Terraconsult consultancy organisation at 12m carats worth
Dollars 1.14bn in 1991 - secured the right from Russia to retain 10 per cent
of its output for independent sale.
De Beers has now won the right to sell this 10 per cent.
In Mr Ralfe's words: 'This is the same cat skinned in a different way. But
the diamond market will be reassured that we have established direct links
with Yakutia, one of the world's biggest diamond producers'.

<TEXT>
NORWAY WILL set a record for annual capital expenditure of NKr46bn (Pounds
4bn) on offshore oil and gas developments next year, but over the next five
years investment will reach NKr216bn, according to a report issued by
Edinburgh-based brokerage house County NatWest WoodMac.
According to CNWM, 21 probable offshore developments will be approved by the
Norwegian government in the short- to medium-term, covering 2.6bn barrels of
oil and natural gas equivalent and 31 trillion (million million) cubic feet
of gas, representing 27 per cent of total remaining reserves in Norway on an
oil equivalent basis.
These 21 developments will contribute 700,000 barrels of oil and NGL a day
by the end of the decade. Total production will peak in 1996 at about 2.43m
b/d from the expected level this year of 2.18m, the report forecasts.
But, operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent will rise to NKr38 by 1996
 -or a total annual NKr46bn - from the current level of NKr33  - or NKr33bn.
The report also says that the increase in the charge from 1992 for gas
flared and used for fuel offshore has significantly increased operating
costs for the industry.
It estimates operating expenditure in 1996 will rise to 58 per cent of total
industry spending from 47 per cent in 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Papua New Guinea yesterday gave the go-ahead for CRA, the
Australian mining group, to reduce its stake in the troubled Mount Kare gold
project in PNG's highlands.
CRA plans to reduce its shareholding in the existing alluvial gold mining
operation from 51 per cent to 12.75 per cent by selling 12.75 per cent each
to Placer (PNG), Highlands Gold and Renison Goldfields. The remaining 49 per
cent shareholding will remain in the hands of Kare-Puga Development
Corporation, which represents local landowners.
Mr Rabbie Namaliu, PNG Prime Minister, said the move was a vote of
confidence in the country's resources industry.
The incoming partners are participants in the nearby Porgera gold mine,
which is managed by Placer. Each will also take a 25 per cent stake in the
hard rock prospecting authority surrounding the alluvial operations. CRA,
which is owns 100 per cent of the hard rock permit, will retain 25 per cent.
Placer, Highlands and Renison have undertaken to fund the next stage of hard
rock gold exploration in the area, and will finance the recommencement of
alluvial gold mining at Mount Kare. Alluvial mining was stopped in January
after an attack on the site by an armed gang. CRA, which is 49 per cent
owned by RTZ of the UK, says production will not restart until the safety of
staff can be assured.

COCOA and COFFEE prices retreated further yesterday as last week's
speculative selling pressure continued. 'It's still all mainly technical
with perhaps some anticipation of further origin (producer) sales,' said one
cocoa dealer as the May cocoa futures price slipped Pounds 18 to a fresh
eight-month low of Pounds 628 a tonne. Traders estimate that over the past
month about 40,000 tonnes of cocoa has been sold by the Ivory Coast, the
biggest producer. May delivery coffee closed at Dollars 844 a tonne, down
Dollars 15 on the day, but dealers said the fact that it had not tested
support at Dollars 838-Dollars 840 a tonne was 'mildly supportive'. 'It
should be one big long buy from now on. . . I just can't bring myself to
sell at these levels,' one commented. Trading was likely to remain subdued
ahead of the start of talks on a new coffee pact in London at the end of the
week, traders suggested. At the London Metal Exchange three months delivery
ZINC touched a fresh 15 1/2 -month peak of Dollars 1,284 a tonne before
profit-taking and trade selling trimmed it back. At the end of kerb
(after-hours) trading it was quoted at Dollars 1,268 a tonne, Dollars 7.50
below Friday's level.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels strives for EC farm
reform compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Portuguese presidency of the European Community and the European
Commission was yesterday trying to craft a compromise on reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy through detailed, individual negotiations with
farm ministers.
These bilateral talks were aimed at isolating the nationally vested
interests against which the commission has to square off its reform plan.
When ministers met in full council on March 3, the UK, Denmark and the
Netherlands piled in behind an unrealistic German shopping list of changes
to the Brussels plan to question the reform's very principles, although the
12 had endorsed them last November.
The commission is now trying to work with a cautious Portuguese presidency
to limit the scope for filibustering, fearful that the chance for reform
might easily slip away. The intractable row over farm subsidies within the
Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks, the hostility of most member
states to new EC revenue demands, and a new spate of elections in the
community, which mean that very few ministers who started the lengthy farm
reform negotiations will be around to conclude them, are all factors feeding
the commission's anxiety for a quick resolution.
Brussels' officials say that if member states can be prevented from denting
the central precepts of the commission's formula for reining in the CAP's
overproduction and profligacy, they will push for a decision at a forseeably
marathon farm council beginning on April 28 in Luxembourg.
The reform plan is built round some 30 per cent price cuts on cereals, with
full compensation - estimated at Ecu14bn (Pounds 9.9bn) - contingent on
medium- to large-scale farmers taking land out of production. France,
Germany and the UK are leading calls for more compensation for 'set-aside',
and most want smaller price cuts.
Before the farm council formally convened last night, member states were
expected to push for a range of expensive concessions, including:
Dried fodder: Brussels wants to abolish this Ecu1bn-plus subsidy to driers
of grass. France and Germany want to keep it.
Maize silage: If grain prices fall 30 per cent, the commission sees no
reason to keep subsidising (cost Ecu800m-plus) maize for cattle-feed; France
does.
Sheepmeat: The UK wants greater compensation and higher headage limits for
its bigger herds. The commission wants stricter quotas to stabilise
expenditure already at Ecu2.2bn.
Beef: Ireland is fighting plans to set limits on the record intervention
buying upon which it depends, which has doubled the beef budget to Ecu4.7bn.
Dairy: The main problem is Spain, Greece and Italy's demand for more share
in a quota that will be cut about 4 per cent to ease the glut and Ecu6bn
cost. The commission argues that intervention stockpiles are understated,
because it spends over Ecu1bn turning butter into pastry and ice cream, and
similar amounts turning skimmed milk into 'calf-milk replacer'.
The commission wants to whittle away at these interests before putting a
final package on the table, which under majority voting could be blocked
only by two large member states and a smaller one.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issue activity remained restricted to small, targeted issues in the
international bond market yesterday as volatile conditions in most
government bond markets deterred potential issuers.
The State Electricity Corporation of Victoria, the Australian state-backed
utility, launched an unusual ADollars 150m 15-year deal, wholly underwritten
by Merrill Lynch.
The bonds, which have an investor put option after two years, pay an initial
coupon of 8 per cent. If the put option is not exercised this would rise to
a level where the yield is 12.18 per cent. The paper was targeted at
investors with an optimistic long-term view of the Australian market despite
the recent weak performance of bond prices, and was placed in the Far East
and continental Europe. From an issue price of 101.25, the lead manager
traded the bonds at 100.25 bid.
Late in the day, Bayerische Hypotheken-und Weschel Bank added CDollars 75m
to its outstanding CDollars 100m three-year issue launched in November last
year. Lead manager Wood Gundy re-offered the 8 1/2 per cent paper to
investors at a fixed price of 98.10, a level held until the close of
trading.
SASIB International, a unit of the Italian industrial group, launched a
L65bn five-year mandatorily convertible bond offering, lead managed by
Lehman Brothers International.
The bonds will be priced later this week with a coupon of 8 3/4 to 9 1/4 per
cent and a conversion premium of 2-5 per cent over the prevailing price of
SASIB's non-voting shares. At maturity the bonds automatically convert into
shares.
The Bundespost, Germany's state-owned postal authority, has authorised
Deutsche Bank to arrange a DM2bn commercial paper programme, according to
banking sources, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Underwriting fees reach
record level in first quarter
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street's securities houses reaped record underwriting fees in the first
quarter of this year, as low US interest rates and buoyant stock markets
fuelled a flood of new corporate equity and bond issues.
According to preliminary figures released by US research firm Securities
Data, between January and end-March disclosed underwriting fees reached an
all-time high of Dollars 1.73bn, comfortably eclipsing the previous
quarter's record Dollars 1.6bn, and almost three times the total recorded in
the same three months of 1991.
The securities houses made their money selling a record Dollars 289.9bn of
new US and foreign debt and equity via 1,566 deals in the first three months
of the year. This shattered the previous record of Dollars 239.6bn in the
fourth quarter of 1991, when slightly more deals were done.
So great was the demand for Wall Street's underwriting expertise that every
one of the top seven securities houses more than doubled their fees of a
year ago. Merrill Lynch consolidated its position at the top of the table,
earning Dollars 354.1m in the quarter. Goldman, Sachs was second with
Dollars 250m, thanks to its strength in equity underwriting, and Morgan
Stanley third with Dollars 187m.
Overall, the pace of domestic US corporate debt and equity issuance was
hectic, with Dollars 71.7bn raised in the quarter by US companies, easily
beating the previous record of Dollars 47.4bn in the fourth quarter of 1991.
The catalyst for the record-breaking quarter was low US interest rates,
which encouraged companies to issue new debt, either for expansion or to
restructure existing debt.
Buoyant US stock markets also played a part, attracting a rush of equity
issues by companies eager to take advantage of rising share prices. More
than Dollars 30bn was raised via common stock issues and initial public
offerings (IPOs) in the quarter, compared with just Dollars 9.5bn at the
same stage of 1991.
The rush of IPOs was not just a reflection of strong stock markets.
Securities Data noted many IPOs had been from industries 'primed for growth
in the 1990s, including biotechnology firms involved in pharmaceutical and
Aids research, healthcare corporations and software manufacturers'.
One of the most active sectors was the market for high-yield, or junk,
bonds. During the quarter, Dollars 6.8bn was raised in 39 issues, a
remarkable come-back considering that in the first quarter a year ago not a
single new junk issue was brought to the market.
Another thriving business was in the issuance of mortgage and asset-backed
securities, with a record Dollars 103.2bn in new debt raised. Salomon
Brothers did especially well, raising Dollars 13.4bn and climbing five
places up the underwriting table to claim the second spot behind Kidder
Peabody.
Although the first quarter has been a bonanza for Wall Street, most
observers doubt the pace of corporate issuance can be maintained for the
rest of the year. But, if US stock markets avoid a big setback, and interest
rates remain low (the Federal Reserve has hinted that monetary policy may
remain unchanged for much of the year), securities houses should see a
steady flow of new underwriting business in 1992.
The boom in stock market and investor activity lifted the operating profits
of the New York Stock Exchange last year to Dollars 57.1m, a four-fold
increase on 1990. Net income was Dollars 11.8m after non-recurring expenses,
taxes and a one-off charge to earnings because of accounting changes. Three
factors were behind the improvement. A record 162 companies joined the list
of NYSE-traded stocks last year, helping boost revenues to Dollars 374.5m.
Trading volume was also exceptionally heavy, averaging 178.9m shares a day,
the second highest in the exchange's 200-year history. A cost-containment
programme cut 1991 expenses by 5 per cent to Dollars 317.4m.

<TEXT>
THE FINNISH government aims to raise between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn
in the international and domestic bond markets this year to bolster its
weakening revenue base.
The task has not been made easy by the devaluation of the Finnish markka
last November and Finland's worsening credit rating. However, plans to
reform the domestic market and to target international offerings should help
smooth the way.
The ratio of the government's debt to gross national product, which ran at
10 to 15 per cent in the 1980s, has now reached over 20 per cent and is set
to exceed 30 per cent in 1993. Finland's debt ratio still lags that of most
other European countries, including the UK's.
The devaluation of the markka, which was pegged to the Ecu just a few months
earlier, proved a severe blow to foreign investors, but sentiment has
improved since the start of the year. Although the proportion of foreign
investors in the FM50bn government bond market slipped in the wake of the
devaluation, it has now returned to around 20 per cent.
Despite recent positive news, such as Finland's application for membership
of the European Community, the risk premium in interest rates caused by the
devaluation is likely to persist. 'It will be very difficult for Finland to
reduce rates ahead of other European countries,' said Mr Peter Lawrence,
Scandinavian analyst at James Capel, even though real interest rates in
Finland are now among the highest in Europe.
The government plans to divide its funding equally between the domestic and
international markets.
'As a trend, we would like to see the proportion of domestic currency debt
increase,' said Mr Veikko Kantola, director of finance at the Finnish
Ministry of Finance. The Finnish markka bond market is to be reformed in an
effort to attract more overseas investors.
The government plans to establish benchmark issues and extend the range of
maturities on offer. Earlier this year, the government started issuing
seven-year bonds in addition to three and five-year bonds. There are plans
to increase the size of the 11 per cent seven-year issue to between FM4bn
and FM5bn. The government also intends to issue 10-year bonds, but may wait
for some easing of interest rate levels.
There are also plans to introduce a market-making system. Finnish banks are
in discussions with the government, and some foreign banks which already
quote Finnish government bonds may be invited to participate.
The strategy for issuance in the international markets is to launch a series
of large benchmark deals totalling around Dollars 1bn equivalent in each of
the leading currency sectors.
Finland has already raised half of its Dollars 6bn international borrowing
programme for 1992 and so can afford to ride the storm of adverse market
conditions. Of its four sizeable deals in sterling, French francs and Ecus
so far this year, one of the two Ecu deals met a rocky reception, but the
French franc and sterling deals were priced attractively enough to appeal to
investors.
According to dealers, Finland's funding costs have risen since its debt was
downgraded. Finnish debt is currently rated AA+ by Standard &amp; Poor's and AA2
by Moody's.
Finland is typically a fixed-rate borrower, holding more than 95 per cent of
its debt on a fixed-rate basis. 'We are interested in absolute interest
levels,' said Mr Kantola, but spreads relative to government bond markets
are also tracked. Currency swap agreements are used to modify the structure
of the debt, which Finland tries to keep close to the composition of the
Ecu.

THE Mexican government has sold 69 per cent of Banco del Atlantico for
1,479bn pesos (Dollars 472m), equivalent to a record 5.2 times book value
and 18 times last year's earn-ings.
The privatisation brings the revenues from the 13 banks sold so far to
32,000bn pesos, considerably more than most analysts had expected. The money
is being placed in a contingency fund which, barring unforeseen shortfalls
in government revenues, will be used to clear the government's internal
debt.
Banco del Atlantico was sold to a group of private investors headed by Mr
Alonso de Garay Gutierrez and Mr Jorge Rojas Mota Velasco, who are the
principal shareholders in Mexico's second largest brokerage, Grupo Bursatil
Mexicano. The price was 26,235 pesos per share. The Finance Ministry said
the investors would shortly form a financial group in which they would put
their bank and brokerage.
The bank is Mexico's seventh largest, but its assets of 10,600bn pesos are
just 2.6 per cent of the banking system's total. In 1991, profits increased
by 34 per cent in real terms to 87bn pesos.
The government plans to sell the country's five remaining banks by the
middle of the year.

AN OFFERING of 10 per cent of state-controlled Philippine National Bank
(PNB) has been over-subscribed by about three times, the bank said.
PNB has decided to expand the offering by another 5 per cent to a total of
12.05m shares.
The offering is the second stage of the privatisation of PNB, the country's
largest commercial bank. In 1989, it sold 30 per cent of its outstanding
capital in what turned out to be the most successful float in the local
stock market.
Although foreign investors are already qualified to purchase up to 30 per
cent of these offerings, the bank plans to issue global depository receipts
for overseas buyers after the Philippine elections in May.
The price for the latest offering was fixed at the weekend at 265 pesos a
share for cash purchases. The price is 12.50 pesos a share higher for
deferred payments.
The offer price is about six times projected earnings for 1992. The PNB
stock yesterday closed at 267.50 pesos on the Manila Stock Exchange and at
270 pesos on the Makati bourse.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand government is to pay Fletcher Challenge nearly NZDollars
400m (USDollars 219.8m) today to buy 104m of its shares currently worth
around NZDollars 345m.
Fletcher Challenge went ahead with a put option in spite of a last-minute
appeal by Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, who said the government would
be forced to borrow to fund it.
The arrangement was part of a complex put and call option agreement in 1988,
when FCL made a successful last-minute bid for the state-owned enterprise,
Petrocorp, which seemed certain to be sold to British Gas. Earnings from
Petrocorp have been the big source of profits for FCL since then, as the
company's earnings have been hit by downturn in its international pulp and
paper and construction sectors.
Under the put and call option, the former Labour government agreed to buy
back into the energy sector on March 31 last year by requiring FCL to sell
it 100m shares at NZDollars 8.25 each. On the put side, FCL could require
the government to to buy 104m shares at NZDollars 3.83.
FCL shares were yesterday selling at NZDollars 3.30 - hence the big loss
faced by the government - but at the time of the deal they were selling at
Dollars NZDollars 4.25, and the prospect of the option being exercised
seemed remote.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sharp strategies create a buffer
against electronics slump - Steven Butler on president Haruo Tsuji's recipe
for resilience in the fiercely-competitive world of computer technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE consumer electronics industry is supposed to be in a slump, groping
about for new products. If it is, someone ought to tell Mr Haruo Tsuji,
president of Sharp, the Osaka-based Japanese electronics company.
In the past two months, Mr Tsuji has pulled off two important cross-border
alliances - with Apple Computer and Intel - that will put it at the centre
of emerging technologies for a new generation of products.
At home, Sharp caught the rest of the industry napping when it launched a
television receiver that promises to revolutionise the market for
high-definition television in Japan. It simplified the functions of the
standard HDTV and managed to undercut competitors' prices by 75 per cent. As
a result, a mass market for HDTV is just around the bend instead of years
away.
'We don't make the same things that other people make, because if we do we
will lose out,' says Mr Tsuji.
Yet Sharp's strategy of avoiding a well-trodden path may not work for much
longer. Technologies it has been perfecting for years - such as colour
liquid crystal display (LCD) screens - suddenly look like becoming
mainstream.
Competitive advantage in the electronics business is at best a fleeting
affair. Yet, thanks to clever strategic choices, Sharp is well-prepared to
cope with the difficult business conditions of the 1990s, where many product
markets have reached saturation.
This is apparent as much in what Sharp has chosen not to do as in what it is
doing. Sharp is big in the semiconductor memory business, controlling 44 per
cent of the world market for mask read-only memory chips that contain, for
example, electronic instruction sets for computer games. Yet, even though
its scientists have stayed in the development race for the latest generation
of dynamic random access memory chips (D-Ram) - a key component of personal
computers - Sharp decided not to manufacture them.
'It is even more cost-effective to buy D-Ram from other companies,' says Mr
Tsuji.
With D-Ram makers unlikely ever to make a profit on the hundreds of millions
of dollars spent to develop and manufacture the latest generation of
high-capacity chip, the four-megabit D-Ram, Sharp's restraint looks wise. It
has left the company in a stronger position to pay for the next round of
research, to which it is devoting 8 per cent of sales, or Y98bn (Dollars
742.42m) a year.
Similarly, Sharp does not have the same huge presence in the saturated
markets for audio and visual equipment that is weighing on giants like Sony
and Matsushita, whose profits are down sharply.
Almost alone among Japanese electronics companies, Sharp has not yet had to
revise downward profits projections for the fiscal year that ends today.
This is not to suggest its sales have been buoyant.
Sales of cordless phones, where Sharp has been a leader, have been sluggish
and are hurt by the appreciation of the yen. Mr Tsuji says a small downward
revision in projections of roughly flat year-on-year profits may be
necessary. Yet its ability to absorb a downturn in the industry is much
better than its rivals.
Instead of spending billions to buy movie and music studios to acquire
'software' to go with its hardware business, Sharp instead devoted its funds
to selected technologies. It is now an unrivaled world leader in laser
diodes, a key component of compact disc players, mask ROM memories, and
liquid crystal display screens.
LCD production in the 1991 fiscal year grew 71 per cent to Y115bn, after 53
per cent growth the year before. Mr Tsuji says growth is likely to reach 43
per cent in 1992. Sharp has led the technological advance since it
introduced the LCD calculator in 1973.
In the last year, however, it has been joined by hefty competitors in the
field. NEC, Toshiba, Matsushita and Canon have all commited large funds to
the LCD business. They are expecting demand for LCD screens to follow the
rising popularity of portable computers. The flat, lightweight screens will
also begin to replace office computer displays, and eventually some picture
tubes in televisions. The market will be huge, but the potential for
oversupply and cut-throat pricing will be high.
Mr Tsuji professes not to be worried. 'Of course there will be competition,
but technological development is the important factor,' he says.
Long term, he wants to gradually re-weight Sharp's business areas. Consumer
appliances as a proportion of Sharp's Y1,220bn in sales have been brought
down from 60 to 55 per cent, with a near-term goal of a 50-50 split with
business related information devices.
The concentration on technologies for electronic devices - which Sharp will
sell to others and use in its own products - is at the heart of growth
strategy. It was partly because of Sharp's expertise in read-only memories
and LCD screens that Intel and Apple selected it as tner.
Intel, which controls 85 per cent of the world market for microprocessors,
is sharing with Sharp its advanced technology for flash memory devices,
easily erasable and recordable integrated circuits that retain information
when the power is switched off. These could be used in place of magnetic
tape recorders or hard disc drives in portable computers, and will make it
possible to build smaller and lighter equipment which uses little electric
power.
Similarly, Apple offered its software to Sharp because of the latter's
expertise in LCD displays, which will be a key component in some of the
pocket-sized electronic devices Apple is planning.
Another attraction was Sharp's proven ability to turn technology into
consumer products that sell. Indeed, Mr Tsuji refuses to forsake the older
lines such as refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and microwave
ovens, because he believes microcomputers, sensors, and optical devices are
about to revolutionise home appliances.

W&amp;A INVESTMENT Corporation, the diversified South African industrial and
consumer group, weathered difficult operating conditions to record a 14 per
cent increase in earnings in 1991.
Turnover was 6 per cent higher than in 1990 at R3.2bn (Dollars 1.1bn),
though the figures are not directly comparable. Attributable profits rose to
R128.9m from R113.1m. Earnings per share declined, however, to 79 cents from
95 cents on account of a 37 per cent increase in the weighted number of
permanent equity instruments in issue. The total dividend was unchanged at
42 cents per share.
During the year, the group embarked on a number of important structural
changes. These included selling property and shares in Elcentre, the
manufacturer of power cables and distributor of electrical goods, as well as
its Arwa/Burhose hosiery business for R200m. The debtors' book of furniture
retailer, JD group, was also sold.
Mr Jeff Liebesman, executive chairman, was pleased the group had maintained
its operating margin at 10.4 per cent.

BOND Corporation, the Australian investment group and former flagship of

not hit its debt swap programme aimed at avoiding liquidation, Reuter
reports from Perth.
The company, operating under a scheme of arrangement with its lenders, said
the loss was mainly due to interest expense accruals of ADollars 105.64m,
unrealised net foreign exchange losses of ADollars 162.6m - relating to
Eurodebt and convertible bonds - and provisions of ADollars 46.09m on
investments and receivables.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK LEUMI, Israel's second largest bank, yesterday announced a slide into
losses in 1991 as a result of parliament-enforced provisions for the
debt-ridden agricultural sector and the second year of heavy losses at its
New York subsidiary.
The bank reported a net loss of Shk78m (USDollars 34.2m) for 1991compared
with a net profit in 1990 of Shk87m, confirming warnings from the Bank of
Israel that a law recently passed by the Knesset legislating large
write-offs for the country's Moshavim collective farms would sorely damage
profitability at the main banks.
Bank Leumi, with total assets at the end of 1991 of Shk67.5 bn, set aside a
total of Shk394m for bad debts, of which Shk301m was accounted for by the
strictures of the new law. It said that without the Moshavim provision the
group would have shown a net profit of Shk77m.
Another big factor in the retreat into the red, however, were continued
losses at Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York, which has been hit hard for
the past two years by real estate losses. It was forced to make provisions
against bad debts of Dollars 101m in 1991.
The picture was much less gloomy at Israel Discount Bank, the country's
third-largest after Bank Hapoalim, which reports today, and Leumi. Only
lightly exposed to agricultural debt, it announced a 24 per cent rise in net
profits to Shk86.5m in 1991, compared to Shk69.9m the year before.
Return on capital of 4.7 per cent was up from 3.9 per cent in 1991. Total
income was up 16 per cent at Shk445.7m. Total assets at the end of the year
were Shk39.4bn, down by 4.3 per cent.
This year's bank results are of unusual interest because of the government's
accelerating programme to sell off its majority shareholdings acquired in
1983 when it stepped in to rescue the banking system from a catastrophic
share collapse.
The shareholdings have not to date had commensurate control because of a
preferential share structure, but a one-share, one-vote system will apply
once the government holdings are sold off.

POSEIDON Gold (PosGold), part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, suffered a setback yesterday when shareholders in Mount
Leyshon Gold Mines rejected plans for a merger.
Mount Leyshon, which is 49 per cent owned by PosGold, is one of two
companies targeted by Mr de Crespigny for a merger which would have created
Australia's third-largest gold producer.
The board said more than half the company's shareholders voted for the
merger, but the majority failed to reach the 75 per cent threshold required
by the company's articles of association.
Small shareholders are understood to have objected to the terms of the
merger, under which PosGold offered nine of its shares, five options and
ADollars 1.50 (USDollars 1.15) cash for every five Mount Leyshon shares.
Shareholders in ACM Gold, the other target company, will vote on a separate
merger proposal on Monday. ACM Gold is 40 per cent owned by Normandy
Poseidon.
PosGold is expected to improve the terms offered to Mount Leyshon
shareholders. However, analysts said the group might wait until after the
ACM Gold shareholders' meeting before acting.
If the deal goes through, Normandy Poseidon will emerge with 55.2 per cent
of the merged PosGold, and Anglo American, the South African mining group,

INTERALUMINA, Venezuela's sole producer of alumina - aluminium oxide -
reported net earnings of USDollars 22m for 1991 on sales of Dollars 319.2m.
In terms of Venezuelan currency, the company - owned by the Venezuelan
government as majority partner and Alusuisse - had higher sales and profits
figures in 1991 than the previous year.
But, due to a 23 per cent decline last year in the value of the Venezuelan
bolivar against the US dollar, Interalumina's financial performance was down
slightly from 1990 in dollar terms. The net profit in 1990 was Dollars
22.8m, while sales revenues were Dollars 319.9m.
Interalumina recently completed a Dollars 200m expansion that raised alumina
capacity to 2m tonnes per year from 1.3m. The government is studying a new
production line that would increase capacity to 3m tonnes.
Interalumina last year produced around 1.5m tonnes of alumina and exported
10 per cent of the total.

<TEXT>
ADSTEAM, the Australian retailing and manufacturing group which is being
restructured by its bankers, yesterday reported a consolidated net loss of
ADollars 133m (USDollars 102m) for the six months to the end of December,
compared with a loss of ADollars 1.2bn in the comparable period of the
previous year.
The group said it was still being adversely affected by interest payments on
debt acquired when the company was being run by Mr John Spalvins, the
Australian entrepreneur, who left last year after being fired in December
1990.
However, the directors said the trading businesses were performing
'reasonably satisfactorily' in view of the recession, with the exception of
the Metro Meat subsidiary and some property interests.
The largest loss during the period was made by David Jones, an upmarket
retailing chain, which posted one of ADollars 57m, compared with ADollars
1.18bn in the comparable period of the previous year.
Adelaide Steamship, the flagship company, reported a net loss of ADollars
48m, down from ADollars 1.15bn; Tooth made a net loss of ADollars 38m
compared with ADollars 582m; and National Consolidated reported a net loss
of ADollars 5m.
The only bright spot was Industrial Equity (IEL), which reported a net
profit of ADollars 27m. IEL confirmed that the disposal of Woolworths, its
supermarket chain, was under consideration.
Analysts say Woolworths could raise between ADollars 1.5bn and ADollars 2bn
on the Australian Stock Exchange, which would make it Australia's second
highest capitalised retailer.
Woolworths is the main competitor to Coles Myer, Australia's largest
retailing chain. It has continued to perform strongly in spite of Adsteam's
financial problems.
Woolworths made pre-tax profits of ADollars 211 last year, and is expected
to report profits of about ADollars 240m this year. However, growth is
expected to slow over the next few years following the completion of an
investment programme.
IEL, which is jointly-owned by three other Adsteam companies, has agreed
credit lines of ADollars 1.45bn with a syndicate of 14 banks which replaced
its previous 51 lenders.
Adsteam has already spun off a number of retailing assets in the ADollars
235m flotation last year of National Foods. Pacific Dunlop, the diversified
Australian manufacturing group, bought Petersville Sleigh, another former
Adsteam company, for ADollars 352m.
The group reported a consolidated net loss of ADollars 1.57bn for the year
to June 30. The banks stepped in to restructure it in late 1990 after the
shares came under strong selling pressure because of concern about the
group's complex cross-shareholding structure and extensive inter-company
debt.

<TEXT>
HACHETTE, the heavily indebted French media group, is being forced to
restructure its finances because of its exposure to La Cinq, the struggling
television station which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and will on
Friday learn whether it is to close.
The news of the restructuring follows months of speculation about the
secretive media group's financial situation.
Hachette, which is in discussions over a proposed merger with Matra, the
French defence group that is also controlled by the Lagardere family's
interests, yesterday announced it expected to make provisions of up to
FFr1.8bn (Dollars 322.8m) in its 1991 accounts to cover its exposure to La
Cinq.
This means Hachette, burdened by net debt estimated at FFr8bn, urgently
needs to increase its shareholders' equity which would be reduced to around
FFr1.2bn after such a provision.
As a result, it has begun negotiations with its banks and shareholders -
including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the
state-controlled French banks - to restructure its finances.
Yesterday, there was speculation in the Paris stock market that the
restructuring could involve the Lagardere faction, which owns 51 per cent of
Hachette, losing control of the group, whose interests include the worldwide
rights to Elle magazine.
Hachette, which is expected to announce an overall loss for 1991 after
sustaining a FFr30m net loss in the first half of the year, is still in
negotiations over the full extent of its exposure to La Cinq, for which it
made a previous FFr1.75bn provision in its 1990 accounts.
However, the 1991 provision of FFr1.8bn is expected to cover all potential
liabilities, including the possibility of compensating the financial
investors, such as Kleinwort Benson, the London-based bank that Hachette
introduced to La Cinq when it took control of the channel in autumn 1990.
The group has been trying to sell assets to reduce the debts amassed by a
spending spree in the US, notably the acquisition of Grolier, the
encyclopedia group, for Dollars 449m, and of Diamandis magazines for Dollars
712m.
It has sold some printing interests in France and Spain, but its historic
property on Boulevard St Germain in Paris and its 8.1 per cent stake in
Rizzoli, the Italian publishing group, are still on the market.

Nicosia-based oil industry weekly, AP-DJ reports from Manama.
MEES said Mr Fahd Mohammed al-Sabah wanted to retire from the KIO for health
reasons. He is likely be replaced by Mr Ali Rashid al-Badr, chairman of the
Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East.
The KIO manages the bulk of Kuwait's overseas equity investments, which
include significant stakes in British Petroleum, Midland Bank and
Daimler-Benz.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: BMW looks at potential
production site in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, the German executive and luxury car-maker, has reached an advanced
stage in the investigation of potential production sites outside Germany.
The company said yesterday it was studying sites in the US and in Europe and
a decision could be made by the early summer.
BMW, one of the most successful European car-makers, has increased its car
production consistently every year during the past decade, with output
rising to a record 553,230 in 1991.
The company said it was working at the limit of its capacity. Last year's
6.5 per cent increase in output was only achieved through heavy use of
overtime with the working of 27 additional Saturday shifts.
According to a US Government memorandum quoted in Automotive News, the
authoritative US auto industry magazine, BMW is '80 per cent' decided on
building a new car plant in the US.
BMW said it was narrowing its selection of locations to a short-list of four
to five potential sites, and confirmed that Anderson, South Carolina, was
one of them.
According to Automotive News, Mr Andrew Thoms, the US Consul-General in
Munich, has written an official memorandum to the US embassy in Bonn
concerning BMW's plans following a recent meeting with Mr Eberhard von
Kuenheim, BMW chairman.
BMW said yesterday it had still not taken a final decision on whether to
press ahead with a foreign production site and was investigating whether
such a site would be used:
To assemble cars supplied in kit form (CKD) from Germany; or
To produce components such as engines; or
To make such a plant the single source for a particular model variant, such
as an estate car range.
BMW has studied production in the US in particular as a way of countering
its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and the
D-Mark. It is also facing severe price competition in the US
high-performance luxury car market, in particular from Japanese car-makers.
Despite heavy falls in its US car sales since the mid-1980s, the US remains
BMW's second largest market after Germany, with sales of 53,300 last year or
nearly 10 per cent of its worldwide sales.
BMW's production is heavily concentrated in Germany at present, but in
common with other German car-makers it has become increasingly concerned at
high German production costs and the pressure for shorter working hours.

<TEXT>
MR GIANNI AGNELLI, the Italian industrialist, has bought 5 per cent of Guoco
Group - the owner of Dao Heng Bank, Hong Kong's fourth largest bank - from
the Kuwait Investment Office.
In what is believed to be Mr Agnelli's first foray into Far East markets, he
said the purchase would lay the groundwork for future co-operation with
Guoco and the Hong Leong group of companies, both of which are controlled by
the Quek family of Malaysia.
The family has extensive interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, as
well as Hong Kong, mainly in finance, property and manufacturing which it
holds through the Hong Leong group of companies.
The family also owns 31 per cent of Guoco which at the weekend said it had
bought 49 per cent of Hoare Govett Asia following a buyout of the broker by
its management from Security Pacific. Aside from banking, Guoco also has
interests in hotels and manufacturing in China.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but analysts said that Mr Agnelli
would have had to pay at least HKDollars 190m (USDollars 24.5m) for the
stake in Guoco. KIO will retain a 24 per cent interest in the company.
Mr Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, has made a convertible loan to
Guoco which entitles him to 9 per cent of the company's capital upon
conversion.

<TEXT>
SAINT LOUIS, the French food and paper company which recently became
embroiled in the bid battle for Perrier mineral water, yesterday announced a
bigger dividend following a 3.2 per cent increase in net profits from
FFr732m (Dollars 130.7m) in 1990 to FFr760m in 1991.
The board proposed an increase in the dividend from FFr30 to FFr32 a share.
Saint Louis became involved in the Perrier saga because of its links with
the Agnelli family of Italy, one of its minority shareholders.
Saint Louis agreed to buy 13.8 per cent of Perrier for FFr1.5bn on the eve
of the announcement of the first FFr13.42bn bid from Nestle, the Swiss food
group.
This purchase was later annulled by the Paris commercial court and Saint
Louis sold the shares back to Perrier.
The Perrier fracas came at a time of a period of rapid expansion for Saint
Louis, which last November launched a FFr4.3bn share offer for the remaining
shares in Arjomari-Prioux, the paper company in which it already held a
controlling 41.42 per cent stake.
The group's net profits for 1991 comprised FFr527m from food interests and
FFr232m from the paper division.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: St-Gobain pins hopes on US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and materials maker, hopes to earn more in
the current year than 1991's FFr2.51bn (Dollars 450m) net attributable
profit, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman, Reuter reports.
Mr Beffa, speaking to financial analysts, said the first signs of recovery
in the US, where Saint-Gobain sees about 20 per cent of turnover, were
apparent in February and confirmed in March.
'The extent of this recovery . . . cannot be predicted,' he said. 'It will
be moderate in 1992 and more significant in 1993.'
The US market is critical to Saint-Gobain because of its Dollars 1.9bn
acquisition in 1990 of US abrasives and ceramics-maker Norton.
Mr Beffa said German growth, which was strong in 1991, was expected to hold
up well in 1992, while French business was likely to be stable this year.
Saint-Gobain's FFr2.5bn net attributable profit for 1991 was down from
FFr3.36bn in 1990.
Mr Beffa added that Saint-Gobain expected to continue to reduce debt in
1992, although he said the company might not reach its goal of cutting net
debt to 40 per cent of equity by the end of 1993.
Net debt stood at FFr20.5bn, or 56 per cent of equity, at end-1991 against
FFr19.4bn, or 59 per cent of equity, at the end of 1990.

turnover

<TEXT>
VEBA, the German power-to-retailing conglomerate, yesterday reported record
sales and profits for 1991. It promised shareholders a DM12 dividend, DM1
more than in 1990.
Mr Klaus Piltz, chairman, said he was cautiously optimistic for this year,
estimating that results would at least match those of 1991. He said all
sectors except oil and chemicals were performing well.
Consolidated turnover rose 9 per cent to DM59.5bn (Dollars 36bn) and
operating profits were up 18.7 per cent at almost DM3bn, said Mr Ulrich
Hartmann, finance director.
The group, which comprises 674 subsidiaries compared with 646 at the end of
1990, had especially good results in electricity generation and
distribution, and in the trading sector.
Mr Piltz said fixed costs would be scrupulously examined this year following
a flurry of acquisitions and new investments.
The aim was to reduce costs by DM400m a year before the end of 1993. This
would involve reducing the workforce by 3,500, slimming down administration,
decentralising management, and pulling out of fringe activities.
The chairman, responding to criticism of relatively weak growth in the share
price, said the question of shareholder value was a legitimate issue. Higher
share prices, however, could not be achieved through short-term measures.
Veba's core businesses depended on medium and long-term strategies. There
was no 'taboo' attached to floating off subsidiaries, but such action should
be taken only when it served the financial and strategic interests of the
group.
Linde, the German engineering group, expects 1992 group sales to rise by
about 10 per cent, after climbing 13.9 per cent in 1991 to DM6.91bn, Reuter
reports from Wiesbaden.

FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Zetterberg plans to quit Volvo
following management shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTER Zetterberg, chief executive of Volvo, plans to leave the Swedish
car and truck group in October after barely two years at the helm.
The 50-year-old former banker and forestry group chief executive - who until
recently had been tipped as the heir-apparent to Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar,
Volvo's chairman - gave no indication of what he will do when he steps down.
Volvo issued a brief statement yesterday announcing Mr Zetterberg's
intention to leave in October.
Only last week, Volvo confounded Sweden's closely-knit business community
with the announcement it was replacing Mr Zetterberg with Mr Soren Gyll, the
chief executive of Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals group
with which Volvo wants to merge.
Volvo said Mr Gyll would take over as chief executive from May 13, while Mr
Zetterberg would be demoted to the position of deputy chief executive.
However, yesterday Volvo said Mr Zetterberg would remain with the company
officially until October 1992 and would be 'available to help Volvo until
then'.
'My decision to leave the company was quite natural in the light of the
management shift', said Mr Zetterberg yesterday. Mr Zetterberg was not
available for further comment.
Business relations between Volvo and Procordia have clearly grown warmer as
a result of the discussions about a proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars 6.48bn)
merger of their operations, although it is still not clear whether the
government will allow the deal to go ahead.
Mr Zetterberg joined Volvo as company president in the spring of 1990 before
taking over from Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar as chief executive officer in October
of the same year.
He is credited with introducing important rationalisation measures,
including the plan to cut 11,000 jobs and reduce costs by SKr5.5bn by the
end of 1992. At the end of 1991, Volvo had 63,600 employees, and costs for
the year amounted to SKr75.6bn.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Spend, spend, spend to stay in the game -
Paul Cheeseright looks behind the financial constraints binding Lucas
Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES, one of the largest UK engineering groups, is
uncomfortable. This is not just because of the interim figures which would
have been just above break-even had it not been for a timely injection of a
pension fund surplus. Nor is it a matter solely of the recession.
Rather it is a question of spending heavily, simply to stay in the
high-technology games it has decided to play, while at the same time coping
with a reduced cashflow.
Lucas needs money.
One measure of the problem is the gearing. Last July Lucas had gearing of 39
per cent. Next July, according to Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, it will still
have gearing of about 39 per cent. Yet in the meantime it has had a once-off
injection of Pounds 90m, a distribution from the Lucas Pension Fund.
When, last November, the Occupational Pensions Board gave approval for that
transfer, Lucas was making it clear that gearing would be reduced to 26 per
cent. The group's inability to hold gearing at that level is recognition of
the fact that it does not have sufficient cashflow to spend simultaneously
on capital investment, research and development, reduction of the cost base,
and dividends.
Without the help of the pension fund, the group would clearly have been even
more uncomfortable.
As it is, its situation has been made more difficult by the shift in
responsibilities at the top of the group, which will see Sir Anthony handing
over executive responsibility to Mr Anthony Edwards, chief of the aerospace
division, and its unexpected aftermath. This was the tension on the board
which led eventually to the resignation - suitably compensated - of Mr
Michael Hankinson, the finance director.
The immediate future will see Mr Edwards looking for further opportunities
to simplify the structure of the group, to bring about a greater
technological co-operation between the three main operating divisions -
aerospace, automotive and applied technology - and, inevitably, to reduce
costs further.
But this is for the longer term and marks a continuation of what has been
taking place at Lucas for some years.
Sir Anthony, however, was stressing yesterday that Lucas is a group whose
activities can only be seen in the long term. Hence the research and
development expenditure and capital investment, which at Pounds 50.3m and
Pounds 49.1m respectively in the first half, held up well against last time.
Once this expenditure is combined with a sharp increase in reorganisation
and redundancy costs - Pounds 15.4m in the first half and likely to be
slightly more in the second - then immediate financial pressures increased.
Probably the pressure was unavoidable. Over the longer term, Lucas, like
other large component makers in the motor sector, has been building closer
technical and financial relationships with the main vehicle manufacturers.
Instead of simply supplying parts, it designs, often in co-operation with
the vehicle maker, complete systems.
The benefit is a more secure customer base as Lucas becomes 'a preferred
supplier'. The downside is that Lucas has to spend more money at the front
end. Yet what is now happening in the automotive sector has already happened
in aerospace.
So the need for a heavy cashflow is evident. But recession made certain that
it would not be forthcoming. Lucas may share in its main business sectors,
but worldwide sales fell more than the figures - Pounds 1.15bn (Pounds
1.18bn) in the 1991-92 first half - might suggest. The numbers look better
once the effect of new acquisitions and exchange rate gains are taken into
account.
Operating profit in the first half was down to a modest Pounds 17.1m, a fall
of more than Pounds 50m compared with the first half of last year. As
interest payments came to Pounds 16.9m, the group's ability to pay for its
longer-term needs out of current income was effectively wiped out. The
position may improve in the second half. Although Mr Edwards does not expect
operating profits from aerospace to be more than the Pounds 16.3m earned in
the first half, the minuscule profits from automotive products should
increase.
Mr Bob Dale, the chief of Lucas' automotive side, has noticed some pick-up
in the market and expects the benefits of earlier cost-cutting to show up.
But the Lucas directors can thank the pension fund for bridging the gap
between the short and the long term.

<TEXT>
A SURPRISE bid worth IPounds 4.67m, or Pounds 4.36m, has been launched for
Tuskar Resources, the Dublin-based exploration company, by Coplex Resources,
the Australian exploration company.
The 1-for-12 offer values each Tuskar share at I1.78p. Coplex shares closed
in Australia on Friday at 45 cents. Tuskar's shares closed at I1.75p last
night.
The Tuskar board will consider whether to recommend the offer to
shareholders, once it has been formally received.
Tuskar's principal asset is its 90 per cent interest in the Rubiales
oilfield in Colombia with estimated recoverable reserves of 100m barrels.
Tuskar has completed three exploration wells to date, but lacks the
financial resources to complete testing to declare the field commercial.
Tuskar must drill two further wells to hold its licence beyond June 30 this
year.
In an interim statement last month Mr Neil O'Donoghue, Tuskar's chairman,
said that commercial development of the field would require investment
sufficient to produce oil at 25,000 barrels per day to offset high transport
costs and the current low prices for the heavy crude which the field
produces.
He said: 'The required amount of funds cannot be raised at this time, and
any attempt to do so would not even raise sufficient funds to complete the
current work programme.'
In Tuskar's rights issue last year 54 per cent of the shares were left with
the underwriters.

bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER PEOPLE, one of the UK's largest computer recruitment consultancies,
suffered the full force of the recession in its key markets last year as
clients in the US and the UK postponed projects and delayed taking on new
staff.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell 68 per cent to Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 3.11m) on
revenues 11 per cent down at Pounds 67.7m.
Earnings per share declined 67 per cent to 5.48p (16.42p) and a final
dividend of 3.3p is proposed making a 5.4p (6.2p) total.
Mr Rupert Bayfield, the chairman, said: 'This balances the actual level of
earnings in 1991, a reasonable return for our shareholders and our policy of
ensuring that we are prudently financed.'
Net borrowings were lower than expected at Pounds 2.9m, with net gearing at
52 per cent.
The group supplies permanent and temporary computer staff in the UK and
temporary consultants in the US. It is therefore vulnerable to downturns in
the computing services market, which is experiencing its worst ever
recession. The share price, which topped 280p in the summer of 1990 and has
been trading at under 100p recently, fell 5p to 90p on the results.
Mr Bayfield said the management of the company had been streamlined and
there had been a 20 per cent reduction in sales, support and administrative
staff, equal to about 100 people. He did not anticipate further
restructuring.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon improves to Pounds 106m - Strong
second half offsets shortfall in first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG second half performance helped MB-Caradon, the building products,
security printing and packaging group, report a 4.6 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 106.4m for 1991.
The result was better than the market had expected and the shares rose 9p to
259p.
There was no change at the earnings level, though, with a fully diluted
figure of 15p. The dividend for the year is held at 8.5p with a recommended
maintained final of 5.75p.
At the half way stage pre-tax profits were down from Pounds 53.4m to Pounds
47.2m. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said that so far in 1992 the
profitability of the group's managed businesses - building products and
security printing - were showing 'a significant increase'.
Group turnover in 1991 was 2.4 per cent lower at Pounds 679.2m but operating
profits from the managed businesses rose 4.7 per cent to Pounds 93.7m. The
group's 25.1 per cent stake in CMB Packaging, the large European company,
contributed Pounds 31.8m to trading profits, the same as in 1990.
Mr Jansen said the UK building products business had seen a 12 per cent
volume fall, but had decided to hold prices and cut costs to improve
efficiency. There was a 13 per cent reduction in employees to 900. Operating
profits fell 9.1 per cent to Pounds 48m.
By contrast European profits rose 45 per cent to Pounds 13.9m, with margins
up from 9.6 to 12 per cent. Volumes rose by 14 per cent and prices added
another 3 per cent. Mr Jansen said the German market was still strong,
though there were signs of weakening in other areas.
In the US the security printing business began to see the benefits of the
merger between Clarke and ABS, acquired in 1989, in the second half after
suffering a 17 per cent profit fall in the first half. For the year
operating profits were up 17 per cent to Pounds 31.8m and margins rose from
16.5 to 20.1 per cent. The small UK cheque printing company made a loss.
New management at CMB had changed the focus of the business, Mr Jansen said.
However, the stake which is in MB-Caradon's balance sheet at Pounds 335m
contributed only Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 5.7m) in dividend.
The interest charge rose slightly to Pounds 20m (Pounds 19.6m) although the
Pounds 149m rights issue money received in November saved Pounds 2.7m. An
exceptional credit of Pounds 900,000 was the balance of a Pounds 8.9m
insurance claim and an Pounds 8m loss on the sale of the group's loss-making
Austrian boiler business.
The cash flow statement showed a Pounds 3.3m inflow even before the rights
proceeds. There were also Pounds 10m (Pounds 18m) of reorganisation costs
which were set against provisions made at the time of the MB-Caradon merger.
At the year end the balance sheet had net debt of Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 202m)
and shareholders' funds were Pounds 483.2m (Pounds 299.7m).
COMMENT
MB-Caradon's performance to date is hard to fault in broad terms. And there
is every reason to expect continued organic growth and greater efficiency.
So there is the luxury of looking at the longer term strategy. MB-Caradon's
enviable problem is that its substantial investments in non-core businesses
 -the CMB stake and the US security printing company - are sufficiently
interesting to make it a risk to sell and reinvest. But in the end
MB-Caradon must use its undoubted financial strength to expand the core
building products business. Meanwhile, on forecasts of Pounds 135m pre-tax
the prospective p/e of 15.2 shows the market's faith in the group's ability
not to disappoint.

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cornhill incurs Pounds 39.5m loss
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in underwriting losses at Cornhill Insurance pushed the company
into the red last year, writes Richard Lapper.
Cornhill, the UK subsidiary of Allianz, Europe's biggest insurer, reported a
loss before tax of Pounds 39.5m in 1991, compared with a profit of Pounds
30.8m in the previous year.
Nearly half the loss was incurred by the Legal Protection subsidiary which
reported an insurance loss of Pounds 17.9m after increasing premium income
by 4 per cent to Pounds 9.4m.
Overall premiums from general insurance increased by 18 per cent to Pounds
595.2m (Pounds 504.4m) but underwriting losses rose to Pounds 102.1m (Pounds
39.5m). With investment marginally lower at Pounds 65.9m (Pounds 66.1m) the
company reported a general insurance loss of Pounds 37.9m (compared with a
profit of Pounds 26.4m). Life profits were slightly lower at Pounds 3.9m
(Pounds 4m). Associated undertakings produced a loss of Pounds 5.5m (profit
of Pounds 900,000).
The group's solvency margin was down to 39.2 per cent.

currently about 3 per cent - by increasing premium income from motor and

FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 'Miraculous' restructuring of Brent Walker
is finalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 1.65bn financial restructuring of Brent Walker was finalised a
little after 5pm yesterday when the last of several hundred documents
arrived safely at the offices of Hill Samuel, the leisure group's merchant
bank.
Lord Kindersley, Brent Walker chairman, said that the restructuring was
'little short of miraculous against the background of the deepest and
longest recession of post-war history'. He said the company would now work
to re-establish some value for shareholders, although he warned that this
would take a long time to achieve.
Mr Richard Heley, head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, said it was
'outstanding that the patience of the banks has held together in view of the
enormous complexity involved in putting the rescue in place'.
The rescue is the largest in UK corporate history and fees involved are
expected to total nearly Pounds 50m.
It became necessary because Brent Walker's borrowings had far outstripped
its ability to service them. Its troubles became apparent in the autumn
of1990 and a standstill agreement was reached with its banks in November,
with a view to a full restructuring following. Talks on that got under way
in February 1991 but have taken until now to complete.
Today sees the start of trading in new shares being issued as part of the
restructuring. The banks are converting Pounds 250m of the group's loans
into equity, and bond and preference shareholders are also receiving new
shares. The old shares fell 2p to 8 1/2 p yesterday.
In supplementary listing particulars for the share issue, posted over the
weekend, Brent Walker details the claims made against the company by Mr
George Walker, its former chairman and chief executive, who was ousted last
May.
He has claimed Pounds 10.3m in compensation for the loss of office, while
Mrs Jean Walker, his wife and another former director, has claimed Pounds
396,000 and Mr Jason Walker, their son, has claimed Pounds 222,000.
In addition Mr Walker has claimed that Brent Walker agreed to indemnify him
if he was required to meet an indemnity he had given to Lonrho, the
international trading group, which had bought Pounds 5m of a Pounds 101.9m
convertible bond issue. Mr Walker had promised Lonrho that it could sell the
bonds back to him. Brent Walker said it was invest-igating the claim and
'has sought clarification from Mr Walker'.
The document also shows that the Pounds 350m William Hill loan has had its
maturity shortened from December 13 1994 to March 1 1994. This will give
lenders a chance to assess the 1993 results and then see if they want to
refinance the loan.
The group has also found a way round the problem of a Pounds 50m payment due
to Grand Metropolitan, the leisure group, which is the final instalment of
the Pounds 685m purchase price of William Hill. GrandMet, which was an
unsecured creditor, has been given a position in the ranking hierarchy. Of
the total, Pounds 20m is ranked near the top of the cascade, with accrued
interest lower down and the remaining Pounds 30m near the bottom.
Brent Walker now hopes to re-start negotiations with GrandMet over its claim
for a refund of part of the purchase price of William Hill.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Tackling the decline at Taylor Woodrow: Tim Dickson on Peter
Drew's departure from the UK construction group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, the retirement of a 64-year-old company chairman is an
unexceptional piece of news. However, last week's announcement that Mr Peter
Drew was stepping down from the big UK construction group Taylor Woodrow
looks anything but routine.
His departure, officially to pursue his alternative career as a watercolour
painter, comes at the end of a turbulent period in Taylor Woodrow's long
history. It was also embarrassingly close to next month's anxiously awaited
1991 results.
Mr Drew's spell at the top coincided with probably the worst conditions in
the contracting industry for 50 years, the collapse of UK commercial
property prices, and a severe recession in the UK housing market.
Pre-tax profits, which peaked at Pounds 117m in 1989, have almost
disappeared with analysts' best hopes that last year will be just the right
side of break even. The dividend is safe for the moment, but is likely to be
cut next time. The share price, a star performer in the middle to late
1980s, has underperformed the market by 63 per cent and the construction and
housebuilding sector by 34 per cent in the 2 1/4 years since Mr Drew took
the reins.
Last week, amid reports of boardroom acrimony, he paid the price.
One important question for investors is how far the ills of Taylor Woodrow
can be blamed on Mr Drew, and to what extent there is a deeper malaise
within the company. The issue is relevant to whether his successor Mr Colin
Parsons - head of Taylor Woodrow's successful Canadian subsidiary Monarch
Development - will be able to restore the company's former blue chip status.
In many ways Mr Drew was an unlikely company chairman. His love for the
performing arts goes beyond the obligatory hospitality evening at Covent
Garden, and, as his recent exhibition in London demonstrated, he is a
talented painter and sculptor.
He made his name in property by pioneering the development of St Katharine's
Dock near the Tower of London, which gave him the standing to challenge for
the Taylor Woodrow succession when Sir Frank Gibb's original replacement as
chairman, Mr John Topping, decided on doctor's orders not to take on the
task. Ironically, the board is thought to have turned first to Mr Parsons,
but he was not yet ready to come back to the UK from Canada.
Critics accuse Mr Drew of having been unpredictable, of lacking the
necessary grasp of detail, and of having confused the stock market in his
desire to take Taylor Woodrow in new strategic directions.
In this context his ambitions in the leisure field were seen as most
puzzling, particularly the purchase of 5 per cent in the unsuccessful
Daybreak morning TV consortium.
More serious, however, was the hostile purchase by Taylor Woodrow last June
of a near 5 per cent stake in a struggling fellow housebuilder and
contractor, Y J Lovell. Seen as the prelude to a possible bid, the move
turned into a fiasco as Lovell shares collapsed on the back of unexpectedly
large provisions. They are now languishing at 21p, against the 130p-135p per
share Taylor is thought to have paid for its stake.
'This was the first clear sign for me that all was not well at Taylor
Woodrow,' recalls Mr Malcolm Brown, buildings analyst at stockbroker James
Capel. 'An experienced contractor does not make a hostile move on a
competitor without knowing what it might be getting.'
Mr Parsons, a 58-year-old chartered accountant, looks a safe pair of hands
by contrast. Experienced in running a public company in Canada - outside
shareholders own 40 per cent of Monarch - he can be expected to attack
overheads and concentrate the group on its core housebuilding, property,
wholesale trading and contracting activities (though there has been some
speculation about the company's commitment to contracting in the US). There
will be emphasis on the traditional Taylor Woodrow virtues of conservatism
and financial prudence.
The City, however, will not be easily convinced that a new chapter has
begun: there is no obvious end to Taylor Woodrow's trading difficulties, in
spite of the strength of its balance sheet (borrowing as a proportion of
shareholders' funds was not thought to be more than 30 per cent at the last
year-end).
The housebuilding division, which even in a good year sells a mere 1,000
homes, is too small to cash in on any housing uplift. The contracting side
has a tail of unprofitable work. And although the portfolio is understood to
be almost fully let there will have to be more balance sheet writedowns.
More serious, though, are suggestions that Taylor Woodrow's supercharged
performance in the middle to late 1980s masked deeper weaknesses in the
organisation only now coming to light. To many observers there is an inbred
look about the board which made it predictable the directors would again
choose one of their own to try to dig themselves out of the present hole.
Boardroom harmony is likely to be restored - with Mr Parsons throwing his
weight behind the previously eclipsed chief executive Mr Tony Palmer and the
rift with life president and company founder Lord Taylor likely to be
healed.
One day, though, Mr Parsons may find the pressure to bring in more outside
blood irresistible.

FT  31 MAR 92 / BAe's Eustace appointed to Philips board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Dudley Eustace, who leaves his post as finance director of British
Aerospace at the end of the month, will become executive vice-president for
finance and member of the board of Philips, the Dutch electronics group.
The appointment of Mr Eustace, a Briton, underlines the willingness of Mr
Jan Timmer, Philips president, to take steps to take the group back to
greater competitiveness. Although Philips has been looking outside the
Netherlands for senior staff, 'we have not seen it before on the board', the
group said.
Mr Eustace, 55, is resigning from BAe after shareholders criticised
management for leaving them unprepared for the collapse in its profits last
year. A BAe rights issue flopped last autumn.
Mr Eustace initially joins the Dutch group as a member of its Group
Management Committee on June 1. He becomes executive vice-president for
finance from January 1, 1993, succeeding Mr Hank HA Appelo who retires at
the end of the year.
The move appears to be in line with Mr Timmer's Operation Centurion, an
ambitious programme to cut costs, raise profitability and introduce greater
dynamism and market responsiveness into a traditionally bureaucratic
corporate culture.
It represents moves within Philips to bring a greater international
dimension to the group, which has been suffering from difficult trading in
its core consumer electronics markets.
'He was the right man in the right place,' said a Philips spokesman.
Mr Eustace will become the second non-Dutch member of the four-man board. Dr
Frank Carruba, an American, joins the board as executive vice-president of
technology.
Mr Eustace is a chartered accountant and has been finance director of
British Aerospace since 1988.
Philips reported a pre-tax profit of Fl 1.2bn (Pounds 373.3m) in 1991,
compared with a loss of Fl 4.24bn but said 'there is still a long way to
go'. It has a high level of debt and recently offered to buy shares it does
not already own in Super Club, a loss-making video rental business.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Lucas turns to pension fund for help: Engineering group sees
operating profits after interest payments fall to Pounds 200,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATING profits at Lucas Industries, one of the largest of the UK's
international engineering groups, crumbled under the weight of the recession
in the motor and aerospace industries.
Only a distribution from the group's pension fund surplus allowed it,
yesterday, to announce pre-tax profits for the six months to January of
Pounds 90.2m and a maintained interim dividend to shareholders of 2.1p.
But the slide in its market value continued. Lucas shares lost 4.5 per cent
in value last week and yesterday they fell a further 7p to 112p, putting a
tag on the group of less than Pounds 800m.
Dealers were concerned about the possibility of a dividend cut at the end of
the financial year.
'Lucas has not yet seen evidence of an early overall recovery in its
markets,' warned Sir Anthony Gill, chairman. But senior executives said that
although the aerospace markets might not produce much more profit in the
second half than they did in the first, there had been flickerings of life
on the automotive side.
Of the three main divisions in Lucas, only aerospace made a significant
first-half operating profit - Pounds 16.3m. The automotive division made
just Pounds 0.8m and the applied technology division broke even. Demand
slipped away; margins were under continual pressure. In the first half of
1990-91 operating profits were Pounds 68.8m.
This time, after meeting interest payments of Pounds 16.9m, Lucas was left
with Pounds 0.2m of pre-tax profits. But, after two years of talks with
trustees and the obtaining of regulatory approvals, it also had a
contribution of Pounds 90m from the Lucas Pension Fund. This has underpinned
its balance sheet and allowed a payment to shareholders.
Like other engineering groups Lucas has retrenched heavily; 2,000 people
lost their jobs in the first half of this financial year. A further 1,000
will go in the second half. More than 8,000 jobs have disappeared since July
1990, taking the payroll down to below 50,000.
The latest profit figures were held back by more than Pounds 15m spent on
redundancy and reorganisation costs. By the end of the financial year, this
sum will have more than doubled.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tom Frost of National Westminster was not the City's favourite clearing
banker. So one might have expected the bank's share price to rise on news of
his departure. Its fall of nearly 1 per cent yesterday simply serves to
emphasise the difficulties facing the youthful Mr Derek Wanless, Mr Frost's
successor as chief executive.
There is little Mr Wanless can do about the effect of high real interest
rates on customers such as Heron International. However, he is unproven as a
strategist, and some awkward decisions loom, for example over NatWest's US
operation which is now returning to profit. A speedy disposal might give the
impression of leadership. Unfortunately it would also mean selling at the
bottom of the market assets which were originally bought at the top.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's statement from Eurotunnel on the conclusions of the disputes
panel was characteristically robust. But in marking the company's shares
down 33p the market rightly concluded that the latest round in the battle
with Transmanche Link (TML) had gone the contractors' way. The panel
findings, to be sure, are not binding and Sir Alastair Morton can be relied
upon to come up with good reasons why he should not triple the monthly fixed
equipment payments as proposed. In forthcoming negotiations with TML,
though, he will no doubt be conscious that the arbitrator in Brussels will
at least take note of the panel's findings. A capital reconstruction is
still not a certainty, but the odds have once again shortened.

FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape is fashionable these days, so it is worth remembering how recently
the market saw it as a rather uninspired overseas trading company. Its
results for 1991 were a reminder of the group's transformation since the
mid-1980s, not least because they included proceeds from the sale last June
of its Assam tea business. The figures also contradicted the notion that
Inchcape is too reliant on the motor industry and Toyota in particular.
Cash flow after tax and dividends last year of Pounds 115m was strong enough
to bring gearing down to about 20 per cent, well below the level predicted
at last year's rights issue. Growth in the non-motor businesses was
vigorous, with profits up by more than half in services and by nearly a
tenth in marketing. As for Toyota, Inchcape was sensible enough to negotiate
a long-term deal with the manufacturer, so it has plenty of time to reduce
its dependence and has already made significant progress. Once the Tozer
Kemsley &amp; Millbourn acquisition is fully absorbed, only 40 per cent of
vehicle sales will be Toyota cars.
The recent volatility of its shares suggests that some investors have been
tempted to take profits. Inchcape is coming out of recession in far better
shape than it went in, which suggests considerable long-term scope. The
prospective multiple of 12.5 is far from daunting.

FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Allianz/Dresdner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something peculiar about the attempt by Germany's cartel office to
force Allianz to cut its stake in Dresdner Bank. The office's interest in
life insurance is natural, since Europe-wide efforts at liberalisation will
not work without effective competition at national level. But it is hard to
see why the Dresdner Bank stake should be the focus of attack, even though
Allianz may exercise influence on the bank through indirect holdings over
and above its declared interest of 22 per cent. Allianz's complex
relationships within the insurance sector itself ought to be a much more
fruitful avenue of investigation.
That said, the Allianz-Dresdner connection is all the more powerful because
both have wide-ranging investments in German industry. Were the cartel
office to win, it would have created a precedent that could weaken the grip
of the financial sector on the broader economy. Ultimately, that would imply
greater scope for the development of merger and acquisition activity.
Of the two, Dresdner has more to lose. It distributes only a small
proportion of Allianz's products, and its share price will be held back by
uncertainty over the outcome of what could be a protracted affair.
Yesterday's 5 per cent fall in Allianz appeared a more dramatic response
than Dresdner's 2 per cent loss. But this reflected the insurer's current
rights issue, without which the paper would barely have moved at all.

FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Lucas has launched three rights issues in the last six years, it is
just as well that the Seventh Cavalry has now turned up with a Pounds 90m
pension fund surplus. The company has been spared an agonising debate over
whether the dividend should be chopped, or whether precious capital spending
projects should be sacrificed instead. Capital expenditure, it seems, is
likely to be broadly unchanged for the year as a whole, while an 8 per cent
yield on the shares reflects the market's confidence that there will be no
diminution in the payout this time.
One wonders, though, what the year to mid-1993 holds in store. The pension
loophole is unlikely to come to the rescue again, especially if there is a
Labour government. It is always possible that the group's main markets in
cars, civil aircraft and defence will finally come good, but this is what
Lucas was saying a year ago and the damage is now evident in its increased
working capital requirement and underlying rise in balance sheet gearing.
From virtually nothing 18 months ago, this will probably be 40 per cent at
the end of the financial year, close to the limit of what is comfortable.
Investors in the sector face a stark choice between Lucas and T&amp;N on the one
hand - would-be world-beaters but desperately capital-hungry - and the likes
of GKN and BBA which have been ruthlessly running their businesses for cash
in the current recession and eschewing fancy technology. No prizes, of
course, for guessing which variety the stock market prefers. Short-termism
or not, it is worth bearing in mind when assessing their chances that the
combined sales of these four UK companies are equivalent to the automotive
division of Bosch.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Tax high, so is spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D R MYDDELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 1979 the Conservative manifesto said: 'The state takes too much of
the nation's income; its share must be steadily reduced.' Taxes in total
took 45 per cent of national income in 1979; they exceeded 50 per cent
between 1981 and 1986; and the latest estimate for 1991-92 is 47 per cent.
Quoted 'official figures' of around 36 per cent are far too low: they relate
to gross domestic product, not to national income.
The fact is that all three main political parties in Britain are high-tax
parties. Since they are all now high-borrowing parties too, this suggests
that government spending is far too high.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Transport priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID WEEKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Londoners will have been saddened to read of the difficulties of
Olympia &amp; York, the company which has brought to Docklands the magnificent
Canary Wharf project, but the company's involvement in funding the Jubilee
Line should be the least of our worries.
Polls carried out by Mori have shown that the top priority of eight out of
10 Londoners is making improvements to the existing services such as new
rolling stock, new signalling and better stations on lines, such as the
Central and Northern line stations.
As one would expect, the customers have got it right. In Westminster and the
City of London we have 170m square feet of offices and a workforce of around
1m people. What is more, we have most of the capital's tourist attractions
and half the hotel bed spaces. Let us concentrate on getting a modern,
reliable underground system for today's workers, residents and visitors.
I note that John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, thinks that this
delay in O &amp; Y's Pounds 40m contribution to the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line
project shows that 'determining transport priorities on the basis of
development case was folly'. It was not. The slower than expected take-up of
the 5m square feet of Canary Wharf offices means the Jubilee Line will not
be needed so soon. Bringing in the private sector has meant the government
programme is forced to take into account market needs. So much the better,
say I.
London Transport's lethargic response to the problems of today is what
should concern us, rather than any delay in Olympia &amp; York's contribution to
the Jubilee Line project. Railways to Docklands can wait while existing
problems in central London are sorted out.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Integration on the buses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From T P F MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins's article about bus deregulation in Merthyr Tydfil
('Bus competition fails the road test', March 27) is full of omens for
deregulation in London. London buses are already suffering from the
fragmentation of a once good integrated system.
London needs to: integrate buses, tubes, trains and taxis; revert to two-man
crews on double-deckers, using updated Routemasters (slightly smaller and
more reliable than other buses, and with open access platforms, these would
increase average speeds and reduce the congestion caused by the buses
themselves); confine one-man operation to small nimble local buses; and
review the route structure to bring it in line with modern movement needs.
To do this, London needs a single authority with control over the entire
infrastructure and with powers to raise the necessary finances.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Entertaining energy manifestos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL STOPPARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The claims and promises on energy policy made by the main parties in
their manifestos are - to put it charitably - entertaining.
The Conservatives credit record expansion in the North Sea to 'low
taxation'. But the present marginal rate of taxation on crude oil production
in the North Sea stands at 85 per cent. Furthermore, they sing the virtues
of deregulation but expect to give ever-increasing powers to 'independent
regulators' such as Ofgas.
The Labour party recognises the need to cut C0 emissions to counter the
greenhouse effect, but promises to secure the future of the coal industry in
preference to gas. Coal is of course the principal source of C0 emissions,
whereas gas is widely accepted as clean, efficient, plentiful and
increasingly economic.
Liberal Democrats face a dilemma with a commitment to discourage private car
use, since much of their support comes from rural communities dependent on
cars. Petrol price increases will be introduced to discourage cars but
'compensation schemes' will soften the blow. They also propose 'measures to
help isolated communities'. Could this amount to a national petrol tax with
Liberal constituencies excluded?
All parties are at least agreed on one point: the newly-elected prime
minister will enjoy a holiday in Rio this June attending the Earth Summit at
the taxpayers' expense.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Better ways to judge schools effectiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professors HARVEY GOLDSTEIN &amp; DESMOND NUTTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, a central feature of the present government's education policy is its
commitment to publishing average test and examination results school by
school, leading to the production of 'league tables'. The education
secretary, Kenneth Clarke, argues that such information is of value to
parents and others for assessing the effectiveness of any particular school.
He also maintains that adjustments to results in order to take account of
'intake' achievement obscures the reality of the figures.
We find it difficult to understand how Mr Clarke can persistently ignore the
evidence from research around the world, including some funded by the
Department of Education and Science itself, which demonstrates the inequity
and the misleading nature of such league tables.
Because schools differ in terms of the intake achievements of their
children, it is quite possible for an extremely effective school to have
relatively low test results simply because it has a low achieving intake.
Conversely, another school might achieve good results but in reality be
quite ineffective in promoting the learning of its children who happen to
have a high intake achievement. In this way true excellence may be missed
and complacency rewarded.
It seems to us that the present policy is in nobody's real interest, least
of all that of parents. Furthermore, as the DES has recently acknowledged,
there are better ways of attempting to judge the effectiveness of schools,
using so-called 'value added' approaches. These approaches are by no means
definitive and need to be handled with care, especially in terms of any
public comparisons, but they are certainly a great improvement on the crude
league tables currently proposed.
Whoever forms the next government should re-examine carefully this whole
issue.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A green target for Mr Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The temperature of EC-US relations has been rising recently over -
appropriately - the issue of global warming. The EC environment
commissioner, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, has criticised President George Bush
for his refusal to commit the US to targets for reducing emissions of
harmful gases which contribute to the greenhouse effect. Mr Bush, for his
part, says he does not intend to support unrealistic environmental plans
which could cost American jobs.
It is easy to see why this bout of tension has arisen. Both men are highly
exposed politically just now. Mr Ripa di Meana has staked out an ambitious
green position in advance of the Earth Summit in Rio in June for which he
needs to cultivate more political support, not least among the EC's own
members. Ideally, he would like to be able to go to Rio brandishing an EC
plan to attack carbon dioxide emissions with powerful weapons like a tax on
energy and carbon. But a number of EC states have reservations about these
ideas, and would certainly not agree to them unless they were sure their
main non-EC trade competitors would follow suit.
Mr Bush is at the height of an election campaign which has shown that the
state of the US economy is a more prominent issue in voters' minds than
greenery. As in many industrialised countries, recession has toppled the
environment from its high place on the political agenda - so much so that Mr
Bush is not even prepared to commit himself to attending the Rio summit, let
alone subscribe to its outcome.
Better track
But if both men are guilty of taking a short-term view, Mr Ripa di Meana is
on a better track. He has secured agreement, however tenuous, from the
majority of EC states to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to 1990
levels by the year 2000 - all, that is, except the UK which has set a target
date of 2005. The means by which he intends to achieve this may still be
open to doubt: indeed without a carbon tax he would fall far short of his
target. But at least the plan carries a commitment against which progress
can be measured.
The US - which emits proportionately far more carbon dioxide than the EC -
has only produced an open-ended commitment to reduce emission levels. The
administration argues that it is more important to establish the means
before committing itself to targets. But the means created so far do not
amount to very much, and are certainly not backed by any credible commitment
from the White House. Indeed, so long as Mr Bush remains aloof from the Rio
process, it will be impossible for the rest of the world to believe that the
US has any serious interest in tackling environmental questions.
Modest proposal
His political opponents have tried to stir the issue - so far without much
success. Mr Bill Clinton, the leading Democratic contender, has a modest
proposal to raise gasoline taxes, and there are moves in the House of
Representatives to force the Administration to set carbon dioxide emission
targets.
But there needs to be closer US-EC understanding for other reasons. The Rio
summit is likely to be a grand bargaining session between the rich countries
of the north and the poor ones of the south over who is to be responsible
for safeguarding the environment. The rich countries have the money to do
it, but they should also be setting an example. A failure among the major
industrial nations to agree on the seriousness of the threat posed by carbon
dioxide and global warming would rule out any likelihood of progress on
these issues in Rio.
There will be further talks in the coming weeks at which Rio participants,
including the EC and the US, will try to conclude an international agreement
on climate change for presentation at Rio. It has to be said, however, that
the chances of narrowing the transatlantic gap do not look very strong.
Unless Mr Bush's political opponents step up the attack on his environmental
record and force him to respond, he has no reason to change his position.
This, in turn, will give no encouragement to the more faint-hearted in the
EC. Rio will achieve very little if Mr Bush does not attend with some firm
targets in his pocket.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Babes in the woods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is good news for the Conservatives this morning. They have not begun
to show signs of cracking under the strain. Better yet, they are managing to
keep their spirits up. They have taken the disappointments of the first
weeks of the campaign on the chin, straightened themselves out and resolved
to keep fighting. Some deride the image of the prime minister taking his
portable soapbox out to the crowds, but he is to be admired for trying to
get into the thick of it.
Tory supporters may take courage from this. The government has a case to
make. I will elaborate on what it might be in a moment, but first consider
the essential selling point, the one they privately intimated yesterday
would be tried this week. It is admittedly a last-ditch argument, but it may
nevertheless have some effect. It is quite simple: who do you trust to get
us out of the recession - the Conservatives or Labour? Such a line could be
persuasive, if it was exploited by people who knew how to sell a political
party.
You could, however, put this same question in another way. The government
has good reason to know what kind of a mess the economy is in. It could
admit its errors, then assert that because it understands what went wrong it
should be the one to save us. I can see the posters now. A huge ship is
sinking, its prow just above the waves. Below it would run the punchline, in
wavy black letters: 'Would you change crews just when you were heading for
the iceberg?' It might capture the floating vote.
Perhaps we had better think it through again. One case for supporting the
Conservatives is that should there eventually be a resumption of economic
growth they are likely to return some of the national dividend to payers of
income tax. Mr John Major promised as much in a confident press conference
performance yesterday morning. It was marred by the irrepressible honesty of
Mr Norman Lamont, who let slip that there would be little room for
reductions in taxation for the lifetime of the next parliament. Still, I can
offer them a poster. A huge hand reaches into a purse, taking out 20 per
cent, 25 per cent, or 40 per cent of its contents. 'After the election after
next, we may take less,' reads the slogan, 'But we can't promise . . .'
No? Let us try another tack. A subsidiary case for voting Conservative is
that the government's policies on education and health are better than
Labour's. This is especially true of health. The government's reforms of the
NHS are not flawless, but they do constitute a serious attempt to get some
structure into its administration. The Labour party appears to reject all
that, thus casting doubt on its protestations that it has been converted to
an abiding faith in fiscal discipline.
Unfortunately for the Tories, most people do not concern themselves about
this. They still prefer Labour as potential mentor of the NHS. Just mention
those three little letters and the polls turn away from the Tories. The
correct Conservative poster on health, therefore, is a blank hoarding. Just
stick eight white sheets up and leave them there. It might puzzle some
passers-by, but it would be more beneficial to Mr Major's campaign than
anything that mentioned the health service, in any context.
All right then, let us make a final attempt. Labour could be portrayed as
hugely profligate, which in aspiration it certainly is. The trouble with
this is that you have to make hyperbole credible. The existing Tory campaign
literature - 'Labour's tax bombshell' - tells us that Labour's manifesto
promises would cost the average taxpayer Pounds 1,250 a year, or Pounds 25 a
week. This lacks verisimilitude. It sounds like what it is: an argument from
extremes. I would have preferred a dripping tap. The steady drip-drip of the
opposition's undertakings and hostages to fortune is disquieting, in spite
of the care taken to present every commitment as carefully costed.
You will see why I have not been offered the job of designing Conservative
advertising. There is, however, one thing that any creative consultant could
tell them before sitting down to lunch. It is: get a line and stick to it.
Do not confuse people with a variety of messages. If it is not to be a
blanket use of 'you can't trust Labour', on the ground that people react
badly to negative slogans, then it surely has to be something along the
lines of 'The recovery is coming - the Conservative recovery.'
Mr Major finds this a hard sell because both he and his chancellor made the
same prediction in vain last year. Their optimism was premature. People will
need to feel the upturn before they believe it. It is no good putting up a
poster whose line is 'the way ahead,' if it depicts the chancellor cutting a
path through the undergrowth - even if he is in boy scout uniform and has
tied a piece of string to the tree stump behind him. But the prime minister
is not dispirited. He keeps his eye on the next step. There must be a way
out somewhere.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: Elektra - Opera at the New York Met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strauss's Elektra is the last new production of the Met season. Like
Tannhauser, the Ring, and Parsifal, it is produced by Otto Schenk and
conducted by James Levine. It is designed by Jurgen Rose, who did the Salome
not long ago.
Rose is a designer adept in many manners. Here he has provided a monochrome
roofed courtyard, spanning the Met's width and height, where light shafts in
from a tall slot in the right wall and is otherwise supplied by follow-spots
switched on to each principal as she or he enters. Dramatic light is an
operatic element to which the Met, wedded to its house man, Gil Wechsler,
accords little attention.
Steps rise steeply to a giant double door in the palace facade, which gives
on to a diagonal inner staircase. Mycenae has evidently been shaken by an
earthquake: although the main walls stand square, the steps and a terrace to
the right of them are out of true, and the left side is filled with a huge,
shattered bronze of a horse, lying on its side. This horse serves as a
symbol of Agamemnon; Electra addresses it often, spreadeagles Chrysothemis
across it while exhorting her, scrabbles for the axe within it, and caresses
a fetlock while remembering her father. For the rest, Schenk's production is
as conventional and drab as his Ring: individual singers have to light it.
Hildegard Behrens, in the title role, did so. When she began, there was so
heavy a beat in her voice and so strenuous a shift between registers that
one feared she might not last out the evening. But she did. Sheer will,
feeling, instinct, fire impelled a strong voice shattered by years of strain
into a thrilling performance. She was still able to pull out shining high
notes, telling chest tones, an eloquent middle. And she felt and made much
of every phrase of the role.
In a little black dress (Chanel would have been proud), she looked tall,
slender, and young - exciting. There was not much else to admire. Deborah
Voigt, the Chrysothemis, was a heavily draped mountainous pudding, her main
merit an ability to scream out high notes shiningly on pitch, excellently
audible above Levine's loud orchestra.
Leonie Rysanek, on the other hand, effortfully banged out Clytemnestra's
music, hammily, on pitches so approximate that they were embarrassing. Bernd
Weikl, a portly Orestes, stood and delivered, and managed by his physical
ineptitude to kill the excitement that Miss Behrens - alive, alert,
climactic, responsive to the score - was striving to creating at the
Electra-Orestes encounter. James King was a dull, routine Aegistheus.
But by the first-night audience the show was cheered to the skies. It is
hard to know what Levine, the artistic head of the Met, really wants. A
cheering (if undiscriminating) public? He got that. A spin-off recording and
video? They are presumably in the works. Orchestral playing of uncommon
excellence and beauty? He got that too, and the orchestral sound was the
main reward of the evening - whenever one removed attention from the stage
(where, as Wagner insisted, operas happen) and listened with averted eyes.
But if one then listened to the whole score - voices and players at once -
Levine seemed to be an undramatic, untheatrical, unoperatic conductor:
unresponsive to his particular cast as he encouraged his brasses to blare
and his drums to crash and drown them; sluggish in his self-indulgent,
loving enactment of Strauss's score; vulgar in his stressing of the obvious.
He is a puzzle. His Met is a puzzle. One does not hear operas better played
than they are when he conducts them. But oh] How dreary, how pointless, how
dated, how unimportant to New York life throbbing all around this all-star
Elektra - apart from the telling, electric Miss Behrens - did seem.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: Moonshine - Abbey Theatre, Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waterford's Red Kettle Theatre Company has replaced Galway's Druid Theatre
as the provincial company to watch in Ireland. Red Kettle has the advantage
of an interesting young playwright, Jim Nolan, among its number.
Nolan's Moonshine, ably directed by Ben Barnes, makes the transition from
Waterford's smaller, more intimate theatre to the vast open spaces of the
Abbey with apparent ease.
The cast at first appears to have escaped from the pages of a William Trevor
story: McKeever, an incompetent and mildly-batty undertaker obsessed with
amateur dramatics; his assistant Michael, the inevitable half-wit; the Rev
Langton, a Church of Ireland rector who has lost both his congregation and
his faith. Add a sexy schoolgirl, a greasy, foul-mouthed gravedigger,and the
trim rector's daughter, Lizzie, returning after a five-year absence to see
her dying mother, and you would seem to have the formula for a predictable,
tragi-comic exploration of small-town life.
But this is to reckon without McKeever's extraordinary determination to
present A Midsummer Night's Dream, although his cast, like Rev Langton's
congregation, keep diminishing and is now reduced to four, including
himself.
Then there is the revelation that Lizzie left home at 17 because of an
unhappy affair with the balding, middle-aged undertaker. Gradually the
characters reveal themselves as deeper and more complicated than their
appearance would suggest.
Given the fact that McKeever is an undertaker, and the setting is a disused
Church of Ireland, it is small wonder that the jokes are not particularly
subtle, descending even to a running commentary during an on-stage embalming
session.
There are better jokes, chiefly those of another playwright, during the
rehearsals of the Pyramus and Thisbe scene from the Dream, an interval
presented by 'rude mechanicals just like us', as the cast keep reminding
themselves.
At the climax of the play, when Rev Langton breaks down during his last
sermon, Michael, with supreme intuition, introduces the Pyramus and Thisbe
scene into Mrs Langton's funeral service. Religion and theatre become
inter-changeable sources of relief from the tedium of everyday life - the
'Moonshine'.
On the strength of this play, Jim Nolan is a competent writer rather than a
brilliant one. He cannot resist the easy laughs, but he compensates for this
by achieving, occasionally, moments of high mayhem. His women are the least
developed characters, and have the flattest lines. For enigmatic Lizzie to
greet her lover after a five-year with 'long time no see' is just not good
enough.
While Tom Hickey gives a fine performance as the frenetic McKeever, Frank
McCusker's amazingly touching and dignified village idiot steals the show.
At first he seems merely stupid, then dangerously vulnerable, and,
ultimately, like all the best fools, the only wise one among us. His
performance will be remembered long after the undertaking jokes are
forgotten.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Raincock, one of the pioneers of legal expenses insurance in the UK,
is planning a new venture to sell the product overseas after severing his
ties with The Legal Protection Group last month.
A former naval captain, Raincock, now 52, founded LPG in 1977 and built up
the company during the 1980s before selling out to Sun Alliance in December
1988. LPG was the first insurance company to offer policyholders a 24-hour
helpline, backing up its range of personal and commercial legal expenses and
professional indemnity policies.
But there the story turns sour. Raincock crossed swords with Sun Alliance
senior management about the pace of the subsidiary's development.
Matters came to a head in January when Sun Alliance closed all five of LPG's
regional sales offices and made 57 of its 400 staff redundant after the
company failed to make a profit in 1991. Raincock lost his job as managing
director and resigned from the company last month. He says he is still
bullish about the prospects for legal expenses and other niche products and
is looking for backers who will promote the product abroad.

Maurice Dwek, the dominating presence at the struggling retail jewellers
Owen &amp; Robinson, is relinquishing his role as chief executive after coming
under pressure from institutional shareholders to appoint outside directors
with strong retail experience.
His position is to be filled by Alan Gaynor (right), who over the past 20
years has worked for various retailing companies including Asda, Do It All,
and the Underwood chemists chain.
Michael Smith, who spent 11 years at Laura Ashley, latterly as acting chief
executive, has also been appointed to the O&amp;R board as finance director.
The incoming pair will face a tough task restoring the company's fortunes.
O&amp;R ran into financial problems last year as a result of a disastrous foray
into the property market and issued a profits warning in January after the
jewellery sector endured a poor Christmas.
But Gaynor, who has spent the past 15 months developing 'pay and play'
public golf courses for Carlton Golf, a company he helped to found, believes
O&amp;R has the potential to recover strongly. He suggests much more can be done
to market the company's 60-store chain of Gold Centres effectively. 'People
see it is a local jeweller, not a national chain,' he says.
Dwek remains as chairman of O&amp;R. Tom Forsyth, the current finance director,

FT  31 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Admitted conduct loses Spens costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGINA v SPENS
Southwark Crown Court:
Mr Justice Henry:
March 13 1992
A PROSECUTION decision in the public interest and with court approval to
offer no evidence against the accused despite having sufficient evidence to
proceed, does not compel a not-guilty verdict, and the court has an
unfettered discretion to record such a verdict or to stay proceedings
permanently. And where the proceedings are stayed so that the accused is
never tried to a verdict, the court may examine his admitted conduct to
ascertain whether there is a positive reason for refusing to pay his costs
out of public funds in that he brought the prosecution on himself.
Mr Justice Henry so held when (1) refusing an application by Patrick Michael
Rex Spens for a not guilty verdict following discharge of the jury in fraud
proceedings against him and his co-defendant, Roger Seelig, arising out of
the Guinness takeover of Distillers group; (2) refusing his application for
a costs order; and (3) granting his application for remission of his Pounds
100,000 legal aid contribution.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Mr Seelig's mental health had broken down under the
strain of conducting his own defence.
The court had discharged the jury from giving verdicts in respect of him and
Lord Spens. Because of Mr Seelig's impact on the trial it would not have
been right to continue as against Lord Spens alone.
On a nolle prosequi direction by the Attorney General, the proceedings
against Mr Seelig were stayed without a verdict being given.
Lord Spens was in a different position. Nothing in the state of his health
prevented him standing trial again in front of a second jury. The director
of the Serious Fraud Office had stated that there was sufficient evidence to
proceed against him, but she decided the public interest did not require him
to undergo a second trial.
She offered no evidence against him.
Lord Spens now applied for a not-guilty verdict.
Section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 provided that where the
prosecution proposed to offer no evidence the court 'may if it thinks fit,
order that a verdict of not guilty shall be recorded'.
Where there was insufficient evidence for the Crown to proceed, the usual
practice was to direct that a not-guilty verdict be recorded.
But that was not this case. Here there was sufficient evidence.
Mr Hood for Lord Spens submitted that where the prosecution offered no
evidence for whatever reason and the court expressed approval, as it had
here, there was no jurisdiction under section 17 to do anything other than
enter a not-guilty verdict.
That was not accepted.
As Parliament had given a discretion whether or not to order a not-guilty
verdict when the prosecution offered no evidence, it was implicit that there
was a sensible alternative to that course.
The alternative was to order that the indictment should lie on the file,
marked not to be proceeded with. Such an order amounted to a permanent stay.
On the strength of the authorities there was an unfettered discretion under
section 17.
If the court were to order a permanent stay, it would leave Lord Spens in
the same position as Mr Seelig.
There was no injustice in that. In each man's case, for different reasons, a
decision had been taken that it would be unfair to proceed further against
him. Neither would ever be tried to a verdict.
In those circumstances, it was not right to order a not-guilty verdict in
respect of Lord Spens.
The court should grant a permanent stay by ordering the indictment to lie on
the file. That was to treat Lord Spens in the same way as Mr Seelig.
Such an order reflected the reality of what had happened.
Lord Spens's second application was for a defendant's costs order under
section 16(2)(a) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.
Lord Spens had been in receipt of legal aid since December 4 1990.
The costs he might recover out of central funds under section 16 did not
include expenses incurred on his behalf by the Legal Aid Board or his
contribution to the Board. It did include expenses reasonably incurred by
him personally in his defence.
Under the section the court's power to make an order lay because Lord Spens
had not been tried to a verdict. The section gave an unfettered discretion.
Such an order should normally be made 'unless there are positive reasons for
not doing so' (Practice Direction, May 3 1991). Examples of such reasons
were: 'The defendant's own conduct has brought suspicion on himself or has
misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him is stronger
than it is.'
In examining whether a defendant's conduct amounted to positive reason to
deny him costs, the court was not restricted to conduct falling precisely
within the words of the example. It must examine his conduct and decide in
all the circumstances whether it amounted to a positive reason.
In considering Lord Spens's conduct the court based its decision on his
account of it, given to Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) inspectors
who interviewed him on December 16 1986 and March 17 1987.
The court was entitled to act on what he said on oath to the DTI inspectors,
and should act on it, because it had to decide whether public money should
be paid to Lord Spens. It was not going outside what he said on oath to the
inspectors.
The question was whether Lord Spens's admitted conduct amounted to a
positive reason for denying him his costs out of public funds.
Lord Spens was a merchant banker specialising in corporate finance. He was
bound to conduct himself in accordance with the City Code on Takeovers and
Mergers.
Under general principle 6 of the code, Lord Spens was obliged to use every
endeavour to prevent the creation of a false market. He had a professional
duty to consult the Takeover Panel on all doubtful questions.
On the Guinness bid for Distillers Lord Spens was faced with an unusual
proposition about indemnity-backed share purchasers, beyond his immediate
experience and about which he knew there were two schools of thought. He
chose not to consult. The potential for a false market was there for all to
see. He took no stance to avoid it. Had he consulted the panel he would have
been told to have nothing to do with the transaction. He would therefore not
have been prosecuted.
By his conduct he brought prosecution on himself.
It would be wrong to use public funds to protect him from the consequences
of that fact.
That was a positive reason for denying him defendant's costs. The
application was refused.
Lord Spens's last application was for remission of his legal aid
contribution.
At the commencement of the preparatory hearings he was acting in person, as
was Mr Seelig. The court urged him and Mr Seelig to apply for legal aid.
There was a strong public interest in a defendant's being legally
represented in long trials. With both defendants competently represented the
trial would have concluded within three or four months rather than the
threatened year.
In exercising its discretion the court could approach the matter in the way
that reflected the public interest.
It could look at his financial position today, rather than 15 months ago
when the matter was assessed. In taking account of his position today, it
must have regard to the fact that it was not making a defendant's costs
order and that he therefore had liabilities to pre-legal aid lawyers.
Also the court must be satisfied that he was in a position to contribute.
On the figures before it, the court was satisfied that Lord Spens's
financial position was not such as would enable him to pay legal aid
contribution.
The right order in all the circumstances, having regard to his overall
liabilities, was to remit his entire contribution.
For the Crown: Elizabeth Gloster QC and Richard Horwell (Serious Fraud
Office).
For Lord Spens: David Hood and Simon Stafford-Michael (Garstangs, Bolton).

FT  31 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The doctors' dilemma -
John Willman takes the pulse of the changing UK general practitioner service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 600 small businesses, the outcome of the UK general election will be of
particular interest. They are family doctor practices which have been - or
from 1 April will become - GP fundholders, each controlling a health service
budget in excess of Pounds 1m a year.
If Labour wins the election, fundholding will be abolished, bringing to an
end an experiment which has been opposed by the majority of Britain's family
doctors. If the Conservatives win, many more practices are likely to opt for
fundholding, in the belief that fundholders will be treated more favourably
when it comes to handing out money.
For the eight GPs who belong to Dr Ian Wild's partnership based at the St
John's health centre in Twickenham, south-west London, fundholding has been
an opportunity to improve the quality of treatment for its 14,000 patients.
The 'Wild Bunch', as they are known locally, control a budget of more than
Pounds 1.6m to buy a range of diagnostic services and treatments on behalf
of their patients.
They can therefore shop around the half dozen hospitals in the area for the
shortest waiting lists on behalf of their patients - unlike non-fundholding
GPs who must normally refer patients to hospitals commissioned by the
district health authority (DHA) which pays the bill.
'We saw fundholding as a way of tackling the growing waiting lists in this
area,' says Mansukh Unadkat, the partner with responsibility for
fundholding. 'It can take six to eight months just to see a consultant for
an opinion and we felt that as fundholders, we could choose the hospitals
which offered more to the patients.
'Information about costs and waiting times is held on computer so that it
takes only a couple of minutes to choose a hospital for an operation. It
gives us tremendous flexibility, and is already producing benefits for the
patients in faster treatment.'
But GP fundholding offers much more than sophisticated shopping around for
the fastest operation, according to a study published last month by the
King's Fund Institute, the respected health service think-tank.* It found
that fundholders were using their market power to change and improve the
services to patients.
Wild and his partners, for example, have negotiated for surgeons and
consultants to leave their hospitals and provide consultations and treatment
at the health centre. A monthly ophthalmology clinic has been arranged and
patients can also see specialists in cardiology, ENT (ear, nose and throat),
gynaecology and urology without travelling to a hospital.
A surgeon performs minor operations at the centre, including the treatment
of varicose veins, removal of lumps and other procedures which do not
require an overnight stay. In the longer term, the practice is considering
providing some overnight beds and therapy facilities at the health centre -
ironically, a converted former cottage hospital.
'Not only does this cost less than booking appointments at a hospital, it
reduces the waiting times significantly,' says Unadkat.
Being a fundholder inevitably involves more paperwork and administration.
Though it does not actually handle the fund, the practice must provide the
regional health authority with information on contracts and referrals
necessary for the hospitals to be paid. Grants are given to ensure that
fundholders have adequate computer systems, and specially-written software
has been approved by the Department of Health to handle the accounting.
Help with the cost of business planning is also available from the
Department of Trade and Industry. The Wild partnership used the consultants
McIntyre Hudson to help in drawing up the business plan required to win
fundholding status.
The practice has also been able to employ a part-time business manager,
Peter Dean, with the allowance payable to fundholders to cover the cost of
administration. A retired bank manager, he brings experience of dealing with
a wide variety of small businesses which has been invaluable in getting the
new systems up and running.
Dean is also an enthusiast for fundholding: 'Doctors have never had to have
much of a hand on the cheque book, apart from handling their own money and
expenditure in the practice. Fundholding has brought home the cost of
treatment and given them the incentive to provide better value for money and
improve the service.'
He expects to show a small surplus on the first year which can be ploughed
back into the practice under the fundholding rules - it will be used to buy
more equipment for minor surgery. The only drawback is that the regional
health authority is trying to reduce the budget for next year.
'The region felt that they had overestimated costs in some areas during the
first year of running the scheme,' Dean says. 'Although we are still
discussing the budget, it is likely to be tighter next year than this.'
Rejecting fundholding for the present are the five doctors in the practice
of Marc Rowland and partners which is based at the Jenner health centre in
Forest Hill, south east London. They are no less keen to improve the quality
of health service for their patients, but want to achieve this by increasing
co-operation between different health agencies.
'The health service is a very fragmented service,' says Rowland. 'We want to
work more closely with dentists, health visitors, district nurses,
chiropodists, as well as housing agencies, social services and voluntary
groups, to become the local focus for dealing with the health needs of our
area.
'If someone comes to see us with stomach pains, there's no point in sending
them to a gastroenterologist to have tubes stuck in every orifice and X-rays
shone through them if the cause is their marriage breaking up or bad
housing.'
Rowland believes that becoming a fundholder would make it harder to develop
the relationships with other local agencies which the practice is trying to
foster. And he worries about the loss of integration in a health service
where hospitals increasingly compete for business. Rather than the more
competitive approach which fundholding implies, he is keen to work with
other family doctors in the area to develop 'locality commissioning'.
'If we and other practices in the area expressed our preferences for
hospitals and other providers, the commissioning authority would have to
give good reasons for ignoring us. Locality commissioning would give us the
same clout as fundholders enjoy, without the bureaucracy and paperwork.'
Rowland admits that this more consensual approach to change is inevitably
slower: 'It is very hard work to get progress on such radical ideas.'
But the practice has usually been able to get what it wanted even if it has
taken a long time. 'Our approach avoids trampling over local relationships
with other agencies which we've worked hard over the years to foster,' he
says.
He accepts that fundholding could offer a short cut round the lengthy
process of building consensus. And he does not rule out fundholding if the
election result suggests that it is here to stay. But for the moment, he and
his partners prefer to pursue their alternative approach to raising the
standard of health care.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Management: Innovators smart from a lack of funds - The
Growing Business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's main programme for supporting innovative small businesses,
the Small Firms Merit Awards for Research and Technology (Smart), should be
increased so that more eligible projects can be funded. The awards should
also be made available twice instead of only once a year.
These are the main recommendations of a study* by two Cambridge University
researchers. The Smart scheme funded 180 companies in 1991 but more
companies deserve backing if the money were available, according to Ian
Moore and Elizabeth Garnsey.
Smart is an annual award which provides funds for companies employing fewer
than 50 people which have an innovative and commercially viable project. It
meets 75 per cent of the costs up to Pounds 45,000, with a second stage
award of up to Pounds 60,000 for further development.
At present, large numbers of companies apply for Smart - 1,422 companies for
just 180 awards in 1991 - resulting in a heavy burden on management time
with only a small prospect of success.
Very few of the projects backed by Smart money would have gone ahead on
their own, the researchers concluded. But since technology is so fast
moving, very few firms are able to wait a year before applying again for a
Smart award. This problem could be overcome by making the awards more
frequently.
The Smart scheme plays an important role in giving credibility to a project.
Businesses which had been unable to raise finance before winning an award
frequently received several offers once they were successful. However,
businesses which applied and were unsuccessful were sometimes seen as having
been judged as not being up to standard.
'We therefore recommend an expansion of the scheme so that the relative
scarcity value is eliminated and so that all viable proposals are funded,'
the researchers said.
In a second research study** Moore and Garnsey called for the government to
rethink its other innovation programmes which emphasise collaborative,
'pre-competitive' research.
The government's approach shows a failure to understand the process of
innovation, they argue. It is often only obvious in retrospect that research
is pre-competitive and it is not clear whether time or the nature of the
activity defines 'closeness to market'.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Technology: Wasting time over recycling - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The packaging industry believes it is grievously misunderstood. At a
Financial Times conference on the subject last week several speakers claimed
that many desirable facets of packaging are frequently overlooked amid the
debate about its impact on the environment.
Packaging acts as an efficient means of transporting and preserving goods,
as a way of ensuring food safety and hygiene and as a method of advertising
a product, they say.
Good packaging saves more than it wastes. The squandering of resources in
many third world countries and the former Soviet Union suggests there should
be more packaging in the world, not less.
'Waste is much more than just a landfill, or a bin in a household,' argues
Hans Rausing, chairman and chief executive of Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval Group. If
a child's brain is wasted through lack of milk, is this not also waste, he
asks.
The industry has a point.
In the grand scheme of things, packaging waste represents only a small
environmental problem but assumes a disproportionate amount of attention
because of its connotations with a throw-away society.
And in framing European legislation on packaging waste, national legislators
have adopted narrow definitions of waste which concentrate on recyclability
to the exclusion of other environmental factors such as the energy used to
recycle them.
But complaining about all this is rather like a football team moaning about
losing one-nil after extra time while worse teams have escaped with draws.
It is the result that counts. If consumers and politicians believe that
packaging represents a big problem then it does. 'Perception is reality,' as
one speaker noted.
With some commendable exceptions, packaging companies have generally reacted
to the environmental challenge with the vision of proverbial ostriches
burying their heads in the sand.
Those companies which have responded tend to view the process as a marketing
exercise rather than as a means of changing the way they operate. Sweeping
environmental claims have been made and subsequently regretted.
Different factions of the packaging industry have also indulged in an
unhealthy internal debate pitting one sector against another. Plastics,
glass, metals and paper packaging associations have all extolled the virtues
of their own products while rubbishing those of others. There has been
little attempt to co-ordinate an industry-wide approach.
Equally, environmental pressure groups are in danger of losing faith with
consumers by pressing governments to adopt policies that are of obvious
political appeal but of dubious environmental benefit.
In particular, the German recycling scheme, the Duales System Deutschland,
which encourages industry to recover and recycle its packages, has aroused
the ire of many in the European packaging industry. One speaker condemned it
as 'absolute lunacy'. Another criticised it as a 'pilot scheme involving 79m
people'.
There is justification in many of their criticisms. Although the DSD may
help solve the landfill problem there are grave concerns about its total
environmental effect.
As Jonathan Sims of packaging consultants RMA said: 'More resources are
being spent transporting waste packaging around Germany, sorting it,
recycling it, warehousing it and dumping it on other markets, than are being
saved. Repeat this on a European scale and in the name of environmental
benefit we will be committing environmental vandalism.'
It is perhaps now time for both the packaging industry and the environmental
campaigners to drop their antagonisms and work closely together to create
more sensible technical solutions to the problems.
At present, both sides are in danger of losing their credibility. And in the
environmental debate credibility is all.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Technology: MIT put in the picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT has signed an agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Media Lab to research ways in which computers handle visual images. The
agreement could earn MIT Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 290,000) a year for the
next five years.
This is the first agreement with a non-British university under BT's
Strategic University Research Programme. Launched last year, the programme
accounted for about half of the Pounds 3m that BT spent on university
research last year.
Under the agreement, MIT will develop tools that computers can use to 'see'
and 'understand' images. The aim is to develop software systems that allow
users to search databases of pictures on the basis of their visual content
rather than written descriptions of what the images depict.
As Alex Pentland, of MIT's vision and modelling group, puts it: 'Everything
we have done with computers up to this point has been based on letters and
numbers. This next step is to teach computers to understand what they see
based on visual content rather than textual information.'
Such a system might allow users to 'show' a photograph of someone to a
computer and then ask it to retrieve all images that show the same person.
The research fits in with BT's aim to develop visual telecommunications. The
company has its own research team working on video communications, but this
deals with more immediate problems, such as how to transmit telephone
pictures. Earlier this month, BT announced that it plans to introduce a
commercial videophone in the near future.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Technology: BT ups the ante - Nuala Moran explains how to
fight bugs with bugs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT is turning entomologist as it searches for a new software strategy to
manage its network.
Scientists in the advanced systems group at the company's Martlesham
Research Laboratories near Ipswich are using ant colonies as a bizarre model
of how to keep its network up and running at all times, cutting out the
costly equipment duplication which is currently needed to prevent loss of
service in the event of failure.
Peter Cochrane, who is heading the software project, first had the idea as
he observed the teeming life of an ant hill while on holiday in Spain. 'When
you look at an ant colony it is remarkable that it can do so many different
things and control so many different functions; yet it takes the equivalent
of only five lines of code to control all the behavioural characteristics
that keep the colony operating smoothly,' he says. If an ant colony is
disrupted it has an amazing capacity for reorganising itself and carrying on
as normal.
A problem with BT's current network is that none of its equipment functions
without software instructions. And because the elements of the network are
so inter-related, one small software fault can lead to big disruptions.
BT's engineers are casting a wary eye at a series of catastrophic network
failures experienced by AT&amp;T and the regional telephone companies in the US
over the past two years.
Between January and November 1991 eight major network failures were reported
in six states, affecting more than 27m customers.
Many of the breakdowns have been attributed to faulty software in the
networks, leading to 'brown outs'. These occur when the software fault leads
a telephone exchange, or switch, to think it is overloaded and to pass a
call on to the next exchange which also thinks it is overloaded. As the call
is passed from switch to switch the network seizes up.
Such a failure meant that 10m users lost service in Maryland and Washington
DC on June 26 last year. On October 22 a similar fault interrupted service
to 80,000 people in Florida - including the 911 emergency service - for
three hours.
AT&amp;T's exchanges not only handle the traffic flowing through the network but
also have integrated customer services such as billing and caller
identification. Such huge amounts of software are inevitably subject to
bugs.
'Put a full stop in the wrong place and it all goes wrong - the probe misses
Jupiter by thousands of miles or the aeroplane crashes,' says Cochrane.
Some breakdowns in the US have been blamed on a minor software upgrade that
was not tested before it was installed in network switching equipment.
Even with the most exhaustive testing, however, software bugs may only come
to light when a network is up and running.
Cochrane believes it is partly a matter of luck that such breakdowns have
not happened in the UK.
From his observations of ant colonies Cochrane has devised a principle of
self-organisation whereby different elements of a network are managed by a
small quantity of self-contained software. Each of these units is then
immune from faults occurring in other units.
When ants are sent off to collect food they may use different routes to and
from the nest, but the result is the same. In Cochrane's analogy the ant is
equivalent to a physical connection in the network and the food is
equivalent to the information that is being passed down it. BT has now built
the first stage of such a self-organising network on a personal computer.
Cochrane stresses that self-organisation of networks is just one line of
investigation that BT is following to get to grips with the problems of
managing its network.
The company is facing a seven-fold expansion in the volume of its network
management software as it moves to create the kind of network which UK
businesses will be demanding by the end of the decade, providing, for
example, visual services.
Its Martlesham project will devise ways of simplifying the software
controlling the company's next generation of exchanges, which are due to
start replacing the existing System X ones early in the next century.
The company is 'tearing its existing software to pieces' and thoroughly
testing any new software before it is installed.
At the same time more reliable hardware is coming to the rescue. 'At the
moment if we do have failures there is standby equipment, but obviously such
redundancy increases costs,' says Cochrane. 'More reliable hardware has
allowed BT to reduce duplication in the past 20 years. The amount of
hardware has been cut 100 times while the network capacity has increased 100
times.'
BT is also studying the network failures in the US to pre-empt such
breakdowns in the UK.
Some of the US failures indicate that network back-up is a chimera. Not only
does it make network management more complex, but if the back-up consists of
the same equipment it can also be hit by the same software bug.
In a sense, adopting the philosophy of self organisation will take BT back
to the era of the Strowger electromechanical switches where every switch on
the network was autonomous.
The US failures have demonstrated, however, that the high capacity of a
single piece of network equipment makes even a low probability of failure
unacceptable.
Customers want fewer small-scale failures but not at the expense of the
occasional large breakdown which brings a whole city to a standstill.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Fayeds seek court decision on panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAYED brothers yesterday renewed their attempt to block disciplinary
proceedings launched against them by the City Takeover Panel, Raymond Hughes
writes. The proceedings followed publication of a government report on their
acquisition of the House of Fraser stores group in 1985.
They asked the Court of Appeal to allow them to seek a judicial review of
the panel's refusal in December to adjourn the proceedings, at which the
central issue will be statements made by the brothers about the source of
funds used for the acquisition. A similar application was refused by the
High Court in January.
Mr David Oliver, QC for the Fayeds, said the disciplinary proceedings should
be deferred until after a pending High Court action against the brothers by
Lonrho, the conglomerate headed by Mr Tiny Rowland, which lost the battle
for House of Fraser.
Mr Oliver said the panel should first conduct its own investigation into
allegations against the Fayeds, and not base its proceedings on the
Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report on the matter. The
Fayeds would challenge that report in the Lonrho action, he added.
The panel executive alleged that the Fayeds had committed fraud by knowingly
making untrue statements - exactly the allegation Lonrho made in its court
action, Mr Oliver said.
It would be an injustice if the full panel came to a conclusion adverse to
the Fayeds and publicly censured them when they might succeed in the Lonrho
action and be vindicated.
The hearing continues today.

<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has bottomed out in the Scottish engineering industry and the
electronics sector is leading an upturn, according to a quarterly survey by
Scottish Engineering, an employers' organisation representing 300 companies.
Orders increased for 52 per cent of electronic engineering companies in the
past three months, and 47 per cent of medium-sized companies - between 100
and 500 employees - in all sectors also said they had taken more orders. A
total of 67 per cent reported a rise in orders in the previous quarter.
Overall, 39 per cent said orders were up and 34 per cent said they were
down. Small companies and the foundry sector showed the greatest decline.
A total of 32 per cent of companies questioned were more optimistic, while
24 per cent were less optimistic. A balance of 2 per cent of companies
reported an increase in capital investment. More investment in training is
planned by 30 per cent of the sample.
Reductions in staffing and overtime continue throughout the engineering
industry, although at a slower rate. Only 19 per cent report employment
levels up. Prices were down in 34 per cent of cases, and up in just 9 per

Colonel Howard Johnson, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said: 'I
believe that we have a confident industry gearing itself for an early turn
around of the recession.'
The survey had a response rate of 56 per cent of members, and responses from
some non-member companies were included for the first time.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Manchester supertram starts next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first supertram has been given approval by the government's
railway inspectorate to start operating in Greater Manchester next Monday,
after five postponements of the launch.
Metrolink, the Pounds 135m light rail system, will run on normal railway
lines to the city centre, where it will take to the streets. It still needs
to obtain approval for street running from early May.
The launch has been held up by a series of construction and operating
difficulties, the final one of which was a need for more training for
drivers.
After several months of discussion about working practices, equipment and
safety requirements, the railway inspectorate refused approval only four
days before the system was due to start last week.
Although less than two miles of track has been laid in the city centre, the
supertram's economic significance is that it will link commuter services
feeding into Manchester's termini.
The project's financing, which has attracted much international interest, is
in the form of a privatisation in which local councils have a stake.
Metrolink has been developed on an innovatory 'design, build, operate and
maintain' principle by a consortium of engineering and construction
companies and local authorities.
Private-sector participants have paid Pounds 5m to join the consortium, but
the local transport authorities - and hence local councils - will get a
share of the profits after certain thresholds are crossed.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Computerised trading on stream at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE brokers yesterday placed risks electronically with underwriters at
both Lloyd's of London and London market companies for the first time as the
Electronic Placing Support system (EPS) came on stream.
Combined with the existing electronic claims payment, accounting and
reinsurance systems developed over the past few years, the system is
expected to improve efficiency at the market.
Mr Steve Abrahams, underwriting manager of Sun Alliance International, who
insured one of the first pieces to be offered electronically yesterday said
yesterday: 'It will cut out a lot of administrative work and is a major step
forward. Sending risks down the line is going to cut out a lot of leg work.'
Mr Chris Trickett, managing director of Sedgwick Professional Indemnity,
which placed the risk with Sun Alliance, said: 'Anything brokers can do to
increase efficiency has got to be good.'
He emphasised that the real cost benefits will be reaped 'in the future'
when all information is captured electronically, reducing the need for
're-keying' of information.
Mr Max Taylor, chairman of London Network Management Committee, who has
co-ordinated co-operation between Lloyd's and the associations representing
London market companies, said: 'We think this is enormously important and
significant.' Both underwriters and brokers stress however that electronic
placement will not end the need for face-to-face negotiation of more complex
and larger risks.
'Negotiating big risks is not the same as trading shares,' said Mr Taylor,
adding that 'the successful implementation of EPS will depend on
'(combining) the best of traditional practices with the benefits that modern
technology can offer'.
Mr Taylor's company, Willis Corroon, is one of four brokers that began
placing risks electronically yesterday.
CE Heath, Minet and Sedgwick are the others. CT Bowring, Alexander Howden
and Greig Fester will join this month and nine other brokers will join later
this year.
Immediate participation in the system among insurers is much wider. At
Lloyd's, more than 100 of the market's 278 syndicates representing more than
four fifths of the market's capacity are taking part and more that 100
insurance and reinsurance companies are also involved.

FT  31 MAR 92 / German-style engineering doctorates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR-YEAR engineering doctorates, based on a German model and quite
different from any existing postgraduate degree in the UK, are to be
introduced at three British universities.
The new degree, to be known as EngD, will combine academic research with
project management, taught courses and problem-solving with an industrial
sponsor.
The Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc) announced yesterday that
it would fund pilot EngD programmes at three centres, starting in October:
the University of Manchester with Umist; University College, Swansea, with
the University of Wales, Cardiff, and the North East Wales Institute; and
Warwick University. Each centre will start with an annual intake of 10
research engineers a year and a Serc grant of Pounds 50,000 a year which
will go up as student numbers increase.
To encourage good students to apply, the EngD courses will pay a basic
stipend of about Pounds 9,500 a year - more than twice the level of a
standard postgraduate research grant.
The EngD is modelled on the Dr Ing qualification introduced in Germany 60
years ago. Professor John Parnaby, chairman of the panel that recommended
the move, said: 'Dr Ings are extremely well represented on the boards of
successful German companies.'

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: An army undaunted by the smell of stale socks
 -Away from the TV lights, a gritty and gruelling general election campaign
is being fought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN constituencies across the country, the election contest is being
co-ordinated from cramped, dishevelled offices smelling faintly of mildew
and stale socks, by men and women poring over ward maps and electoral
registers.
A sharp-suited agent clutching a mobile phone is popping in and out. The
lavatory reading matter is usually restricted to booklets with titles like
'Campaigning in the 1990s'.
Staple ingredients include candidates trudging affably from door-to-door, or
from old-people's home to shopping precinct, pressing the flesh and trying
to sound interested, getting close enough to see the whites of constituents'
eyes.
They include armies of volunteers folding leaflets, licking envelopes and
sticking on stamps. They include adoption meetings in dingy school assembly
halls reeking of polish with the caretaker rattling his keys in the
background.
Strict legal limitations on election expenditure at local level have
superficially kept changes to a minimum in the humdrum often dreary business
of trying to win a Westminster seat.
But it would be a mistake to be fooled by the tawdry trappings. In the best
campaign teams, there is no shortage of innovation; the grimy net curtains
obscure a carefully co-ordinated strategy where resources are deployed with
military precision.
One important recent development is the availability of increasingly
sophisticated computing and desk-top publishing packages at affordable
prices. These are used to prepare spreadsheets and lists, and produce ever
more imaginative promotional literature.
Mr Greville Janner, defending Leicester West for Labour, addresses the Asian
voters in his constituency in four different languages: Hindi, Urdu,
Gujurati and English. One Labour candidate defending a Scottish seat intends
to send a personally addressed letter to each of the 5,000 or so professed
Scottish National Party supporters in his constituency.
Mr Kevin Lomax, Labour candidate for Dudley West, has taken to sending
constituents letters instead of leaflets - 'because we know they (leaflets)
tend to be thrown straight in the bin.'
In Basildon, Labour's agent Ms Linda Webb has made it a priority to catch up
with the Tories in terms of electronic power. 'We spend our money on
technology rather than on the fabric of the building,' she says, staring at
the tumbledown campaign headquarters.
A consequence of this growing dependence on computers is an increased
emphasis on security. The Cheltenham Liberal Democrats have their main
computer securely locked up in the candidate's house and not at party
headquarters. This reduces the risk of break-ins, says Mr David Figeon, the
local agent.
Candidates are also continually honing their canvassing and targeting
techniques. Many are intending to exploit the lighter evenings produced by
last weekend's clock change to indulge in an extra hour's nightly
campaigning, extending their evening forays until 9pm.
In Amber Valley, the Tory team of Phillip Oppenheim, who is defending the
seat, arrives in a road in its Volkswagen battlebus. Anyone wishing to raise
an issue on the doorstep is immediately notified to the candidate, who
spends about five minutes talking and taking details. He has a his own
special blue form for waverers: a mini-questionnaire asking them to tick
boxes to indicate why they are hesitating.
Labour's Derby campaign headquarters has produced a detailed booklet of
instructions to campaigners. The doorstep question has changed from the old
formula in which a candidate or assistant asked: 'Can I rely on your vote?'
Now the question is more likely to be a much gentler 'Have you thought which
way you are voting?' or 'Which party do you normally support?'.
Face-to-face debates, often arranged by religious groups, are a feature of
the campaign in a number of constituencies.
The involvement of central party organisations is increasing too -
especially in the marginals. Conservative Central Office says many London
constituencies have joined a central printing scheme for the sake of
economies of scale.
At a recent Tory rally in Battersea attended by party members from
throughout London, a selection of artwork 'cleared by the Research
Department' was available, for use on 'any leaflets you might be
considering'.
So orchestrated is Labour's Greater London masterplan that the party pulled
workers out of safe seats at the weekend to concentrate on marginal
constituencies.
With a close race in prospect the routine for getting the vote out on
polling day is likely to be pursued more ruthlessly and single-mindedly than
ever before.
The Derby Labour instructions say: 'Knocking-up continues throughout the
day, if necessary calling on the same people over and over again.' They even
advise knocker-ups to volunteer to baby-sit so that mothers can leave their
family to vote.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday fiercely attacked the Tories' record on education and said
additional annual spending of Pounds 600m would raise standards for every
child, of every level of ability, Andrew Bolger writes.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said reading standards had gone
down since 1987. 'From the Tories we've not had standards, but double
standards - a few children in opt-out schools and city technology colleges
favoured, while the needs of the rest are neglected.'
Labour promised to set and achieve ambitious targets to secure a nursery
education for every child whose parents wanted it, and to raise the
staying-on and achievement rates for pupils over the age of 16.

THE trend of the past two weeks reasserted itself yesterday. 'Labour

FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Farmers straying from the Tory fold - The
Issues: Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS have traditionally voted for the Tories, but there are signs that
the recession has caused some to switch their allegiances.
The battle for the farming vote is usually a two-horse race between the
Tories and the Liberal Democrats. A poll conducted for Big Farm Weekly by
Mass Observation UK earlier this month suggested that in the coming election
one in four farmers will vote Liberal Democrat compared with only 13 per
cent in 1987. The poll of 502 farmers showed the Tory share of the vote down
from 83 per cent in 1987 to 63 per cent.
Only 2 per cent of voters work on the land, but they could be vital to the
outcome in several constituencies, according to Mr Richard Howarth, lecturer
in agricultural economics at Bangor University College. 'There are some very
marginal seats where quite a small number of voters could influence the
outcome,' he says.
For example Cambridgeshire North-East has a Tory majority of 1,428, while 15
per cent of the electorate is involved in agriculture. Hereford has a
similarly slim Tory majority, with 8 1/2 per cent in farming.
Mr Howarth points out that the Liberal Democrats have a lot of marginal
seats, including Brecon and Radnor, which they hold by 56 votes, the
smallest majority in the country. 'In a closely fought election the Liberal
Democrats have to keep sweet with the farmers,' he said.
Scottish and Welsh nationalists are complicating the picture. Galloway and
Upper Nithsdale, one of the most agricultural seats in the UK, is held by Mr
Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, with a majority of 3,673 over the Scottish
National party, which is keen to regain the seat.
Tory concern over the farm vote appears to have been growing for several
months. At two important agricultural gatherings Mr John Major, the prime
minister, urged farmers to get closer to the market, warning that the
present level of price support was simply not sustainable.
He was unable to offer solace on the two biggest areas of concern and
uncertainty for farmers - the proposed reforms of the European Community's
Common Agricultural Policy and the talks on Gatt - the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, may not have had a good press in
his struggles with CAP complexities. But he has won grudging respect for his
defence of the industry.
Most farmers are under no illusion that an agriculture minister of another
political colour could do any better. Mr Martin Howarth, National Farmers'
Union head of international affairs, says it would be very difficult for a
UK minister to trade agricultural reform against another issue.
The Tory manifesto - which devotes more space to agriculture than those of
the other main parties - promises to 'redouble our efforts to reform the
CAP' and 'stoutly defend the interests of British farmers and consumers'. It
points out, however, that pressure to reduce protectionist measures and the
need to contain the cost of the CAP mean farmers will face reduced support
and increased competition.
The Liberal Democrats also say they will work for fundamental reform of the
CAP. They want to increase direct aid to farmers and make incentive payments
for environmental objectives, 'in particular for extensifying food
production (using land less intensively), and reduced-input and organic
farming'.
Labour promises a Department of Food and Farming and pledges to replace
production subsidies with 'green' premium payments 'to promote
environmentally sound management of the countryside'. It believes changes in
the wasteful CAP 'can help finance other Community projects'.
All three parties support the Rural Development Commission, and include
measures to improve the environment and conservation.
Owners of large farms are concerned that proposed changes to the CAP will be
unfavourable to them. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, is
committed to reforms that will support 'rural communities which have no
viable alternative to agriculture', which in effect means smaller farmers,
mainly in continental Europe.
Mr Howarth points out that this has divided the farm lobby. The Farmers
Union of Wales is keen on the MacSharry proposals while the NFU would prefer
to reform the CAP through a supply-management system and the Country
Landowners' Association is against production controls. 'They are all taking
a different line,' said Mr Howarth. 'For the first time the lobby is not
united.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new homes fell slightly in the US last month, but the drop did not
appear to cloud prospects for an economic recovery significantly.
The Commerce Department said it had recorded new home sales at an adjusted
annual rate of 613,000 in February, down 2.7 per cent from January's figure
of 630,000.
But the decline only took the edge off an 11.1 per cent rise in sales in
January. Sales of existing homes have shown signs of revival: the National
Association of Realtors reports a 9.3 per cent rise in February.
The department reported that the stock of new houses for sale fell 4 per
cent in February to 269,000, its lowest level since 1983. This stock
represented only 5.2 months of sales, it said.
Median sale prices, however, dropped in February to Dollars 117,000 (Pounds
67,630) from Dollars 123,000 in January, lower than a year earlier.
The recession-hit north-east showed the most vitality, with new home sales
rebounding 14 per cent in February after seasonal adjustments to a level 40
per cent up on a year ago.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Cheney runs into heavy flak on the home front: George Graham
on opposition to cuts in Reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Richard Cheney, the US secretary of defence, announced detailed
plans to cut 234,000 troops from the Reserves and National Guard over the
next five years, he stepped into a congressional hornets' nest.
Mr Cheney has been trying for three years, with severely limited success, to
persuade Congress that it must allow him to cut reserve troop strengths in
line with the 25 per cent reduction in overall force structure that he is
trying to carry out.
But the reservists bring formidable firepower to bear: their National Guard
component is organised state by state and falls under the authority of the
state governors unless it is activated by the US president.
Led by Congressman Sonny Montgomery, a retired major general in the
Mississippi National Guard, Congress has resisted making the cuts sought by
the Defence Department and reduced spending in other areas of defence.
'In 1989 when we asked, they said no. In 1990 when we asked, they said no.
In 1991 when we asked, they said okay, you can have half of what you asked
for. Just because Congress says no doesn't mean it's a bad idea,' Mr Cheney
said, arguing that the cuts he proposes would save Dollars 20bn (Pounds
11.5bn) over the next five years.
US military strategy for the past 20 years closely integrated the reserves
into a Total Force designed to head off a Warsaw Pact attack in central
Europe, but the collapse of the Soviet Union has changed both the size and
the type of military forces needed. General Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, argues that he must be allowed to reduce the reserves
along with the rest of the forces.
The proposed cuts would affect 830 Reserve and National Guard units, and no
state would emerge unscathed. Army units would bear the brunt of the cuts,
with much smaller cuts in naval and air force reserves. "I'd like to keep
every single one of them,' Gen Powell said, 'but I can't make that case. The
geostrategic situation has changed in the world, and the fiscal situation
has changed in the world.'
The core of congressional hostility to the proposals is the financial and
social importance of National Guard armories to local economies. "A local
armory of 150 persons has a payroll of about Dollars 2m a year,' Mr
Montgomery says. "By closing over 800 armories around the country you are
certainly not helping us get out of the recession. These armories are the
community centre, and these armories are really the best support that the
active forces have.'
But as Congress continues to demand a bigger 'peace dividend', the Reserves
may also have to suffer. "The Congress cannot have it both ways,' Mr Cheney
says. 'They cannot tell us we have to cut the defence budget, and then
object every time we move to cut the defence budget.'
The Reserves have a chequered history. US presidents have often been
reluctant to call them up, and when they have, the Reserves have often been
reluctant to respond, according to a study of the Army Guard and Reserve by
Mr Martin Binkin and Mr William Kaufmann of the Brookings Institution.
Their mobilisation before the US entered World War Two and during the Korean
War provoked grumbling in the ranks and rancour in Congress. Partly as a
consequence, when the US began to build up its involvement in Vietnam,
President Lyndon Johnson decided not to call up the reserves and to rely on
conscription. The National Guard became a paradoxical haven for those who
wanted to avoid the war - such as Vice President Dan Quayle.
After the Vietnam War, the function, equipment and training of the Reserves
were substantially upgraded as they were integrated into the new Total Force
strategy. Reserve and National Guard units became increasingly
indispensable, with the Reserves providing most of the armed forces'
capability in fields such as transport, supply and medical services. Some
functions, like water purification, are entirely carried out by reserve
units.
New legislation gave the president the power to call up reserve units for up
to 180 days without congressional authorisation, although this power was not
used before the 1990 Gulf mobilisation. In 1987, for example, six naval
reserve minesweepers were deployed to the Gulf; most of their reserve crew
members were left behind.
However, if the Gulf war provided the first sustained test for the Reserves,
the lessons are mixed. Mr Cheney feels obliged to say that the 231,000
reservists called up 'once again proved that they are an absolutely
indispensable part of America's military force.' Certainly, the perception
that the Pentagon is brutally laying off the heroes of Desert Storm has made
the issue of reserve cuts even more sensitive.
Logistical units, as well as two field artillery brigades, were deployed in
Saudi Arabia, but the army found that infantry and armoured reserve units
were far from combat-ready. General Gordon Sullivan, the army chief of
staff, now estimates that he needs as much as a year to get a reserve
division up to full combat readiness, much longer than had been postulated
under Total Force thinking.
It is argued that this kind of delay might be enough to face a resurgent
threat from a power such as Russia, but it is inadequate to meet a sudden
crisis, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
In the meantime, Mr Cheney faces a hard struggle to overcome congressional
opposition to these cuts. The recognition is spreading, however, that it is
hard to cut the defence budget much further without also cutting reserve
strengths, and this may be the year that his argument will prevail.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Clinton smoke draws little fire: Candidate's marijuana
confession may revive 'character' issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE two leading candidates for the Democratic party's presidential
nomination have finally agreed on something. Mr Jerry Brown asserted on
Sunday night that Mr Bill Clinton's confessed use of marijuana while a
student at Oxford in the late 1960s was 'not relevant' to the current
campaign.
In response to a question in a televised debate shown in New York, which
holds its primary a week from today, Mr Clinton said: 'When I was in
England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it,
and I didn't inhale and I never tried it again.' He added he had never
broken any US state drugs law.
Mr Brown, appearing via satellite from Wisconsin, said he had never used
marijuana but went on: 'I agree with Clinton, why don't you lay off this
stuff? What you did 20 years ago is not relevant.'
The question of the use of narcotics has now become almost a rite of passage
for aspiring American politicians and public office holders. In 1988, two
Democratic candidates, Senator Albert Gore and Mr Bruce Babbitt,
acknowledged earlier recreational use of soft drugs. So did Judge Clarence
Thomas, approved as the new Supreme Court Justice last year, and Mr Douglas
Ginsburg, who withdrew his nomination by President Ronald Reagan for the
Supreme Court in 1987.
In the latter case, Mr Ginsburg confessed to use only seven years
previously, when already a university professor, an admission which
materially damaged his nomination. However, national surveys have shown that
about half Mr Clinton's generation which grew up in the 1960s smoked
marijuana at one stage or another.
There was some criticism yesterday that Mr Clinton had chosen to defend
himself on the narrow grounds that he had broken no US law, not mentioning
that marijuana was still illegal in Britain.
A more general concern for the Arkansas governor may be the extent to which
his admission reinforces other well-aired doubts about his 'character' -
less among his generation but more among older Americans to whom the 'sex,
drugs and rock n'roll' revolution always was unpalatable.
His confession attracted front-page treatment yesterday in the mainstream
media, with the New York tabloids typically having a field day. 'Clinton on
the S-pot,' was the headline in the New York Post, while the Daily News,
which had pressed Mr Clinton on the issue earlier, half-joked 'Weed asked
him that.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAITI'S military rulers have threatened to arrest parliamentarians who try
to ratify an agreement which would let President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
overthrown and sent into exile in September, return to the country.
The threat follows a ruling by Haiti's supreme court on Friday that the
agreement, negotiated a month ago by Mr Aristide, a group of Haitian
parliamentarians and the Organisation of American States, was invalid and
could not be implemented.
The court's ruling, following submissions by the army-backed government, and
the subsequent threats to the legislators, has scuttled any hopes of an
early return by Mr Aristide, and has strengthened the hand of the army in
the Caribbean state of 6.5m people.
A statement on state-controlled television said any challenges to the
court's decision would be 'a grave crime of rebellion and outrage'. It
followed criticisms by some legislators of the supreme court's decision, and
indications that they were willing to convene a session of the assembly to
ratify the agreement in defiance of the court's conclusion.
OAS members, including the US, are under growing pressure to rethink their
policy towards Haiti. They have been embarrassed by the resilience of the
military authorities in the face of an international economic embargo.
The OAS had placed much hope by the accord, which it brokered last month.

   ST JOHN'S, NEWFOUNDLAND
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLEET of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia trawlers is today due to claim two
areas of the high seas for Canada, in protest at overfishing by foreign
vessels.
The deep-sea trawlers, which left from St John's, Newfoundland, at the
weekend, will anchor a fishing boat near the 200-mile limit in a symbolic
assertion of rights over valuable fishing grounds.
Canada's continental shelf extends beyond the 200-mile limit at two points,
the so-called Nose and Tail of the Grand Banks, east of Newfoundland.
Canadian officials say this has left its fish stocks, which straddle the
limit, prey to the unregulated activities of foreign vessels.
In February Canada reduced its quotas for northern cod in its own waters for
this year to 120,000 tonnes from 185,000 tonnes, warning of environmental
catastrophe unless catches were reduced and the stocks allowed to recover.
Ottawa has waged a long battle against the activities of European Community
vessels beyond its territorial waters, directing its fiercest criticism
against Spain and Portugal. However, many Canadian inshore fishermen say
their own offshore fleet must take a share of the blame for overfishing.
The federal government is coming under political pressure to act against
foreign vessels. Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, warned last week that
Canada would press the issue hard at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in
June.
Theoretically, fishing beyond the territorial limit is overseen by the North
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, of which both Canada and the EC are
signatories. However, an objection procedure allows signatories to bypass
Nafo quotas and set their own limits. Even these unilateral curbs are widely
ignored, Canada claims.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Turkey tells Syria to cease aid to Kurds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TURKEY yesterday issued a strong warning for Syria to end its support for
Kurdish separatists, after a week of growing unrest in south-east Turkey
where rebels of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) are calling for a general
insurrection.
The broadside by Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, marks the most
explicit charge of Syrian involvement in the PKK's struggle for an
independent state in south-east Turkey. It comes just two weeks before a
scheduled visit to Damascus by Mr Ismet Sezgin, Turkey's interior minister.
The statement underlines mounting Turkish concern at what it sees as Syrian
complicity, giving backing to Turkey's claim that the PKK constitutes an
external threat despite growing evidence that it now enjoys broad support
inside the country.
Mr Demirel described Syria's action in giving the PKK a safe haven in the
Bekaa valley as unacceptable. 'It should be clearly understood that our
patience has a limit,' Mr Demirel warned.
Turkey claims the PKK has 7,000 guerrillas outside Turkey either in northern
Iraq or in the camps in Bekaa, and just 3,000 inside Turkey. 'We will do
everything we can to stop this killing. I don't think this should go on for
10 or 15 years. It should be stopped,' he said.
Mr Demirel's comments raise the prospect of possible Turkish military action
against PKK camps in the Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley. Turkish
aircraft bombed alleged PKK targets in northern Iraq last week. Mr Demirel
defended the hot pursuit tactics as an act of self-defence sanctioned by the
United Nations Charter.
Turko-Syrian relations have long been based on mutual suspicion, a simmering
dispute over Turkish control of the river Euphrates, and the outstanding
Syrian claims to Hatay province - given to the Turks in the 1930s when Syria
was under French administration.
Turkish frustration at its failure to combat the PKK reached a new impasse
last week with the deaths of more than 70 people involved in demonstrations
to mark the Kurdish New Year.
This frustration was compounded by German criticism on Thursday that Turkey
was using German military aid equipment to put down the demonstrations - a
charge denied by Mr Demirel.

MALAYSIA'S economy is set to expand 8.7 per cent in 1992 for a fifth year of
rapid growth but the government will check inflation and infrastructure
bottlenecks, the central bank said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Real domestic gross product (GDP) would grow 8.7 per cent from 8.8 per cent
this year, making Malaysia one of the fastest-growing economies in the
Asia-Pacific, the bank said in its 1991 report.
Some analysts said that despite Bank Negara's latest projections, actual
growth in 1992 could be slower.
Malaysia's inflation hit 4.4 per cent in 1991 from 3.1 per cent in 1990 and
Bank Negara said it could rise to 4.5 per cent in 1992.
'We are used to zero or 1 per cent in the past,' Mr Jaffar Hussein, the Bank
Negara governor said.

<TEXT>
HUNDREDS OF riot policemen, coupled with strict security measures, yesterday
prevented militant Kashmiris from marching across the disputed border
between Pakistan and India.
Their presence halted the latest effort by members of the militant Jammu
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) to reunite the divided state, an effort
which Pakistani officials feared could lead to war with India.
The militants attempted to send small groups to infiltrate sections of the
border, as an effort to keep their initiative alive.
However the arrest last night of Mr Raja Muzaffar, acting chairman of the
Front, put an end to hopes that the march could be a success.
Militants on the Indian side also called off their planned march in the
other direction, into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
On the Pakistan side riot policemen, aided by army engineers, built walls of
stone and erected a barbed-wire fence outside Caikothi, the last garrison
9km from the border town Chinari, to prevent marchers from taking the main
road to Srinagar, capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.
Last month, a similar march led to the killing of at least a dozen people,
while another 60 were injured.
Elsewhere in the state, riot policemen fired tear-gas shells on JKLF
supporters, to break up a gathering in Muzaffarabad, the capital of
Pakistani Kashmir.
Last night Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, prime minister of Pakistani Kashmir,
said that his government would allow no similar marches in the future.
The militants reiterated their goal of an independent Kashmir, free from
domination either by India or Pakistan. Before his arrest, Mr Muzaffar told
reporters in a remote mountain hideout some 4km from Chinari that 'the march
will discourage the conspiracies to divide Kashmir and will promote our
attempts at reunification.'
Both Pakistan and the semi-autonomous Kashmiri state have traditionally
backed a UN plebiscite for Kashmiris leading to accession either to India or
to Pakistan.
The Financial Times correspondent was among Western and Pakistani
journalists and press photographers who were arrested by the Kashmir police
and detained for more than an hour yesterday.
Policemen armed with rifles, carrying tear gas shells and batons, surrounded
the press team and threatened to charge them for allegedly associat ing with
'proclaimed offenders'.
David Housego adds from Srinagar: The Indian government is to release five
Kashmiri nationalist leaders in an effort to launch a political dialogue in
the state. The freeing of the leaders, announced by Radio Kashmir last
night, is expected within two days. It seen by the government as paving the
way for elections in the state - possibly within the year.
Most of the leaders have been held for two years for supporting the
militants' separatist movement. The decision reflects growing confidence by
the state government that it can contain the insurgency which in the past
has drawn India close to war with Pakistan.
Mr GD Saxena, governor of Kashmir, said in an interview yesterday: 'We have
the upper hand and initiative now. I feel confident that we can keep things
under control.'

ONE OF the eight presidential candidates in the May 11 Philippine elections,
Mr Joseph Estrada, has dropped out to become the running mate of another
opposition contender, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, of the Nationalist People's
Coalition.
Mr Estrada, a member of the Senate who gained popularity as a movie actor,
said yesterday he had switched over to Mr Cojuangco's camp 'to help ensure
that the next president wins by a majority vote'.
Charges of a sellout quickly met Mr Estrada's announcement. He had said
earlier in the campaign that one of his opponents had offered him 200m pesos
(Pounds 4.65m) to drop his presidential bid. Although admitting that his
party had been running low on funds, Mr Estrada yesterday denied there was
money involved in what he called 'a joining of forces' between his Partido
ng Masang Pilipino and Mr Cojuangco's NPC.
Some analysts said Mr Cojuangco's chances may have improved with the new
alliance. In many pre-campaign surveys, Mr Estrada was among the leading
names in terms of popularity, but his position has been eroded in recent
weeks.
Mrs Imelda Marcos said yesterday that the body of her husband, former
President Ferdinand Marcos, would be brought to his home province in the
Philippines from Hawaii next week for burial, AP adds.

repatriation of Cambodians from Thailand

<TEXT>
ONE of the largest repatriation programmes undertaken by the United Nations
began yesterday when 527 Cambodian refugees were bussed across the border
from Thailand to an uncertain future in their homeland.
The refugees, from among the 375,000 Cambodians living in seven sites in
Thailand, were welcomed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian monarch,
and Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(Untac). The two men have joint responsibility for returning the country to
normal after two decades of war following a peace accord signed in Paris
last October.
Under the protection of a company of Malaysian UN soldiers guarding the
road, yesterday's returnees were welcomed by flag-waving schoolchildren and
driven to a temporary reception site in Sisophon.
From there they will be taken to farmland allocated to them in the area of
their choice and cleared of landmines by the UN. They will be given building
materials, agricultural tools and food for up to a year.
They are returning voluntarily, but some are apprehensive about the
continued strength in the countryside of guerrillas from the Khmer Rouge,
the extreme left faction which ran Cambodia between 1975 and 1978 and caused
the deaths of up to 1m people.
'I'm happy to be going back to Cambodia because I've been separated from my
parents for a long time,' said Mr So Koemsan, aged 29. 'I'm also worried
about many things, and my main worry is the Khmer Rouge.'
Prince Sihanouk acknowledged that there was an upsurge of fighting around
Kompong Thom between the Khmer Rouge and the existing Cambodian government
installed by the Vietnamese when they invaded the country and overthrew the
Khmer Rouge in 1979. He also expressed grave doubts about the Supreme
National Council.
The returning refugees, many of them children who have spent all their lives
in Thailand and enjoyed education and medical care from the UN, are likely
to find life hard in Cambodia.
Apart from the unstable political situation, they face a lack of government
services, the risk of malaria, and competition from displaced Cambodians who
never crossed the frontier into Thailand.
UN officials have struggled to secure funds for the Dollars 2bn operation in
Cambodia.
'We have all waited a very long time for this moment,' said Mr Akashi at a
welcoming ceremony in Sisophon yesterday. Mrs Sadako Ogatak, UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, said: 'We were there for you in Thailand and I
promise you we will be there to help you resettle in your homeland.'

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN President Roh Tae Woo yesterday fired his intelligence chief
and replaced three cabinet ministers in the aftermath of a humiliating
parliamentary election defeat, AP reports from Seoul.
The action followed an opposition demand that Mr Roh sack his entire
23-member cabinet and issue a public apology for alleged vote-rigging in
last week's elections.
Mr Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party lost its majority by one seat in
the March 24 elections, widely seen as a prelude to presidential voting
later this year. The DLP had controlled nearly two-thirds of seats in the
299-member parliament.
In the shake-up, the first since last December, Mr Lee Sang-hyon, home
minister, replaced Mr Suh Dong-kwon as chief of the agency for National
Security Planning (NSP), the main government intelligence organisation.
Mr Lee Dong-ho, a provincial governor, succeeded the outgoing home minister,
whose job includes control of the 130,000-member police.
Mr Kang Hyon-wook was named agriculture and fisheries minister and Mr Noh
Won-il is the new transport minister.
Officials said the NSP was the only cabinet-level post directly held
responsible for election-related disputes. The agency is suspected of having
been deeply involved in illegal campaigning.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Shamir rejects formula to resolve Likud split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said last night the
resignation announced by Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, was 'unnatural
and unjustified'. But he offered no concession to bridge the cavernous split
which has opened in the ruling Likud party three months before the June 23
general election.
'We are the owners of the same party. The same spirit guides us. There are
no differences between us,' Mr Shamir insisted, adding: 'There is nothing to
extort out of me.'
Mr Levy, smarting over what he regards as the malicious subjugation within
the Likud of himself and his supporters by Mr Shamir and his allies,
declared on Sunday night that he would resign from the government.
He larded a vituperative attack on Mr Shamir with assaults on the way some
ministers, as he put it, have 'declared war' on the US. This was in line
with his position as the Likud minister most supportive of the US-brokered
Middle East peace process.
But Mr Levy's main concern was clearly to recoup his recently damaged
domestic political position. He was careful not to slam the door on either
the government or the Likud party. Under government rules, he would not hand
his resignation in until Sunday's cabinet meeting, leaving a week open for
negotiations over his demand that his camp be granted one-third of all party
appointments as the price for his retreat.
Mr Shamir is anxious to avoid prolonging a dispute within the party that has
already weakened its position in the neck-and-neck election battle with the
opposition Labour party. If Mr Levy were to go so far as to leave the Likud
and set up his own party, as many of his supporters are urging, it could tip
the balance against the Likud in the finely balanced Knesset elections.
Equally, Mr Shamir is under pressure from some in the Likud who feel it
would be better in the long run to cut out what has become a festering wound
in the party by forcing Mr Levy to set up on his own.
Mr Shamir's inclination is to find a way to keep Mr Levy in the fold, but
finding a formula may be difficult. He said yesterday Mr Levy's demand for a
quota of party posts for his supporters was out of the question. He
reiterated an assurance to make Mr Levy foreign minister and deputy premier
if Likud wins the election. But he added: 'I don't want to hear about
percentages . . . there is nothing to talk about.'
The issue is made doubly sensitive for Mr Shamir because of the strong
ethnic undertone underlying the row. Mr Levy is the champion of the
Sephardi, or oriental Jews who came to Israel from North Africa and the
Middle East. They resent what they see as the disciminatory attitude of the
traditional Ashkenazi, or European establishment, to which Mr Shamir
belongs.
The danger of losing their loyalty was quickly and publicly recognised by Mr
Binyamin Begin, son of the late prime minister Menachem Begin, whose careful
gathering of the Sephardim into the Likud fold was the foundation of the
party's accession to power in 1977.
'We are talking about an important group in the Likud, even very important,'
Mr Begin said yesterday. 'Most of them have been activists for many years. I
very much hope in the week that we have it will be possible to straighten
things out.
'I hope that all the members will understand three months before the
elections that there are things that are bigger and more important than
ourselves . . . first of all to win the elections on the 23rd of June.'
The US has suggested reconvening Middle East peace talks between Israel and
its Arab neighbours in Washington on April 27, writes Tony Walker in Cairo.
The Arabs have indicated they will attend. In Tunis, Mr Yasser Abed Rabbo, a
member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, said
foreign ministers of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon would meet in Beirut tomorrow
for co-ordination talks.
Israel, which has been pressing for talks to be moved from Washington to a
location closer to the Middle East, probably in Europe, has not yet
signalled its acceptance of the date.
The European Community, meanwhile, has indicated that it will invite
Palestinians from outside the occupied territories to talks in Brussels in
May on Middle East economic issues.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Egypt falls into line on censure of Libya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPTIAN officials, who have led a rearguard action to save Libya from
international censure over the 1988 bombing of an American airliner,
appeared to have resigned themselves last night to the passage of UN
sanctions.
Officials were last night signalling that Cairo would reluctantly fall into
line with some of the sanctions provisions, such as an arms and air embargo,
but they were vague as to whether Egypt would also downgrade diplomatic
links with Libya as required by the proposed Security Council resolution.
'My understanding is that we will comply with the resolution,' said a
well-placed official. 'Egypt supports international legality and the role of
the United Nations.'
However, there is no doubt that western determination to press ahead with
sanctions in an effort to force Libya to yield two of its nationals accused
of bombing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie is causing acute discomfort in
Egypt whose diplomacy has, for the past six months, been fully engaged in
efforts to head off just such a development.
Egyptian uneasiness, and indeed misgivings among the pro-western Arabs
generally, stems from a fear that western pressure against Libya will be
portrayed throughout the region as another example of the west seeking to
bully a weak Arab state under the so-called 'New World Order', weighted
heavily towards US interests.
'To Arabs, it appears like the strong imposing its will on the weak under a
new Pax Americana,' said Professor Saad Ibrahim of the American University
in Cairo. 'People are unhappy about the precedent that is being established
and ask where will it end, not that anyone has much sympathy for Gadaffi
himself.'
One western official believes that one of the main problems in what he
described as a 'messy situation' stems from Arab misunderstandings of what
is involved in the due process of law in the west. 'No matter how hard we
try to explain the situation, reactions are emotional,' he observed. 'People
believe what they they want to believe.'
Mr Gamil Mattar, a former senior Arab League official, voiced a common view
among Arab intellectuals when he said there was 'no precedent' for demands
to extradite the Libyan nationals. 'What's the point of delivering these two
people to the US?' he asked. 'This kind of humiliation of the Arabs will
only lead to more violence and terrorism.'
Arab commentators are suggesting the west may be in danger of painting
itself into a corner over the issue of sanctions. Dr Gehad Auda of the
Centre for Political and International Development Studies in Cairo said
that just as the Arabs faced a dilemma over Libya, so did the west.
'What can the US do to oblige Libya to comply?' he asked. 'It cannot use
force. In fact, the US does not know what to do to uphold the norms of the
new international order.'
Egyptian officials say they are hoping for a last-minute compromise before
the sanctions package is due to come into effect on April 15. They are
pinning hopes on the International Court of Justice, which has been asked by
Libya to rule on who might have jurisdiction in the case. But they hold out
little hope of a quick resolution.

DECISIONS on the two largest oil and gas developments in the former Soviet
Union to be undertaken with the participation of foreign oil companies have
again been stalled.
At the same time, however, Russian legislators are drafting a new Oil and
Gas Law which, foreign energy companies hope, will bring order to the
confusing system of decision-making which ensures interminable delays.
The Kazakhstan government has sent a new set of demands to Chevron
Corporation of the US to incorporate into their proposals for the
exploitation of the giant Tengiz oilfield between Omsk and the Aral sea in
the central Asian country. According to the Interfax news agency, these
include cutting the profits share to 13 per cent and increasing the
royalties payable to Kazakhstan to Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14.4bn).
Quoting Mr Kalyk Abdullayev, the deputy prime minister, the agency said that
the republic would also claim increased control over land use and keep all
excess profits accruing from any increase in the price of oil.
He said that the new claims were based on advice from the US investment bank
Goldman Sachs and the UK law company, Slaughter and May.
The Tengiz development is reckoned to increase the republic's oil output to
50m tonnes a year within eight years from its current level of 26m tonnes a
year.
The Russian parliamentary commission reviewing the tender for offshore oil
and gas fields in Sakhalin off the Russian east coast is delaying announcing
any decision because of a 5:3 split against awarding the tender to the
US-Japanese 3M consortium of McDermott, Marathon and Mitsui.

TRADE negotiators in Geneva have failed to meet today's deadline for an
accord on tariffs and services in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, on steel
and on the transatlantic dispute over European subsidies to Airbus
Industrie.
The chances of meeting the Easter deadline for completion of the Uruguay
Round now look remote, and officials are increasingly talking of extending
the talks into the summer, even into next year.
The detailed country-by-country negotiations on reducing tariffs by a target
one-third, and on specific measures to open services markets to foreign
competition, are key ingredients of the Uruguay Round package designed to
put flesh on the bones of the draft 'Final Act' presented last December.
Officials say neither set of talks is likely to make progress until there is
some sign of a breakthrough in the crucial US/EC talks on farm subsidy cuts
in the Uruguay Round.
Talks on a new multilateral code for steel trade continued in Geneva
yesterday and are due to resume today, The Bush administration has indicated
it will not renew US voluntary export restraint agreements (VRAs) on steel
which expire today, but the US steel industry has threatened a barrage of
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits if there is no multilateral code to
replace the VRAs. The proposed code would phase out tariffs and direct state
subsidies to steel over 10 years.
The EC yesterday pledged it would not reintroduce import curbs on steel,
even if talks in Geneva failed to produce an Multilateral Steel Agreement
(MSA) curbing subsidies and other trade distorting measures. Spain, however,
remains the only EC country pressing for protection against imports.
Brazil
EC officials said yesterday that no talks on the US/EC Airbus dispute were
taking place, after inconclusive discussions last week in Washington. The US
is now expected to take its case against Airbus subsidies to Gatt's
subsidies committee.

RUSSIA'S reform programme is too severely market orientated and will cause a
social explosion if it continues to ignore the social and political
dimensions, a group of western scholars has told the Russian government.
The five-strong group said yesterday they had advised Russian leaders 'that
the transformation of Russia cannot be reduced to a transition to the market
economy'.
It is a dramatic sign of the times that foreign experts - including two
American professors - should come to Moscow to admonish Russian leaders for
being too right-wing.
Led by Professor Manuel Castells, professor of sociology at the University
of Madrid, the group had two advisory sessions with Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr
Alexander Shokhin, the two deputy prime ministers, and Mr Genady Burbulis,
the first deputy prime minister (and former instructor in Marxism-Leninism).
The fact that the group secured so much time indicates that the Russian
government is now concerned by the effects of their own policies, and the
lack of governmental power. Prof Alain Touraine, the distinguished French
sociologist, said that 'we told the Russian government: you were right to
break with the existing system and to create a market economy. But it would
be wrong to concentrate only on economic issues and to destroy the state'.
He warned of the dangers in the distancing of the people from the
authorities.
The group's concerns chime with the private views of some official foreign
advisers working in Moscow, including those with the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. They are concerned that the strict application of
monetary and fiscal disipline is not accompanied by adequate structural
changes. In addition, insufficient preparation is being made for the social
protection of those people hit by soaring prices.
Prof Stephen Cohen, who holds the chair of planning at the University of
California at Berkeley (not a popular discipline in contemporary Russia),
told a group of mainly Russian journalists yesterday that 'sometimes in this
great country you people take things too seriously for your own good. You
took the 1917 revolution too seriously and now you're taking the market too
seriously.' Prof Castells said flatly: 'All entrepreneurial classes were
created with the assistance of the state.'
'The most rapidly growing part of the world, in South Asia - Korea, Japan,
Singapore - would not have experienced their economic miracles without the
state. Under present circumstances, a purely liberal policy would not lead
to a market but to a new monopoly formed by the members of the old
nomenklatura.'
All agreed that the bias of foreign advice - strongly orientated towards
rapid market change - was 'distorted'.

FT  31 MAR 92 / EBRD wins credibility with a hard-nosed approach: Initial
scepticism about the bank's special role in eastern Europe has given way to
quiet approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was
launched a year ago, there was one question which Mr Jacques Attali, its
philosopher-president, was repeatedly asked: Was the bank needed?
Many officials in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the
international banking establishment argued at the time that there were
already enough institutions lending to eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
'If the EBRD is to be judged on the sole criteria of simply being another
bank, then it is not needed,' a British banker said. But because the EBRD is
the only international financial institution that has a specific mandate to
establish the framework for a market economy in the former communist
countries of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and within a democratic
environment, the initial scepticism about the bank's role in the
reconstruction of eastern Europe has slowly give way to a growing awareness
that the bank has a special role to play.
The first role is purely commercial. Mr Ronald Freeman, vice-president, and
head of the merchant banking arm of the EBRD, says it is not in competition
with other banks.
'Our job is to attract strong equity partners in order to conclude contracts
in eastern Europe. Every loan must be secured at market rates. We will
syndicate everything. That is how we will keep our feet on the ground,' he
said.
This hard-nosed approach to lending to eastern Europe has reassured its
critics. Large General Motors, and GEC-Alsthom, have invested in eastern
Europe, with co-financing from the EBRD. Capital committed by the EBRD,
combined with commitments made by foreign investors and lenders, total
Ecu2.1bn (Pounds 1.5bn) to the region.
'Large companies are approching us for co-financing because they are still
uncertain about the political and economic climate in eastern Europe and the
CIS,' said Mr Freeman. 'But we cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach to the
region. We have to get on with it,' he added. Mr Freeman also believes the
reduction in export credit guarantees by many western govenrments is making
the EBRD an alternative for foreign investors who want to do business in
eastern Europe but who want the added security the bank can bring to a deal.
But at the same time, the governments of eastern Europe, which are all
represented on the bank, realise that the bank is no 'soft touch'. 'We are
not Santa Claus,' said Mr Attali. 'The republics in the CIS, and the east
Europeans, are beginning to understand that we cannot make promises. They
also understand that taking equity in a company is not the same as extending
subsidies.'
This tough approach is tempered by the development arm of the bank, which,
unlike the merchant banking side, has a much longer-term philosophy. 'We
concentrate on developing the infrastructure to the extent that the EBRD's
environmental, transport and energy policy is aimed at integrating the
countries of eastern Europe with western Europe. This is a very long and
complicated process,' explained Mr Thierry Baudon, director of public
infrastructure, energy, and environment in the development bank. It is this
emphasis on integrating the two Europes which is increasingly shaping the
EBRD's philosophy, and which follows Mr Attali's grand vision of an open,
continental market embracing the former communist states.
'I am very cautious about having a doctrine for the bank,' explained Mr
Attali. 'I realise more and more that even if prices are liberalised in all
these countries, you keep coming up against one basic problem: all these
countries lack a financial sector.'
'The bank underestimated the need for technical assistance in eastern Europe
and the CIS,' he admitted. 'For instance, these countries need a central
bank, a fiscal system, a civil service, a telecommunications network, a
state to collect taxes. These institutions have to be created.
'We must help the countries of the CIS and eastern Europe establish these
institutions within a democratic framework, otherwise there will be no
environment in which the market economy can function.' Officials at the bank
realise they cannot, and do not want to operate alone, especially when it
comes to drawing up long-term policies on the environment, energy,
telecommuncations, and transport in east Europe and the CIS.
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday launched its
first annual report with a plea to European Community countries to open up
their markets to eastern Europe, writes Judy Dempsey. Mr Jacques Attali,
president of the EBRD, said without access to western markets, potential
foreign investors will stay away from the region.
But Mr Attali said it was also necessary to 'have a clearer view of what
kind of investments can be done in order to get eastern Europe out of the
(economic) mess. It is very important to put money into infrastructure
investments.' One project under consideration by the EBRD is military
conversion.
He said the EBRD, which now includes all the countries of eastern Europe and
the Baltic states, and which yesterday formally admitted all the republics
of the Commonwealth of Independent States except Georgia, intends to commit
about Ecu1bn (Pounds 710m) to the region in 1992, and about Ecu2bn in 1993.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Spanish alert after Eta chiefs captured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government was yesterday bracing itself for a possible upsurge
in separatist violence after the arrest in France late on Sunday of the
military high command of the Basque separatist organisation, Eta.
Senior Spanish officials, struggling to disguise their delight at the
capture of Eta's three most wanted operational leaders by French police,
were warning that retaliatory strikes were still possible.
'The operation is still going on . . . but there must not be any euphoria,'
said Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, the Spanish interior minister. 'Eta is still
capable of striking and there will not be any relaxation in our security. If
anything, it will be increased.' He said Spain would try to have the three
extradited.
The capture of the three men is probably the most devastating blow struck by
the authorities against Eta, which has killed more than 700 people in its
20-year struggle for Basque independence. Those held were Francisco Mugica
Garmendia, Eta's military commander and Spain's public enemy number one.
With him were two key lieutenants, Jose Luis Alvarez Santacristina, Eta's
leading ideologue, and Joseba Arregui Erostarbe, alleged by police to be the
group's top bomb-maker.
The organisation has stepped up its campaign this year in the hope of
frightening the government to a negotiating table by threatening to attack
this summer's Olympic Games in Barcelona or the World Fair in Seville. More
than 12 people have been killed this year.
Although the detention of the men was greeted by violent protests in parts
of the Basque country, Madrid is hoping that the removal of the military
leadership might make it easier for more moderate elements in Eta or its
political wing, Herri Batasuna, to make their voices heard.
Nevertheless, Eta leaders have been arrested before and replaced, though the
arrest on Sunday of Mugica means that the last of the organisation's
traditional Marxist-Leninist leaders is now dead or behind bars. But it is
assumed that at least two Eta units will continue to operate in Spain.
Mugica was one of the ideological clique thought to have murdered Eta's
leader, Mr Moreno Bergaretxe, and assumed control in 1974 when he began to
have second thoughts about armed struggle.
That entire clique is now under arrest or dead but one of its members lives
under a form of house arrest in the Dominican Republic. He is Eugenio
Exteveste, whom Madrid sees as the only person moderate enough to negotiate
an end to the fighting and who would still carry some credibility with Eta's
die-hard supporters.

GERMANY said yesterday that most of the 2.4m property disputes in the former
East Germany would be resolved by 1994, bringing the planned completion date
forward from beyond the year 2000, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Hans-Jurgen Schafer, president of the Federal Property Office, said a
planned change in the law setting strict time limits on resolving disputes
would speed up work. Staff have processed just 3.2 per cent of property
claims since unification. The large number of outstanding claims from former
East Germans on expropriations has blocked investment in the depressed
region by overloading the bureaucracy.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVENTEEN of Russia's 20 semi-independent enclaves are expected today to
sign a federal treaty designed to preserve at least the semblance of
Russia's territorial integrity.
But the treaty is being boycotted by Chechnya, Bashkiria, and by Tatarstan,
the largest of the former autonomous republics, which voted 10 days ago to
deal with the Russian Federation on an 'equal basis' but says it will stop
short of outright secession.
The treaty itself may also be less binding than it appears. Mr Ramazan
Abdulatipov, chairman of the Council of Nationalities, one of the two
chambers of the Russian parliament, said yesterday some republics, such as
Kalmykia, would sign with reservations. These would allow republics to reach
deals with Moscow - for instance giving them control over their mineral
wealth or the right to collect taxes.
But whatever its faults, the treaty should provide President Boris Yeltsin
with a badly-needed political success to shore up his position ahead of next
week's Congress of People's Deputies, during which his economic policies
will come under fierce attack.
A negotiated settlement with Tatarstan, allaying fears he is allowing Russia
to break up, should also help buoy his political fortunes. Finally,
agreement with the 17 enclaves could make it easier for the Russian
Federation to adopt a long-delayed constitution, although there are reports
that Mr Yeltsin has ditched the official draft of the document.
Tatarstan's vice-president, Mr Vasily Likhachev, yesterday met Mr Gennady
Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister, for talks on a bilateral treaty.
A similar deal is being sought by Bashkiria, which attended preparatory
talks but has differences over property, mineral resources, budgetary policy
and taxation. Chechnya representatives stayed away. A fourth possible rebel,
Yakutia, said it would sign the treaty if amendments were made on economic
issues.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PACIFIST group has launched a campaign to block the Swiss government's
plan to buy 34 McDonnell Douglas F-18 fighter aircraft for Dollars 2.3bn
(Pounds 1.32bn).
Normally, military programmes in Switzerland are sacrosanct, but the F-18
project has aroused considerable opposition, partly because of its high cost
and partly because of doubts that such a sophisticated aircraft is the right
weapon for the country's future security needs.
A recent opinion poll in the French-speaking part of Switzerland indicated
that 76 per cent of the population opposed the purchase, although 60 per
cent thought an airforce was still necessary.
The government has just approved a new security policy, refocusing the Swiss
Army on international peacekeeping and maintaining order at home in the
event of natural catastrophes or shock-waves from conflicts or disasters in
neighbouring countries.
The possibility of having to repel a determined aggressor is considered
extremely remote.
Two weeks ago, the council of states, the parliamentary chamber reflecting
the views of the 26 cantons, approved the F-18 project. In June, the more
representative national council will have the final say.
Last weekend, the Group for an Army-Free Switzerland set out to raise -
within a month - the 100,000 signatures needed to force a referendum on the
purchase.
It is almost certain to succeed and then it would demand that the cabinet
express its opinion on the referendum before the F-18 issue comes before the
national council.
The referendum itself would have to be held within two years.

FT  31 MAR 92 / Kohl condemns Ozal over his 'Hitler' attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between Germany and Turkey took a further sharp turn for the worse
yesterday when Chancellor Helmut Kohl angrily denounced President Turgut
Ozal for comparing his policy to that of 'Hitler's Germany'.
He issued a formal statement describing the Turkish leader's weekend
interview as unacceptable and 'completely incomprehensible'.
At the same time the row over the alleged use of German-supplied armoured
cars in Turkish actions against Kurdish civilians claimed its first victim
in Bonn, with the sacking of a senior defence ministry official.
Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defence minister, who is facing demands for his
own resignation, said that Mr Wolfgang Ruppelt, head of the ministry's
armaments division, had taken personal responsibility for delivering 15
Leopard tanks to Turkey last year, after the German parliament imposed a ban
on the trade. Mr Stoltenberg's own position remains in doubt.
The bitter confrontation between the two Nato allies has blown up with
extraordinary rapidity, after Germany last week condemned the Turkish
military actions against the Kurds, and suspended all arms supplies to the
country.
President Ozal retaliated at the weekend with an interview with Turkish
journalists, accusing Germany of behaviour 'which corresponds to that of
Hitler's Germany, although under different conditions'.
'Germany regards itself since its unification as a superpower,' he said. 'To
prove that, it is interfering everywhere, which has certainly already been
noticed in Europe. The difference with Hitler's Germany consists in the fact
that today's Germany misuses its economic might, and continually trots out
its threats. Germany will see in a very short time that it has chosen the
wrong path.'
Mr Kohl said the statements were 'unacceptable in both tone and content'. He
had always declared his belief in the tradition of friendship between the
German and Turkish peoples, and therefore particularly cultivated bilateral
relations. He had also particularly worked for the 'constructive
development' of Turkey's relationship with the European Community, the
statement said. One reason for the particular vehemence of the Turkish
reaction to German criticism is the perception that Bonn has been as adamant
as any other EC member in blocking the country's application for EC
membership, out of fear of a flood of future Turkish migrant workers.
In Germany, the use of German arms against the Kurds is a particularly
explosive issue, coming on the eve of two key regional elections in
Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein next Sunday.
The German government has provided Turkey with military assistance worth
DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.92bn) since the mid-1960s, according to Bonn.
This included DM1.5bn worth in connection with the Gulf War - made up of 80
tanks, anti-aircraft weapons and ammunition.

FT  31 MAR 92 / French workers lose their fortress: The closure of the
Billancourt plant signals the end of an era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ERA of French industrial history ends today with the closure of the car
plant on an island in the Seine, at Billancourt, where Renault, the
state-owned car maker, began life 94 years ago.
A white Renault 5, the last vehicle to be made there, came off the
production line on Friday and was yesterday completing technical tests in a
gloomy water-lapped shed.
'It was poignant and pathetic. We felt as if we were taking part in a
funeral,' mourned union delegate Daniel Labbe, one of the last of the
hundred or so workers there.
The Billancourt plant was a dinosaur in the modern car industry, says
Renault. It swallowed components via a narrow bridge, and disgorged them as
vehicles into barges moored against its steep walls. Renault decided to
close the plant with the loss of just over 4,000 jobs two years ago. Output
has been shifted to more efficient sites in north-east France where the
company operates rigorous Japanese-style stock control.
Billancourt's demise symbolises the eagerness of today's French public
sector to break with old traditions. Indeed, the island's stormy life
resembles an alternative history of 20th century France. In 1898, Louis
Renault, founder of the group, assembled a prototype in a shed on the bank,
preserved today as a museum. Seven years later, the company began its first
volume production of a model later known as the taxi de la Marne because of
its role in the First World War when the government commandeered Paris's
entire taxi fleet to carry infantry to fight the approaching Germans. After
the war, Renault became the first French company to accept collective
bargaining with workers, a development of great interest to the future
Chinese Communist leader, Deng Xiaoping, who worked at Billancourt in 1925.
But the plant's fate was anything but heroic. Nazi forces used it as a tank
repair plant during the Second World War. Louis Renault was arrested for
collaboration in 1944 and died in prison a year later. His company was
confiscated and transformed into a regie, the equivalent of a public
utility.
Billancourt returned to its role as a laboratory of social policy after the
war.
Then, the company was run along corporatist lines through tacit agreement
between the Communist-led CGT trade union, the Communist party and the
state. The Kremlin-like hulk was dubbed the 'workers' fortress' by the CGT
which held the balance of power between the state and unions for much of the
plant's life.
It set a pattern of industrial relations different from other western car
companies, at least until the 1980s.
Immediately after the war, the plant produced its first truly mass market
model, the boxy little 4CV, at first available only in the sand yellow paint
captured from Germany's Afrika Corps.
Intense upheaval and strikes followed in the 1960s and 1970s, when
Billancourt was a centre of left-wing politics - once the site of a meeting
between the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and demonstrating workers.
Billancourt's days began to draw to a close from the moment Renault was
transformed, two years ago, from a regie into an autonomous state-owned
company, in theory with less political interference and more freedom to
close inefficient plants.
The European Commission's attacks on state aid and the company's alliance
with Volvo, the private sector Swedish car maker, hastened its shift away
from the Billancourt days and into commercial reality.
The question now is what happens to the site. Less than half an hour from
the city centre and about 1km long by several hundred metres wide, it is
believed to be worth up to FFr10bn (Pounds 1.03bn).
Renault wants to move its company headquarters there, from the ugly
aluminium-clad tower block on a nearby river bank.
The rest of the land would be sold to the highest bidder, to pay for a
Renault technical centre to be built near Paris.
However, the finance ministry says the land belongs to the state.
Billancourt could soon be the site of yet another great battle.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRICTIONS on direct advertising of pharmaceuticals to the public will be
announced today by EC ministers, meeting as the Internal Market Council.
The restrictions are part of a larger package of measures to break down
barriers to the free trade of pharmaceuticals within the EC.
The package, a compromise worked out with the industry since the first
proposals last July, includes measures prohibiting misleading or unclear
advertising for non-prescription over-the-counter drugs.
Pharmaceuticals groups will also have to provide consistent and detailed
information about the contents on packaging. Labels or inserts will have to
describe ingredients and warn of possible side effects.
In addition, drugs companies will be forbidden to offer free samples to
healthcare professionals. However, proposals to ban the sponsorship of
doctors' conferences have been dropped following intensive lobbying.
Wholesalers will also be obliged to keep adequate records of stocks and set
up emergency plans to withdraw products from the market.
The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations, which
represents the industry, was unavailable for comment.
Uniform technical standards for cars will be introduced across the European
Community from January 1, 1993, under legislation to be approved by member
states today, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels.
Internal market ministers will give the formal go-ahead to the remaining
three measures out of a series of 44 on technical standards, and agree a
final framework measure to implement 'whole-vehicle-type approval' in the
Community.
This means that from the end of this year new cars will only have to conform
to one set of standards, checked by one government, instead of having to
seek technical approval under 12 systems. There will be transitional
arrangements for cars which have already been approved by at least one
country.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Euro-commercial Paper: Diversity hampers liquidity growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Euro-commercial paper market may have failed to fulfil ambitions of
matching the Dollars 500bn US CP market for size and liquidity, but it can
at last claim to be a reasonably profitable market for participants, and an
efficient source of funds for rated borrowers.
The level of outstanding Euro-commercial paper is close to Dollars 90bn,
having grown slightly in the last year or so, according to bankers. Mr Len
Harwood, head of capital markets at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects the market
to benefit from a shift of investors towards the short end of the yield
curve. 'The market could grow by around 20 per cent over the next year,'
says Mr Harwood.
However, the lack of a homogeneity, as in the US market, will continue to
hinder the development of a large, liquid Euro-CP market.
Although most programmes are still denominated in US dollars, multi-currency
programmes have become increasingly common. In particular, the portion of
the Euro-CP market denominated in Ecu has risen substantially to around 15
per cent and is set to expand further. At the same time, the liberalisation
of regulations has allowed active domestic commercial paper markets to
develop in a number of European countries, such as France.
Although such diversity could be said to fragment liquidity, it also
increases the market for borrowers.
The Euro-CP market has also become increasingly credit-sensitive, so the
bulk of outstanding paper is rated A1/P1 or above. This has limited the size
of the issuer base, while some borrowers' problems in rolling over
commercial paper has encouraged companies to establish stronger back-up
lines.
However, Mr Warren Spar, managing director at Lehman Brothers, says
'companies are refinancing more expensive, Libor-plus, bank debt in the
commercial paper market'. The trend is selective, though, since 'the
importance of credit rating continues to grow'.
Structural changes have diverted the market from a self-destructive path.
The departure of a clutch of market participants, such as Merrill Lynch and
Warburg, has helped ease excessive competition. Also, the application of a
commission-based structure, similar in concept to the fixed-price re-offer
mechanism in the Eurobond market, has helped restore margins. Fees for
placing commercial paper now average around five basis points.
For large European companies, the US commercial paper market still offers
greater flexibility, because it is bigger and more liquid.
The US CP market is 'an easier market in which to write big tickets,'
according to David Sloper, manager of Abbey National's dollar portfolio.
In the longer term, the trend most bankers hope to see, as deregulation
accelerates, is for the border between US and Euro-CP to blur so that a
global commercial paper market develops.

CONTINENTAL, the world's fourth largest tyre manufacturer which recently won
a protracted fight to remain independent of Italy's Pirelli, reveals a group
net loss of DM128m (Dollars 77.5m) for 1991, Reuter reports from Hanover.
. The loss, much as expected, compares with a net profit of DM93.4m for
1990. Group turnover of the German tyremaker amounted to DM9.4bn, an
increase of almost 10 per on 1990's DM8.55bn. Parent company net loss was
DM417m, against a profit of DM42.2m previously.
Continental's directors ascribed the plunge into the red to high
extraordinary costs linked to the closure of its Barrie, Ontario, plant and
transfers to reserves for restructuring measures.
Parent company results were also depressed by write-offs on the book value
of the US General Tire unit.
But operating profit rose and extraordinary costs fell away, and the group
predicts a return to 'clearly black figures' in 1992.

<TEXT>
HAFNIA, the Danish insurance-based financial services group, has withdrawn a
standing offer to buy any new shares issued by its domestic rival, Baltica,
at DKr1,000 (Dollars 156.25) each. Hafnia gave no explanation for
withdrawing the offer, which was first made in 1990 as part of an
unsuccessful attempt by it to gain control of Baltica.
Hafnia has bought a substantial bloc of shares in Sweden's Skandia as part
of an attempt, with Norway's UNI Storebrand, to gain control of Skandia and
establish a Nordic insurance giant. The two challengers have received a cool
reception from Skandia, although they held further talks on Wednesday.
Baltica Holding, meanwhile, reported a DKr271m (Dollars 42.3m) net profit
compared with a DKr2.04bn loss in 1990. Last year's result was a return on
capital of 3.0 per cent. An unchanged DKr8 per share dividend was proposed.
Life assurance profits rose from DKr199m to DKr466m and accident group
profits from DKr225m to DKr277m. Baltica Bank, however, made a DKr334m loss.

FT  30 MAR 92 / A man with 'petrol in his veins'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ferdinand Piech is a man with 'petrol in his veins', as Die Zeit, the
weekly German newspaper, put it. Eccentric and, by all accounts, prickly, he
is a brilliant engineer who has steered VW's Audi subsidiary into a period
of rising profits with robust, well-styled models at the upper end of the
market.
At a time when the VW group is struggling to curb costs against ever tougher
foreign competition, especially from Japan, the choice of Mr Piech against
the smoother, more communicative, higher profile Mr Daniel Goeudevert, VW
board member, indicates a willingness to tackle the unpleasant work with
renewed energy.
This will include extensive job cuts, especially at VW's high-cost German
plants. As both industry and labour representatives on the supervisory board
backed Mr Piech's appointment, recognition of the scale of VW's problems
obviously goes deep.
In spite of his long career in the car industry, Mr Piech, 54, a keen skier,
jogger, and - of course - fast driver, does not fit the mould of the average
German car manager. He is extremely rich - his fortune is based on his stake
in Porsche, the luxury sports car company, and in the Salzburg-based Porsche
family company, whose activities run from car importing to banking and
hotels.
But he has proved that wealth can also go hand-in-hand with ambition and
innovation. His grandfather was the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, who
designed the VW Beetle car - the foundation of the company's post-war
success - as well as the first sports car under the Porsche name.
Mr Piech has carried on in this tradition. As an engineer, he was involved
in the trailbreaking Audi Quattro sports car, the use of galvanised steel to
prevent rust, and breakthroughs in aerodynamics. Yet this is not to say that
Audi is one long success story. It has never really recovered in the US from
the sales slump caused by allegations of unsafe acceleration, though it was
cleared of these.
Nor is Audi likely to escape the impact of the cost and labour cuts
threatening the German car industry. Even rivals such as Mercedes-Benz and
BMW have made aggressive noises to their workforce. Mr Piech certainly does
not look like the man to shirk a disagreeable task, however uncomfortable it
makes his managers and workers.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Security Pacific broker sold off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITY Pacific, the troubled west coast US bank, last night completed its
divestment of Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, with the sale of Hoare Govett
Asia to the management.
At the same time, the management sold 49 per cent of the company to Guoco
Group - the owner of Dao Heng Bank, a medium-sized Hong Kong bank.
The deal came a month after Security Pacific signed a letter of intent with
ABN-Amro, the Netherlands bank, for the sale of Hoare Govett in the UK and
Europe.
Mr Tony Lowrie, Hoare Govett Asia's chief operating officer, said yesterday
that the deal would enable the broker to relaunch itself as a lead-ing Asian
house, and to strengthen its links with institutions and companies in the
region.
The firm, which will be renamed HG Asia, has eight sales and research
offices in Asia and sales operations in London, New York and Sydney.
No price was given for the transaction, which is conditional upon US
regulatory agencies' approval and an audit.
However, Security Pacific is still likely to have lost more than its total
investment of some Pounds 100m in Hoare Govett. It bought control of the
firm in December 1984 and took full ownership in 1987.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Putting public finances back in the
public eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL five-year-old Jennifer Bennett captured the headlines last week, the
state of Britain's public finances was shaping up as a promising election
issue.
Allegations of a Pounds 11bn 'hole' in the government's finances and concern
that the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement budgeted for
1992-93 might be an underestimate, fuelled fears of an emergency Budget this
summer, irrespective of which party would be in power.
But should the state of the public finances give rise to such concern? It
is, after all, still less than three weeks since the Treasury's 1992 Budget
projections were published. Although the forecast deficits of Pounds 28bn
for 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn for 1993-94 upset the City, the government's
medium-term projections envisage a steady decline in the PSBR to a modest
Pounds 6bn or just 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996-97.
However, in the hot-house atmosphere of the election campaign, the
Treasury's PSBR projections already appear old hat.
One City commentator, Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist of UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, has gone so far as to suggest that 'there is now more than a whiff of
Budgetary crisis in the air'.
He believes that next year's Budget will have to incorporate a Pounds 5bn
net tax increase and that the PSBR - minus privatisation receipts - could be
more than Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 70bn by 1996-97.
Mr Martin's is an extreme view. But other commentators have been scaling up
their PSBR expectations. Mr Michael Saunders, Salomon Brothers' UK economist
in London, forecasts a Pounds 30bn deficit in 1992-93 rising to Pounds 38bn
in 1993-94 and 1994-95, before settling back to Pounds 28bn in 1996-97.
Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs in London, expects the
UK's annual borrowing requirement will stay above 3 per cent of GDP, or
about Pounds 20bn in today's money, throughout the life of the next
government.
The PSBR is notoriously difficult to forecast. The Treasury's own 'Red
Book', published on Budget day, shows that the average error of official
PSBR forecasts over the past 10 years has been Pounds 6.25bn, or 1 per cent
of GDP.
Predicting the PSBR has become even more hazardous in recent years. The
rapid shift from a Pounds 14.7bn budget surplus in 1988-89 to a deficit of
similar ending suggests that its 'cyclicality' has grown, meaning that it is
more prone to wild swings in line with changes in business conditions.
A big increase in self employment in the 1980s has made income tax receipts
more volatile. The changes to corporation tax introduced in the mid-1980s by
the then chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson, have also affected the PSBR.
By moving from 100 per cent investment allowances in the first year to 25
per cent allowances on a declining balance depreciation system, Mr Lawson's
reform ensured a big increase in corporation tax receipts in the years
immediately after its introduction. But companies' allowances have gradually
built up since the mid-1980s, diminishing receipts. This trend coincided
with the transition from boom to recession that has depressed the profits on
which corporation taxes are levied.
On the expenditure side, social security outlays have risen more than might
be expected from the increase in unemployment during the recession.
Government spending on disability and single parent benefits is rising
faster than anticipated.
There is, however, no reason so far to believe that the tax base has shrunk
because of the Lawson tax changes or the recession.
Therefore, the wide variation between the assessment of the Treasury and
some private sector economists of future PSBR trends has to have another
explanation.
To some extent, City economists are more sceptical about the ability of the
next government to keep public spending under control. A more important
consideration is the future path of economic growth.
The Treasury's Red Book expects real growth of 2 per cent in the UK in
1992-93 and growth at an annual rate of between 3.25 and 3.75 per cent in
the four financial years that follow.
Although the growth rates for 1993-94 and after appear ambitious, the length
and depth of the recession will mean that average annual growth over the
business cycle will almost certainly be below trend.
Mr Martin, by contrast, believes that growth is likely to stay below 2 per
cent a year in the medium term, because of insufficient productive capacity
in the economy that will lead to a severe balance of payments constraint.
Mr Martin's analysis is at present a minority view. Certainly nothing since
the Budget is likely to have persuaded the Treasury that its assessment of
the economy is wrong.
It is highly unlikely that officials will be telling the next chancellor
that he must have an emergency Budget this summer. But he will be urged to
keep a close eye on evolving trends.
Away from the hustings, both the Tories and Labour are conscious that their
room for manoeuvre in economic policy will be very limited. Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, has made clear that it could take longer than the
next parliament to establish the new 20 pence tax rate as the basic rate of
income tax.
'Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, insists that his priority is to get
the economy on a sound footing. I'm very keen to see increased social
expenditure, but it must be done at the level which we can sustain,' he said
last week.
Mr Saunders says the winner of the election will be 'on a Budget tightrope'
while Mr Davies believes that the next government has 'about a year's grace'
to bring borrowing under better control.
'It's not a crisis but it is also not comfortable,' is how Mr Saunders sums
up the present state of the public sector's finances.
This year's autumn public expenditure round will therefore be very tough for
whichever party holds office. Its outcome could determine whether the UK
budgetary problems will turn into a crisis.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Volkswagen gears up for cost-cutting: Changes at the top of
German carmaker may herald tough measures for a leaner look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen is a proud company. Its cars, including the popular Golf, are
among the best mass-produced models in the world; its record of innovation
is impressive; and it has a high level of environmental consciousness.
The trouble is that compared with other carmakers, its costs are also among
the highest. This is certainly no cause for pride and clearly influenced
those deciding who should take over the driving seat of the German group.
Thus, Mr Ferdinand Piech, a tough and somewhat caustic car engineer, is set
to take over as the chief executive in nine months.
It has been rumoured for some time that Mr Piech would be favoured over his
rival, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a Frenchman who joined VW two years ago from
the German subsidiary of Ford of the US. Mr Goeudevert, a former Sorbonne
literature professor with unconventional views about the industry, certainly
looked like the heir apparent until Mr Piech's strong engineering
credentials shot him ahead.
Now that Mr Piech, head of the Audi subsidiary, has virtually won the race -
the decision in his favour by a special committee of the supervisory board
still has to be rubber-stamped by the full board on April 10 - the question
is what he will do after Mr Carl Hahn, 65, steps down at the end of this
year.
There is plenty that needs to be done. According to Mr Stephen Reitman,
motors analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew: 'VW has made little
progress in boosting output per employee during a period when substantial
advances have been made by its competitors.' VW, he adds, 'remains the high
cost, high charging producer'.
The original plan was that Mr Hahn, one of the best-known figures in the
German motor industry, should stay on for two years after his normal
retirement date. This would have taken him to the end of 1993.
But those responsible for appointing the top management realised that
competition was becoming fiercer and that drastic steps were needed. 'There
is a growing sense of crisis,' says Mr Reitman. 'The numbers are not adding
up any more.' He estimates that VW's earnings per share slid from DM36 to
DM27 last year, though he expects a slight improvement in 1992. In 1989, the
figure was DM59.
Against this background, it was not surprising that the news of Mr Piech's
takeover as head of the group was coupled with an announcement that 12,500
jobs would be lost from VW's domestic workforce of 130,000 by 1996. VW
insisted that the reduction of 2,500 jobs a year would occur through natural
wastage. It denied a report in Manager Magazin, a German business monthly,
that cuts of 25,000 were planned at west German plants.
VW is not the only German motor company plagued by high costs and a labour
force whose size is out of line with slimmer foreign competition.
Mercedes-Benz is contemplating cuts of around 20,000 people in the next few
years while BMW intends to shed 3,000 people in 1992.
The German motor industry association (VDA) has also warned that job
reductions are inevitable. 'They will be gradual, but over time they will be
substantial,' says Mr Achim Diekmann, managing director of the VDA. In the
last 10 years, other EC members have reduced jobs in the industry by
410,000, while the German industry has had an increase of 79,000.
Components makers have already started cutting employment and shifting more
production abroad in response to increasing competition and the pressing
demands of carmakers for more sophisticated parts and systems at low prices.
In Mr Diekmann's view, the traditional car plants in western Europe, not
just Germany, are under threat from those in newer locations such as Spain
and Portugal; the Japanese transplants in the UK also pose a tough
challenge. VW is trying to combat this by building a new plant in eastern
Germany where it will apply 'lean production' methods, buying into Skoda,
the Czechoslovakian car producer, and teaming up with Ford in Portugal.
It has long been involved in Spain, where it owns the successful Seat
carmaker. VW is also building up its activities in Mexico and China. Apart
from developing new markets, an important reason for this expansion is to
develop output in low cost countries. Altogether, group capital investment
in the next five years will total DM51bn (Pounds 17.9bn).
Inevitably, VW's vigorous foreign expansion has focused a spotlight on cost
levels in its German plants, especially at its Wolfsburg headquarters where
it turns out 4,000 cars daily. Mr Reitman refers to VW's 'ruinously
expensive domestic manufacturing handicap', noting that VW and other
European producers still have to face the full blast of Japanese competition
in the EC.
Mr Goeudevert, the director responsible for the VW marque - accounting for
some 80 per cent of group business - agrees that action is necessary, but
not just at VW. 'Certainly, VW has a cost problem but it is not a typical VW
problem.'
The group has implemented organisational changes to improve financial
transparency and enable it to monitor costs more effectively.
Yesterday, in an apparent extension of this policy, VW said it was
considering the creation of a separate holding company to oversee its
separate VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques. It has also been striving to
ensure that its component plants maintain their costs at competitive levels.
None of this is easy, as Mr Hahn well knows. 'We have to keep the pressure
on VW to maintain world standards and not fall asleep in a captive market,
which is the most dangerous thing that can happen. Everybody - workers, shop
stewards, and managers - know they are being measured by the best
international standards.'
It is these high standards that Mr Piech will have to maintain. But in an
increasingly ferocious and fast-moving industry, he will have to do it at
cost levels which do not leave VW at a severe disadvantage to its
competitors. VW needs to slim down to stay up with the leaders.

FT  30 MAR 92 / TV plan to show company meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES are to be offered the chance of broadcasting their annual meetings
on national television for Pounds 60,000 an hour.
BMH Communications, a company set up by film producer Mr Bryan Hall, has
signed a deal with BBC Select, the corporation's subscription arm, for
access to night-time hours on BBC 1 and BBC 2.
The service, being marketed as The Business Channel, would transmit between
2am and 6am. No decoder or special equipment would be needed. Broadcasts
would be listed in Radio Times.
Detailed talks are already under way with utilities which have large numbers
of individual shareholders following privatisation.
The first deals are expected to be signed soon and broadcasts could go out
before the summer. The Pounds 60,000-an-hour charge will include both the
BBC's and BMH's fees, but not production costs.
The Business Channel will be able to broadcast the full proceedings of an
annual or extraordinary meeting, but says it will not be allowed to
advertise specific products.
Mr Paul Ellis, BMH chairman, said the service could lead to a large increase
in the number of shareholders who could see what was going on at AGMs.
Mr Ellis, a private investor in the scheme who is also a director of Crown
Communications, the company which owns the commercial radio station LBC,
believes the venture could eventually transmit up to 250 hours of broadcasts
a year.
If successful, the scheme could generate additional work for independent
television production companies.
BBC Select has about 2,500 night-time hours a year to use for special and
subscription services.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Germans press for European bank to be sited in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank has launched a strong appeal to EC governments to site the
future European central bank in Frankfurt.
It says such a decision would help establish the institution's
anti-inflationary credentials and persuade a sceptical German public to give
up the D-Mark in favour of monetary union.
Mr Otmar Issing, one of the five top directors of the German central bank,
said in an interview: 'In no other country . . . is the surrender of its own
currency so deeply felt as in Germany'.
The country would have to press on with its efforts to cut inflation before
moving on to European monetary union.
The central bank would start afresh, Mr Issing said. It was important that
it began in a period of stability. 'This can't be achieved if the D-Mark is
weak and German inflation is at 4 per cent.'
A fierce debate has begun in Germany over monetary union and a joint
currency since the Maastricht summit in December
Mr Issing's comments represent the Bundesbank's most forthright intervention
to date over the location of the European central bank (ECB), also sought by
London, Amsterdam, and other cities. They mark a quickening of the debate as
the decision looms on a site for the proposed European Monetary Institute,
the organisation paving the way for the central bank and whose location is
expected to determine where the bank goes.
They also show that the Bundesbank, along with commercial bankers and the
Bonn government, is treating the ECB's location as a question of popular
confidence in Emu throughout the Community.
'One shouldn't underestimate the importance of psychology,' Mr Issing said.
'Stability is regarded as being at one with the D-Mark and Frankfurt. We see
a decision for Frankfurt against this background.
'The conditions for a European currency which is as stable as the D-Mark
will not just be fulfilled by the (ECB) statute, which largely follows the
Bundesbank model, but will also be backed up by people across Europe saying
'this must be done in Frankfurt'.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Business failures up by 4.5%in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS failures in the UK in the first quarter of this year have continued
to rise above the high levels of 1991.
A survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, shows that
14,881 British businesses collapsed during the first quarter, 4.5 per cent
more than the 14,245 failures recorded by the same survey in the last
quarter of 1991.
The current weekly rate of business failures, 1,240, shows a big rise over
the 800-level in the first quarter of 1991.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, stressed yesterday
that in previous recessions the failure rate had peaked some time after a
recovery was under way. 'The larger company has the ability to cut back
fixed costs while the smaller business, so far into the downturn, does not
have that option,' he said.
The survey was drawn immediately into election campaigning when Mr Gordon
Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said it showed that business
failures would exceed 100,000 during the recession, with more than 1m lost
jobs.
'This makes this recession election a referendum on Conservative economic
failure,' he said.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's figures show a slight slowing in the weekly rate of
company liquidations, from 479 to 467, between the last quarter of 1991 and
the first quarter of this year. Individual or small business bankruptcies,
however, rose from 708 to 773 per week.
London and the south-east were the worst-hit areas, with nearly 40 per cent
of all business failures and more than half of liquidations. Business
failures in the south-east, excluding London, were 87.5 per cent higher in
the first quarter of 1992 than during the same period last year.
The next highest rates of increase in corporate liquidations between the
first quarters of 1991 and 1992 were in the West Midlands and Wales. The
lowest were in the East Midlands and Scotland. Bankruptcies rose by more
than two-thirds in all regions except Scotland, where the increase was 29.4
per cent.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Crisis for Israeli government asforeign minister Levy
resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government was plunged into crisis last night when Mr David
Levy, the foreign minister, announced his resignation after launching a
furious attack on Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, for damaging
Israel's relationship with the US and dividing the ruling rightwing Likud
party.
Mr Levy, seething with indignation, transformed a split within Likud ranks
that had been festering for a month into a damaging wound just three months
ahead of the June general election with an emotional and bitter speech to a
meeting in Tel Aviv of his supporters within the party.
'One thing I must certainly do, for the sake of the Likud, for the sake of
days to come, for the sake of the state: I have decided to resign from the
government,' Mr Levy said.
He took care to stress he was not leaving the Likud, as some of his
supporters wanted.
His resignation will not be submitted until next Sunday, leaving time for
efforts to persuade him to rethink, as several senior Likud figures last
night said he should.
But there was no doubt Mr Levy's move was electoral mannah for an opposition
Labour party already marginally ahead of Likud in the opinion polls.
The row began in earnest in February when Mr Levy and members of his Likud
'camp' were reduced to lowly positions in the party's list of candidates for
the election by an alliance between Mr Shamir, Mr Moshe Arens, defence
minister, and Mr Ariel Sharon, housing minister.
Subsequent negotiations to mollify Mr Levy came to nothing. Instead, his
long-standing differences with Mr Shamir, highlighted by the premier's
decision to attend last October's Madrid Middle East Peace Conference as the
Israeli delegation head in Mr Levy's place, were exacerbated.
Mr Levy's anger at the overruling of his more moderate approach to the peace
process by Mr Shamir was clearly evident in his speech last night.
He said the recent deterioration of relations with Washington was a
'fundamental mistake' as there was no substitute for close ties with the US,
which had arranged the peace negotiations on Israel's terms.
Mr Levy also gave vent to the deep resentment he and his supporters - mostly
Sephardi, or Oriental Jews - hold towards what they see as the contemptuous
attitude shown them by Mr Shamir, Mr Arens and Mr Sharon - all Ashkenazi, or
European.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Team short of match practice: Philip Stephens assesses the
calibre of Labour's cabinet-in-waiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They have perfected the art of opposition. In 10 days they may have to start
learning how to govern.
Mr Neil Kinnock and his colleagues are not yet looking beyond the election.
The 13 years spent in the political wilderness has left them too
superstitious to take for granted a fractional lead in the opinion polls.
Last week's row over health reminded them just how easily even the most
professional election campaign can be derailed. So far the Conservatives
have been bruised but not beaten.
The Labour team is conscious also that the approach of April 9 will turn a
harsher spotlight on to just how well-equipped for government is a party
which has not ruled since 1979. Three successive Conservative victories have
given resonance to Labour's claim that it is time for change. The Tory wins
have also provided substance to Mr John Major's charge that the opposition
lacks the calm authority needed to steer Britain in an uncertain world.
If he wins, Mr Kinnock will enter Downing Street with one of the least
experienced teams ever to take office. The Labour leader has been in
parliament since 1970 but has never held a paid government post.
Mr Tony Blair, the aggressively bright employment spokesman, has had a
pivotal role since 1987 in the party's shift to the political centre ground.
He was 16 years old when Labour last won a general election in 1974.
Mr Gordon Brown, the 41-year-old trade and industry spokesman and a
candidate in any future leadership contest, is among the two-thirds of the
party's front bench team who have never experienced life at Westminster with
Labour in power.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy
leader, are alone among elected members of the shadow cabinet in having sat
around the real cabinet table in 10 Downing Street.
The sober-suited guardian of his party's painfully reconstructed economic
strategy, Mr Smith would find the transition easy. He is instinctively
conservative, a creature of government rather than opposition.
The exhaustive review of policies which followed defeat at the last election
in 1987 has persuaded Mr Kinnock that he leads an opposition as well
prepared as any in history. Behind a slim manifesto lie a clutch of detailed
documents setting out an agenda stretching far beyond a single term in
office.
In the first year alone the manifesto promises an economic recovery
programme, devolution for Scotland, a freedom of information bill, repeal of
the council tax, reversal of the Tory health service reforms, an overhaul of
training and education policies and a statutory minimum wage.
The review - the route through which Mr Kinnock dumped his party's
ideological baggage - forced Labour to map out in detail the alternatives
both to its own socialist past and to the Tory agenda.
But overwhelmingly the politicians who would be charged with implementing
this programme are men and women whose experience has been shaped by the
priorities of opposition rather than of practical policy-making.
The cabinet would be undeniably Mr Kinnock's. The mutterings about his
leadership which have surfaced when Labour has lagged in the opinion polls
have not weakened his grip on the leadership. Mr Smith is more popular with
the voters, but nine years as leader have tightened Mr Kinnock's grip on the
levers of power.
That authority does not mean his government would be shaped entirely in his
own image. Once installed in Downing Street a Labour leader can choose his
team, but the cabinet he starts with is the one elected in opposition by the
party's MPs.
Mr Kinnock's team is young - most are in their 40s or early 50s - and
overwhelmingly the product of the very grammar schools the party is pledged
to abolish. But it is far from uniform in style or outlook.
The abrasive self-confidence of Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign
secretary, contrasts with the softly-spoken obscurity of Mr David Clark, the
agriculture spokesman. The self-effacing style of Mr Donald Dewar, the
spokesman for Scotland, is offset by the explosive unpredictability of Mr
John Prescott, the transport spokesman.
Mr Hattersley, guaranteed the Home Office as well as the deputy leadership,
has an awkward habit of reminding more technocratic colleagues that the
party remains committed to greater equality as well as to competent economic
management. His relationship with Mr Kinnock is sometimes cool but friends
insist there are fewer divisions on the central policy issues which would
confront a Labour government than Mr Hattersley's less cautious rhetoric
implies.
Mr Kaufman, promised the foreign office after extricating the party from the
minefield of unilateral disarmament, does not slot easily into any cliques.
Widely credited with describing the party's isolationist 1983 election
manifesto as the 'longest suicide note in history', his approach to foreign
policy is both pro-Nato and pro-European. The social chapter of the
Maastricht Treaty and economic and monetary union would be embraced as part
of a strategy to 'promote Britain out of the European second division'.
There are few traces in the shadow cabinet of the factionalism and
left-right divisions which bedevilled the governments of Mr Harold Wilson in
the 1960s and 1970s.
But Mr Robin Cook and Mr Bryan Gould, responsible for health and the
environment respectively, might prove powerful advocates of a strategy to
rediscover in government some of the radicalism the party has suppressed in
opposition.
Mr Frank Dobson, the energy spokesman and Mr Michael Meacher, responsible
for social security, fall into a loose left of centre category, as do Ms
Anne Clywd and Ms Jo Richardson, entrusted with overseas development and
women's affairs. Mr Meacher, mistrusted in the leader's office, would be
among the most likely casualties of any early reshuffle.
More broadly, there is private acknowledgement that some of the policy
tensions which have been suppressed willingly in opposition could quickly
re-emerge in government.
The commitments pencilled in by Mr Smith in his shadow Budget may not
satisfy the expectations of many of those running Whitehall spending
departments.
Colleagues believe that Mr Kinnock's refusal to contemplate any devaluation
of sterling reflects a private as well as public conviction. But if the
economic outlook proved to be as gloomy as it now looks, there might be
dissenting voices in his cabinet. On their past records, Mr Cook and Mr
Gould would not share the view that the pound's value was sacrosanct if the
price was a retreat from a stronger welfare state.
But Mr Kinnock's cabinet would not be a government bursting with radicalism.
His long, often embarrassing, journey from the rebellious left to the
centre-right of his party has obscured a new-found conservatism. The
politician who in 1981 was too busy to attend Prince Charles's wedding is
now prepared to boast of his visits to Windsor Castle.
Earlier advocacy of a command economy cut loose from Brussels has been
replaced by a conviction that Germany and France are the appropriate models
now for a Labour Britain. A vibrant manufacturing sector has replaced
equality as Mr Kinnock's Holy Grail.
Close friends predict that once in Downing Street Mr Kinnock would combine a
tight grip on his cabinet with a 'conventional' relationship with the civil
service establishment. A shadow cabinet colleague says: 'He would want above
all to prove that he was up to the job.'
The scars inflicted by the strife within his party have also brought with
them a streak of authoritarianism. Mr Kinnock puts a premium on loyalty. He
is contemptuous of those who prefer the 'self-indulgence' of dissent.
His aides are understandably resentful of any comparison with Mrs Margaret
Thatcher's autocratic style. They insist that the question he asks is not
'Are you one of us?' but rather 'Can you deliver?'
Mr Kinnock's instinctive conservatism would be shared by the most powerful
figures in a Labour cabinet.
There have been tensions between Mr Kinnock and Mr Smith. The shadow
chancellor is not shy about acknowledging his immense contribution to the
party's bid for power. He has powerful backing from Mr Jack Cunningham, the
campaign co-ordinator who would expect to become leader of the House of
Commons. But personal rivalries between them have not spilled over into
fundamental policy differences.
The industry and the employment spokesmen are among prospective members of a
powerful inner cabinet promoting Mr Kinnock's vision of European-style
social democracy. Mr Brown, responsible for the interventionist industrial
strategy at the heart of Labour's economic programme, is a close, if
sometimes competitive, ally of the shadow chancellor. Mr Blair has
demonstrated by reshaping the party's industrial relations strategy that
youth and a public school background are no obstacle to his handling of the
trades unions.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, once a left-wing firebrand but now charged with
maintaining a tight grip on the purse-strings as shadow chief secretary,
completes the team of 'realists' in control of economic policy.
Mr Cook and Mr Gould have a different relationship with Mr Kinnock. Both at
times have been among his most strongest supporters. Both on other occasions
have fallen out with him. To some in the leader's inner circle Mr Cook's
advocacy of electoral reform and Mr Gould's residual Euro-scepticism make
them too 'independent-minded'.
But along with Mr Jack Straw, the education spokesmen, both Mr Cook and Mr
Gould meet the criterion of politicians who can deliver.
Deliver, that is, in opposition. For now Mr Kinnock can claim nothing more
for any in his team. They jettisoned the old ideologies and crafted a set of
policies which has made Labour electable. They have mastered the art of
political point-scoring. But if he wins on April 9, Mr Kinnock may well
discover than that the realities of life in government are harsher still.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Personal View: A sensible bank merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR KIT MCMAHON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recently announced intention of the Midland and Hongkong banks to merge
raises questions about the future of British banking. I shall discuss two of
them, but in doing so I may not be able to display the appropriate degree of
objectivity. Having spent much effort trying to bring this merger about, and
having apparently failed 18 months ago, the possibility that it might now
actually occur fills me with a pleasure as intense as it is wry.
The first question is: if the UK is over-banked, would not an intra-market
merger be strategically better than one with an overseas bank? The second is
whether, in view of so many mistakes, banks are wise to aspire to global
status rather than stick to their back yards?
Is the UK over-banked? If one thinks of personal banking services, the
answer must be yes. Including building societies, there are some 650
institutions operating some 20,000 branches engaged in selling and
processing a limited range of inherently simple products for the personal
customer: loans, including mortgages; deposits; the receipt and payment of
cash and the transfer of monetary claims and liabilities.
With most institutions having a small share of the market for these products
(even Barclays, the biggest UK clearer, has less than 14 per cent of
deposits) there could be many mergers before problems with the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission would arise on this count.
Individual mergers could help to reduce the duplication of resources. But
they could provide only a partial solution because the problem arises less
from the number of players than from the wasteful way in which the industry
distributes its products. Few personal banking services require either a
visit to a branch or the kind of paper and labour intensive processing now
done in branches.
It will be a long time before the revolution in methods of distribution is
complete, but the elements of a solution are already visible: automated
teller machines; telephone and postal banking; centralised processing and
electronic transmission networks. In the end, it will be the application of
technology, money and imagination more than greater concentration which will
reduce the economic waste in distributing personal banking services.
For the banks' corporate customers, the picture is different. The UK already
has one of the most concentrated corporate banking industries in the world.
If NatWest's existing share of the small business market were to emerge now
as the result of a proposed merger, it is very unlikely that the MMC would
allow it. For the handful of banks in this market, it is hard to avoid both
bad debts and criticism. (Abbey National's shareholders must be praying that
they do not try to enter it). There are doubtless many ways in which banking
support to the corporate sector could be improved, but it is hard to believe
that further reducing customers' already limited choice is one of them.
For the largest companies, including the multinationals, the picture is
different again. Competition to provide banking services to these clients
has been worldwide and intense. Corporate treasurers have played banks off
against each other, driving margins down to derisory levels, while economic
conditions and management errors have led to some significant losses for the
world's largest banks. There must be a temptation for a big bank to withdraw
from this field altogether.
But generally, this cannot be a correct response. Business, even
medium-sized business, is becoming increasingly international. Some banks at
least will have to follow it. Within a decade, there may be perhaps a dozen
or so truly global players. And conditions are already changing to make
their role a profitable one. Multi-banking without loyalties does not look
so smart for a company when the going gets rough. There is now a clear move
back to relationship banking. The recent behaviour of the Japanese banks
(everyone in - everyone out) has been an object lesson.
A merger between the Hongkong Bank and Midland would mean that the UK would
have three truly international banks. And the new bank would probably be the
only non-Japanese global bank with a substantial presence in Asia, the
fastest growing area in the world.
Of course, as in any industry, global size has its risks. The
decentralisation of management that is essential carries dangers of loss of
control, which can be especially serious for a bank. Financial and credit
controls will have to be tight. But size can convey great advantages. For
Hongkong/Midland, the integration of their worldwide treasury operations and
their correspondent banking and trade services would be very valuable. Size
and geographical spread would enable them to serve corporate customers
particularly well. And capital strength would help with credit rating and
Midland's ongoing attempts to rationalise and reduce the cost of its retail
banking.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: New violin concertos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new violin concertos by Dominic Muldowney and Robin Holloway, premiered
in the last fortnight by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the BBC
Philharmonic respectively, are big, ambitious pieces, each an important
staging post in its composer's development. But there the similarities begin
and end. For where Muldowney's work represents a genuinely fruitful attempt
to revivify the concerto tradition, and to create something live and dynamic
out of the traditional opposition of soloist and orchestra, Holloway's seems
more concerned with nostalgic backward glances, fondly and elegantly
exploring a lost expressive world without ever colonising new territory of
its own.
Though it was completed more than two year ago, Muldowney's concerto is the
the most elaborate to date of his experiments in rhythm and in combining
different strands of tempo. Here the orchestra is divided left and right
into two ensembles, each with its own conductor and set of metronome speeds
laid down by computer-generated click tracks. At some points the two groups
have totally independent material, at others they share, while the soloist
holds the ring between them, looking from one to the other to take tempo
cues, siding first with one and then the other.
It takes us away, says Muldowney, 'from the 19th-century notion of the
solitary hero struggling against the rest and towards that now common
dilemma, a choice between two.' He is so adroit in handling his rhythmic
constructs that it's the almost theatrical vividness of these shifting
liaisons and the teeming invention of the music that is projected, hardly
ever the mathematical complexity. So though the components of the slow
movement concern themselves with the tempo ratio of 499: 500 the music
emerges untrammelled, as a shining rhapsody with the soloist's lyrical
subtley inflected lines spun across a gentle, fluctuating accompaniment.
There are three movements, but the concerto is also conceived as a giant set
of seven variations on the same Bach chorale Es ist genug that dominates the
finale of Berg's concerto. In this case though the effect is not at all
valedictory. The first movement moves through a kaleidoscope of rhythmic
relationships, taking up the first five variations which outline a waltz at
one point, a kind of scherzo at another, and always etching the solo line
sharply against the busy orchestral detail until it is overwhelmed in the
last section. Then after the beautifully poised slow movement, the finale,
another single variation, careens along as a toccata while the tempo
constantly changes and the textures gather themselves, fall apart and
reform.
The performance had been splendidly prepared; the composer and Libor Pesek
took charge of the bifurcated Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and Tasmin
Little was a compelling soloist, astonishingly assured in a part that
requires her constantly to change tack and yet preserve her poise and sense
of proportion. It's undoubtedly a work with which she should gain a stack of
engagements.
*
Holloway's concerto is a good deal more straightforward, and for all its
incidental beauties, finally lacks a distinctive character. Holloway
declares it to be a homage to the French tradition, burying away a Faure
song at its emotional centre and it certainly provides the soloist - Ernst
Kovacic, for whom Holloway wrote his winning violin Romanza 15 years ago -
with succulent, grandly expressive opportunities. Yet Holloway's gentle
reflections and tonal shifts evoke other references - back to Elgar in the
fruitiest passages, to Berg in its more bittersweet moments. It is all very
pleasant and easy on the ear with a refinement and discipline which some of
Holloway's recent music has lacked. But unlike the Muldowney it never leaves
the impression that there are yet more rewards hidden beneath the surface,
awaiting discovery.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: A giant in Tokyo - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo last year had an operating budget of 7.5 trillion yen. This year the
tax revenues have declined for the first time for 36 years, but you would
hardly call it a recession, the actual drop in income being a minute 0.2 per
cent from the year before. What does the city Governor do when he is so
agreeably flush with funds? The answer in the case of Governor Suzuki was to
embark on an astonishing building campaign. This great public programme was
carried out with no increase in taxes and no deficit financing.
The major monument of this era of public spending is the new Tokyo City Hall
 -officially known as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office - in the
Shinjuku district of the capital. The architect, Kenzo Tange, was chosen by
way of a competition. Tange became world famous for his Tokyo Olympic
stadiums for the 1964 Olympics. These are still remarkable buildings that
achieve a sublimation of high-technology structures into elegant forms,
evocative of traditional buildings.
The City Hall is a giant. The great mass of the lower floors rises and then
splits into two towers that climb to a height of 243 metres. There is a
second tower block that rises to a mere 163 metres and a lower complex,
housing the Assembly which is built around a Siena-like fan-shaped city
square. Scale is what is impressive here. It is manifested not only in the
towering height but also in the generosity of the public spaces. The
Citizens Lobby is like a giant film set of a public building. Hostesses in
navy blue uniforms wave you with white-gloved hands towards the mirrored
doors of the lifts. Parties of neat Tokyo school children are swept up to
the top floors to enjoy the domed observatory floor where, according to the
publicity leaflet they can enjoy 'a panoramic view of Tokyo and think about
and understand Tokyo and the metropolitan administration.'
This is the kind of architecture that is designed to make you feel big and
proud - and it works. The towers are the best part. I thought the Assembly
Hall was disappointing. Although rich in marble and thick in carpet, it is
bland in colour and strangely dominated by the empty symbol of an onyx
rising sun. Interestingly enough, the City Hall is much more fun for the
public visitor than for the elected officials. Perhaps that is the right way
round.
Another aspect of the spending boom is the provision of sport and
educational facilities. Four of these have been designed by Fumihiko Maki, a
Tokyo-born architect who trained in the US and spent some time working in
America for the Skidmore Owings and Merrill practice. His Metropolitan
Gymnasium is an exotic, almost organically formed creation with a
dramatically shaped metal roof. It stands as part of a public complex with a
large swimming pool also designed by Maki, as was the adjoining University
Music School. At the Gymnasium I felt the influence of Eero Saarinen - there
was certainly more than a touch of the Kennedy airport TWA terminal about
the flying roof. The fourth Maki creation close to this complex is the
Technology Museum (Tepia), which is more straightforwardly modern but
benefits from the use of water at its entrance and the sheer elegance of its
cutaway elements.
Throughout these projects there is also something that is very distinctive
in Japan - simple and beautiful landscaping. Much of the urban landscaping
is hard, using granite or other stone pavings and restrained planting.
Fumihiko Maki is in the big league of modern architects - he is very good
but, like many things in modern Tokyo, he is not above the influence of
trend and fashion. His 'spiral' building follows the pointless American
trend of 'deconstruction' - cutting away the skin of a building to show its
inner parts. This is frequently done at the corners to show that the
structure supporting the edifice has nothing to do with the walls. Observers
looking at deconstructed architecture are left to shrug their shoulders and
say 'so what?'.
Fashion can be an influence for quality - if it rises above mere trend.
There is no doubt that one architect in Japan at the moment is both high
fashion and serious quality and that is Tadao Ando. His work is tough and
serious, austere and cold. He is the master of smooth concrete and of
defensive planning which creates houses within high walls, where they calmly
create their own world away from the frantic city. His plans show a
fascination with the intriguing spaces that are made when the square sits
inside the circle. I visited one of his recent Tokyo creations that seemed
to sum up his essential skills as well as his sense of what is chic.
La Collezione is a group of Italian fashion stores gathered together in a
small Ando building. Clothes, hairdressing, a gymnasium and health club all
huddle within one of Ando's circular concrete, almost fortified, walls.
Access to some of the shops is by lift or a climb up a sweeping spiral
stair. All is minimal and grey, but it is tres chic. Ando is aware of the
noise and visual chaos of much of modern Tokyo and so he fortifies his
clients - some may say he almost entombs them - to allow the creation of
internal,concealed, neutral places in the city.
One imported architect from Italy, Mario Bellini, working with the Obayashi
Design Department, has brought another kind of stylish architecture to
Tokyo. His Tokyo Design Centre has just opened, and it is a brilliant
insertion into the city street. Maximising on the difficulties of the steep
site he has put a staircase (another scala reggia) that is partially open to
the elements through the centre, allowing access at all levels and giving
the impression of a steep Italian street in Tokyo. More than a gesture, it
leads the eye to the sloping garden where Bellini has placed one of his
famous equestrian sculptures.
Tokyo is rich in good new architecture. It is also visually exciting in
rather outrageous ways. There is a lot of sudden colour: the luminous
lime-green public telephones, for instance (there are also some searing pink
ones); uniformed workers at petrol stations who appear to have stepped from
some space programme, gleaming in pink and silver; fluorescent madness in
the pachenko parlours (Japanese equivalent of fruit machines); and the
delicate eruption of a mass of coloured umbrellas the moment it rains or
snows. Tokyo offers tension and creation and energy that have clearly
inspired its contemporary architects. If you look hard, the tradition of
Japanese minimal elegance can still be found. The city can produce an
amazing mixture of restraint and madness.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York: Debt shakes a Dollars 20bn edifice to its
foundations - The Reichmann brothers built a property empire on drive and
debts. But O&amp;Y, headed by chief executive Paul Reichmann, faces a financial
crisis. Next week, its bankers meet to bail it out

MR PEN KENT is inured to companies running into difficulties. As a director
of the Bank of England, his job is to prevent a corporate drama becoming a
banking crisis.
But even he was shocked by what he was told a fortnight ago by Mr John Crow,
the governor of the Bank of Canada.
Olympia &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer with debts in excess
of Dollars 20bn, had run out of cash.
The company, Mr Kent was told, had two immediate problems:
Institutional investors were balking at being asked to repurchase hundreds
of millions of dollars in commercial paper or debt securities, as they fell
due for redemption;
Cash was urgently required for the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project, Europe's
biggest office development, in London's Docklands. A Pounds 40m first
payment was due at the end of March for the Jubilee Line underground railway
link extension to central London, crucial to the whole project.
'Until then, O&amp;Y's had funded all these cash demands from rents and assets
sales,' says one banker. 'But it was having trouble selling assets. O&amp;Y was
caught in a vice.'
The alarm bells had started ringing on February 13, when Canada's Dominion
Bond Rating Service downgraded the rating on one of O&amp;Y's commercial paper
offerings.
The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada were afraid of the consequences
if O&amp;Y defaulted on any significant payments.
If banks had panicked, the stability of the financial system would have been
at risk, said to one regulator.
The cash crisis was the result of years of relentless expansion by Toronto's
secretive Reichmann brothers, who had transformed a small tile-importer into
a property empire spanning two continents and financed largely by debt.
It also underlined what many bankers seemed to have ignored: that the three
brothers, famous for sealing their deals with a handshake, were not immune
to the ups and downs of the marketplace.
By the time the two central bankers spoke, O&amp;Y's debt had reached a
staggering USDollars 20bn. The sheer scale of the debt came as a shock to
O&amp;Y's banks.
The fact that the Reichmanns kept their cards so close to their chests, once
part of their mystique and perceived strength, may yet return to haunt the
many banks and other institutions who lent them money.
'All the people who bought O&amp;Y's bonds and lent money did so without knowing
the full story,' says one Toronto real estate adviser. Banks lent for
specific property developments and were not given information on how much
had been borrowed elsewhere for other projects.
In the week following the first alert, Mr Kent and Mr Crow kept in constant
touch. They also alerted the Federal Reserve in New York.
Banks on both sides of the Atlantic were coralled into providing more than
Pounds 100m in emergency loans to meet bills falling due in the coming
month. Separate bank facilities were arranged to redeem the commercial
paper.
The bankers finally came to a startling realisation. A fundamental
restructuring of O&amp;Y's debt was needed to tide the company over the deep
property recession in the UK and north America.
The reorganisation of O&amp;Y's borrowings will be the biggest corporate
restructuring, dwarfing even last year's reorganisation of the Dollars 8bn
of debt in Mr Rupert Murdoch's media business, News Corporation. As one
banker puts it: 'O&amp;Y's debts are not so different from those of a
medium-sized country.'
The banks are bracing themselves for further shocks when they are supplied
with detailed financial information on O&amp;Y once the restructuring process
gathers pace. Some of them now suspect that O&amp;Y's assets, ravaged by the
slump in property values, might not cover these debts. Three senior bankers
estimated this weekend that O&amp;Y's mortgages in New York alone could be up to
Dollars 1bn more than the current market value of the properties on which
these debts are secured.
The biggest surprise, according to one financier, may stem from O&amp;Y's
off-balance sheet liabilities, in the form of interest and currency swaps -
two sophisticated but risky financial tools much used by the Reichmanns.
One O&amp;Y adviser notes that currency hedges are used in one of the mortgages
for New York's four-building World Financial Centre complex. The principal
was denominated in Japanese yen and the interest is payable in US dollars.
That particular swap generated profits for O&amp;Y, but others are thought to
have been less successful.
Another undisclosed but significant form of O&amp;Y's borrowing is the so-called
'vendor take-back mortgage', under which those who sold properties to O&amp;Y
provided loans to finance the deals.
Bankers are hopeful that none of them will face financial difficulties. Mr
Allan Taylor, chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, one of the company's
biggest creditors, said last week: 'The O&amp;Y problem is not life
threatening.'
One executive with close knowledge of O&amp;Y's 100 or so banks, says that the
biggest lender to O&amp;Y is the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with Dollars
1bn in debt. Royal Bank of Canada has Dollars 750m; Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, Dollars 700m; Citicorp, the US bank, around Dollars
500m; Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, Dollars 350m; Bank of Nova Scotia,
Dollars 300m; Bank of Montreal, Dollars 300m; and Chemical Bank, also of the
US, Dollars 200m.
For years, the Reichmanns commanded a level of respect - almost awe -
bestowed on few other leading business figures. But how were they able to
borrow so much when they shared so little information with outsiders?
One US banker says: 'You have to understand that in the past, Paul Reichmann
(O&amp;Y's chief executive) just had to make a telephone call. The man had a
magic touch. He is very modest, very talented and a relentless salesman.'
The Reichmanns' unobtrusive manner, their sobriety and their legendary
reputation for always keeping their word - not to mention their spectacular
early successes - fostered a rock-like confidence both in north America and
abroad. Any deal with O&amp;Y was thought to be a safe deal.
Living secluded lives in Toronto's Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood, near the
intersection of Bathurst Street and Glencairn Avenue, Albert, Paul and Ralph
Reichmann have never been social climbers, nor are they part of Canada's
business mainstream. Their enormous houses are within walking distance of
each other, although even the most senior executives of their non-real
estate companies are rarely, if ever, invited to their homes.
The scale of the Reichmanns' ambitions since they arrived in Canada from
Tangiers in the late 1950s is, literally, monumental.
Besides the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project in east London, - O&amp;Y owns about
40 office buildings in north America, with 40m sq feet of space. It is the
largest office landlord in New York and Toronto.
O&amp;Y also has a 35 per cent stake in Calgary-based Trizec Corp, north
America's largest publicly-listed real estate company, and a minority
interest in Catellus Development of San Francisco, a leading west coast
housing developer.
Trizec alone owns more than 300 buildings. Their 113m sq ft of rentable
space would fill 25 complexes the size of the existing buildings at Canary
Wharf. Trizec also owns 25 per cent of The Rouse Company, one of the US's
biggest shopping-mall developers.
The Reichmanns also have vast interests outside the real estate industry.
The business from which it all started, Olympia Tile, has grown into one of
north America's biggest tile and carpet distributors.
The brothers own 82 per cent of Abitibi-Price, one of the world's biggest
newsprint producers, and are the largest single shareholders in Santa Fe
Energy, a US oil and gas producer, and Santa Fe Pacific, whose businesses
range from railways to gold mining.
The privacy of their home lives is replicated by an obsessive secrecy in
their business dealings. O&amp;Y is a privately-held family company. The board
consists of the three Reichmann brothers, their wives and four trusted
lieutenants recruited from O&amp;Y's auditors more than 20 years ago.
The driving force is Paul Reichmann. One businessman who knows him well
says: 'Paul is a very likeable man - but behind the friendly exterior, there
is a really tough man. He has enormous inner drive and commitment. He has no
time for small talk.'
Paul Reichmann insists on being consulted on the smallest decisions
affecting parts of the business empire.
One executive who worked with him says: 'Paul knew every detail. He knew the
type of marble, the mouldings on the iron work, the design of the hall and
shops, the terms of every funding structure. He really understands the
nitty-gritty'.
But his refusal to delegate may also be a weakness.
'He was taking too many decisions himself. There was no management structure
in place,' says one executive.
The Reichmanns made their mark in the late 1970s by paying rock-bottom
prices for the so-called Uris package of eight buildings in Manhattan. The
Dollars 320m portfolio grew ten-fold in value over the next decade, and the
swelling cash flow from the buildings allowed O&amp;Y to diversify.
Their star rose further with their far-sighted decision in the depths of the
1981-83 recession to press ahead with the construction of New York's World
Financial Centre. The aura of invincibility created by these early successes
has tended to overshadow later mistakes.
In 1989, O&amp;Y lost millions by riding to the rescue of Campeau Corporation,
the Canadian real estate company that had overstretched itself by buying two
US retail groups. A former business associate says: 'The Campeau deal was a
turning point. It was a deal Paul didn't want to do, he did it to help out a
friend. It was a deal too far'.
O&amp;Y also gambled on Olympia Place in Orlando, Florida, by building on the
outskirts of the city. Today the building is 28 per cent vacant.
Many of O&amp;Y's non-property investments have turned out to be less successful
than the Reichmanns would have hoped. as the accompanying table shows.
But at the heart of O&amp;Y's financial problems is what could turn out to be
its biggest miscalculation - the Pounds 3bn project to develop the Canary
Wharf office complex in east London's Docklands in 1987, just as the London
property market was reaching its crest.
The Reichmanns misjudged the severity of the London market's decline again
in 1988 and 1990, when they bought stakes in the London developers, Stanhope
and Rosehaugh.
Canary Wharf remains a substantial cash drain. O&amp;Y wooed tenants to the 4.5m
sq ft Canary Wharf complex with generous incentives. However, 40 per cent of
the building is empty and may remain so for some time.
Cash generated in north America has also been under pressure. As the
recession has taken its toll, vacancy rates have risen.
Perhaps the starkest example of this is ITT's former head office at 320 Park
Avenue, New York. With the exception of a small BMW showroom on the ground
floor, the black-and-grey steel tower, adjacent to the Waldorf Astoria
hotel, is deserted .
Generally, however, O&amp;Y has been astute in its choice of sites, and this may
yet help the Reichmanns.
As the figures above (compiled after extensive inquiries by the Financial
Times in cities across north America) show, their record as landlords is no
worse, and sometimes better than average.
Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York who heads the group's US
operations, says that, excluding the ITT building which represents their
biggest failure so far, O&amp;Y's vacancy rate in New York averaged only 10 per
cent last December. Even if no expiring leases are renewed this year, the
vacancy level would rise to only around 15 per cent.
But the bald figures tell only half of the story. As the market slumped,
landlords were forced to cut rents to keep existing tenants, and to offer
juicy incentives to attract new ones.
Nominal asking rents may be Dollars 20 or Dollars 30 a square foot in rent,
but concessions can mean that tenants get the first three to four years of a
10-year lease virtually rent-free.
On top of that, the landlord also pays the service charges and taxes, which
in New York can cost Dollars 15 per sq ft even before financing costs. Cash
flow projections made two or three years ago have become meaningless.
With rents under pressure, the Reichmanns have also found that they can not
easily dispose of assets to raise cash. The New York property market remains
flat, with values now 30 to 40 per cent below their 1987 peak. Most property
investors and bankers predict that values will not recover for another three
years.
Even at depressed prices, there are few buyers for large, downtown office
blocks. The same applies to O&amp;Y's non-property investments. The stake in
Interprovincial PipeLine, which is being sold to finance the forced
retirement of the commercial paper programmes, fetched a price below the
prevailing market level.
Until this latest crisis, the Reichmanns had been able to raise cash by
seeking private partners for their projects.
They did a deal late last year under which Hong Kong magnate, Mr Li Ka Shing
will help finance the renovation of 60 Broad Street in New York, in exchange
for a 49 per cent equity stake. At the time, a joint statement said the
transaction signalled 'an important strategic alliance'.
Mr Li may yet end up buying more O&amp;Y assets. But in the short term, the
Reichmanns' fate depends on the progress of debt restructuring talks.
Representatives of 20 big international banks will meet in Toronto on April
6 to discuss the debt restructuring.
The banks will be forced to make sacrifices. In any restructuring, the banks
will have to provide more money to O&amp;Y to allow the completion of
developments such as Canary Wharf.
They will be forced to defer interest payments until the property market
recovers and O&amp;Y's rental income increases. If they become particularly
pessimistic about O&amp;Y's prospects for generating income, they may have to
convert some debt into equity. They may also find themselves owning some of
O&amp;Y's buildings which would be hard to sell in the present slump.
Although there is a risk that banks with small exposures will demand
immediate repayment - which could sink O&amp;Y - most bankers, property
investors and regulators agree that the property empire is probably safe.
There will be immense pressure from regulators on all banks to toe the line.
In one sense, O&amp;Y's weakness - the size of its debt - is also its strength.
The collapse of the O&amp;Y empire would cause unbearable losses.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York: Canary Wharf, a project too far?
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YERBA BUENA, a huge 87
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
acre redevelopment in a run-down part of San Francisco, should have been
O&amp;Y's next showcase.
Described as the 'last prime site' in San Francisco, it was large and bold
enough to change the face of a major city.
But after a string of missed deadlines and reprieves, O&amp;Y has lost its
rights to build two skyscrapers and an entertainment complex. O&amp;Y must now
find Dollars 2m by July or lose its right to build a 750,000 sq ft office
tower.
O&amp;Y's attempt to hold on to the last vestiges of its original involvement in
Yerba Buena is a long way from its first mega-project in 1975: First
Canadian Place, the 72-storey, 2m sq ft tower in the heart of Toronto's
financial district.
It is even further removed from the project which put O&amp;Y into a league of
its own - the World Financial Centre, a Dollars 1.5bn, 8m sq ft complex on a
vast landfill site, south of Wall Street.
The Reichmanns' bid to develop the whole site in 1980 was a monumental
gamble. Other developers wanted to test the market, one building at a time.
They said O&amp;Y would never attract leading tenants on that scale. The
incentives offered to tenants seemed crazily generous. It was bound to fail,
they said.
The Reichmanns thought the sheer scale would attract leading tenants. They
were right. Wall Street firms were on the threshold of meteoric growth. The
project proved a spectacular success.
O&amp;Y's next blockbuster, Canary Wharf, was not so successful and much may yet
depend on its fate.
The project appeared to offer all the ingredients that made the World
Financial Centre a hit: cheap land, tax breaks and scale. London was growing
at break-neck pace and most of its offices were out-dated slums. Canary
Wharf seemed an unmissable opportunity to repeat a winning formula.
But Canary Wharf dwarfed even the World Financial Centre in its ambition. It
was attempting to create a third new business centre for London at a stroke,
something no other developer was prepared to attempt.
The World Financial Centre was three minutes walk from Wall Street. Canary
Wharf was two and a half miles from the city. The transport links that O&amp;Y
were counting on have been painfully slow to arrive.
Attracting new tenants was always going to be an uphill struggle. The
collapse in the London property market made it infinitely harder.
Two years ago, Canary Wharf's asking rent was Pounds 30 per sq ft - half
City rates. Now City rents have halved and there is a glut of high-quality
modern offices, making it much harder for Canary Wharf to compete.
The project is 40 per cent unlet, and is not producing nearly enough income
to service its debt.
The development so far is probably worth considerably less than the Pounds
1.3bn it cost to build. Canary Wharf tower was recently valued at Pounds
680m and 10 Cabot Square was valued at Pounds 215m. But this does not take
account of the project's empty space and it probably over-estimates O&amp;Y's
ability to use its tax breaks.
Buildings that have been started will be finished, but the remainder -
another 6m sq ft of space, costing another Pounds 1.7bn - has an uncertain
future.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Outside Names fear heavy bias in Lloyd's loss

those members of the Lloyd's insurance market who have jobs there - fared
significantly better than outside Names in 1989, according to figures
circulating at the market. The figures have been derived by Names, the
individuals whose assets provide capital for Lloyd's, from sources including
estimates from Chatset, an independent analyst.
Figures based on preliminary syndicate results suggest that, when Lloyd's
reports its 1989 results in June this year, Names will pay more than Pounds
1.35bn to meet losses run up by syndicates in which they are grouped. But
outsiders who supplied more than 87 per cent of the market's capital look
likely to bear more than that proportion of the losses.
The expected gap for 1989 between working and outside Names is much greater
than that disclosed by Lloyd's last month for the 1988 year when working
members provided just over 11 per cent of the capital of the top 20
syndicates and almost 11 per cent of the 20 worst performers. In 1986 and
1987, working members fared worse than market outsiders - supplying
respectively 14.0 per cent and 13.2 per cent of the capital of the
worst-performing syndicates and 9.4 per cent and 10.6 per cent of the
best-performing. The 1989 estimates were compared with details of the
participation of working and outside Names, collated by syndicate, which
were published last month by Lloyd's.
The estimates derived from Chatset figures and other sources indicate that
working members will receive 16.7 per cent of the profits generated by the
top 20 syndicates, but will pay out only 5.7 per cent of the losses suffered
by the 20 worst-performing syndicates.
Working Names accounted for between 32.7 per cent and 53.9 per cent of the
capacity of the four small syndicates which will produce the market's best
results. Outsiders dominated loss-making catastrophe reinsurance in which
syndicates and London insurance companies insured each others' exposures to
large loss.
The market's seven worst-affected syndicates - managed by the Gooda Walker,
Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire agencies - ran up losses of
almost 600m, nearly half the total loss. None drew more than 7 per cent of
their capital from working Names. That news is certain to anger many Names.
The Commercial Court will this week hear motions from more than 820 Names
seeking injunctions to prevent the draw-down of their funds.

FT  30 MAR 92 / SIB probes charge of 'stock lending'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES regulators are investigating allegations that a leading UK fund
manager has been lending the stock certificates of a pension fund client
without the client's knowledge or permission.
Inquiries by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, began after Mr John Quarrell, a pensions lawyer and a partner at
solicitors Nabarro Nathanson, wrote to his 30 largest pension fund clients
on March 9, urging them to check on the security of their assets held by
their custodian.
He urged them to consider a surprise visit to the custodian's premises at
9am to request stock certificates relating to their six largest investments.
In his letter, Mr Quarrell cites the case of a pension fund client of a
colleague who did so and found that by 9.30am the custodian, who was also
the fund manager, could produce only 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the
relevant certificates.
'Upon inquiry it became clear that the institution had been using the others
for 'stock lending',' Mr Quarrell wrote.
The fund manager's actions not only raised questions about the breach of
authority and the security of the assets, but suggested that it had been
keeping profits that rightly belonged to the pension fund. Neither the fund
manager nor the pension fund was identified in Mr Quarrell's letter.
Mr Charles Nunnelly, a board member of Imro, the self-regulating body for
the fund management industry, said he had notified Imro of the allegations
and had asked for an investigation.
Mr Quarrell is chairman of an industry subcommittee which is examining
regulatory issues arising from the theft of assets from pension funds
controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
The letter has raised what is becoming an increasingly contentious issue
within the industry - whether stock certificates should be designated in the
name of the actual owner or be in the name of the fund manager.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Fall in real income of poor found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REAL income of the UK's poorest households fell during the 1980s, the
Low Pay Unit campaign group says today, John Willman writes.
It calculates that the average income of the bottom fifth of households fell
from Pounds 3,442 in 1979 to Pounds 3,282 in 1989 at that year's prices. The
average income of the top fifth rose over the same period from Pounds 20,138
to Pounds 28,124.
One reason for the increased gap is changes to the tax and social security
systems, a report from the unit says. Most of the benefit of income-tax cuts
went to taxpayers at the top of the scale, while increases in indirect taxes
such as value added tax and National Insurance have been borne by low-income
families.
The report says the number of adults earning less than the Council of
Europe's 'decency threshold' increased during the 1980s from 7.8m, or 38 per
cent of the workforce, to 10m, or 47 per cent. The 'decency threshold'
defines low pay as 68 per cent of the mean earnings of full-time workers.
The unit argues for a national minimum wage.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Charity cash 'has life-saving role' in NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITABLE fund-raising has assumed a 'life-saving role' in the National
Health Service, Directory of Social Change says today.
The voluntary sector agency claims in a report that charity is being called
on to finance capital projects and basic services, and says: 'Many hospital
appeals now stress that, if not enough money is raised, lives will be lost'.
A consensus that charity should not finance services which were the proper
responsibility of the state has 'all but collapsed,' says the report. Basic
services which had been supported include building developments; equipping
special-care baby units; keeping operating theatres open; providing
life-support machines and cardiac monitors, fitting ambulances with
resuscitation equipment and training their crews.
More than 2,300 charitable funds for hospitals are now registered with the
Charity Commission - five times the pre-1980 level. The report estimates
that total charitable income in the NHS is Pounds 370m a year.
Charitable assets held by health authorities and self-governing trust
hospitals are worth Pounds 693m, says the report.
The report says that hospitals' growing reliance on charitable income may
have a number of implications in the internal market introduced under
government health reforms.
One possibility, says the report, is that successful charitable appeals
could lead to a reduction in state finance for hospitals.

BRITAIN needs a federal industrial policy which recognises that creating
national or even European 'champions' is outmoded, according to a report
today from the Institute for Public Policy Research.
The left-of-centre think tank argues that industrial policy will fail unless
it takes into account the power and importance of worldwide developments in
technology, production and products.
The report lists elements which should be included in the UK's industrial
policy. These include an active competition policy accompanied by social and
supply-side policies to minimise unemployment, and stringent environmental
targets and quality standards in public purchasing.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Rise in judgments against debtors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in consumer indebtedness as a result of the recession is
suggested by figures for county court judgments in England and Wales last
year, David Barchard writes.
The total number of judgments, made when someone defaults on a debt, reached
a record of 1.8m last year.
Details of judgments in county courts are used by banks, retailers, and
other consumer-credit bodies when deciding whether to lend to individuals.
Details of a judgment against a debtor are held for six years, and the
person may find it difficult to obtain credit in that period.
Judgments against debtors last year were 22 per cent up on 1990, but this
may partly reflect the fact the procedures for notifying judgments to the
Registry Trust, which keeps a record of bad debts, were improved during the
second half of 1990.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Hollick silent on avoidance allegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HOLLICK, the Labour peer who is managing director of MAI, the financial
services group, yesterday declined to comment directly on newspaper
allegations that the group had considered a plan to pay senior executives
partly in gold bullion.
When MAI was asked whether it had set up a such a scheme, or had plans to do
so, it said it was 'unable to deal specifically with the points raised
because legal proceedings had been set in train'. The intention of such
schemes is legally to avoid National Insurance contributions, which are not
required on payments made in bullion.
The allegations are politically sensitive because Lord Hollick has been
closely involved with the Labour party's election campaign. He has been
tipped for a ministerial post if Labour wins, and has been mentioned as a
possible governor of the Bank of England.
In such bullion schemes, payment needs to be made outside the European
Community in order to avoid paying value added tax on the gold. A further
advantage of such schemes is that employees can defer tax for up to 18
months if the payment is timed for the end of the tax year. The tax year
ends on April 5.
Similar schemes to avoid National Insurance contributions involving unit
trusts and equities were halted by the Inland Revenue last October.
Wright, Webb, Syrett, a firm of solicitors, said yesterday that writs would
be issued today for libel by Lord Hollick and MAI against the Mail on Sunday
for articles published yesterday. An injunction to restrain further
publication would also be sought.
The solicitors warned in a statement that Lord Hollick would be seeking
damages and looked forward to vindicating his reputation in the High Court.
The Mail on Sunday articles claimed that several hundred senior executives
at MAI had arranged to receive part of their earnings in gold bars in
Jersey, which is outside the EC.
An early edition of the newspaper suggested that Lord Hollick would also
benefit from the scheme. However, later editions included a denial from Lord
Hollick's solicitors stating that none of his salary would be paid in
bullion. Lord Hollick's solicitors said the writs would refer to all
editions of yesterday's Mail on Sunday.

FT  30 MAR 92 / HMSO to go ahead with 4.7% pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HER MAJESTY'S Stationery Office is to increase salaries of 2,000 staff by
4.7 per cent this week even though two unions are taking industrial action
to try to win a better offer. HMSO is thought to hope the award will weaken
the resolve of unions involved in the action.
The two unions involved, the CPSA and NUPCS Civil Service unions, said an
overtime ban and work-to-rule were continuing. They are considering further
ballots on selective strikes by key groups of workers.
The dispute is significant because HMSO was the first government agency to
introduce a pay system outside national bargaining in the Civil Service.
The deal being implemented by HMSO provides less than other civil servants
have received recently.
The 4.7 per cent is backdated to January, after a three-month pay freeze
from the settlement date in October last year. The unions say it will be
worth 3.5 per cent in the 12 months from the settlement date.
The two unions have held a week-long strike, now fin-ished, by some workers
in HMSO's publication centre.
Mr Mike Lynn, HMSO deputy chief executive, said he believed there was little
support among union members for further strikes. He added that it was
difficult to gauge the effect of the overtime ban and work-to-rule.
Members of the IPMS Civil Service union are working normally after balloting
to accept the offer.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Inquiry into CD prices ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has decided not to refer manufacturers and
retailers of compact discs to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Two separate OFT investigations into the prices charged by the retailers and
producers of CDs failed to discover evidence of collusion sufficient to
warrant a referral. An announcement is expected this week.
The decision is a blow for the Consumers' Association, which has been
campaigning about what it says is the high price of CDs. It has complained
that CD prices in the UK are far higher than those in the US.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which
represents the music companies, says that the average full price for CDs in
the UK last year was Pounds 11.99, while in the US the figure was between
Dollars 12 and Dollars 13 (Pounds 6.60-Pounds 7).
CD prices are also higher than those of cassettes, even though the OFT
believes CDs are cheaper to manufacture.
The call for less expensive CDs has received support from some retailers. In
January, Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of WH Smith, appealed to
music companies to provide a wider range of inexpensive CDs. That followed
his company's announcement that it would stop selling long-playing vinyl
records.

NOBLE &amp; LUND, one of the best-known companies in the UK machine tool
industry, is to become mainly an assembly operation after more than 100
years of manufacturing.
FMT Holdings, owner of Noble &amp; Lund, is transferring manufacture of the
company's large gantry-type milling machines and aviation profiling machines
to its base in Brighton, East Sussex. Sixty manufacturing jobs have been cut
at Noble &amp; Lund, which is based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, leaving 50
assembly and design workers.
The transfer is a response to the recession, which has reduced orders for
Noble &amp; Lund. The company derives four fifths of its business from the UK,
more than the average for the UK industry.
Mr Mike Bright, FMT chairman, denied strongly that Noble &amp; Lund was to be
closed.
This year FMT - one of the few UK builders of machine tools that competes
head-on with the Japanese in making flexible machining centres - cut 60 jobs
at Brighton.
Total employment has fallen from 400 in 1990 to 200. 'We must just hope that
we see the end of the recession,' Mr Bright said. Mr Stephen LeBeau, a
well-known figure in the UK machine tool industry, has left Yamazaki, one of
the world's largest producers, after little more than a year as UK sales
director. His unexpected departure was said to be by mutual consent.
Yamazaki would not comment.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pay issue set high on agenda - Minimum wage
sparks scepticism - Job loss fears - Employers' concern over expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL battle-lines are firmly drawn over Labour's plan to introduce
a national minimum wage, but many observers in industry believe much of the
debate is sound and fury signifying little.
Supporters believe the minimum wage would lead to more equitable
distribution of income for the estimated 4.5m employees in the UK paid less
than Labour's proposed minimum of Pounds 3.40 an hour. Critics say it is a
sure-fire recipe for lost jobs and would lead to an inflationary wage
spiral.
Mr Michael Howard, employment minister, speaking on a BBC election phone-in
radio programme last week, argued that the minimum wage would not succeed in
helping those people it was designed to help and might destroy up to 2m jobs
if employers sought to maintain pay differentials.
'Is it better for someone to work at Pounds 3.06 an hour or not at all?' he
asked one caller.
However, a survey published last week by Industrial Relations Services, the
independent pay research group, found that most personnel managers seemingly
did not share such views and were 'not particularly hostile' to the plan.
Of 527 companies surveyed, 41.3 per cent were opposed in principle, 31.5 per
cent had no strong opinion and 27.2 per cent supported it.
The survey said job losses would 'probably be far more limited than the
government predictions would suggest'.
Not surprisingly, the trade unions are strongly in favour. Mr Pat Jones, a
spokesman for Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said the suggestion that it
would lead to job losses was 'absolute rubbish'.
He said: 'The same argument was used before the introduction of the wages
council in the 1940s and there was never any evidence to support it.'
There is a widespread feeling in the City, at least, that the minimum wage
is a sop to the Labour left and may even be quietly abandoned. They point to
apparent back-sliding, with the suggestion that its introduction would be
deferred for a year.
'The Liberal Democrats are not in favour of the minimum wage and, if you
assume we will be in the grey middle-ground of coalitions after the
election, then it might be a issue Labour is prepared to give ground on,'
says Mr Alun Jones, head of quantitative research at stockbroker UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew and co-author of a study of Labour's economic proposals.
City analysts say the leisure, textiles, stores, brewing and food
manufacturing sectors would be most affected by a minimum wage.
Yet the effects of a minimum wage are probably impossible to calculate. It
would not immediately compel companies to sack droves of employees; there
would be more subtle attempts to adjust recruitment practices, trim working
hours, and review the grading structures.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Retailer calculates Pounds 3m rise in bill -
Minimum wage sparks scepticism - Job loss fears - Employers' concern over
expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE grand rhetoric associated with the imposition of the minimum wage will
almost inevitably end up in grim niggling debates for those who would have
to implement it.
Many companies, feeling the pinch because of the recession, would clearly
try to minimise the impact on their wage bills and would spend hours in
talks with trade unions discussing how to implement it.
Asda, the grocery chain which is the biggest employer in the Yorkshire area,
has recently been struggling with high borrowings and tough trading
conditions.
Earlier this year it introduced a wage freeze in agreement with the GMB
union.
The year-long freeze applies to all employees, from check-out operators to
main board directors, but may be under severe pressure if a Labour
government were to enact its minimum wage proposals. Unlike some
manufacturing companies, retailers cannot move their operations abroad and
would face the full brunt of cost increases in the UK.
The immediate effect would be to force Asda to increase the pay of the
25,000 hourly-paid staff who fall below the Pounds 3.40 threshold. That
would be likely to cost the company upwards of Pounds 3m a year.
Most of Asda's affected employees are only 4p below the minimum, with others
falling 7p to 14p short. Employees in London stores would not be affected
because they are already paid above the minimum.
Other categories of staff may also be affected. For example, Asda is not
certain what the position of trainees would be under the proposed scheme.
Asda pays employees Pounds 3.08 an hour during their first 12 weeks of
training, in line with the wages-council rate.
The minimum wage would also generate pressure to maintain pay differentials
for staff on higher grades. These pay pressures could be significant, though
they are impossible to calculate.
The unions accept that this issue may cause difficulties in some
circumstances.
Hard-pressed companies would find it difficult to absorb the inflationary
cost pressures resulting from stepping-up of pay bands. But if differential
rates were not raised, Mr Pat Jones of the shopworkers' union Usdaw
predicts: 'It would cause a revolt in the stores. Nobody would take a
supervisor's job if they were paid the same as someone who collects
trolleys.'
Mr Phil Cox, Asda's finance director, says: 'Although we are very much
against the minimum wage, it is not something that would have a massive
effect on us. I do not think it will be an enormous cost but it is certainly
not helpful.'
He suggests the pressures will be more acute for some smaller competitors.
'The smaller chains will have less flexibility and more of their employees
fall below minimum wage rates.'
In the grocery sector, at least, the minimum wage is only likely to become
another point of competitive differentiation in a rapidly-polarising market.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Production shift to overseas forecast -
Minimum wage sparks scepticism - Job loss fears - Employers' concern over
expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
'MIDDLE-SIZED companies tend to get ignored by politicians,' says Mr David
Parker, chairman and chief executive of Sherwood Group with 3,000 employees.
The company is one of the largest suppliers of lace in Europe and Britain's
third biggest sock maker - too big to attract small-business grants but too
small to qualify for special assistance for strategic industries.
Life under Labour would, nevertheless, change the Nottingham business from
shopfloor to boardroom, though in financial terms Mr Parker's team reckons
it comes out more or less even.
This does not prevent Mr Parker putting personal taxation at the top of his
list of worries. 'Labour's plans would damage incentives for
middle-to-senior management, rather than the most senior,' he says.
He identifies about 70 of the 2,400 UK staff who would be hit by Labour's
plan to lift the ceiling on National Insurance payments for earnings above
about Pounds 21,000 a year. Less than 15 are even close to being affected by
the 50 per cent tax band for incomes above Pounds 40,000.
Mr Parker is concerned about the prospect of a minimum wage. The textile
industry has a high proportion of women workers on low wages, many on
piecework. Some of Britain's biggest textile companies such as Coats Viyella
and William Baird have warned that heavy job losses would result.
Sherwood is better placed than many. Lace and sock-making are highly
automated.
Across the company about 500 staff earn less than the Pounds 3.40 an hour
Labour says will be its minimum wage. Although this includes some teenagers,
trainees and unskilled staff, most of them are in garment-making and Mr
Parker says he 'would probably accelerate our drive to assemble garments in
the Pacific basin'. The proportion of Sherwood's clothes made in the far
east should go up to 50 per cent fairly soon in any case but could go higher
'depending on circumstances'.
Sherwood has experience of a minimum wage environment. It manufactures in
France, the Netherlands and Germany. 'Wages are higher there,' says Mr
Parker guardedly, and he acknowledges that this hurts margins.
A minimum wage might not help employment, but should help productivity.
Sherwood would spend more on automated machinery additionally encouraged by
Labour's plan to give 40 per cent capital allowances in the first year,
which would add Pounds 100,000 to the company's cashflow for this year,
according to Mr Peter Newbold, the finance director.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Sterling faces a spell of nerves - City Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THIS the calm before the storm for the pound? According to Mr Keith
Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, a hung parliament with lots of
horse-trading will mean that 'sterling is going to come under quite a lot of
pressure'.
But earlier fears of a sterling crisis during the election campaign have
certainly not been fulfilled, even though the opinion polls point to a close
and uncertain outcome.
In fact sterling has been rock solid, mostly between DM2.86 and DM2.87, for
the first 2 1/2 weeks of the campaign. All three parties are committed to
maintaining the pound at a central rate of DM2.95. True, the pound has been
testing its floor against the Spanish peseta. But it has been only about 3
per cent below its DM central rate, against the permitted 6 per cent
fluctuation.
The European exchange rate mechanism has been doing its job. Traders
evidently feel it is too risky to punt against sterling. But there is a
price. While bank base rates have stayed at 10 1/2 per cent, three-month
money is up to 10 3/4 per cent and six-month money costs almost 11 per cent.
City experts fear a more serious bout of nerves after the poll. Mr Tim
Congdon, of Lombard Street Research, is a well-known opponent of British ERM
participation, using words like 'catastrophe' to describe the consequences
should interest rates be raised.
Nevertheless, there is a widespread feeling that a minority or majority
Labour government would be expected to demonstrate its commitment to the ERM
by hoisting interest rates at least temporarily: some say half a percentage
point would be enough, others fear up to two points.
Mr Michael Hughes, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, thinks that
such an administration might need to pay attention to the Budget deficit as
well as to interest rates. 'The Treasury, on a change of government, will
encourage ministers to go into the 2 1/4 per cent band quite quickly,' he
believes. But far from being a soft option this would be 'equivalent to the
IMF in 1976' when big public-sector spending cuts were forced on the then
Labour government.
The possibility of sterling becoming a narrow band currency is a factor in
limiting speculation against the pound. Mr Norman Lamont has only said that
narrow bands will be adopted 'in due course'. One or two opportunities to do
so - with sterling briefly above DM2.88 - have been passed up within the
past six months, presumably because of pre-election nerves. But the pound
cannot remain a wide-band currency indefinitely without losing credibility.
A Tory win, most City experts agree, would take the heat off sterling for a
while. But it seems rather unlikely at this stage that the Conservatives
would have a working majority. This leaves traders to fret about the
possibility of a devaluation by Labour, either immediately after looking at
'the books' on taking power, or somewhat later, after interest rate rises
become unacceptable. There are also worries about semi-public debates about
economic policy between coalition partners.

How long would someone have to work at Labour's proposed minimum hourly rate
of Pounds 3.40 to earn an annual salary of Pounds 21,060, the present
ceiling on National Insurance contributions? A reader who is a retired
accountant was struck by the disparity between these two hotly debated
figures and worked out the answer - almost 17 hours a day, 365 days of the

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Nellist's way - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An interview by BBC Radio 4 in Coventry South East the other day went
roughly as follows.
'Will you be voting for Dave Nellist in the general election?'
'Of course, he's always been a strong supporter of the Labour movement.'
'You realise that Dave Nellist is no longer the official candidate of the
Labour party?'
'Oh, yes, of course.'
'So will you be voting for Dave Nellist at the general election?'
'Oh, no, of course not.'
The confusion may continue all the way to the ballot box. An opinion poll in
the Birmingham Post today suggests that Nellist, the man expelled from the
Labour party for alleged Militant activities and now standing as Independent
Labour, has 30 per cent of the vote, against 32 per cent for official Labour
and 28 per cent for the Tories. When he was still a member of the Labour
party at the last general election, Nellist won 47 per cent. He may now let
in the Tories.

Nothing new out of Northern Ireland. The Irish bookmakers, Eastwoods, are
forecasting that all 17 Ulster MPs will keep their seats. That includes
Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who continues to fight Belfast
West, but declines to sit in Westminster. Adams had a majority of only 2,221
over the mainly Catholic SDLP at the last election. Ian Paisley, by
contrast, had a majority of more than 23,000 in Antrim North, but says he is
fighting as if he is in danger of losing his deposit. The odds against this
are unquotable.

More scientists are joining the attack on the Conservatives' science policy.
Today, 17 members of British Scientists Abroad, who have already voted with
their feet by leaving the country, argue in a letter to The Times that
scientists leave Britain not because of the tax regime, but because 'higher
education and research as a whole has been systematically undervalued and
neglected in the past 13 years'. Many, they say, might be prepared to return
'if conditions were to improve'.
Last week, 20 leading researchers wrote a letter to the same paper
complaining at the way the 'progressive erosion of public support for
research' had demoralised the scientific community.
The latest letter warns that until a party is elected that understands
scientists' true motivation and is prepared to demonstrate a real commitment
to investment in science, their morale will not be restored, and they will
not be lured home. Unfortunately, however, the writers of this week's
letter, as those of last week's, seem unable to find any party that fits the
bill.

Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spitting Image, the political satire programme, is to return to the
television screen on April 8 - the eve of the general election. 'So far
nobody has even raised a question about it,' says a spokesman for Central
TV, the company that puts it out.
At the last general election in 1987, a special Spitting Image programme
appeared at 10pm, just after the polls closed and before the coverage of the
results by ITN. It was quite savage.
Will the April 8 show be equally sharp? The answer is that it is impossible
to tell in advance. The political puppets will appear in front of a live
audience as a sort of Question Time and the answers will be ad-libbed. A
regular Spitting Image series resumes on April 12.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'Pate' takes battle to France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYED by a rise in opinion poll support for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy
Ashdown fled floating voters at home for France yesterday to seal un
photo-opportunite exceptionnel.
Keen to boost his reputation as un homme actif et un bon Europeen, he
addressed an imported audience in Boulogne on Labour and Conservative
failure to set Europe as an election issue.
Monsieur Pate Ashdown - as translated by Mr Jean Gol, president of the
Belgian Liberal party - boasted, in convincing French, of how he was the
first chef de parti opposition to take his election campaign out of the UK.
But the menu of Eurobabble and speech was for home consumption.
'We should campaign hard to see that the central bank comes to London,
Europe's foremost financial centre. It is absurd for Britain to hold back
and to see greater integration as a threat.'
In the ensuing Euro-Liberal love-in, Mr Yves Galland, leader of the Liberal
Democrat and Reform Group of the European parliament, compared Pate
Ashdown's landing with the arrival of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders'
regiment in defence of Belgium in 1914.
'Britain needs her Liberal Democrats if she is to catch quickly, and without
loss, the European train leaving from Maastricht,' he said.
Mr Willy de Clercq, president of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform
Parties, poured on the creme. 'You are not known as 'action man' for
nothing,' he said.
Mr Ashdown headed from the cheering audience, across the road, for a
three-course lunch at Boulogne's La Matelote Restaurant, avec des vins
blanc, rouge et rose for the coach of journalists, then returned, via
high-speed catamaran, to Dover. He had been abroad for less than four hours.
'It has been serious politics and a good lunch,' said a party official. Back
on the humdrum UK campaign trail, Mr Ashdown's visit to Rochdale and
Manchester today will lack a certain je ne sais quoi.
Earlier, Mr Ashdown insisted that any minority government would have to
agree to introduce legislation authorising proportional representation in
the first session of the new parliament to secure Liberal Democrat support,
Ivor Owen writes.
He reaffirmed that in the event of a hung parliament Liberal Democrat MPs
would be prepared to defeat the government rather than permit a re-run of
1974, when Mr Harold Wilson's minority administration clung to office for
just over six months before securing a minuscule overall majority in a
second general election.
Interviewed by David Frost on TV-am, Mr Ashdown emphasised the encouraging
message from the opinion polls that support for the Liberal Democrats was
growing with 'not much sign' of it being squeezed by the two main parties.
He acknowledged that if unable to secure an overall majority both Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, were
likely to seek to 'ignore the judgment of the ballot box' and try to go it
alone.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Surveys show C2s starting to change their
allegiances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADLINE figures of this weekend's opinion polls showed the Tories
making up some of the deficit on Labour. But there was still precious little
cheer for them in the fine print.
It showed that the battle of Jennifer's ear had left health unrivalled as
the campaign's main issue.
Although the broadcast did not appear directly to have bolstered Labour's
ratings, neither did it significantly harm them. Overall, the party remained
comfortably ahead of the Tories on this key topic.
The polls again highlighted the Conservatives' failure to get tax on to the
agenda and underlined Labour's continuing improvement on matters of economic
competence.
Perhaps most worrying of all for the Tories, two surveys showed them heavily
losing the struggle for vital C2s votes. It was this skilled working class
that underpinned the victories of the Thatcher years.
According to ICM for the Sunday Express, Labour's lead among the C2s stands
at a startling 14 points, up from just 5 two weeks ago. NOP for The Mail on
Sunday put Labour's edge among C2s at 6 points, double what it was a week
earlier.
NOP for The Independent on Sunday offered the Conservatives a glimmer of
light, suggesting that 65 per cent of C2s thought their taxes would rise
under Labour.
But Mori for The Sunday Times indicated that only 12 per cent of voters saw
tax as one of the prime issues determining which way they will vote. That
compared with six out of 10 respondents who regarded health as a key issue.
Labour's lead as the party with the best National Health Service policies
was left intact in the wake of the Jennifer broadcast, with Harris for The
Observer putting it at 14 points.
The LibDems' decision to keep out of the subsequent slanging match over how
the subject's name entered the public domain lies behind the strong increase
to 30 per cent in the number of NOP/Independent on Sunday respondents saying
the party was running the most impressive campaign.
In a good week for the party, Mr Paddy Ashdown, its leader, has closed to
within 5 points of John Major in his personal ratings as tracked by NOP/Mail
on Sunday. A total of 51 per cent now think Mr Major is doing a good job,
against 46 per cent for Mr Ashdown and 35 per cent for Mr Kinnock.
In Scotland an opinion poll by Mori for the Sunday Times confirmed Labour's
strong lead, putting it on 42 per cent (down one point from a week ago). The
Scottish National party was on 27 per cent (unchanged), the Conservatives on
20 per cent (unchanged) and the Liberal Democrats on 10 per cent (up one
point).

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Monetarist sees drop in tax revenue under
Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S plans to increase sharply the income tax and National Insurance
burden of middle managers could lead to a significant drop in national
income and tax revenue, according to Professor Patrick Minford, the
monetarist economist.
Applying econometric analysis to the behaviour of 7,000 male workers covered
by the government's general household survey, Prof Minford concluded that
Labour's plans could lead to a drop in national income of between 2.1 per
cent and 2.5 per cent a year and a loss in tax revenue of between Pounds 7bn
and Pounds 8bn.
Prof Minford said Labour's tax plans, unveiled by Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, would have a considerable disincentive effect on higher income
groups. He said workers in the top fifth of the income scale - broadly the
group earning more than Pounds 21,060 a year - would reduce their work
effort by 12 per cent under Labour if their gross wages were held constant.
Those in the top tenth - earning more than Pounds 32,000 a year - would cut
work effort by 8 per cent while those in the top twentieth on more than
Pounds 50,000 would reduce work effort by 4.5 per cent.
The annual loss in terms of economic production would be Pounds 13.7bn or
about 2.1 per cent of national income. Prof Minford warned that the output
effects of Labour's plans would begin almost at once.
'By abolishing the National Insurance ceiling Labour would bring 3m
moderate, yet highly productive, earners into a sharply higher marginal tax
band. If the general household survey is to be believed, they will
reallocate their activities dramatically over the longer run, to the severe
detriment of the economy.'
He said the negative effects on the economy would be greater if companies
restored workers' pay to offset the impact of the tax increases. There would
be a general rise in company costs, increased unemployment and a 2.5 per
cent loss of output.
The Institute of Directors has compared the manifestos of the three main
parties with its own programme published last month. It finds that
Conservative policies score 40 positive points against three negative, while
Labour scores 21 positive points against 25 negative, and the Liberal
Democrats 36 against 22. The Chemical Industry Association has called on all
three main political parties to commit themselves to the creation of open
trading conditions free from protectionism and competitive distortions.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Conservatives slow to praise central effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY candidates are drawing heavily on reserves of determined optimism as
the campaign enters its last full week.
While looking for a fresh start, there was not much praise for the efforts
from Conservative Central Office after the campaign's faltering start and
lacklustre continuation.
Sir Marcus Fox, a vice-chairman of the party's 1922 backbench committee,
acknowledged that people felt Labour had dictated the agenda for the first
two weeks. Mr John Bowis, defending a slim majority in Battersea, south
London, said that in the first week the impact of the national campaign was
'zilch', though the position improved last week.
'We're fighting a local campaign, the national campaign is entirely outside
our control,' was the less-than-enthusiastic message from Mr Tim Devlin,
defending a majority of less than 1,000 in Stockton South.
Privately, the mood is more outspoken. 'I go out campaigning in the morning,
and I have a good time,' says one Tory in a marginal seat. 'I come back in
the evening and watch the news and go to bed depressed by the incompetence.'
Particular scorn is reserved for the low-key 'Meet John Major' sessions with
between 200 and 300 invited supporters. These are seen as wasting the
opportunity for a large-scale rally with 'razzmatazz'.
But the Tories seem cheered by the impact of Labour's health broadcast. Some
said dislike of Labour's tactics had hardened traditional Tory support, and
increased the number of volunteers and requests for posters. 'It's done us
some good among the elderly C2s in particular,' said one candidate.
There were clear signs of relief over the leadership's change of tactics
towards positive campaigning signalled over the weekend. 'We've got to turn
positive - that's what wins elections,' Mr Jacques Arnold, defending
Gravesham, in Kent, commented yesterday.
Candidates had different ideas about what the thrust of that positive
message should be, though there was some agreement that having found much of
the party's core vote holding up, the main effort should now be to win over
the floating voters.
Mr Bowis said the message should be that lower taxes were the way to
stimulate the economy, enabling more to be spent on public services. Mr
Arnold said the emphasis should be on 'people power' and the government's
education and NHS reforms.
Others would like to see the debate turn to Europe, where the Tories could
corner the market in Euro-scepticism. Many would like the leadership to
concentrate on the impact of Labour's plan for a national minimum wage. 'We
must appeal to the nine out of 10 people in jobs,' one Tory pragmatist said.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: EC partners keep one eye on presidency - View
from: Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS is watching the UK election campaign very closely, though its
attention has been more focused on the French regional polls because of what
they might portend for an early return of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, to Paris.
Britain's European Community partners harbour a mix of hope and fear about
the outcome on April 9 - with the mix differing in each of the 11 countries.
Perhaps their common trepidation about Labour coming to power is simply the
concern about a relatively unknown and totally untried government taking
over the presidency of the EC council of ministers. When the UK takes the
presidency on July 1 it will confront a difficult agenda, with future
financing of the EC almost certainly still to settle and the question of how
and when to take in new members to resolve.
But all Britain's European partners, and the EC institutions, are agreed on
one thing. A Labour victory would untangle the knot into which Mr John
Major, the prime minister, tied the EC by refusing to go along with social
policy at Maastricht. Labour has said it would immediately subscribe to the
Maastricht treaty protocol which seeks to extend social policy regulation
further and faster by the use of majority voting.
Quite how a Labour government would make Britain's change of heart legally
effective, at this late stage, is not clear.
The Maastricht treaty, with all its protocols and annexes, has been signed.
Some governments - notably Denmark which is busy distributing copies around
the country in advance of its June 2 referendum on Maastricht - have already
put the treaty to their parliaments.
A brief inter-governmental conference on social policy would probably have
to follow a Labour victory.
With the three main UK parties broadly in favour of Maastricht, it is clear
that European political and monetary union does not ride on the outcome of
the British election, as it may do in the Danish referendum or in the
eventual Bundestag debate.
But the Commission has, for some months now, been pulling its punches in
order not to stir up 'Euro-aggro' in Britain. It has, for instance:
Delayed, until after April 9, its report on the system whereby Britain has
had a two-thirds rebate on its contribution to the EC. This is likely to be
as controversial as the other aspects of the Commission's requested funding
for 1993-97, which have now all been published. Germany, a far bigger net
contributor than the UK, gets no rebate itself and has signalled it no
longer wants to contribute to the UK rebate.
Delayed until April a report which will make clear its view that Britain is
under a legal obligation from the Single European Act to abolish frontier
checks on people, as well as goods, crossing intra-EC borders.
The UK government contends that the 'free movement' provisions of the act
apply only to EC citizens, and that it has the right to check the documents
of non-EC travellers. Agreed to a UK request to postpone a March 11 hearing
at the European Court of Justice on the Commission's complaint that the UK
is infringing EC law on the purity of bathing water on certain Lancashire
beaches.
Britain's partners are well aware that a Labour victory might change the
balance of Community argument on several issues.
On the move to economic and monetary union, Labour has argued for more
attention to be paid to real convergence (growth, employment and regional
development) between states, as well as the nominal convergence (on debt,
inflation and interest rates) prescribed in the Maastricht treaty. Labour
has, for instance, said it would use the presidency to convene a special
'jobs' summit between EC finance and employment ministers.
A Labour victory would mean that Sir Leon Brittan, the senior Tory-nominated
UK Commissioner, could only stay on in Brussels if the Conservatives agreed,
in a more junior post than the powerful competition portfolio he presently
holds.
The likelihood of his departure, and the fact that no other European
government is likely to appoint so free-market a liberal, would tilt the
Commission view crucially on industrial policy.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Trend reversed in share index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND full week of the election campaign showed a reversal of the trend
for the FT Election Share Index, with stocks that might benefit from a
Conservative victory doing better than those that might benefit from a
Labour win.
The index, published daily during the campaign, consists of 10 stocks which
might outperform in the event of a Labour victory and 10 which could benefit
from a Conservative win.
Its performance last week differed in one other important respect from the
first week of the campaign - the difference between 'Conservative gainers'
and 'Labour gainers' was very slight.
The big loser of the week in the Labour index was APV, down 4.35 per cent on
the week and down 1.71 per cent since the election campaign started. Its
slide this week reflected the market's unhappiness at the company's poor
results.
Stocks with a stronger political wind behind them were Thames Water (a
'Conservative gainer' because of Labour's plans for tighter regulation), up
1.47 per cent on the week but down 15 per cent since March 11; and National
Power, another privatisation stock, up 3.16 per cent on the week but down
9.7 per cent during the campaign as a whole. The moves must have reflected a
belief that the political threat to both companies had been overdone.
Since the election was called all but one of the Conservative gainers -
mostly companies that stand to lose in easily identifiable ways if the
Labour party comes to power - have fallen in price.
The Labour gainers list also shows more losers than winners - seven down
since the campaign started, three up. This probably reflects the fact that
the potential benefits to this category of shares are more nebulous than the
potential losses to those in the other list.
The base for the index is closing prices on the day the election was
announced, Wednesday March 11. Both sections of the index are set to 100 at
that date. The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share
Ordinary index - which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price
movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Broadcasts set to open new fronts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE broadcasting war will shift to education and defence this week as Labour
attempts to push its plans for schools and training up the agenda and the
Conservatives play the leadership card.
In a party election broadcast tonight, Labour's film will aim to press the
claim that education is as much the party's natural 'winning territory' as
the National Health Service.
But Tory strategists have heard reports that staff at Walworth Road have
again based their arguments on real-life cases, possibly leaving them
vulnerable to charges of inaccuracy and distortion.
For the Conservatives, a broadcast scheduled for tomorrow will open the new
campaign front of defence, to be followed later in the week by a switch to
law and order. But the subliminal message will be all about Mr Neil Kinnock.
Conscious that 'negative campaigning' is alienating voters - not least
Conservative supporters' themselves - the public relations team at Central
Office believe they can promote Mr John Major's leadership qualities by
highlighting his achievements in the Gulf war and foreign affairs.
By pushing Mr Major's record the implicit comparison is with Mr Kinnock and
Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary. According to the polls they are
less trusted than their counterparts.
Reports that Labour has shelved another NHS broadcast were denied yesterday
by Mr Bryan Gould, the environment spokesman. But he insisted that health
would continue to be a central theme in Labour's campaign.
None the less, one senior Labour strategist said that final decisions on the
shape of party broadcasts were not being taken until the day they are due to
be shown.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour candidates want focus kept on NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR parliamentary candidates want the party leadership to keep the future
of the National Health Service at the top of its election agenda in spite of
last week's row over the controversial election broadcast.
There was a strong feeling that the row over the Jennifer Bennett case had
distracted from Labour's pledge of an extra Pounds 1bn NHS spending and its
warning about a 'two-tier' health system, but all the candidates questioned
believed that the future of the NHS must retain a high profile.
Mild disappointment that Labour had not moved further ahead in the opinion
polls was tempered with broad satisfaction at the campaign so far.
Candidates and officials appeared generally satisfied by the performance of
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in his ITV interview with Brian Walden
yesterday. Mr Kinnock faces what could be a tougher test tonight, when he is
questioned by David Dimbleby for BBC1's Panorama. To round off a hard week
of TV interviews, the Labour leader is interrogated by Sir Robin Day on ITV
on Thursday.
Experienced Labour candidates yesterday remarked on the slow start to the
Conservative campaign. 'It may be that their activists are less enthusiastic
because Mrs Thatcher has gone,' ventured Mr Alan Meale, who as candidate for
Mansfield defends Labour's smallest majority, just 56 votes.
Ms Clare Short, candidate for the safe seat of Birmingham Ladywood,
expressed concern about the lack of a Tory presence. After campaigning in
the nearby constituency of Birmingham Yardley, where the Liberal Democrats
are challenging hard, she said Labour would appreciate more of a fight.
Ms Short admitted that the Bennett case had probably helped the Liberal
Democrats as both main parties suffered a backlash to the bickering.
However, she added that regional polling suggested Labour was doing
'slightly better' than the national polls suggested.
A recent convert to proportional representation, she said she would like to
see more emphasis in London on Labour's programme of constitutional reforms.
'We have got a very radical agenda, people don't realise what a strong
package it is.'
In London, officials brushed aside the weekend polls, arguing that it may
take a little longer for the impact of the health issue to show through.
They said they expected Mr Neil Kinnock's ratings to improve as the election
campaign continued.
As Labour launched its package of measures for women yesterday, candidates
reported that the number of female volunteers working in the constituencies
had increased markedly over 1987.
Mr Robert Sheldon, seeking re-election as MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, said
unemployment and the closing of factories were the main issues being raised
in his constituency. There had been no reference to the controversial
broadcast.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pushing at the voters' open door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RED rose carefully adjusted in mackintosh lapel, Roy Hattersley was ready
for a routine canvass in his own political backyard.
Not many Labour party workers around. Not a great deal of point in
Birmingham Sparkbrook: safe Labour since Mr Hattersley won it in 1964. The
workers were in adjacent Conservative marginals.
But there are 80 people on the electoral roll at the Trinity Centre, a
shelter for the homeless and unemployed. The evening was not a good time to
visit, as the shelter official made clear. Retreat was blocked by a
resident. 'You Conservative lunatic,' he greeted the deputy leader of the
Labour party. 'I'm an alcoholic,' he declared to the world at large. To Mr
Hattersley he confided: 'This is not a good place to be. Labour wouldn't
have this sort of place.'
Certainly it would not from choice. But Sparkbrook needs it. The
constituency, just off Birmingham's city centre, has nearly 1,000 homeless
families, and unemployment is around 30 per cent.
Mr Hattersley moved on to streets of houses constructed for Victorian
artisans. 'I'm Roy Hattersley, your Labour candidate, may I count . . . ' -
the standard appeal. It was like pushing an open door: 'You've voted for me
seven times? Thank you very much indeed.'
He was among the Asian-origin population of Sparkbrook. Two of the three
wards in the constituency have an ethnic-minority population of more than 50
per cent. The West Indians have been and largely moved on. Ugandan Asians
came in the 1970s, Kashmiris in the 1980s. Islam is the main religion.
In spite of the fact that Asian names are starting to appear on the lists of
Conservative candidates, the ethnic vote largely belongs to Mr Hattersley.
'There is a certain air of 'why is he asking the question?'' Mr Hattersley
remarked after he had received another assurance of support.
By this time his canvass had turned into something of an evening out.
He had his knights of the realm with him, Mr Dick Knowles and Mr Stan Yapp:
veteran local politicians who work the constituency for him and preserve
their local base. But he had also collected a posse of children, who
followed his every move.
The cavalcade ran into Mrs Cherrill Burton, vice-chair of the Sparkhill
Residents Association. 'The last time I saw you was four years ago,' she
complained.
Mr Hattersley knows the problems of deprivation in Sparkbrook. 'There aren't
special tailor-made policies,' he said. 'This area wants what Labour is
offering generally to an extreme degree.'

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Percival Patterson, a 57-year-old, London-trained lawyer, will be sworn
in today as prime minister of Jamaica, succeeding Mr Michael Manley, who
retired on Saturday because of ill health.
Mr Manley's retirement took effect soon after the ruling People's National
party elected Mr Patterson as its president, giving him a margin of four
votes to every one in support of the only other contender, Miss Portia
Simpson, the labour and welfare minister.
Miss Simpson had support in the rural and inner-city areas, with Mr
Patterson being backed by the parliamentary party and the island's business
community.
After his victory became clear, Miss Simpson claimed there had been
irregularities in the voting, but said she would respect the result 'in the
interest of the party and the country'. In accepting his election to the
presidency of the PNP, Mr Patterson invited supporters of both factions to
unite under his leadership.
The impact of the row on the unity of the government will be reflected in
the composition of the cabinet Mr Patterson names this week. Mr Hugh Small,
finance minister, who supported Miss Simpson's candidature, said he doubted
he would be appointed.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Philippines plans more state sell-offs
</HEADLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippine government plans to auction off a majority stake in two more
large state groups - National Steel Corporation and Duty-Free Philippines.
This follows the success of its recent privatisation projects, involving
Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Philippine National Bank.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, disclosed that the government
planned to sell 51 per cent of National Steel Corporation and Duty-Free
Philippines before the administration of President Corazon Aquino ends its
term of office on June 30.
An estimated 4bn pesos (Pounds 96m) could be generated from the sale of
National Steel, which is controlled by the state National Development
Company. Another 1bn pesos could be generated from Duty-Free Philippines.
The possibility of selling off Manila Hotel is also being considered,
according to Mr Estanislao. The five-star hotel is owned by the Government
Service Insurance System, a state-run retirement and welfare fund for
public-sector employees.
The government last week turned over majority ownership of PAL to PR
Holdings, a consortium of local business groups.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Higher minimum wage, more hamburger-flippers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MINIMUM wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre
government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty,
public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. It is also largely
ineffective at solving any of them. But Labour's proposed minimum wage would
only be positively harmful if, as the Tories claim, it will reduce
employment. The recent international evidence is surprisingly mixed.
There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's
minimum wage. Most of them are based on model simulations of the UK economy.
All of them are, at best, semi-educated guesses; and probably not worth the
effort. No-one knows whether, or how, introducing a statutory minimum wage
would affect unskilled wages and employment.
International evidence is a better source of clues on the likely effects of
a UK minimum wage. The US, in particular, also has a large and highly
competitive service sector employing many women and young people at
relatively low wages. The federal government has increased the statutory
minimum wage twice in the past two years, most recently in April 1991.
Most US studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades
have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young
people. A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage
to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. By 1980 the
federal minimum wage was 75 per cent of the average wage in Puerto Rico's
manufacturing industry compared to 43 per cent on the mainland. Its
unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and
1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise
in the minimum wage.
Yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise
in the US minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. One of the
most careful, directed by Mr Lawrence Katz and Mr Alan Krueger of Harvard
and Princeton Universities, surveyed the wage and employment practices of
314 Burger King, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Texas in
August 1991. A third of them had also been surveyed the previous December,
before the higher federal minimum wage came into effect in April. Over half
of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45
cent increase in the minimum wage. Only 5 per cent of restaurants were
already paying more than the new minimum.
The survey directly contradicts the conventional view that raising the
minimum wage prices people out of jobs. On average, the restaurants that had
to increase their wages by more tended also to have a larger increase in
employment, as the right-hand chart shows. Each dot signifies one
restaurant's growth of wages and full-time employment. There are many
outliers; but the upward sloping 'best-fit' line between the dots indicates
a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between higher
mandated wage growth and higher employment. A 10 per cent wage increase is
predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent.
The survey does not suggest that raising the minimum wage increases
unemployment, at least among hamburger-flippers. One explanation is that
fast-food restaurants can impose below-market wages on their existing
employees but have to raise them to market rates in order to attract new
employees. Only when the government mandates this general wage increase does
expansion become profitable. But the result is not more skilled employment,
as Labour would have us believe. Moreover, the same argument would not apply
to internationally competitive industries; a similar study of textile
companies could well give the more conventional result. But the US evidence
does counsel against confident empirical generalisations.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Kashmiri police set to block militants' march
</HEADLINE>

   MUZAFFARABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of police and para-military troops were on alert yesterday in the
state capital, Muzaffarabad, in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, as security
was tightened ahead of a today's planned march by militants to cross a
disputed border with India.
The authorities intensified their search for the march leaders at the
weekend and cut some telephone links. A special law was introduced
prohibiting public gatherings of more than four people.
While militants vowed to press ahead with the march, government officials
were confident the turnout would be low. During a similar march last month
at least a dozen people were killed and many were injured after police
charged at demonstrators trying to reach the border.
A similar march is planned by militants from the Indian side of Kashmir in
an effort to cross the border into Pakistan, but officials believe the heavy
presence of Indian troops is unlikely to allow that.
Representatives of the militants said they were concerned that the turnout
would be low due to the Islamic fasting month of Ramadhan.
A goverment crackdown since last Wednesday has forced many of the march's
leaders to go into hiding. Mr Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir
Liberation Front (JKLF), the leading organisation which called the march, is
still in detention since his arrest last week.
The prime minister of Pakistani-ruled Kashmir, Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan,
said none of the militant leaders would be allowed to leave Muzaffarabad.
Militants leaving other cities to go to the border would also be stopped.
Mr Qayyum defended his goverment's position on the Kashmiri right to
self-determination leading to accession with Pakistan. He said: 'The
overwhelming majority of Kashmiris want accession to Pakistan. Our lifeline
depends on Pakistan.'
A day earlier Mr Rajaz Muzaffar, acting head of the JKLF, who plans to lead
today's march, said: 'In Indian-held Kashmir, Mr Saxena, the governor, has
pronounced that he will stop the march of the JKLF. In Muzaffarabad Abdul
Qayyum has announced the same. What is the difference between Saxena and
Abdul Qayyum?'
India and Pakistan have fought three wars on the disputed division of
Kashmir and many fear there could be further conflict as long as the dispute
remains unresolved.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Spanish strike looms over convergence plan: Big shake-up in
labour market proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government and the country's main trades unions are gearing up
for what may become their most disruptive dispute since the Socialists came
to power in 1982.
Both the main socialist and communist unions are now toying with calling a
general strike in protest at a reform of the labour market being proposed by
the government as the linchpin of its new strategy to converge with the
leading European Community economies and so be able to enter into monetary
union by 1997.
The convergence plan, which is aimed at taking Spain to within the economic
convergence limits decided upon at the EC summit in Maastricht last
December, was agreed by the cabinet on Friday.
Designed by finance minister Carlos Solchaga, the plan recognises the fact
that Spain has done little to combat its growing public deficits and left,
for the past five years, control of the economy largely to monetary policy.
Nevertheless, Mr Solchaga's plan calls for the general public sector deficit
to fall from around 4.4 per cent today to just 1 per cent by the end of
1996, a herculean task feasible only if massive cuts are made in public
spending.
These, it is clear, will be made in the labour market. The government would
cut subsidies to employers for creating jobs and extend the time in which
temporary job contracts remain valid from six months to a year. Normally,
after six months on a temporary contract, a worker has the right to a
permanent job. The measures will also mean it will take a year's work
(instead of six months) to be eligible for full unemployment benefit.
The government also plans to 'encourage' unemployed workers to look more
actively for jobs, and will penalise people not seeking jobs or failing to
accept offers away from their homes. While the plan is to be discussed with
the unions, Mr Solchaga said on Friday their support 'is not a key to its
success. It is not a wage negotiation.'
Mr Solchaga also said he wanted to stop runaway health service spending, and
the government may introduce measures to devolve managerial decision-making
to hospitals or clinics, and to make them responsible for their own
financial performances. While this would not be a Thatcherite privatisation,
many regional health ministers have already begun to pressure Madrid not to
cut health spending.
Union leaders warned over the weekend that the convergence plan represented
probably a bigger threat to their members than the job-creation programmes
that triggered a successful one-day general strike on December 14 1988.
Unemployment in Spain is running at around 16 per cent and though Mr
Solchaga has tried before to push tough spending cuts through the party
machine, he has always failed.
The labour market reforms will be seen by the unions and the political left
in Spain as a threat but this time Mr Solchaga appears to have won the
support of the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez.
A strike now would be a serous threat to Mr Gonzalez, disrupting Spain's
1992 celebrations and establishing a climate of confrontation ahead of a
general election expected to take place in about a year.
France has arrested the top military leader of Eta, the Spanish Basque
underground movement, French interior minister Philippe Marchand said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Marchand identified the arrested man as Francisco Garmendia, alias
Artapalo, believed to be the overall commander of Eta guerrillas operating
in Spain. Two aides were arrested with him.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Arab efforts to defuse Libya crisis near failure

THE latest Arab League attempt to defuse the crisis over Libya's refusal to
yield two men accused of bombing a US airliner appears near collapse after
further Libyan statements at the weekend.
Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, the Libyan foreign minister, vowed yesterday
that his country would not 'surrender' to demands that it hand over its
nationals for trial in the west.
A despondent Egyptian foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, said after a meeting
with President Hosni Mubarak and Mr Beshari: 'I see that things are
difficult and are not progressing towards a breakthrough the way one would
like.'
The United Nations Security Council is due early this week to approve a
resolution that would impose sanctions, including an arms and air embargo,
against Libya over its refusal to hand over Libyans allegedly involved in
the 1988 and 1989 bombings of US and French airliners in which a total of
441 people died.
The Arab League yesterday sent a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, outlining its understanding of the Libyan position.
League officials would not be drawn on its contents, but they expressed
little optimism of an early resolution of the crisis.
Moderate Arab states, notably Egypt, have been trying for months to head off
a looming confrontation with the west, fearing domestic troubles if Libya is
subjected to UN-imposed penalties.
Last week, a compromise appeared to be in the making when Libya indicated it
might be prepared to hand over the two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland, to the Arab League which would have passed them to
the UN secretary general.
But Tripoli balked, prompting speculation about serious differences in the
Libyan regime between Colonel Muammer Gadaffi and his number two, Major
Abdel-Salam Jalloud.
Col Gadaffi is being portrayed as a voice of reason in the Egyptian press,
while Maj Jalloud is depicted as the main obstacle to compromise.
Egyptians were furious last week after an Arab League committee led by its
secretary general, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, was insulted when it went to
Tripoli to discuss the crisis. Egypt was particularly incensed by a despatch
carried by Jana, the Libyan news-agency, which alleged that the Arab League
committee was acting under pressure from the 'Crusader West'.
This week's expected Security Council resolution follows one agreed in
January, demanding that Libya hand over nationals involved in bringing down
the two aircraft.

FT  30 MAR 92 / French reshuffle likely after minister's sacking: Socialists
suffer further setback in cantonal elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISMISSAL at the weekend of Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French minister for
public administration, means that President Francois Mitterrand will be
virtually forced to announce a government reshuffle this week, possibly
including replacement of Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister.
Pressure for changes in the government intensified yesterday with a sharp
setback for the Socialists in local cantonal voting.
Mr Soisson was a leading non-Socialist who had been recruited to broaden the
government's political base. With his dismissal coming on top of their
defeat in regional elections a week ago and now in cantonal voting, the
Socialists look increasingly isolated and feeble.
Preliminary returns last night showed that the Socialists lost numerous
seats to conservative opponents in the run-off second round of the cantonal
elections.
With 764 out of 1,423 cantons counted, the Interior Ministry said
conservative candidates shared 55.9 per cent of the vote, with the
Socialists and their allies winning only 32.8 per cent.
Initial results indicated the Socialists would lose five of the 29
departments they controlled - Nord, Puy de Dome, Drome, Gers and Dordogne.
All were long-standing Socialist bastions and Nord had been held by the Left
since 1934.
Mrs Cresson was only narrowly re-elected in a western cantonal constituency
of Chatellerault, while social affairs minister Jean-Louis Bianco was
defeated in a local poll in Provence.
Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister, conceded that the results were a fresh
setback for the party and the government. 'The voters have given a warning,
a sign of dissatisfaction,' he said. 'The government must take account of
this.'
Socialist Party leader Laurent Fabius said: 'This is a serious failure for
the Socialist party and it must be recognised honestly. . . We must hear the
message that the French people have sent us.'
The most immediate implication of Mr Soisson's sacking is that it may become
much more difficult for the Socialists to secure the support of moderate
conservatives, either as members of the government or in parliament. Indeed,
it may be impossible so long as Mrs Cresson remains prime minister, since
her feisty character is not naturally suited for consensus building.
Mr Soisson was sacked by Mrs Cresson on the grounds that he had accepted the
support of the extreme right-wing National Front members of the newly
elected Bourgogne regional council in the ballot for council president.
Mr Soisson, whose surprise election was secured by only one vote, claimed
that all his votes in the secret ballot came from respectable political
parties. But the bare figures suggest he may have got help from the National
Front, and the National Front leadership has been careful to sustain the
uncertainty.
Mrs Cresson gave Mr Soisson the option of choosing between his seat in
government and his presidency of the regional council. He chose Bourgogne.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Pounds 500m EC funds plea for aircraft industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community should inject Ecu700m (Pounds 500m) of research funds
into the European aircraft industry, and help EC aerospace companies protect
themselves from exchange rate fluctuations, according to a controversial
report being prepared by the Commission's industry department.
The draft paper on the industry, which comes at a sensitive point in EC-US
talks on aircraft subsidies, has already run into internal opposition from
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner.
The latest draft will be discussed with aerospace experts from EC member
states tomorrow. Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, was hoping
to win his colleagues' approval for the paper next week in Strasbourg, and
publish it on April 8 with a similar report on the EC automotive industry.
But competition officials in Brussels are already pressing for substantial
changes to both papers and even senior industry officials admit that
alterations may be necessary. For example, the explicit reference to the
need for Ecu700m of aerospace research funding between 1994 and 1998 is
likely to be withdrawn, because the Commission has yet to decide how to
allocate research funds for those years.
The paper examines how to preserve the European aircraft industry's
industrial and technological competitiveness, faced with a weak world
economy and waning defence budgets. It suggests action in a number of areas,
including harmonisation of standards, improved vocational training and the
establishment of a coherent European air traffic control system.
But the draft is likely to revive the argument about mergers in the sector,
which reached its peak last year when the Commission voted to follow Sir
Leon's recommendation and block the Franco-Italian bid for De Havilland, the
Canadian aircraft maker. Mr Bangemann opposed the decision and competition
officials believe the draft paper is too heavily weighted towards his
interpretation of the EC's merger rules.
It also tackles sensitive trade issues, such as how to reduce the European
aircraft sector's vulnerability to dollar exchange movements. The document
says a working group should be set up to examine the feasibility of an
'exchange risk insurance system', which, it adds, would be self-financed and
conform with Gatt subsidy rules.
The EC aircraft industry is itself unhappy about some aspects of the
Commission paper. European aircraft makers are concerned that it gives
ground to the US at a crucial point in subsidy negotiations, by suggesting
that it should be possible to reduce the EC's direct state aids for
financing new EC aircraft programmes.
EC and US negotiators met in Washington last week for final talks about
aircraft subsidies. If they do not reach agreement by tomorrow, the issue
may have to be resolved through Gatt disputes procedures.

INTEL, the largest US semiconductor maker, has pre-empted another challenge
to its dominance of the market for personal computer microprocessors.
It has filed a patent infringement suit against Cyrix, a small Texas company
that is today announcing its own version of one of Intel's widely-used
microprocessors.
Anticipation of the Cyrix announcement fuelled a sharp decline in Intel's
stock price last week.
Before seeing the Cyrix chip, Intel filed a suit charging Cyrix with
infringing four patents that protect Intel's microprocessor technology.
Intel said that its claims were based on information gleaned from financial
analysts
Mr Thomas Dunlap, Intel general counsel, said: 'We do not believe that it is
possible to produce a chip that is compatible with our 386 microprocessor
without infringing our patents.' Intel is seeking a preliminary injunction
to prevent Cyrix from selling its microprocessor chip.
Intel has filed suit against all of its would-be competitors, but has yet to
win an injunction to prevent them from selling the look-alike chips.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Aid budgets may be pooled under trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S national aid budgets could eventually be pooled as part of a common
foreign trade policy, according to officials in Brussels. This long-term
objective has emerged as efforts gather pace to lay common ground rules
across the European Community for tied aid and export credit terms to
developing countries.
The EC has in the past year set up two working parties intended to prepare
reports on eventual harmonisation of export finance practices among member
states. It has also worked closely with the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on limiting how tied aid can be
mixed with commercial credits to win contracts in the developing world.
Since February 15, such aid can only be mixed in projects that are not
commercially viable, and in the poorest of developing countries.
Country by country, exporters complain that cheap export credit insurance,
and the practice of mixing aid with commercial loans, are used by
competitors to snatch contracts.
The possibility of pooling aid funds is the longest-term aim of one of the
two working parties - that headed by an official seconded from Coface,
France's leading export credit agency. This group is concentrating on
'non-marketable risk' - export finance that cannot be commercially
supported, because the project has a life of more than three years, or
because it is in a poor or volatile country where the danger of default is
high.
The first aim of the group is to harmonise 'technical ground conditions' for
providing export credit cover. This will include getting export credit
agencies to agree on the percentage of the value of a contract they will
insure, what kinds of risk they will insure, and for how many years cover
will be provided.
The second aim will be to harmonise export credit insurance premium rates.
Stage three will aim to establish a 'common cover policy', under which
governments agree on what risk category different export markets fall into,
adjusting premium rates accordingly. At present, many governments tinker
with rates as part of their foreign or defence policies, pointing cheap
credits at allies regardless of commercial risk.
'If the Maastricht Treaty (on European union) is completed, then it should
make it easier to reach a common foreign trade policy,' an EC official said.
With this, and a 'common cover policy' for developing countries in place, it
would be a comparatively small step to pooling national aid funds centrally
in the EC. Exporters from across the EC could then tap the common aid pool,
regardless of which country is sponsoring a project.
'It would be too idealistic to over-estimate the speed of progress that is
possible,' an official said. 'We have to move forward cautiously.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Pay pledge by Kinnock brings Tory tax assault: Conservatives
switch from 'negative campaign' but hit at Labour public sector plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLEDGE from Mr Neil Kinnock that a Labour government would not allow
public sector pay to fall further behind the private sector yesterday
provoked a Conservative charge that the 'open-ended' commitment would bring
new tax rises.
The accusation came in spite of assurances from Conservative strategists
that they have switched their tactics to stress the positive vision behind
their election message.
Party officials said that today's news conference on tax would meet
criticism of 'negative campaigning' from Conservative supporters by
promoting the advantages of a low-tax economy.
They will combine this with a detailed analysis of the impact of Labour's
plans on the incomes of skilled and semi-skilled workers.
Yesterday Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, revived Labour's own tax
warnings by repeating charges that the Conservatives' are planning to raise
or extend the range of value added tax.
But his efforts to pre-empt the Conservative tax assault was, in part,
deflected by close questioning over Labour's plans for public sector pay.
Earlier, Mr Kinnock had remarked in an interview on London Weekend
Television's Walden programme that Labour would halt the deterioration in
public sector pay rates in relation to private sector increases.
Under pressure from the interviewer, he insisted that Labour was 'too
prudent' to try to bridge the gap between private and public sector pay. But
he added: 'We are going to stop the gap widening.'
His comments, however, provoked further questions at a Labour news
conference as to how the party would achieve this without raising public
expenditure at a time when private sector pay is outstripping inflation.
In an effort to clarify the position, Mr Smith added the rider, included in
the Labour's manifesto, that public sector pay rates would be linked to
'clearly defined budget limits.'
Calling on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to fulfil his pledge to meet
him in a television debate, he said there was no danger of any repeat of the
wages spiral that ended with the 'winter of discontent' of public sector
strikes in 1978-79.
However, Mr Kinnock's remarks provoked Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative
chairman, to warn that Labour's public sector pay promise would add to a
manifesto 'bulging with spending pledges that can only be met by higher
taxation'.
The election campaign's return to economic issues came as figures on
business failures in the first quarter of this year showed weekly rates at
1,240 against 800 in the same period last year.
Weekend opinion polls showing Labour holding a lead of between 1 and 4
points in four surveys and a Harris/Observer poll showing the Tories 2
points ahead have calmed some Conservative fears of a sharp surge to their
opponents.
But while party officials insist that there has been no weekend outbreak of
'jitters', Mr John Major is understood to have ordered his team to target
the crucial C2 voters and the 'Don't Knows' with a more upbeat message.
The prime minister is said to have told party workers that people 'don't
want to vote Labour, but want to know why they should vote for us.'
Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats saw their poll ratings climb by 3 to 4
points in all but one poll. This gain was widely attributed to voters'
distaste at the squabbling between the two main parties over Labour's
controversial health broadcast last week.
The new 'positive' phase of the Tory campaign began in earnest yesterday
with ministerial speeches from Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the environment and education secretaries, focused on the Tory record and
and Mr Major's plan to devolve power to local people.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Lamonts stand up for their namesake: Conservatives switch
from 'negative campaign' but hit at Labour public sector plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT may be having a less than scintillating election campaign,
but he is winning the vote of the Lamont clan.
In an informal FT poll of small companies which carry the Lamont name, only
one in three said it hoped to see a new chancellor after the election.
Several said their businesses have been helped by being called Lamont, in
spite of the chancellor's association with the deep recession, and his
relatively poor image among directors of big companies.
The 20 companies in the poll are linked by the Lamont name but operate in a
range of sectors.
Even though most of the people quizzed are Tory supporters, many admitted to
hard times in the recession and were unhappy with the party's economic
record.
However, Mr Lamont did much better in the poll than in an earlier FT survey
of directors of big companies. Only 39 per cent of these said they wanted to
see him continue in office, with 46 per cent preferring Labour's Mr John
Smith as chancellor.
Just seven of the small company representatives wanted to see Mr Lamont
replaced, while 11 favoured him and two were undecided. Eleven said they
would vote Tory, with six for an opposition party and three undecided.
Among supporters of the chancellor is Mr Alan Lamont, director of Lamont
Clamping Systems, of St Ives near Cambridge, which sells woodworking
equipment. 'He is a rather dour individual, but I have no grounds for
thinking that he is any worse at his job than anyone else,' he said.
Another backer is Miss Alison Lamont, who runs Lamont for Beauty, a beauty
parlour in Diss, Norfolk. She liked the Budget, which she said would give
people 'more money in their pay packets for treatments like mine'.
Mr Gordon Lamb, proprietor of Lamont Interiors, a builder in Farnborough,
Hampshire, hoped Mr Lamont would continue as chancellor, although he said:
'He should admit he has made mistakes; he should say, 'OK, I've copped it'.'
Lamont Holdings, a six-person London telecommunications company, has gained
through its association with the chancellor's name, according to Mr Alex
Covell, a director. 'It has been a form of advertising,' he said.
Mr Albert Lamont, a tailor in Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland, said he was
'very lucky' to share the chancellor's name.
Mr Graham Lamont, a chartered accountant in Workington, Cumbria, has cashed
in on the Lamont association. For the past two years, he has organised a
'Budget breakfast' for clients the day after Mr Lamont has presented his
Budget to parliament.
In contrast, Mr Charlie Doran, manager at Lamont City Farm, in Erskine, west
of Glasgow, is a Labour supporter, and no fan of the chancellor. 'The words
I would use to describe Mr Lamont are not printable,' he said.
Mr John Lamont, who farms 450 acres near Elgin, Moray, said the chancellor
had weak presentational skills. 'I would like to see him replaced. I would
buy a used car from John Smith, but I wouldn't buy one from Norman Lamont,'
he said.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Volkswagen's new head to cut 12,500 jobs over five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest car producer, is appointing a new chief
executive and planning drastic action to cut costs, including the axing of
12,500 jobs over the next five years.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, 54, an Austrian with a reputation for toughness who runs
VW's successful Audi subsidiary, has been chosen to take over from Mr Carl
Hahn next January. Mr Hahn, 65, had been given a two-year extension of his
contract, but will step down a year earlier than planned.
The company said the cuts of 2,500 a year in its 130,000-strong workforce
would occur through natural wastage and would not involve redundancies. It
denied a report that cuts of up to 25,000 were planned.
The choice by an inner committee of the company's supervisory board of Mr
Piech as group head underlines VW's determination to streamline its
business. While an engineer at Audi, he was involved in several
technological innovations and as its chief executive has presided over a
period of rising profits and successful model launches.
Until the last few weeks, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a Frenchman who joined VW
from Ford Motors' German subsidiary two years ago, had been regarded as the
favoured candidate to succeed Mr Hahn. But with the backing of both trade
union and corporate representatives on the supervisory board, it became
clear recently that Mr Piech was in the lead.
The appointment still requires the approval of the full non-executive
supervisory board at its next meeting on April 10, but this is expected to
be a formality. Mr Goeudevert, 50, who is responsible for the VW marque
within the group, will be appointed deputy chief executive.
VW also announced a 2.5 per cent rise in group net profits to DM1.1bn
(Pounds 380m) for 1991, with turnover up by 12 per cent to DM76bn. The
dividend will be unchanged at DM11 a share. However, it said that profits of
the parent company, which reflect domestic performance, fell by a third to
DM447m.
Mr Stephen Reitman, motors analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London
stockbrokers, said the VW parent could be losing money on car sales before
financial and other income was added in. VW has declined to comment on
previous reports that this was the case and its figures, like those of other
German companies, do not make this clear.
'They've got to get their break-even levels way down,' he added. It was
against this background that Mr Piech's appointment should be judged. 'It's
not time to be courting popularity,' he said. 'He will be the man who
rattles cages.
Similar cost problems are being experienced at other motor concerns in
Germany, which has Europe's highest labour costs outside Sweden. German car
companies have a productivity lead, but other European countries have been
catching up.
VW's main rival in Germany is Opel, part of General Motors of the US. Opel
has been reporting steadily rising profits in recent years and its new Astra
family car is in direct competition with the third generation of VW's Golf
model.
Both companies are building new plants in east Germany.

   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olympia &amp; York, the financially strapped property developer, has postponed a
meeting which it was due to hold in London today with its bankers and other
participants in the Docklands Canary Wharf project.
Canadian-based O&amp;Y said last night that 'the time is better spent in
Toronto' preparing for a meeting on April 6 at which the company will
present interim proposals for restructuring its CDollars 20bn (Pounds 9.6bn)
debt.
The London meeting was to have been attended by Mr Tom Johnson, O&amp;Y's new
president, and by its financial advisers. However, some European banks which
Mr Johnson was to have met are understood to have been represented at a
meeting in Toronto last Friday between O&amp;Y and about 20 of its key
creditors. No new date has been set for the London talks.
In a separate development, Canada's Reichmann family, owners of O&amp;Y, have
injected more than CDollars 30m into their company by buying the property
developer's stake in Camdev Corp, the company once controlled by fallen real
estate developer Robert Campeau.
Details of the transaction emerged last Friday as the company announced that
it had asked lenders to freeze principal repayments on its debt pending the
presentation of the April 6 restructuring plan.
Meanwhile, inquiries by the Financial Times have shown that 17 per cent of
the Toronto-based company's US portfolio, which comprises 29m sq ft of

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (12): Confident about the
future - Profile: Krka pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is a good thing that Krka's balance sheet does not depend on sales of
snails.
The war, and the breakdown of the transport and distribution network
throughout most parts of the former Yugoslavia, have meant that Krka has not
been able to obtain snails from the republic of Serbia.
Luckily, snails, which are exported by Krka to France, make up a tiny
fraction of the exports of a company which is Slovenia's largest
,manufacturer of pharmaceuticals.
The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and tough business, as
Mr Joze Colaric, director of Krka's export division, is the first to admit.
The collapse of the communist system throughout the countries of eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), or former Soviet
Union, has opened up opportunities for western companies.
But Mr Colaric reckons that Krka is in a strong position to maintain, and
expand its markets in this region because of its experience and presence in
this part of Europe for several years. Exports of pharmaceutical products
account for 3.6 per cent of Slovenia's exports.
In the first nine months of last year, Krka's exports to eastern Europe
increased by 18 per cent to 78 per cent, compared to the same period in
1990. In particular, exports to Poland in 1991 totalled Dollars 30m, an
increase of Dollars 19.3m.
Krka's turnover in 1991 amounted to Dollars 280m, of which Dollars 120m was
earned from exports to eastern Europe, and Dollars 14m earned from exports
to western markets.
'We export ready-made drugs to eastern Europe and the CIS, and raw materials
to western countries,' explains Mr Colaric. 'Our strengths are in exporting
finished products to eastern Europe. We know these markets inside out,' he
says.
Closer to home, Krka realises that it cannot ignore the market in the former
Yugoslavia. Sales to the Yugoslav market fell by 20 per cent in 1991 and are
expected to fall by an additional 5 per cent. This is hardly surprising,
given the war, the disruption in the monetary and financial system, and the
poor relations between Slovenia and Serbia, which opposed Slovenia's
declaration of independence on June 25.
Indeed, Krka lost one of its recently-built factories in Surljig, in the
republic of Serbia, after the local workforce took over control of the
plant.
Despite the problems, Mr Colaric is optimistic about Krka's future relations
with the former Yugoslavia.
'Outstanding payments owed by Serbia to Krka amount to Dollars 10m-Dollars
15m,' he said. 'But we are still supplying Serbia. The republic pays us with
sugar, soya beans, starch and copper. Serbia is strong in raw materials.'
Krka is fortunate in the sense that 70 per cent of its raw materials for
pharmaceutical products are manufactured in Slovenia.
Inevitably, as economic reforms in Slovenia progress, and financial
discipline is introduced in a banking and accounting system which was
extremely lax, companies such as Krka will have to think hard about
ownership structures.
At the moment, the company is socially-owned, which means that the
workforce, not the state or private individuals, can decide about its
future.
'We are interested in foreign partners, but we want to have a controlling
interest in the company,' said Mr Colaric. Krka is in need of capital. Its
long-term debts total Dollars 1m and its commercial debts - to suppliers -
amount to Dollars 12m.
But because its reputation among western pharmaceutical companies is high -
companies such as Wellcome and Sandoz have extended licences to Krka - and
because Krka has an attractive network of spas throughout Slovenia which
account for 10 per cent of its annual turnover, Mr Colaric believes the
company is in a strong negotiating position.
'We know the region (of eastern Europe), we know the markets, our labour
costs are low, and we have a highly-skilled work force. We are confident
about the future,' he adds.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (11): Focus on expanding
markets - Profile: Iskra Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGH sheer hard work, skilled expertise, and good business sense,
Iskratel, a joint venture company in which Siemens holds a 47.2 per cent
share, is thriving. But no thanks is due to the former Slovene government.
Iskratel is part of the Iskra Telecom group, the successor of Iskra
Telematika which was founded in 1946 in Slovenia to manufacture electronics
and high precision equipment.
Today, the group consists of 12 companies specialising in the production and
marketing of telecommunications equipment, high-quality computer equipment,
and services.
The majority owner of the Iskra Telecom group is Iskra Telecom Holding which
was established in 1989 as one of the first holding corporations in the
former Yugoslavia. It controls the programmes and strategies of the dozen
companies which are grouped under this parent company.
The creation of Iskra Telecom Holding was one of the main prerequisites for
Iskratel entering into a joint venture with Siemens.
The joint venture was mooted in the late 1980s, when the late Mr Franz-Josef
Strauss, former West German defence minister, visited Slovenia. At that
time, the Iskra group had already been co-operating for some years with
another west European telecoms company.
Slovenia's communist authorities, anxious to attract Siemens to the
republic, proposed to the Iskra management that if it ended co-operation
with the other west European company, it would match the capital put up by
Siemens.
Siemens, for its part, was anxious to gain a foothold in this part of
southern Europe.
'We have not seen one penny from the Slovene authorities,' said an Iskratel
employee. 'We really needed that capital to invest and to restructure.' The
employee, a computer engineer, said the government created the Iskra Telecom
group so as to carve out Iskratel from the core company in such a way that
it would be attractive to Siemens.
'The Iskra company was beginning to have financial problems at that time.
Naturally, a foreign partner did not want to inherit any debts from our
side,' the employee explained.
'Luckily, the joint venture has worked out. But the much-promised capital
from the government would have given us greater clout with our foreign
partner. We could have marketed our own products more successfully in
Europe,' he added.
Despite broken promises, and some restructuring difficulties, Iskratel has
pulled through successfully, and looks set to strengthen its markets
throughout this part of southern and eastern Europe.
As a joint venture, Iskratel produces and markets EWSD, a digital electronic
switching system for public communication networks. This has been licenced
from Siemens.
This system is complemented by the Slovene-produced SI 2000 digital
switching system which is specifically designed for private and public
networks of small and medium capacities, and is particularly suited to rural
and less-developed regions. This is licenced from Iskra Telecom.
Mr Andrej Polenec, managing director of Iskratel, says the complementary
system is very successful. 'The two programmes are compatible and suit the
needs of our future strategy,' he explained.
Iskratel has its eye on expanding into the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), or the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and Turkey.
Turnover in exports to the CIS, particularly the Ukraine, amounted to DM10m
last year, and in 1991, turnover to Turkey exceeded DM10m, an increase of 13
per cent.
'This part of Europe - the CIS, eastern Europe and Turkey - is potentially a
vast market for us,' said Mr Polenec. 'We know the region, we have the
contacts and skills from many years experience of working with electronics
and telecommunications here in Slovenia, and we are competitive, yet
sophisticated,' he said.
Iskratel is also determined to capture the large market of the former
Yugoslavia.
Despite the war, and the change in the units of currencies in Slovenia and
Croatia, Iskratel has not encountered any big difficulties in payments with
any of the republics.
'For instance, we have concluded business with the republic of Serbia's PTT
worth between DM16m and DM17m,' said Mr Polenec. 'When we have payment
problems with Serbia, we deal in barter. After all, the economies of
Slovenia and Serbia are complementary. In lieu of money, we receive copper
and cable, which are the strengths of the Serbian economy,' he said.
'I reckon Iskratel is in a good position to provide the former Yugoslavia
with our switching system,' he added.
The balance sheet of Iskratel is now healthy. Debts amounting to DM20m have
been cleared. Siemens extended a DM20m credit line - in addition to capital
 -which is guaranteed by one of Slovenia's largest banks. The company has
also been restructured. The workforce has been reduced from 2,200 to 1,100.
The initial start-up capital amounted to DM52m, with Siemens contributing
DM25m, and Iskra Telecom, DM27m. Turnover last year totalled DM134m, an
increase of 30 per cent on the previous year. The company estimates a
turnover of DM159m in 1992, reaching DM228m by 1996. About 12 per cent of
turnover is earmarked for research and development. Profits in 1992 will
exceed last year's total of DM500,000.
'Investments have been considerable. Siemens invested DM25m. The initial
investment phase is now coming to an end, so we expect bigger profits,'
explained Mr Polenec.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (10): Hard work, flexibility
and common sense - Profile: Mura textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is not often you find a Louis Feraud or a Boss label in any of the
textile factories in eastern Europe, or in any of the republics of the
former Yugoslavia.
And it is seldom in this part of Europe that you come across young men and
women designing and working on computers for next season's fashions.
But this is precisely what is taking place in the Mura textile factory,
which is located in Muraska Sobota, a town of 16,000 inhabitants set on the
great Pannonian plains in north-eastern Slovenia and almost touching the
borders of Hungary.
Here, the people of Muraska Sobota have been engaged in the textile industry
since 1925 when Mr Janez Cvetic set up a small workshop in which he employed
four women to sew underwear. Since then, the textile factory, which was
nationalised after the Second World War, has expanded into an export-driven
enterprise, spread over eight plants, employing more than 6,500 people and
exceeding an annual turnover of DM130m.
Mr Bozo Kuharic, the general director of Mura, puts the successful growth
and expansion down to hard work, flexibility, and common sense.
'Three years ago, we knew that the political climate throughout Yugoslavia
was changing. It was becoming more complicated to do business with the other
republics. So we concentrated even more on expanding the export side of the
business,' he explains.
Today, more than 90 per cent of Mura's production is geared specifically for
western markets. The textile industry in Slovenia contributes more than 7
per cent to the republic's GDP and employs more than 50,000 people. It has
traditionally been an export-oriented industry.
'Over the past few years, we saw how we were losing part of the Yugoslav
market,' says Mr Kuharic, 51, who joined the company 24 years ago and who
has been general director for the past 14 years.
'We were ready to find new export markets - after all, the export business
is nothing new for us. Thirty years ago, it was decided by the management
that it should be export driven, and we have not looked back since,' he
says.
Mura, as a general principle, does not sell to western markets under its own
label although it has two of its own labels which it markets abroad.
Instead, European retailers, equipped with their own designs, commission
Mura to cut and manufacture the products.
Mrs Danijel Plemenitas, the technical manager, says that more than
three-quarters of its clients are 'steady'.
'This means that our employees can identify with the label. We try to have
the factory floor designed in such a way that one group of employees will be
sewing for one particular western retailer. I suppose it builds up a kind of
loyalty,' said Mrs Plemenitas.
Mura's biggest client is Germany, which accounts for 70 per cent of its
turnover, followed by the rest of the European Community countries. Mr
Kuharic says the US and Britain remain difficult markets because of textile
quotas. As a means of trying to expand into the US market, Mura established
a joint venture in New York in which it holds a 25 per cent stake. It also
has a joint venture in Munich.
The comfortable turnover of Mura means that it can update its equipment, and
import quality fabrics, mostly from Italy. Its annual imports total DM30m.
In recent years, the company has been investing about DM10m in machinery,
particularly computers. Recently, it has been diversifying into computer
software management programmes which it sells to other enterprises in
Slovenia. These sales now account for about 10 per cent of its turnover. In
the near future, the Mura management plans to invest in computerised cutting
machines.
But the future also raises questions about whether the capital base of the
enterprise should be increased.
Mr Kuharic says Mura will only negotiate a privatisation package if the
company is treated on equal terms with a bidder.
At the moment, Mura is socially-owned, which means that neither the state,
nor private individuals, own the company. Instead, it is owned by the
workers. Under the terms of a federal law passed by the Yugoslav government
in 1989, they have the right to buy out the company themselves, or initiate
privatisation proceedings with a foreign partner through Slovenia's Agency
for Privatisation, and the republic's development fund which are overseeing
the republic's privatisation process.
'We will be eventually transformed into a limited company,' said Mr Kuharic.
'About 15 per cent of the shares would be held by the employees, 40 per cent
would be sold to a domestic or foreign partner, and we would decide later
what to with the remaining 40 per cent of the shares. It depends on what
kind of legislation the Slovene government decides,' he says.
Mr Kuharic says Mura's capital base is strong. 'We do not have any
outstanding loans or credits. We can use our foreign exchange earnings as we
wish.'
In common with other enterprises in Slovenia and the other republics of the
former Yugoslavia, the management of Mura is represented on the board of the
local Ljubljanska Bank. Mr Kuharic thinks that in future, creditors should
not be members of the boards of banks.
And what about eventually marketing Mura's own label among western
retailers? Mrs Plemenitas says the company spends little on marketing its
own product, adding that Mura's strength is its flexibility and its
reliability in satisfying its clients.
'Launching our own label would require a large investment in terms of
marketing. I suppose it is a question of perception. It is like trying to
compete with a Mercedes,' she said.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (9): Harsh realities after
euphoria - Judy Dempsey on the political background
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST government coalitions have a honeymoon period. But sooner or later,
they file for divorce. Slovenia is no exception.
Across the post-communist world of eastern Europe, the young,
democratically-elected governments, of which several are coalitions, are
struggling to create strong and stable democratic institutions. Most of them
have written new constitutions aimed at breaking completely with the
communist period. All have had free parliamentary elections. Again, Slovenia
is no exception.
But this small republic of 2m people is unique among the former communist
countries.
The six-party Demos coalition which was elected in April 1990, and which is
headed by the Christian Democratic Party under Mr Lozje Peterle, prime
minister, had to fight for its independence when the Yugoslav federal army
attacked Slovenia after it declared its independence on June 25, 1991.
Throughout the war, Slovenia was effectively ruled by a triumvirate of
ministers consisting of Mr Janez Jansa, defence minister, Mr Igor Bavcar,
interior minister, and Mr Jelko Kacin, information minister. None of them
belong to the Christian Democratic Party, the dominant party ion the
six-party coalition government.
At the helm was Mr Milan Kucan, president of Slovenia, who, as a
reform-minded leader of the republic's communist party in the mid-1980s,
moved Slovenia towards political pluralism and independence.
After the European Community-brokered Brioni accord in July 1991, in which
the Yugoslav army agreed to withdraw from Slovenia and Slovenia imposed a
three-month moratorium on the implementation of its independence, the ruling
Demos coalition started fraying at the edges.
The euphoria of defeating the Yugoslav army gave way to the harsh realities
of trying to set up institutions for independence and the market economy.
Introduction of new laws on privatisation, foreign investment and the
restructuring of the banking system has proved difficult. They have also led
to bitter divisions within the government, for which there are three
reasons.
First, the government consists of 27 ministries in which there is little or
no co-ordination. No one questions the need to reduce the government by
half. Nor does anyone doubt the jostling for posts among the coalition
partners in any new government.
Second, the government has inherited the former communist 'parliamentary'
system common to the other republics of the former Yugoslavia. This system
is composed of three 80-member chambers: the Chamber of Associated Labour,
the Chamber of Communes, and the Socio-Political Chamber. Together these
three chambers make up the 240-strong Assembly (or parliament).
The Demos coalition holds 55 per cent of the assembly seats, but it has not
got a majority in the Chamber of Associated Labour. As a result, pushing
draft legislation through the three chambers is politically difficult, as
well as time-consuming.
For the sake of consensus, bills are often watered down, or else rejected.
Moreover, most acts require a two-thirds majority vote from among all three
chambers. The government's property and ownership laws, which required a
simple majority vote, were faced with 240 amendments from the chambers. All
those amendments had to be voted upon in each of the three chambers.
On a more optimistic note, the next election should produce a more efficient
parliament because the constitution has replaced this cumbersome,
bureaucratic system with a smaller bicameral system.
Finally, government legislation has been delayed, indeed paralysed, because
of internal rivalries and the break-up of the Demos coalition.
This occurred in February after a group of independent deputies attempted to
make the government leaner and more efficient by calling for a vote of no
confidence against the incumbent government.
The attempt to unseat Mr Peterle was led by Mr Marko Voljc, who has worked
with the World Bank since the 1970s. Mr Peterle, a Roman Catholic who is
more interested in opening churches than visiting factories and who has
little interest in economic affairs, has lost several ministers because of
disagreements over economic policy.
The attempt to toppled the government failed. But in the process, the
government is now polarised between the conservative Christian Democrats and
the Peoples (former Farmers') Party on the one side, and on the other, by
the liberals, who are grouped around the Democratic Party, led by Mr Bavcar,
and the Liberal Democratic Party.
Economists and bankers in Slovenia say that the disagreements and endless
quarreling in the government could be resolved by calling fresh elections,
which would give the next government a clear mandate for reforms.
But no elections can be held until the assembly has agreed an electoral law.
On that point, no party can agree on whether it should be proportional
representation, first past the post, or a mixture of both systems.
'I would like elections as quickly as possible,' says Mr Kucan. He will run
again for president, but is expected to face stiff opposition from Mr Janez
Drnovsek, the former Yugoslav federal president.
Unless a spectacular wind of goodwill, reason, and consensus prevails over
the next few weeks, elections will not be held until the autumn. 'The longer
we delay, the more time we will lose in introducing reforms,' added Mr
Kucan.

Privatisation
</HEADLINE>

IT is doubtful if Professor Jeffrey Sachs, one of the most ardent proponents
of the shock therapy programme which seeks to privatise the economies of the
former communist countries in the shortest possible period of time, will be
returning to Slovenia in the near future.
Prof Sachs, from Harvard University, is one of three professors advising the
Russian government on a 'shock transition' to a market economy. His plan for
Slovenia, first unveiled to the Slovene parliament in April 1991, involved a
massive and speedy privatisation to be centralised and administered by the
government.
But his programme for Slovenia's privatisation programme deepened the
divisions in the government and precipitated the resignation of two of the
government's most talented ministers - Mr Joze Mencinger, the deputy prime
minister and economics professor at the University of Ljubljana, and Mr
Marko Krajnac, the finance minister.
Both are now at Slovenia's central bank keeping a tight hold on monetary
policy.
The two ministers resigned for one main reason. 'We wanted a decentralised
system of privatisation which was suited to the Slovene economy,' says Mr
Mencinger.
'The idea was that an enterprise could choose from many methods of
transformation (towards privatisation) laid down by the law and could even
combine them,' he said.
'The government would determine the rules for the privatisation and would
monitor it, but would not administer it. Privatisation would be gradual;
there would be no free distribution of shares at the beginning of the
process and enterprises would be transformed into joint stock, or limited
companies, in two years,' he added.
In broad terms, the Sachs model, supported by Mr Lozje Peterle, prime
minister, Mr Andrej Ocvirk, deputy prime minister, and Mr Igor Umek,
minister responsible for privatisation, was in two stages.
The first phase involved a distribution of a percentage of the enterprise
shares to employees, and to a development fund. Later, shares from the
development fund would be transferred to five newly-created investment funds
which would be distributed among the citizens of Slovenia.
The main thrust behind this plan was to create a model for ownership and a
definition of property rights as soon as possible.
In common with the rest of the republics of the former Yugoslavia - but not
with the countries of eastern Europe - property is socially owned. It is
owned neither by the state nor by private individuals, but by the workers.
Until recently, however, they had not been free to raise equity by selling
this socially-owned property.
Thus, both privatisation plans had to determine how best to transfer
socially-owned property into private ownership. Should it first be
transformed into state-owned property, or should enterprises be given a
range of options about how to privatise.
The Sachs programme was criticised on the grounds that real ownership would
rest in the hands of the state and the politicians. One year later, the
Slovene coalition government is still debating a privatisation bill. 'We now
have a bill which the government is discussing,' says Mr Igor Umek.
'It is a compromise, taking into account aspects of the two former proposals
on privatisation,' said Mr Umek. The current bill envisages that:
Up to 20 per cent of the values of the assets will be distributed at a
discount to the employees;
20 per cent of the shares will be distributed to the population through
mutual funds;
10 per cent of the shares will be earmarked for a retirement fund;
10 per cent of the shares will be placed in a restitution fund (set up to
compensate those whose property was confiscated or nationalised by the
communists after the Second World War);and
The remaining 40 per cent will be sold to foreign or domestic buyers.
Despite the political wrangling over new legislation, Slovene enterprises,
of whom many are anxious to raise equity, have been able to use the federal
government's enterprise law and foreign investment law, both of which were
passed in late 1989.
The two laws divided ownership into social, co-operative, mixed and private
ownership. A federal law on social capital, which was passed in 1989, gave
workers' councils the right to sell companies to private owners. The
proceeds were paid into a special development fund. Agencies were set up in
each republic to assist enterprises in this work.
Later, in August 1990, employee buy-outs were allowed through the purchase
of 'internal shares' at a discount, but sales of these shares were
prohibited on the securities markets.
The federal law, although radical, contained several weaknesses. The Slovene
government, elected in April 1990, took advantage of the federal legislation
and attempted to close the loopholes.
An Agency for the Promotion of Economic Restructuring and Transformation of
Companies - otherwise known as the Privatisation Agency - and a development
fund, were established in December 1990 to supervise the process of
privatisation throughout Slovenia.
Mr Marko Simoneti, director of the agency, says privatisation is moving
apace. 'There are a lot of loopholes with the federal law, but we are
closing them. The question now is to decide what should be sold and when the
government will embark on a national strategy for the development of the
Slovene economy,' he said.
Unlike other former communist countries, the agency has not had the
opportunity to have wide access to western experts - because their fees are
high. And it has not yet had access to the UK's Know-How Fund which was set
up in 1990 to provide technical expertise and financial assistance to former
communist countries.
Despite these drawbacks, Mr Simoneti says the agency is implementing three
methods for the privatisation of socially-owned enterprises. These include
partial or full acquisition of an enterprise by a foreign company;
additional investment of equity capital; and debt-to-equity conversion by
the creditor.
The agency also advises on establishment of new companies, or equity joint
ventures with socially-owned enterprises.
'When we were set up, one of our main tasks was to set up a licensing system
for business appraisers in order to provide a solid base for approving
privatisation of enterprises on a case-by-case basis,' explained Mr
Simoneti. 'This is working well. We are confident that the privatisation
process will speed up over the next few months.'

WHEN is the right time to privatise a company? Certainly not during a war.
But this is precisely what happened in June 1991 when the Yugoslav federal
army attacked the republic of Slovenia. It was also the first large
transaction in Slovenia in which the Privatisation Agency and the
development fund sold 76.5 per cent of a company to two foreign partners.
The company involved was Tobacco Company Ljubljana (TCL). Established 120
years ago as a state tobacco monopoly, it was the seventh-largest cigarette
factory in the former Yugoslavia, producing 4bn cigarettes a year, and
holding 7.1 per cent of the total market.
It also produced 1.1bn units for other tobacco companies, and exported
200,000 units. It distributed 80 per cent of all cigarettes of various
brands consumed in Slovenia. The number of employees totalled 1,780 in 1991.
Over the past 40 years, TCL was run by the workers' council which, under the
terms of the federal government's legislation on privatisation, had decided
it would initiate privatisation proceedings. It needed capital.
The company was running into problems. Its market share has declined from 17
per cent to 7 per cent over the previous decade because of a change in
consumer demands. In addition, exports were likely to fall because the
cigarettes were not of international quality.
In late 1990, TCL decided it wanted to link up with an international
cigarette manufacturer. Management and employee buy-outs were deemed
unsuitable since these methods of privatisation would not tackle the
company's long-term problems - and aims.
Its goal was to produce an internationally-known brand and a new generation
of cigarettes with low tar and nicotine content. It hoped to increase the
quality of existing TCL brands; obtain new machinery for this purpose;
introduce modern management techniques, particularly in the marketing
sector; and gain better access to international markets.
The agency was called in and negotiations started with two foreign tobacco
manufacturers: the German-French Reemtsma/Seita firm and a US company.
After months of valuation and analysis, both potential investors were
invited to submit their offers and were asked to describe how they would
meet the goals of TCL. The offers were received by the agency on June 10.
But both offers were too low in comparison with the appraised value by the
agency's licenced appraiser.
Fresh negotiations were started - in July - at the height of the war in
Slovenia.
'That was an important signal for us that these foreign companies had a
genuine interest in investing in TCL,' explained Mr Simoneti.
'The key issue they were concerned with was how much should the rate of
return be increased to accommodate for the political risk in our country. On
this point, we took a strong position - arguing that political instability
is a short-term problem and that in the long run, political and economic
risks in Slovenia are much lower,' said Mr Simoneti.
By the end of July, both offers were increased by 40 per cent.
Reemtsma-Seita had the edge on its US rival because it proposed a
partnership that would preserve the identity of TCL and thus continue the
business tradition of one of Slovenia's oldest companies.
Over the next few months, the nuts and bolts of the deal were put together
in the following way:
The socially-owned company was transformed into a limited liability company.
The shares were transferred to the development fund, which then became the
seller of the company;
Some 76.5 per cent of TCL shares were bought by Reemtsma-Seita. The
remaining 23.5 per cent of the shares were reserved by the fund for the
future sale, or future free distribution to employees. The foreign partners
were willing to accept employees as shareholders;
The contract included a detailed investment programme spread over five years
which, along with the purchase price, totalled DM110m;
A modernisation plan was agreed involving no redundancies, and an extensive
training programme was written into the contract.
Mr Simoneti, who prefers a long-term business plan to a quick sale, says the
contract shows that even in a war, business can be concluded.
More importantly, he says enterprises themselves are now taking the lead in
starting privatisation proceedings. 'Although we do not have a
clearly-defined strategy about what should be privatised, interest among the
enterprises is increasing and contracts are being signed. Foreign investors
are now looking at Slovenia as a market, not just for this republic, but for
the former Yugoslavia as well,' he said.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (6): Legislative fillip
sought - The Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>

IF traders at Ljubljana's small but lively stock exchange could choose a
present to celebrate the second anniversary of the Borza's opening on March
29, 1990, they would probably opt for a new batch of legislation which would
speed up privatisation and foreign investment.
'New legislation would give the exchange a real fillip. We still have to
develop Slovenia's financial infrastructure and financial instrument,' said
Mr Drasko Veselinovic, 33, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of the
Borza, which is located on the sixth floor of a high-rise office block in
the centre of the capital.
Despite the slow pace of the economic reforms, the Borza is thriving. 'There
is an enormous interest in the exchange,' said Mr Veselinovic. On a typical
trading day - it is open twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays - the
trading floor is packed with young and old, men and women, standing around
the central trading desk. More significantly, at the other end of the floor,
space has been set aside for the public which keenly follows the day's
prices.
Outside on the street, exchange prices flash across a large electronic
screen. 'We keep the public informed. It is the only way to attract interest
and promote awareness of the market economy,' said Mr Veselinovic.
The Borza has 30 securities listed, of which five are stocks and the rest
consist of bonds issued by the government, municipal councils, or commercial
institutions. The bonds can be traded in all denominations of foreign
currency but, because the Slovene Tolar, the unit of currency, is pegged to
the D-Mark, trading in Deutsche Marks account for 95 per cent of total
volume. Payments are made in Tolars.
The stocks include a private bank in the neighbouring republic of Croatia,
the Mladinska Kniga, Slovenia's large publishing house, and the SKB bank,
the republic's second-largest bank.
Last year, market capitalisation was Dollars 600m and the annual turnover
totalled DM106m. But Mr Veselinovic says that daily turnover in recent weeks
has amounted to DM2m.
'This is quite a substantial increase. It is partly due to the launch of a
gold product - bars, coins and commemorative medals. Can you imagine what
the exchange would be like if the government started selling off those 1,600
state-owned companies,?' he asked rhetorically.
In common with other exchanges, Ljubljana's Borza has a 'clausus', which
stipulates that no share can rise or fall above or below 20 per cent in any
single trading day. But with such a high clausus, is there not a danger of
inhibiting risk-taking? 'Not at all,' explained Mr Veselinovic. 'We have no
choice, given the rate of inflation which is running at between 10 and 12
per cent a month.'
Inflation, and the absence of legislation in other areas of the economy, has
not deterred the exchange from opening its floor to foreign investors.
'There are no limitations for foreign members who want to trade here. All
they have to have is a legal branch here. The Borza is open to all hard
currency accounts. Investors can take their dividends freely out of the
republic - subject to a withholding tax - and they can be paid in the
currency in which they originally traded,' said Mr Veselinovic.
However, the foreign exchange law has yet to allow the listing of foreign
securities, but it does permit the issuing of securities by joint ventures
or foreign-owned companies which are based in Slovenia.
Moreover, the exchange's founding statutes are restrictive in the sense that
ownership is in the hands of the banks, which are only allowed to buy shares
in the Borza. Ljubljanska Banka, Slovenia's largest bank, holds 30 per cent
of the exchange's total capital.
However, there are plans to widen this ownership structure through allowing
new shareholders such as insurance companies and pension funds
Mr Veselinovic and his colleagues believe that once the privatisation law is
passed, the Borza will really thrive. 'We are already preparing for this. We
are looking for new and bigger premises. In a year's time, we will have in
place a complete electronic system,' he explained. He added: 'I suppose we
were ahead of time when we first opened. But then, we couldn't wait around,
waiting for things to happen, could we?'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (5): An awkward period -
Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

<TEXT>
THESE are tough times for Slovenia's banks. They are tough because the
banking system has inherited a peculiarity of the Yugoslav federal banking
system in which enterprises could establish their own banks. In doing so,
the enterprise managers could simultaneously be represented on the board of
their banks.
The result was that the local bank manager could issue credit to his or her
own enterprise. There was little or no accountability. The banking system
was devoid of checks and balances.
In late 1989, the Yugoslav federal government, then headed by Mr Ante
Markovic, attempted to start a process of restructuring which was aimed at
breaking the incestuous relationship between the banks and enterprises. But
there were too many interests at stake in cutting off credits lines from the
enterprises.
Enterprises were in no position to stand on their own feet without credits.
Moreover, they had been spoiled by soft budget constraints, consisting often
of 'soft' loans extended by the banks to the enterprises, as well as
inter-enterprise loans. Any immediate axeing of the credit lines would lead
to insolvency, bankruptcy and more unemployment. Against this background,
Slovenia's banks are now in the process of restructuring.
It is not going to be easy because the republic's banks, in particular, the
Ljubljanska Bank, is saddled with bad debts. This is because it largely
monopolised the republic's banking system. About 60 per cent of all
enterprise loans are on the bank's books at its headquarters in Ljubljana,
the capital of Slovenia, and when its dozen or so subsidiaries are taken
into account, the Ljubljanska Bank network holds between 80 per cent and 90
per cent of the republic's enterprise loans.
'What else would you expect when this bank had the monopoly,' said Mr Marko
Kranjec, former finance minister and now the vice-governor of the republic's
central bank, who believes in implementing a tight monetary policy.
'However, this does not mean that the Ljubljanska Bank is 90 per cent
contaminated. It is in bad shape. But the bank can obtain credit lines
without problems. Throughout the republic, we have only one illiquid bank.
In fact, most of the banks will be able to survive,' he added.
It is difficult to gauge the precise figure for non-performing loans because
loans are divided into five categories: normal loans repayable within a few
days; loans payable within 60 days; loans payable between 60 and 180 days;
loans payable between 180 days and one year; and those loans which exceed
one year.
However, banks officials reckons that non-performing loans exceed DM1bn  -
and that is excluding inter-enterprise loans and other means of financing to
the enterprises. The questions now preoccupying Slovene bankers are how the
banks can be restructured and how enterprises can start exercising financial
discipline.
Mr Stanislav Valant, assistant managing director of the Ljubljanska Bank,
describes restructuring as 'a long process.'
'Some enterprises started to restructure two years ago when they saw how the
political developments were going to affect their exports to other parts of
Yugoslavia. Then there are others who are involved in debt-equity swaps. It
is a case-by-case process,' he said.
But like Mr Kranjec, Mr Valant believes that the board of directors of banks
must no longer be net debtors. 'The relationship between enterprises and
banks has to be changed. The legislation exists. It just has to be
implemented,' said Mr Valant.
Mr Valant sees the problem of restructuring the banks in terms of a
transition. Because there has been no financial discipline to speak of, and
because there are no financial institutions in place such as pension and
investment funds, so as to provide additional sources of financing, the rug
cannot be pulled from under the feet of the enterprises overnight.
If most of the banks are burdened with non-performing loans, there is
another problem facing the banks, namely the claims against the National
Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), which is based in Belgrade, the federal capital
and capital of the republic of Serbia.
In the past, any foreign exchange deposits made by Slovenes to the banks in
Slovenia were transferred to the NBY. Most of the deposits of Slovene
citizens, which exceed Dollars 1.2bn, had been originally placed in the
Ljubljanska Bank.
Because of Slovenia's declaration of independence - which Serbia and the NBY
opposed - the NBY's (and Serbia's) desperate need for foreign exchange
reserves, and Belgrade's unwillingness to open up negotiations with Slovenia
on the question of foreign exchange deposit accounts, the NBY has not
released these deposits to Slovenia.
As a result, the deposits have remained technically frozen although some
economists in Slovenia believe the deposits have been spent.
A similar picture exists for those foreign exchange deposits held by Croat
citizens in the Ljubljanska Bank in Zagreb, capital of neighbouring Croatia.
They amount to Dollars 454m.
Mr Valant says the banks' claims against the NBY will probably be purchased
by the Slovene government. 'The Slovene government will have to negotiate
these claims and, probably, the Slovene government will guarantee these
deposits. The Prime Minister (Mr Lojze Peterle) said the government would
issue a letter of intent and would purchase those loans from us,' said Mr
Valant.
Were this to happen, he believes public confidence in the banking system in
Slovenia would be fully restored.

Judy Dempsey examines the economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SLOVENIA is in recession. But unlike the other former communist countries of
eastern Europe which have been plunged into recession because of the radical
transformation of their economies, the reasons for the recession in Slovenia
are different.
The political crises in the former Yugoslavia have greatly contributed to
the republic's current economic circumstances.
Traditionally, Slovenia's economy was more developed than those of the other
five republics. It had the highest standard of living and consistently
higher growth in industrial production and GDP. But this small republic of
2m people was in no position, either politically or economically, to
insulate itself from the economic crisis which plagued the entire federation
throughout the 1980s.
In the mid-1980s, the Yugoslav economy was stagnating. Industrial production
was falling by 15 per cent a year, unemployment had reached 19.8 per cent by
the end of 1990; the average inflation rate had increased from 20 per cent
between 1974 and 1980 to 2,600 per cent in 1989; real wages had fallen to
two-thirds of those in 1979.
Inter-republic differences had also been increased. The gap in GDP between
Slovenia and the southern province of Kosovo widened from 5:1 in 1955 to 7:1
in 1988. Attempts to introduce market reforms by Mr Ante Markovic, the
former federal prime minister, came too late to avert the violent political
and economic disintegration of the federation.
In a recent paper*, Mr Jose Mencinger, a professor at the University of
Ljubljana, argued: 'The political developments deprived Yugoslavia of all
systemic advantages from a swift transition (to the market economy).
'The differences between the 'west' and the 'east' (among the republics of
Yugoslavia) became an unsurmountable barrier for the implementation of
systemic changes, and for a sound economic policy. In such circumstances,
the prices of 'secession' (by Slovenia) became lower than the economic and
social costs of sharing the Yugoslav chaos.'
Few economists and government officials in Slovenia have doubts about the
economic costs of independence. About 30 per cent of the republic's exports
were earmarked for the former Yugoslavia, and about 28 per cent of its
imports were from the other republics.
But the political disputes and economic blockades between the republics, and
the war in neighbouring Croatia, the breakdown of the Yugoslav federation's
transport and distribution networks, together with the introduction of new
currencies in the republics, have reinforced the view among Slovene
economists that its government must introduce an economic strategy.
The economists want this strategy to focus on introducing privatisation,
attracting foreign investment through new legislation and incentives,
finding and targeting new, hard currency export markets, and normalising its
economic relations with the former republics of Yugoslavia.
Parallel to adopting a national strategy, economists want the government to
focus more sharply on addressing the republic's macroeconomic problems.
Since 1985, industrial output in Slovenia has been declining by about 10 per
cent and gross fixed investments have been reduced by more than 30 per cent.
In the first nine months of 1991, the downward trend continued, with
manufacturing output falling by 11 per cent compared with the same period in
1990.
Attempts by the government to reverse these trends have not been entirely
successful. Mr Marko Kranjec, the vice-governor of Slovenia's central bank,
says the government has been postponing introduction of a stabilisation
programme since the beginning of 1991.
As a result, when Slovenia declared its independence on June 26, 1991,
inflation was running at 12 per cent a month, unemployment was rising above
10 per cent of the labour force, the low level of foreign exchange reserves
was preventing the purchase of imports, and enterprises were faced with
substantial arrears. These economic trends dampened the euphoria of
independence. That was when the central bank stepped in.
Under legislation passed last June, the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank,
was made completely independent of the government. Mr Franc Arhar, head of
the central bank, and his colleagues set about introducing a tight monetary
policy, primarily aimed at curbing inflation and stimulating growth.
The first measures undertaken by the bank was the introduction of a new
monetary unit called the Slovene Tolar (SLT).
For technical reasons, the conversion rate between the Tolar and the
Yugoslav dinar, the federation currency, was initially fixed at one for one.
A maximum amount of SLT27,000 per person was allowed so as to insulate the
new monetary system from the rest of Yugoslavia and to reduce the amount of
Yugoslav dinars from other part of Yugoslavia being converted into Tolars.
All existing notes and coins were exchanged within 27 hours.
Once the new currency was introduced, the central bank set about wiping out
excess liquidity from the banks by employing a variety of instruments. Mr
Kranjec explained how the central bank stopped the policy of selective
lending to priority sectors; reduced the minimum reserve requirements from
20 per cent to 7 per cent of demand deposits; revoked the automatic
availability of re-discount facilities to commercial banks; introduced a
fixed re-discount rate of 25 per cent per annum; and imposed a credit freeze
from October 8 to October 31.
The central bank then examined how the republic's foreign exchange reserves
could be boosted. It devalued the Tolar by 60 per cent, or SLT32 to DM1. It
then set about allowing the market to adjust the exchange rate.
Transactions were liberalised and 70 per cent of export earnings could be
used freely by exporters, but within two days, otherwise enterprises would
have to sell the foreign exchange on the spot market to other enterprises or
banks. Some 30 per cent of all foreign exchange revenues had to be submitted
to the central bank for servicing the external debt, as well as for payment
for items such as oil and medicine.
The central's banks persistence in adhering to a tight monetary policy has
had a positive affect on the economy.
The liquidity of the banking system has been reduced by 60 per cent and
foreign exchange reserves have increased by 30 per cent to Dollars 250m. But
the monthly inflation rate remains erratic. In October, it was reduced to 5
per cent, but the following month it accelerated to 17 per cent a month.
Mr Kranjec and other economists argue that the central bank's success in
implementing its tight monetary policy must be actively supported by the
government.
'We need support from the government, but we are not receiving it,' said Mr
Kranjec. For example, the central bank wants greater, but temporary,
restrictions on price increases, and a tariff policy.
At the moment, various lobbies in the government tend to favour continuing
monopolies in the food, food processing, and utilities sector over
competition. These lobbies include the agrarian farmers sector, which is
politically close to the Christian Democrats, largest party in the Demos
coalition and which is led by Mr Lozje Peterle, prime minister.
'Anti-monopoly laws and competition policy must be introduced to curb this
huge monopolistic system which can raise prices and push up inflation,'
argued Mr Kranjec.
The government is slowly coming round to supporting the central bank's
monetary policy. The jump in inflation last November finally persuaded the
cabinet to freeze salaries for six months. The central bank would have even
more clout vis-a-vis the government in the successful implementation of its
monetary policy if Slovenia was admitted to the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank.
'We will support the central bank's tough monetary policy,' said Mr Andrej
Ocvirk, deputy prime minister. 'But it will take time to come out of the
recession. The next few years will not be easy for us,' he added.

<TEXT>
AFTER centuries of living under the Hapsburgs, and decades under communist
rule, Slovenia regained its independence on January 15 this year when it
finally won recognition by the international community.
Slovenia's struggle for independence, whether - at an earlier period of
history - from Vienna, or from the Yugoslav federation, was not based on the
politics of recalcitrance or rebelliousness - or driven by a fiery devotion
to a nationalist cause.
Before declaring independence last June following a republic-wide
referendum, Slovenes, in their pragmatic way, had attempted to find a modus
vivendi with the status quo in Belgrade, federal capital of the former
Yugoslavia and the capital of Serbia.
Pragmatism, flexibility and more than a tinge of stubbornness have long
characterised this industrious and hard-working community, and have shaped
the nation's relations with the more powerful neighbours it was obliged to
live with in the Yugoslav federation. Even over the past two years, when
efforts to save the federation from disintegration - it was by then already
slipping deeper into political and economic crisis - had all but failed, the
Slovenes attempted to salvage what remained of Yugoslavia by proposing a
confederation of sovereign states.
When these attempts were blocked by the republic of Serbia and the federal
army, the Slovene government, elected in April 1990 in the republic's first
free parliamentary elections for many decades, chose the road to
independence.
For the Slovenes, a small nation of 2m people, it was a matter of survival.
Its trade with the other republics of Yugoslavia was being blocked by
Serbia; its contributions to the federal budget were being squandered; its
citizens' foreign exchange deposits were financing the federal defence
establishment.
The first days following the declaration of independence on June 25 will be
indelibly marked on the consciousness of the republic. During that night, in
the course of which young and old Slovenes celebrated their independence in
the streets of the Slovene capital of Ljubljana, the Yugoslav federal army,
or People's Army, crossed into Slovenia in an attempt to gain control over
the republic's external borders.
After several days fighting against a well-prepared Slovene defence force, a
demoralised federal army retreated but turned its attention - and much
greater fire power - on neighbouring Croatia, which had also just declared
its independence.
Slovenia has had a mere 10 weeks in which to feel secure in its
independence, since recognition of its sovereignty was granted - by most
countries but with the notable exception of the US - on January 15.
Making a reality of that independence is an historic task.
While Slovenia and the countries of eastern Europe share the same
difficulties in making the transition to the market economy and political
pluralism, it also has to establish its own institutions of independence
from the Yugoslav federation.
These include consolidating a new monetary system, stabilising control over
its borders, establishing its own postal service, setting up its own banking
system and communications network, and funding and training a diplomatic
service.
Independence also involves negotiating membership of international
organisations such as the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the
European Community and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, as well as a host of other institutions through which independence
can be strengthened. But while the tasks facing the Slovenes are awesome,
there is little doubt that the benefits of freedom and independence far
outweigh the endless, and costly, compromises made under the previous,
communist federal system.
Economically, Slovenia, has for the moment lost its market share in the
former republics of Yugoslavia, which previously accounted for more than 30
per cent of exports and imports. Slovene economists believe, however, that
economic relations with these republics will eventually be normalised.
Foreign investors are already seeking access to markets in the former
republics of Yugoslavia by setting up joint ventures in Slovenia. They see
that the republic's small market can be compensated by using Slovenia as a
stepping stone into the other republics, into eastern Europe, and into the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
But in order to attract foreign investment, the fragile six-party coalition
government, which consists of Christian Democratic, Liberal, and Social
Democratic parties, will have to prove it is competent and capable of
drawing up legislation on privatisation, and foreign investment, and of
restructuring the banking system.
The government has been slow in drawing up legislation. One of the reasons
is that the Slovene authorities agreed last July to suspend implementation
of its independence declaration. This decision was part of the
European-Community brokered Brioni peace accord which aimed at finding a
solution to the federal army's attack on Slovenia.
In return for a three-month moratorium on the implementation of Slovenia's
independence, the federal army, within that three months, agreed to withdraw
completely from the republic.
The other reason for the slow pace of change is that the coalition
government has inherited the former communist system of large cabinets. The
present one, consisting of 27 ministries, is repeatedly criticised by
economists and bankers for lacking co-ordination and a strategy for the
economy. The former communist system has also slowed up decision-making.
Legislation is often blocked, or watered down, as it passes through the
three-chamber parliamentary system. This cumbersome system has almost
paralysed the work of the government.
Finally, the coalition government has little expertise and experience. It is
led by Mr Lozje Peterle, the prime minister who is also leader of the
Christian Democrats. His critics say he is more preoccupied with restoring
what he terms the 'dignity' to politics, and restoring the power of
traditional conservative forces in Slovene society, than opening up new
enterprises and attracting foreign investors. The business community,
foreign partners and the Slovene electorate are becoming impatient for
change.
The Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, which is implementing a tight
monetary policy, wants the government to stem the growing impatience and
disillusionment by breaking down monopolies, encouraging private enterprise
and maintaining a freeze on wage increases.
The central bank believes that the successful implementation of these
policies would curb inflation, now running at more than 10 per cent a month,
and stimulate growth. Industrial production, compared with last year, is
this year expected to fall by 4 per cent to 15 per cent because of the war
in neighbouring Croatia and the loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia.
Unemployment is expected to rise by 2 per cent to 10 per cent.
Few economists doubt the need for a speeding up of the economic reforms. At
the same time, they - and ministers from across the political spectrum -
argue that the process of transforming post-communist societies must take
into account Slovenia's political culture and traditions.
With the support of the agrarian community, the Christian Democrat movement
is anxious to invoke and promote traditional values of the family and women,
giving the Roman Catholic church more prominence in social and public life
and encouraging women to have more children, rather than joining the labour
force. These traditions are tempered by liberal and social democratic values
which find wide support among the younger, urbanised population.
But unlike many of its east European counterparts and neighbours of the
former Yugoslavia, the Slovene government has not allowed the paraphernalia
and symbols of nationalism to prevail over pragmatism. Instead, the work
carried out by the central bank, the agency for privatisation and the
enterprises, serves to reassure the international community and foreign
investors that Slovenia is stable. But if that confidence and stability is
to remain a permanent feature in this part of Europe, Slovenia will need
access to experts, credit facilities and markets. They will secure
Slovenia's place in the new Europe.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (2): EC-sponsored talks may
help resolve problems - Debt: Relations with the former Yugoslav central
bank must be settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SLOVENIA'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settle
its relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), or central
bank, establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible,
and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Relations with the NBY are complicated. Before Slovenia declared
independence, any foreign exchange deposits which Slovene citizens deposited
in banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY. These deposits amount to
Dollars 1.2bn.
In addition, Croatian citizens in neighbouring Croatia also deposited
Dollars 465m into Slovene banks in Croatia.
Since independence, these accounts have been frozen. Officials at the the
Ljubljanska Bank, Slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of the
foreign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the the
government of Slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiations
with the NBY for the eventual return of the deposits.
Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank,
reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain their
foreign exchange savings. He says much depends on the negotiations and
political atmosphere between Ljubljana and Belgrade. Slovene officials are
also anxious to start negotiations on the unallocated Yugoslav federal debt.
The federal debt totals Dollars 14.6bn. Of this amount, Slovenia accepts
that its allocated share of that debt is Dollars 1.8bn. 'We will not renege
on repaying this debt,' said Mr Andrej Klemencic, adviser to Slovenia's
Ministry of Finance.
The debt-service ratio is about 40 per cent of Slovenia's GDP. Last year's
GDP amounted to Dollars 13.5bn.
Mr Jose Mencinger, a member of the board of Slovenia's central bank, said
servicing that debt should not be a problem. 'Last year, our exports
totalled Dollars 3.8bn. That is a decline of only 5 per cent compared to the
year before. So, we are not in such a bad position with regard to servicing
the debt,' he said.
However, negotiating what share of the unallocated federal debt Slovenia
should assume is already proving difficult.
The unallocated federal debt - which consists of loans to the NBY, or the
federal government which had not been specifically earmarked for projects in
any of the six republics of the former Yugoslavia - amounts to Dollars
3.5bn. Slovene officials say they are committed to repaying its share of the
unallocated federal debt.
Mr Kranjec says that the Bank of Slovenia has already proposed negotiations
on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the NBY'S foreign
exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former
CMEA socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks.
'This is going to take a long time to settle,' said Mr Kranjec. He and other
Slovene economists now believe that the European Community-sponsored peace
conference on Yugoslavia could play a role in negotiating issues related to
the debt. Resolution of these issues, and recognition by the US of Slovenia,
would speed the republic's admission to the International Monetary Fund and
other financial institutions.

<TEXT>
I confess to a sneaking admiration for Mr Jerry Brown's presidential
campaign. I should not say this because the former governor of California is
deeply unpopular in left-leaning political circles in Washington. The
pundits who count regard him as an unscrupulous and unelectable crank. They
hate him for mercilously exposing the charac-ter weaknesses of their
'anointed' candidate, Mr Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor. And they are
shocked by some of his policies - such as his advocacy of a flat rate income
tax.
Mr Brown may have been inconsistent over the years. But the central point he
is making today - that economic and social reform is impossible so long as
politicians are bought and sold by rich individuals and powerful interest
groups - is surely of vital importance. US politics is horribly corrupted by
money: the average senator has to raise Dollars 4m to defend his seat.
Mr Brown has courageously restricted campaign contributions to Dollars 100 a
head. He has dispensed with the pomp of a campaign such as Governor
Clinton's, which includes hordes of paid advisers and pollsters - not to
mention a posse of secret service agents. Mr Brown, once a Jesuit monk,
relies on a skeleton staff of volunteers, sleeps at the homes of supporters
and appeals to the public mainly through a free 1-800 telephone number.
According to the conventional rules, this should have spelled oblivion.
Instead, the Brown campaign is gaining momentum, having defeated Mr Clinton
in Connecticut last week.
At first blush, Mr Brown's advocacy of a 13 per cent flat rate tax on
personal incomes and business value-added appears a crass error. It turns
traditional Democrat fiscal theory on its head. Most Democrats are obsessed
with the need to reverse the Reagan tax cuts, which favoured the rich. Mr
Clinton, for example, has made redistribution in favour of the middle
classes a central theme of his campaign. The Washington Post dismissed Mr
Brown's plan as 'cruel and reactionary'. Mr Michael Kinsley, a liberal
columnist for the New Republic magazine, described it as 'brain dead'.
Yet in some ways Mr Brown's iconoclasm is admirable. After all, here is a
Democrat proposing something that even former President Ronald Reagan, a
fellow Californian, lacked the courage to implement. In the mid-1980s, the
Reagan administration considered a flat rate tax, but decided it was
politically too risky because it would shift too much of the tax burden onto
the poor and middle classes.
Some pundits say Mr Brown does not understand the implications of his plan.
This seems unlikely: Mr Brown may be eccentric, but he is not stupid. He has
also experienced a baptism of fire in fiscal affairs. As governor of
California in the late 1970s he initially opposed - but was later forced to
support - the Proposition Thirteen property tax revolt. He would not be
advocating a flat rate tax today unless he felt it would appeal to the
majority of Americans. Critics should remember that he has a knack of
anticipating public opinion: a couple of decades ago, he was one of the
first US politicians to take environmental arguments seriously.
Mr Brown rightly emphasises the simplicity of flat taxes. In TV debates, he
tells the audience that his plan would replace voluminous tax returns with a
postcard-sized form that children could complete. Grinning, he says he would
put hordes of lawyers and accountants out of business. He is on less solid
ground when he claims that high earners would enjoy only modest gains
because the transparency of the new rules would prevent them exploiting
loopholes. The rich would gain substantially from flat rate taxes, just as
they gained from cuts in the top rates during the 1980s.
If Mr Brown has any sense, he will backtrack a little and offer larger
exemptions for those at the bottom of the income distribution (his scheme
already allows for the deduction of rent - an important quid pro quo for the
huge mortgage interest deductions allowable for the highest earners). But he
may be shrewd in guessing that the politics of envy is losing its bite. The
world is changing so fast that it may be wrong to assume that electorates
will always support redistribution through the tax system, which is anyway a
surprisingly recent innovation.
It is not so long since somebody as level-headed as John Stuart Mill could
describe progressive taxation (taxes that rise more than proportionately
with income) as a 'mild form of robbery'. Prussia introduced the first
progressive tax only in 1891; the US did not follow suit until 1913. Within
30 years, the US top rate had reached 91 per cent. But the tide began to
turn fairly quickly. From the late 1950s, reformers were arguing for lower
marginal rates to boost incentives. President John Kennedy cut the top US
rate to 70 per cent in the early 1960s. During the 1980s, top rates plunged
almost everywhere.
By advocating flat rate taxes, Mr Brown is thus only extrapolating a recent
trend. Once again, this derided devotee of Zen Buddhism may have glimpsed
the future before the rest of us. If so, he is laying the ground for a
politics that cuts through party lines. Mr Brown is green, favours low,
simple taxes, supports national health insurance, and wants to cut the nexus
between money and politics in the US. You may distrust the messenger, but
the message is undeniably potent.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Gambler's biggest risk - Tony Ryan,
chairman of GPA, the aircraft-leasing company, talks to Paul Betts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most men carry a wallet in their back pocket. What Mr Tony Ryan keeps in his
is a schedule of spending commitments totalling Dollars 20bn over the next
10 years.
'This is the list I live with,' he says, pulling out a tiny piece of paper
showing that GPA, the aircraft-leasing company he founded in Shannon,
Ireland, 17 years ago, currently owns 411 airliners and has another 500 on
firm order or option.
The numbers are staggering, and send shivers through investors at a time
when the air transport industry is suffering its worst recession in 40
years. Airlines are struggling to make money and financial institutions are
increasingly wary of funding new aircraft purchases.
Mr Ryan says he is relaxed. 'I often tell people I sleep like a baby. I wake
up every 10 minutes screaming.'
Mr Ryan will need all his apparent confidence as he embarks on perhaps his
greatest challenge since launching GPA as a small aircraft leasing outfit
and transforming it into the world's leading aircraft leasor with about 50
per cent of the market. Not only is he having to ride out turmoil in the
aircraft industry, but he has also chosen this moment to float his company.
His decision is based on GPA's performance last year. 'I did not welcome
1991 when we were hit by a series of circumstances we never predicted, like
the Gulf war,' he says. 'But it also offered us an opportunity to show how
we operate. I told my staff at the time that if we can work out of this
recession it will be a great way of convincing investors we can manage risks
well.'
The company's performance, though disappointing when compared with its
earlier double-digit profits growth, has been better than might have been
expected. GPA recently reported slightly higher net profits of Dollars
196.5m for the nine months to the end of December 1991 compared with Dollars
195.8m in the same period in 1990.
The financial markets will still need considerable reassurance if the
flotation in June is to be successful. 'It's not so much GPA but the state
of the industry which concerns me,' says Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace
analyst at Shearson Lehman. 'The question is whether they can buck the trend
in a business facing a lot of problems,' he adds.
According to an Airbus executive, the recession was expected to hit
aircraft-leasing companies harder than others in the industry: they would
have too many aircraft and too few customers.
Other observers point to a string of further worries: the question of how
GPA would finance future aircraft purchases as banks grow more reluctant to
provide funding; the quality of the company's earnings in the light of its
heavy dependence on profits arising from aircraft sales in the secondary
market; and whether its equity base is strong enough in relation to its
huge, long-term aircraft order commitments.
Mr Ryan, who describes himself as 'just a Tipperary farmer', will have a lot
of explaining to do in coming weeks.
'If people are frightened by our order book they should take comfort. We
placed 165 aircraft last year in the worst ever period in aviation,' Mr Ryan
says. He concedes that GPA is a difficult company for analysts and investors
to understand but that aircraft are inherently more attractive assets than
tankers or property.
'My fundamental belief is that an aircraft as an asset is inherently
profitable. If a client has a problem, you can move the asset elsewhere. The
mobility of the aircraft is a great joy,' he says.
But he acknowledges there is likely to be a 'heavy fall-out' in the
aircraft-leasing industry, while stressing that GPA will not be a casualty.
'We've built up a robust structure. Our fleet is made up of new aircraft. If
we had 400 old ones we would not be going public and we probably wouldn't be
going anywhere.'
GPA took a calculated risk in its aircraft-buying spree of the late 1980s,
though it managed to negotiate 20-25 per cent discounts from manufacturers
because of the big orders. 'We've sculptured our orders from now to the end
of the century to mirror the customer base of the big manufacturers,' Mr
Ryan says. Airlines have over-ordered aircraft in recent years and
manufacturers have over-produced, so manufacturers are now reducing
production by 25-33 per cent.
'We traditionally pick up about 8-10 per cent of annual production. When
production is adjusted we will go down to about 10 per cent of the new
rate,' Mr Ryan says.
The biggest problem is not too many aircraft but not enough financing.
'Money rather than aircraft will be the scarce commodity of the 1990s,' Mr
Ryan says, adding that GPA has tackled the short-term problem with a line of
credit facilities worth Dollars 8bn, equity of Dollars 1.2bn and its
forthcoming public offering which is expected to raise between Dollars 550m
and Dollars 700m in fresh money.
'In the longer term we are going to have to find some other method of
financing until the banks come back because of the magnitude of money
necessary to finance aircraft during the next 10 years,' Mr Ryan says.
He first planned the June flotation five years ago with the idea of going to
the market in 1990-91 to give greater liquidity to his shareholders. But he
decided to wait until this year after the company had shown it was capable
of riding out last year's sharp downturn.
Mr Ryan believes the securitisation of aircraft will become a growing trend.
'What we are increasingly doing is buying an aircraft, selling it to a
customer for a profit. He is then entitled to the lease income while we get
a fee for managing the aircraft. At the end of the lease we can either sell
the aircraft and share the proceeds with the owner or release it for him.'
He forecasts a further development will be the setting up of aircraft
investment funds to attract smaller investors. 'We are setting up with
Citibank a Dollars 500m international fund for this purpose,' he says.
'We've got smaller funds in several countries. We also have plans for a
Dollars 1bn fund.'
He says the geographical spread of GPA's portfolio has also helped the
company hedge itself during the recession. 'The first six months of last
year were very rough. About 25 per cent of our customers were in serious
trouble.' But the other 75 per cent around the world 'continued to send
money in: there was good traffic in places like south-east Asia and Latin
America'.
Mr Ryan admits, however, that GPA took a a few blows on the chin. 'We
clearly gave Braniff (the bankrupt US carrier) too many planes and we lost
money.' But GPA has limited its exposure to the US market to 10 per cent of
its business. 'I was never comfortable with the draconian US bankruptcy
laws,' Mr Ryan says.
Preferring to scout the world in search of business, or to farm his estate
in Tipperary where he owns a pub called Matt the Thrasher, rather than adopt
a high public profile, Mr Ryan will find himself in the spotlight in coming
months.
He will have to persuade investors that GPA is a good long-term bet and that
the sheer quantity of aircraft it has on order are sound assets. 'The
question is whether you believe flying by aircraft is the best way to get
from A to B. If the answer is no, I would have a problem,' he says.
His family history leads to his firm beliefs. 'My family has been in the
transport business for 1,000 years.' This is a slight exaggeration. His
father was a train driver, his grandfather a station master, and his two
sons now own the airline Ryanair.
Perhaps the best message he can give the financial community will be his
commitment to stay at GPA as chairman at least until 1996 and not sell his
shares. At a flotation price of Dollars 20-Dollars 25, Mr Ryan's 8 per cent
stake would be worth Dollars 188m-Dollars 235m. 'But since we started, I
have never sold a share.'
The Irish tax authorities pose a bigger personal problem. The new Irish
government's tax regime is ending exemptions on dividends to shareholders
like Mr Ryan in Shannon-registered companies. Mr Ryan confirms he is
considering becoming a foreign resident. 'I have places in Spain, Mexico and
Monte Carlo,' he says. As an expert risk manager, he might even be tempted
to try to break the bank.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Going down in flames: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The sensational collapse in popular support for the governing Socialist
party in the French regional elections a week ago has opened up a national
political crisis to which there is no obvious solution. There is no obvious
solution because the acuteness of the apparent crisis, as expressed in the
violent dislocation of voting patterns, seems irrational and
disproportionate, in relation to the observable facts in the real world.
It is common to explain the election result as a classic protest vote.
Circumstances conspired to turn the minor event of the elections to 22
regional councils into a national test of opinion, with the maximum scope
for free expression, in the therapeutic or play-group sense of the term. The
voters were angry about unemployment, or immigration, or Europe, or the
financial scandals in the political parties; so they let rip with infantile
ill temper and disillusionment.
Yet the intensity of this French protest seems out of all proportion with
what they have to protest about. The vote implies that France is the worst
governed country in Europe; in fact the French are as well governed as
anyone, and better off than most.
In economic management terms, the Socialists' recent record is more than
honourable. French economic growth is significantly better and more
consistent than Britain's, French inflation is regularly much lower, and
France is much more prosperous.
No one would deny the pain of high and rising unemployment; but French
unemployment is in the same ball park as Britain's. The same goes for
immigration. The school system is vastly superior, and the health system is
ruinously luxurious. In comparative terms, France's problems simply do not
justify this degree of anguish.
Some French analysts have taken a stern moral line. Some of them blame the
politicians: the French voted to reject all the traditional parties of
government, because they are nauseated by the stench of corruption. Others
blame the French people: the scandalous National Front vote marks the French
as the black sheep of Europe, in the same shameful league as the Austrians.
Neither thesis will quite do. A Figaro exit poll said that many more people
(41 per cent) were influenced by their revulsion at the political scandals
than by high unemployment (24 per cent). But a Liberation poll said
unemployment was the top factor for 38 per cent, while the scandals only
influenced 12 per cent. You pays your money . . .
The thesis of a rotten streak in the French body politic is troubling.
History testifies to a resilient extreme right-wing strand in France; there
have also been periods of violent anti-Semitism and xenophobia. These two
tendencies reached a shameful acme in the Second World War, when Vichy
France fell over itself to co-operate with the Nazis. But to infer from last
week's elections that there is a moral flaw in the heart of France is going
too fast.
The National Front vote is a symptom of political disturbance: it does not
mean France is going fascist. More than 40 per cent admit to racist
feelings; yet France is clearly ashamed of half-buried memories of episodes
in its history, and it is striking how often the media dig up skeletons,
such as the practice of torture in the Algerian war, or the brutal
deportation of Jewish children to Germany in the Second World War *,
manifestly for purposes of expiation.
The central revelation of the election is the collective rejection of all
the traditional parties of government. All polls say that French politicians
seem aloof and elitist, talking a wooden, bureaucratic jargon. Their
corruption may be distasteful; what is really alienating is their
self-satisfied Parisian remoteness.
But the politicians' failure lies more in their policies than in their
style. The Socialists have abandoned socialism; they have yet to devise a
new message. The conservatives have only one message: Get Rid of the
Socialists.
The reasons for this policy vacuum lie in the European Community.
Macroeconomic policy, the traditional centre-piece of political debate,
whether in a left-right context or in a Keynesian-classical dialectic, has
been removed from the control of national politics. Mainline French
politicians scarcely discuss economic policy, because there is nothing much
left to discuss.
As a result, the Community has shaken the perceived political legitimacy of
the nation state. This is especially destabilising in France, which is
founded on an intensely normative image of the commanding state and the
integrationist republic. Last Sunday, 27.2 per cent voted against Europe, or
41.1 per cent if you include the ecologists.
President Francois Mitterrand will go down in history as a great European.
But he will go down in flames at home, unless his party can devise a new
political message which recreates national legitimacy in a European context.
And the first priority in that message will be a plausible answer to
unemployment; socialism may be discredited, but the Community will not last
long if unemployment is once again regarded as an Act of God or of Adam
Smith.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Dollar may rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR may rise on March economic data this week, while a number of
other currencies come under pressure for a variety of reasons, writes Andrew
Jack.
A batch of new statistics is due to be released in the US, including
consumer confidence, National Association of Purchasing Managers and
employment figures. These should provide some indications of the level of
economic activity during March, compared with the data for earlier months
released last week.
But Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser with Chemical Bank, is sceptical of
the impact of the data.
He said the likelihood of the long-awaited interest rate cut by the Bank of
Japan as part of a package to stimulate the economy was strong, and would
help boost the Yen.
In Germany there may be continued uncertainty about the possibility of
interest rate cuts, despite the harsh line taken by the Bundesbank in recent
days.
In Italy, the lire is likely to come under pressure in advance of the
election on April 5, as concern grows about the state of the existing
political coalition.
In the UK, continued political uncertainty is likely to be fuelled with a
series of new polls which continue to affect jittery markets. Mr Cocker
stressed that the money markets and equities were more likely to be affected
by the election than the exchange rate.
Mr David Coleman, treasury adviser to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
London, said: 'The market is getting fed up with opinion polls. Why take out
a large position when you know it might be affected by big fluctuations? It
is going to be nervous this week, and the nervousness will remain until the
election.'

Results Due
Lucas Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, is likely to
announce a further decline in half-yearly profits on Monday. Indeed, some
brokers are predicting only break even, although it is still thought the
2.1p dividend will be maintained.
Harassed, on the one hand, by poor demand in the automotive and aerospace
industries, but under pressure, on the other, to keep up research and
investment spending, Lucas is trapped between recession and creating a base
for its future fortunes.
Full-year figures from MB-Caradon, the building products group, on Monday
are expected to show pre-tax profits edging ahead to perhaps Pounds 104m
(Pounds 101.7m) in 1991, in spite of the recession. After a 12 per cent
profit fall at the interim stage to Pounds 47.2m, this would suggest a
better second half.
The group's quarter share in CMB Packaging, the European packaging group,
will contribute more following management changes there, but the proceeds of
the Pounds 149m rights issue launched last October will barely have arrived
by the year end. A maintained total dividend of 8.5p is expected.
Also on Monday, Inchcape, the international motor distributor, marketing and
business services group, is expected to report annual pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 174m to Pounds 180m, in line with the forecast made in December
when it had a Pounds 376m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Tozer
Kemsley &amp; Millbourn (TKM).
Interest will focus on how the motor distributor and retailer is being
bedded in and what effect the Budget's halving of car tax has had on sales
by Inchcape, one of the UK's biggest car distributors. Mr Charles Mackay,
the new chief executive, will also report on how the process of organising
Inchcape into global business streams is progressing.
London Weekend Television, which retained its franchise at the bargain
basement price of Pounds 7.58m, is expected to unveil a good set of results
on April Fool's Day.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 19m and Pounds 21m
for 1991. The outcome could be at the high end of expectations and perhaps
even modestly up on last year's Pounds 20.7m. Such a result would be a
considerable achievement in a recession.
LWT, in common with other ITV companies, will almost certainly be trying to
reduce costs further, so some provision for redundancies could reduce the
headline profit figure.
On the same day Harrisons and Crosfield, the chemicals, building supplies
and feedstock conglomerate, is expected to show a further fall in pre-tax
profit to roughly Pounds 75m for 1991 from Pounds 106m.
Its Harcros builders' merchants chain has been vulnerable to the slump in
house building and in house moves, while part of the chemicals division is
also construction related. The more resilient food and agriculture
businesses are too small to have offset declines in other divisions.
But the big question is:will Harrisons maintain an uncovered dividend? The
betting seems to be yes, just about.
Sun Alliance, the biggest of the composite insurance groups, is set to post
a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 420m and Pounds 470m when its reports its
1991 results on Thursday.
Sun is the market leader in domestic mortgage indemnity insurance and has
been forced to make increased provisions as a result of rising
repossessions. Some analysts suggest that the group may not increase its
final dividend.
Full-year results from William Baird, the textiles company, are expected to
show a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 33.8m to about Pounds 25m on
Thursday. The textiles operation, with Marks and Spencer as a big customer,
is a steady performer. But Darchem, the engineering division, has suffered
badly during the recession.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Economics: Search for further signs of recovery in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last two months have seen some signs of recovery in the US. The question
this week is whether these positive pointers will continue into those
relating to March.
New home sales rose by 12.9 per cent in February, while the National
Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) survey for February pointed to a
slightly more upbeat assessment in the outlook among manufacturers.
The consensus of analysts' forecasts compiled by MMS International, the
business information group, suggests that both trends will continue.
Friday's labour market data for March should show no further increase in
unemployment from February's 7.3 per cent. In February 164,000 jobs were
created, the highest number for two years. According to research by Midland
Montagu, however, nearly all the employment growth in February was in
services, with a big proportion of the new jobs concentrated in retail
trade.
Increases in manufacturing were more meagre - February produced only 12,000
new jobs in the sector as a whole. Midland Montagu believes manufacturers
that will probably raise employment during March in response to an increase
in orders and strong consumer spending in February.
Several important inflation indicators will be released in Europe. With
Germany's preliminary cost of living index for March expected to show annual
inflation at 4.7 per cent, up from 4.3 per cent in February, the Bundesbank
will not want to relax its high interest rate policy for the time being.
Unemployment data is also due in Germany. The continued rise in unemployment
reflects the weakness of the economy - West German unemployment has been
badly affected by weak manufacturing production and high inflows of
immigrant workers.
In the UK there is virtually no economic data and certainly none that
politicians will attempt to latch onto as the election campaign enters its
third week.
Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of City forecasts in brackets
from MMS International, a financial information company, include:
Today: US, February new home sales; Denmark, fourth quarter GDP; Canada,
January employment earnings.

(-ADollars .72bn).
Thursday: US, February factory goods orders (up 0.3 per cent), February
factory goods shipments, M1 (-Dollars 1.5bn), M2 (-Dollars 1bn), and M3

FT  30 MAR 92 / Money and Credit: Fed spells out bond auction reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPERCUSSIONS of last year's Salomon Brothers bond trading scandal
continue to reverberate around the US Treasury markets.
Earlier this year the government unveiled plans to reform the bond auction
system - the process by which the Treasury sells new government securities
to the dealing houses and investing institutions.
The new system would involve an ascending-price plan which allocates
securities based upon the lowest interest rate bidders are willing to
accept. All bids would be submitted electronically, and every participant in
the new, 'dutch', auction would be able to see the bidding at every stage.
At the close of each auction, the securities would be distributed to bidders
at the same price. The amount of securities each bidder receives would
depend on the interest rate they were willing to accept.
The Federal Reserve Board, which, with the Treasury and the Securities and
Exchange Commission, launched an investigation into ways to improve the
auction system in the wake of the Salomon scandal last summer, has now
explained why it thinks its proposed new auction process would be an
improvement on the current system.
The Fed's thinking has been laid out in a paper written by Mr Vincent
Reinhart, chief of the Fed's banking and money market analysis section, and
reportedly the architect of the new auction plan. In the paper, the Fed
admits the current system was susceptible to 'squeezes' and 'corners'.
A squeeze occurs when one or a small group of bidders buys up most or all of
a new issue - in effect, cornering the market - and uses its position to
force rivals, especially those who sold the new issue short, to pay more for
the securities.
Mr Reinhart explains how firms that wanted to create a squeeze or a corner
could prey on three weaknesses in the existing auction system: one, there
was always a core of reliable demand for the securities from short-sellers
who had traded in the when-issued market; two, the method of allocating the
securities made demand at the auction acutely price-sensitive; and three,
the use of sealed bids meant a 'cornerer' could place bids only marginally
better than the consensus, yet win all the awarded securities.
The paper went on: 'Clearly, one dealer with adequate capital could take
advantage of the system.' One such dealer was Salomon, which with its
billion dollar capital muscle, could afford to swallow huge amounts of the
newly auctioned securities. The Fed's conclusion, therefore, was that the
design of the current system provided dealers and investors with incentive
to manipulate the auction process.
Despite these inherent faults, the Fed does not believe the current system
is entirely bankrupt. Moreover, Mr Reinhart's paper acknowledges that the
proposed new system may also be open to abuse, and that setting up a
real-time auction will pose a daunting technical challenge.
In particular, it warns of potential hazards in the transition to a new
system. The biggest fear, and one voiced by many of those who oppose the new
plan, is that investors will be reluctant to enter the new auction because
of unfamiliarity with the process.
Most of the opposition to the plan is coming from the primary dealer
community. They already face a loss of value in their dealership franchise,
with the government pledged to open up bidding to a host of other financial
institutions.
Even worse, if the proposed changes are introduced, primary dealers will no
longer have crucial inside knowledge about the progress of each auction. In
the current auction process, the primary dealer's exclusive access to the
Fed means investors feel they must bid through the dealers if they are to
stand a chance of being awarded any securities.
Under the new system, customers will be confident of bidding on their own
because the crucial inside knowledge - who is bidding for what - will be on
the screens for all to see.
The Fed is not rushing into anything. In June it plans to host, with the
Treasury, a seminar on the proposals. After considering the views of the
securities industry, it plans to start experimenting with the new system
next year.
Everything, however, will have to wait until the automation of the current
antiquated auction process is finished.

FT  30 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Prices battered by election jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILT market suffered as yields rose for most classes of UK government
bonds, against a background of worries about the election and a possible
rise in interest rates in the next two months.
During the week, yields for 10-year securities rose about 10 basis points,
making an increase of some 60 basis points over the past month. There has
been a consequent decline in prices.
The yield increase may make it more difficult for the Bank of England during
the next six months to raise the revenues it needs through new gilt issues
to pay for the large increase in public sector borrowing envisaged by the
Treasury.
The tendency towards higher yields was particularly noticeable at the short
end of the yield curve. That reflected the view that sterling may be
susceptible to selling pressure in the next few weeks, which which might
force the government to increase short-term base rates to prevent the pound
slipping beneath its band in the European exchange rate mechanism.
But despite the recent decline in prices, the mood in the gilt market is not
all gloom. Many gilt practitioners reckon that, at their current prices, UK
securities are cheap compared with their counterparts in other government
bond markets. As a result, buying pressure, particularly from overseas,
could become evident in the weeks ahead.
Last week, the main focus for gilts investors was the April 9 general
election, with more opinion polls pointing to the possibility of a Labour
victory or a hung parliament.
That worries many people in the market, on the grounds that Labour might
push up government borrowing further, or there could be a run on the pound
as nervous investors switch funds out of sterling.
As a result, the week saw a general decline in prices, with the benchmark
Treasury 10 per cent bond maturing in 1994 edging down to 99 17/32 , a fall
of about a quarter of a point. The yield climbed 13 basis points to 10.22
per cent.
The price for the longer-dated 9 per cent stock due in 2008 fell by more
than half a point to 94 1/2 . The yield on Friday night was 9.67 per cent,
up 7 basis points. At the 10-year maturity level, yields were pushed up by 9
basis points to 9.94 per cent, close to the psychologically-important 10 per
cent mark last seen in August 1991.
German bond yields also rose, by about 6 basis points at the 10-year mark,
largely due to worries about inflation and because of growing consensus that
the Bundesbank is unlikely to ease interest rates before late-summer.
Even though German bonds have seen a general rise in yields this month, the
change has been small compared with the increase in gilt yields. As a
result, the difference between German and UK yields has increased
considerably from the low point last autumn. UK bonds have yields 181 basis
points higher than comparable German ones, compared with 123 basis points in
September.
Some believe this could offer a buying opportunity for gilt investors. Mr
Philip Tyson, a bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, reckons buying support
could easily push up prices, particularly if the market is boosted by
opinion polls pointing to a Tory win.
A longer-term consideration for many in the market is the volume of new
issues by the Bank which will be needed to pay for the rise in the public
sector borrowing requirement, which the Treasury sees reaching Pounds 28bn
in 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn the year after. Taking into account gilt
redemptions, this means that during the next financial year - and probably
the one after as well - the Bank will probably have to sell about Pounds 3bn
of gilts a month.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, believes the Bank
will have to gain much of this sum by issuing long-dated gilts, in the 10-20
year maturity area.
However, now there is little incentive for institutions such as pension
funds to buy gilts of this maturity, as prices for them are higher than
those of shorter-dated bonds. Accordingly, yields are lower: a 20-year gilt
provides about 9.6 per cent, some 30 basis points below the level for
10-year gilts.
As a result of such thinking, Mr Shepperd believes that during the next year
or so, yields for long and short-dated securities will start to converge,
making it no less attractive for investors to buy long-dated gilts as
short-dated ones.

FT  30 MAR 92 / French Bonds: Recovery imminent as market hits nadir

and if so - when President Francois Mitterrand will have Mrs Edith Cresson
replaced as prime minister.
The fate of Mrs Cresson has been debated so loudly for so long that the
smart school in French finance tends to dismiss it as an irrelevance.
Irrelevant or not, the dire performance of the ruling socialists in last
Sunday's regional elections sent the French bond markets spinning downwards
on Monday morning only to waver for the rest of the week.
The prime minister's future is still in the balance, but the outlook for
French bonds looks much brighter. The consensus is that the market has now
reached its nadir - what no-one seems to agree on is when the recovery will
begin.
'Things can only get better,' said Mr Bernard Godement, head of French
economic research at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris.
Mr Godement reckons the upswing has already started. Others are more
pessimistic. Mr Francois-Xavier Chauchaud, market economist at Banque
Indosuez in Paris, agrees with Mr Godement that the market will not fall any
further, but he expects to see a few sluggish weeks of stability before it
starts to rise again.
'You have to remember how heavily investors' perceptions of France are
influenced by events in Germany,' he said. 'I don't see any prospect of a
real recovery in the French bond market until there is evidence that German
inflation is falling, and we won't get that for another month.'
So far this year the progress of French bonds has been at best erratic. The
market was strengthened by interest from international investors in the
opening months of the year, only to fall again when they retreated in the
approach to last weekend's elections.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bond ended last week at
8.72 per cent, compared with 8.38 per cent a month ago. The Matif bond
futures contract hovered around 107.6 at the end of the week.
Meanwhile, the spread of French bonds over German bunds, now seen as a
critical mark of the market's competitiveness, has widened to around 66
basis points. This is still lower than the peak of 70 basis points just
before the Maastricht summit in early November, but well above the levels
achieved earlier this year.
France may have slowed down, but it shows no sign of slipping into real
recession.  Unemployment is still rising and hit 9.9 per cent in February.
But Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, is still exercising tight
control of the economy and inflation was held at 3 per cent last month.
The latest forecast from Paribas suggests that the French economy ought to
muster growth of 1.8 per cent this year - lower than the official forecast
of 2.2 per cent, but well above the 1 per cent achieved last year.
When German interest rates come down, presumably in the second half of this
year, French rates will almost certainly follow. This should be the final
fillip for the bond market.

FT  30 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Uncertainty and over-supply slow new
issue activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROMARKET participants may be struck by a feeling of deja vu looking back
over the first three months of this year. As in 1991, the period saw a
torrent of new issues as investors flocked to the market, followed by
near-paralysis as uncertainty and the effects of over-supply took hold.
If anything, the swing from boom to bust was even more pronounced this year
than last. In total, Dollars 73.6bn new Eurobonds were issued, against
Dollars 63.5bn in the first quarter of 1991. Yet the slowdown in new issue
activity during March has been spectacular. Only a handful of new issues was
launched last week, most meeting a muted response.
One reason for the slowdown in new issue activity over the past two weeks is
economic: there is deep uncertainty over the prospects for both the US and
European bond markets. The yield on the US Treasury long bond retreated back
above 8 per cent this month, and analysts are divided about the future
prospects.
One leading Eurobond firm admitted last week that even its in-house
economists were divided over the outlook for the dollar bond market. Some
see a triple-dip US recession on the horizon, with the long bond rising and
the yield falling towards 7.5 per cent. Others see a resurgence of growth
and inflationary pressures in the US economy, with the long bond moving to
8.5 per cent by the middle of the year.
In Europe, most bond markets have lost the gains made in the aftermath of
the Maastricht summit, which seemed to set the economies on a path towards
monetary union and low inflation.
Against this background, institutional investors are loathe to commit
additional funds to the market.
However, the over-supply of bonds during February and the early part of
March has greatly accentuated the problem. Many Eurobond firms are holding
substantial inventories of unsold paper, much of it underwritten at prices
which no longer reflect secondary market levels.
Just how much of the Dollars 73bn total new issuance remains on the books of
underwriters is uncertain. Estimates range from 25 per cent of total new
issuance - dismissed as outlandish by many syndicate officials - to a modest
Dollars 5bn equivalent. The truth is probably somewhere between the two.
The league table of lead mangers shows some substantial changes over this
time last year. Deutsche Bank Capital Markets is the biggest winner in terms
of market share, rising to the top slot from seventh position at the end of
the first quarter of 1991. Union Bank of Switzerland also increased its
volume of lead underwriting, rising to third position from 10th under the
management of Mr Len Harwood, who assumed responsibility for new issue
activity at the end of last year.
In contrast, Morgan Stanley International was at the head of the league
table in March 1991 but now stands at 19th position. Banque Paribas Capital
Markets has fallen from second place to fifth.
The slide of both firms is due to the lower volume of large Ecu bond issues
by sovereign and supranational borrowers over the past three months. Ecu
bond issuance amounted to Dollars 13.5bn equivalent, from Dollars 15.53bn in
the first three month of last year. The Ecu remained the second most popular
Euromarket currency, but the dominance of the dollar has not been threatened
this year as it was in the early months of 1991.
However, market share does not always equate with profitability. The firms
rumoured to be carrying the most unsold inventory of bonds also appear
towards the top end of the underwriting league table.

FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Third-quarter reverse for BHP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, reports a fall
in third-quarter net profit to ADollars 224m (USDollars 172.3m) from
ADollars 245m in the previous year's comparable period.
However, BHP said the reduction was caused by an abnormal income tax benefit
in the earlier period, which more than offset an improvement in pre-tax
profits from ADollars 359m to ADollars 459m. Revenue fell by 5.6 per cent to
ADollars 3.6bn.
The result suggests BHP is unlikely to match last year's record full-year
net profit of ADollars 1.42bn, in spite of higher contributions from the
steel division and its share in the Escondida copper mine in Chile.
Net profit for the first nine months of the year was ADollars 631m, down 41
per cent on the previous comparable period. Before tax, profit for the nine
months was down 13 per cent to ADollars 1.1bn. Revenue fell 13 per cent to
ADollars 11bn.
BHP said net profits from the minerals division increased 16.8 per cent to
ADollars 171m in the quarter, largely because of an increased contribution
from Escondida, which began shipments in the third quarter of 1991.
The Australian coal business also reported improved results, mainly due to
increased sales volumes and the sale of its interest in a joint venture
project. The gains were partly offset by lower results from manganese
operations caused by lower demand.
The steel business produced a net profit of ADollars 37m, compared with
ADollars 15m in the previous quarter, which was adversely affected by
preparation for the relining of the group's largest blast furnace.
Steel despatches were 6 per cent higher than in the comparable quarter of
last year, but 9 per cent below the second quarter of the current year.
Steel exports were up 33 per cent, but export profits suffered from lower
prices caused by over supply.
The petroleum division posted a net profit of ADollars 83m, down 58 per cent
on the previous period, which included the impact of high oil prices during
the Gulf war. BHP said the division's net profit was 44.6 per cent lower if
the impact of the war was excluded.

<TEXT>
ITALTEL, the Italian state-owned telecommunications equipment maker, raised
net profits to L132.5bn (Dollars 106.94m) last year from L120.9bn in 1990,
despite continuing falls in telecoms equipment prices, writes Haig Simonian.
Part of the earnings increase stemmed from sharply higher group turnover,
with a 24 per cent surge in volume terms. However, the effect of continuing
price competition was reflected in the fact that group sales rose by only
17.4 per cent to L2,760bn from L2,350bn.
Earnings were again boosted by productivity increases. However, Italtel said
1991 profits had been hit by extraordinary costs related to an early
retirement scheme. It gave no details about the size of the extraordinary
item.

maintain profit

   PONTE DI PIAVE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEFANEL, the Italian casual clothing group best known for its
brightly-coloured knitwear, is likely to report static earnings when it
publishes full figures shortly.
Mr Giuseppe Stefanel, chairman, said the company had experienced a year of
'consolidation' in 1991. Stefanel's earnings recovered strongly in 1990
after being depressed by a variety of factors the previous year.
Last year's earnings were also hit by the fact that group sales were
virtually unchanged from the L434bn (Dollars 350.28m) in 1990, rather than
reaching about L460bn, as targeted.
Turnover for 1991, which will be between L435bn and L436bn, was affected by
the decision not to bid for certain brands which had been produced by the
group's CFM subsidiary. The move had reduced group sales by some L30bn last
year, according to Mr Stefanel.
He remained cautiously optimistic about the dividend, which he said would at
least match that paid in 1990.
Mr Stefanel argued that it had been a considerable achievement to maintain
the group's earnings and sales performance during a very difficult year.
Looking ahead, he expected sales to reach L500bn this year, thanks to
continuing geographical expansion and the steady upgrading of the company's
core Italian outlets.
However, he recognised that achieving the group's target of 15 to 20 per
cent growth in sales annually would not be easy 'at a time of virtually
static prices'.

IBM Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of the world's largest computer company,
has reported a 33 per cent decline in pre-tax profits last year, to Y103.5bn
(Dollars 784.1m).
IBM blamed weak sales of computer hardware in the face of an economic
slowdown that caused many customers to delay equipment purchases.
Sales were down to Y1,272.1bn from Y1,326.5bn. Domestic sales were off by
6.8 per cent to Y903.8bn Export revenues rose 3.3 per cent.
After-tax earnings were off 32 per cent to Y56.48bn.
As part of the worldwide restructuring of the IBM group, IBM Japan has been
shifting its focus away from the hardware side. The company said sales of
software, services, and system integration continued to grow.

<TEXT>
MR YOSHIFUME Tsuji has been named president-designate of Nissan Motor,
Japan's second largest carmaker. He will take over management of the company
in June from Mr Yutaka Kume, who will become Nissan non-executive chairman.
The transfer of leadership comes at a time when Nissan's sales and profits
are under severe pressure worldwide. Mr Kume said he selected Mr Tsuji to
succeed him in part because of his experience in production and purchasing,
which would put him in position to pursue a needed cost-cutting programme.
Mr Tsuji is currently executive vice-president in charge of Nissan's
production operation group and non-automotive operations group. He has held
a wide range of positions within Nissan, mainly on the engineering side,
since joining the company in 1954.
Mr Kume, who as president of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association
(Jama), has been a powerful advocate for the industry, will not fade from
the scene. Although he said he would not interfere with Mr Tsuji's
management of the business, he will continue to be influential within the
company and will continue as Jama chairman.
Mr Kume is also widely expected to be appointed vice-chairman of the
Keidanren, the influential association of Japan's leading businesses, and
could be in line for eventual promotion to chairman.
Mr Kume denied he had any understanding with the Keidanren. However, if Mr
Kume is to join the organisation in an executive role, he would need to make
himself available by May this year. Mr Kume turns 70 next month and would be
ineligible for appointment to the Keidanren next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEMI-TECH (Global), the Hong Kong company which controls the Singer sewing
machine group, achieved a 70 per cent jump in profit attributable to
shareholders to HKDollars 771m (USDollars 99.1m) in the year to January
1992, from HKDollars 453m in 1991.
The figures included a one-off profit of HKDollars 268m from the public
offering of shares in Singer, which was listed in New York in August 1991.
The Semi-Tech results reflect another strong performance from its US
subsidiary, which increased its share of the world sewing machine market to
37 per cent and also reported a 28 per cent increase in sales of consumer
durable products.
Turnover increased from HKDollars 8.63bn to HKDollars 9.37bn, largely due to
the marketing of new Singer branded products.
A final dividend of 2.8 cents a share is recommended, making a full-year
payout of 3.8 cents, against 2.7 cents in 1991.
Mr James Ting, executive chairman, said: 'Given our strong cash flow, total
elimination of acquisition-related debt and diversified low cost
manufacturing sources, in combination with Singer's proven global marketing
prowess, the outlook for the current year continues to be favourable.'
The group aims to pursue this strategy with its investment in another fallen
giant, Sansui Electric, in which it has acquired a 19 per cent stake from
the collapsed Polly Peck International group.
Semi-Tech's Hong Kong partner in the deal, Grande Holdings, is to streamline
the production process, making use of low cost facilities in Southern China,
while Semi-Tech will utilise the 30,000 distribution outlets of the Singer
network to provide a wider market for Sansui products.

POHJOLA, the biggest Finnish insurance group, reported a dramatic surge in
operating loss for 1991 due to heavy claims stemming from its foreign
insurance business.
Operating loss jumped to FM588m (Dollars 129.5m) from FM108m a year earlier,
but the directors proposed paying a maintained dividend of FM1 per share.
Profit from Pohjola's domestic direct insurance and reinsurance business was
wiped out by underwriting losses of FM614m in its foreign insurance business
 -compared with a loss of FM97m.
Miss Pirkko Alitalo, director and chief financial officer, said the loss
arose because foreign insurance claims were much larger than originally
expected.

FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Israeli bank hit by debt
write-offs

LEGISLATION forcing Israel's banks to write off large chunks of agricultural
debt slashed 1991 profits at United Mizrahi Bank, the country's fourth
largest banking group. The group is for sale under the government's
programme to sell its majority bank shareholdings.
Net profits of Shk32.7m (Dollars 13.7m) were up by more than three times
compared with Shk7.2m in 1990, in large part due to strong performance at
the group's mortgage bank, Bank Tefahot. Return on capital recovered to 5
per cent, compared with 1.1 per cent.
However the core Bank Mizrahi slipped to a Shk8.1m net loss from a Shk2.1m
profit under the burden of bad debt provisions. The group was forced to set
aside Shk98m for the agricultural sector out of total provisions of Shk195m,
including Shk57m to take account of write-offs recently dictated by
parliament to ease the debt burden on the country's Moshavim collective
farms.
The Bank of Israel, which has strongly criticised the law, has warned that
the legislation will all but wipe out 1991 profits at the big banks, which
are all reporting this week.
The central bank and Treasury are particularly incensed as they are involved
in trying to sell the government bank holdings, acquired for Dollars 7bn
following a share collapse in 1983. Bids close for a 25-to-51 per cent share
in United Mizrahi, currently controlled by the United Mizrahi religious
organisation, on April 30.

FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: INI plunges to Pta61.26bn loss

<TEXT>
INSTITUTO Nacional de Industria (INI), the Spanish state industrial holding,
has plunged to Pta61.26bn (Dollars 589m) pre-tax losses for 1991 from a
profit of Pta9.24bn a year earlier, hurt by dismal performances from its
steel, airline and defence companies, Reuter reports from Madrid.
Mr Javier Salas, chairman, said the Gulf war, Spain's slowed economic growth
and comparatively steep inflation and interest rates dealt a blow to several
of its key industries.
He said 1992 would see some improvement, but added that another year of
hefty losses was likely. 'It will be a bad year, but better than the
terrible year we just experienced.'
Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana, the flag carrier 99 per cent owned by INI,
chalked up a pre-tax loss of Pta54.19bn up from Pta26.11bn, in part because
of plunging airline traffic due to the Gulf war.
The airline, which includes Chile's Landeco and Venezolana Internacional de
Aviacion, hopes to raise up to Pta120bn in 1992 in new capital, currently
under review by the European Community Commission. It plans to use this to
help cover its Pta400bn fleet renovation and an investment strategy
including further acquisitions in Latin America.
The steel group Grupo Ensidesa was also one of the worst performers among
INI's 46 subsidiaries with a consolidated pre-tax loss of Pta35.59bn. In
1990, the group posted a Pta11.01bn loss.
Mr Salas pegged the company's poor results to plunging steel prices
worldwide, slowing economic growth and the difficult restructuring process
the Spanish steel sector now faces.
Construcciones Aeronauticas (Casa), the aircraft maker, posted a Pta9.74bn
loss against a Pta4.6bn loss in 1990.
The company hopes for a cash infusion of around Pta43bn to help bring it
back to profitability and position itself for a possible foreign alliance.
But Mr Salas offered a dim view of 1992 for the sector. 'It will be a bad
year for defence,' he commented.
The group's best performer was the utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad
(Endesa). The Endesa group turned in a Pta131.74bn pre-tax profit in 1991,
up from Pta108.84bn a year earlier.
Mr Salas added that INI was considering selling part of its 75.6 per cent
holding in Endesa.

offer

<TEXT>
HAFNIA, the Danish insurance-based financial services group, has withdrawn a
standing offer to buy any new shares issued by its domestic rival, Baltica,
at DKr1,000 (Dollars 156.25) each.
Hafnia gave no explanation for withdrawing the offer, which was first made
in 1990 as part of an unsuccessful attempt by it to gain control of Baltica.
Analysts, however, said Hafnia probably withdrew because its finances would
come under excessive strain if Baltica made an issue and Hafnia had to make
good its offer.
Hafnia has bought a substantial bloc of shares in Sweden's Skandia as part
of an attempt, with Norway's UNI Storebrand, to gain control of Skandia and
establish a Nordic insurance giant. The two challengers have received a
somewhat sceptical reception from Skandia, although they held further talks
on Wednesday.
Baltica Holding, meanwhile, reported a DKr271m (Dollars 42.3m) net profit
compared with a DKr2.04bn loss in 1990. Last year's result was a return on
capital of 3.0 per cent. An unchanged DKr8 per share dividend was proposed.
Life assurance profits rose from DKr199m to DKr466m and accident group
profits from DKr225m to DKr277m. Baltica Bank, however, made a DKr334m loss
as a result of large provisions on property engagements. It required a
capital injection from the parent company.
Premium income in Danica, the life group formed following Baltica's
acquisition of the state life assurance and pension company, Statsanstalten,
increased from DKr1.17bn to DKr4.35bn. Accident group premiums increased
from DKr4.09bn to DKr4.91bn.
Baltica said it would not this year achieve its target of a market rate of
return on its equity capital.

FT  30 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Heron's plight coming under close scrutiny
 -Pounds 100m loss estimated and restructuring on the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not an easy year for the company or for me personally. Saying this Mr Gerald
Ronson observed that 'it will be seen as a time from which we at Heron all
move forward together'.
It is not hard to understand why, in March 1991, Mr Ronson said in the
annual statement of his property and finance company Heron International
that he wanted to put the past behind him.
Heron had suffered the worst year of its history, and Mr Ronson had just
completed a six-month term in Ford Open Prison for his part in the Guinness
scandal.
His wish for a better commercial year has not been granted. A year later,
for the financial period ending tomorrow, Heron is likely to declare a its
first-ever pre-tax loss, which some estimates put as high as around Pounds
100m. On Friday Mr Ronson will ask his banks to reschedule some Pounds 1.3bn
of debt and bonds.
It would be easy to throw back at Mr Ronson his comments in last annual
report: 'We have always borne in mind the possibility of cyclical changes in
the economy . . . we have always pursued . . . the prudent management of . .
. borrowings'.
But the restructuring has surprised many Heron observers who shared its
chairman's view that it was cautiously managed. They point out that Mr
Ronson is hardly known for flamboyance. Now 53, he took over the business
that he and his father, from a Russian jewish immigrant family, had
developed together. He retains a tough-talking style and London accent
unsoftened by his financial success.
His small long-serving team of executives has been picked over the years
from those who share his taste for working a six and a half day week.
He and Mr Alan Goldman, the 48-year old chartered accountant who is deputy
chief executive, and has worked for Heron for 18 years, share a view of
commercial life as an unceasing battle. Fond of pugnacious metaphors in
their comments to the press - Mr Ronson described working in America as
swimming in a shark pool - they have not given the impression that they were
carried away with delusions of omnipotence.
Bankers have been comforted too in the past by Mr Ronson's own 15 per cent
stake in the business. Of the balance 40 per cent is held by Ronson family
trusts, and 45 per cent by the Ronson Foundations, which give to a wide
range of charities.
How then did Heron miscalculate? The company has said that the biggest
factor in the need for financial rescheduling was the damage done to its net
worth by its ill-fated US expansion - a decision made 12 years ago.
In 1980 it paid Dollars 23.5m for Pima, a US savings and loan business,
similar to a building society. Pima, based in Tucson, Arizona, had then
around Dollars 400m of loans on its books, but these rose to some Dollars
3.3bn by 1987. However, like several savings and loans associations in the
South West of America, it fell into heavy losses after a collapse in the
property market.
From mid 1987 Heron tried, unsuccessfully, to find a buyer. But Pima was
eventually given away to the US's Office of Thrift Supervision, a regulatory
authority, in March 1990, and Heron wrote off Pounds 193m in its accounts
for that year.
But clearly that 12-year-old decision is not all the story behind the call
for Friday's meeting. Writedowns on its development property portfolio have
played a large part too. Heron will present its banks on Friday with what it
coyly describes as a 'different' assessment of its net assets from the
Pounds 585.1m shown in last year's accounts - and banks are expected to
scrutinise the assumptions for last year's valuations closely.
The financial assessment is being carried out by Price Waterhouse, the
accountants, although the company said yesterday that Ernst &amp; Young, the
auditors, were being retained.
However some Heron watchers are also asking whether an underlying past
weakness - which may have contributed to the US expansion - is Mr Ronson's
dependence on a small number of long serving directors.
Heron has brought in several outsiders to manage divisions over the past
decade. But Ronson-watchers point out that not all were long-lasting - in
particular the appointment of Mr Hugh Jenkins in 1984, to oversee the US
operations - in retrospect then at a critical point in their fortunes. Mr
Jenkins stayed only for 18 months, before leaving to return to investment
management in the UK. He is now chief executive of Prudential Portfolio
managers.
However charges of introversion must be lessened by a series of senior
appointments in the last few years; at present only six of the top 15
executive directors and managers have been at Heron more than 10 years.
The question of how the blame for financial rescheduling should be
distributed between the recession and Heron's management will come under
scrutiny at next Friday's meeting.
One banker last week described Heron as 'intensely private in both senses -
not just as Britain's second largest privately - owned company, but in Mr
Ronson's character.' The restructuring may cost him some of that privacy.

FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Investors may be given a chance
to buy large Ashanti Gold stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS MAY soon be able to buy into Ashanti Goldfields Corporation of
Ghana, which operates one of the world's biggest and richest gold mines. But
Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate which owns 45 per cent of Ashanti, will
not provide any of the shares.
Lonrho, which is being pressed by the City to reduce its debt, had no
intention of disposing of any of its Ashanti holding - 'not in the medium,
or the long-term' - insisted Mr Sam Jonah, managing director of the gold
mining company, at a meeting of the Association of Mining Analysts in
London.
Mr Paul Tarsh, the Lonrho director responsible for its mining operations,
added: 'Not only would we not sell, we would love to buy some more of
Ashanti.'
Mr Jonah revealed that the Ghana government, which owns the rest of Ashanti,
was exploring the possibility of selling some or all of its stake in the
company - perhaps by floating Ashanti on the local stock exchange to
encourage this fledgling institution.
'The initiative is coming from the government, not Lonrho,' Mr Jonah said.
Ashanti produced 569,452 troy ounces of gold in the year to September 31 at
a cash cost of under Dollars 170 an ounce, placing it among the world's
lowest-cost producers. Mr Jonah said that production would increase to
630,000 ounces this year, and added that the company had sold forward about
25 per cent of this at an average of Dollars 375 an ounce. Gold's price
closed in London on Friday at Dollars 341.85.
Ashanti was about the start a Dollars 300m expansion project to boost output
to 1m ounces of gold a year by 1995 at a cash cost of Dollars 168 an ounce.
Half the finance would be generated internally and the rest would be
borrowed. Ashanti's debt at present was only 20 per cent of equity and the
company was talking to five banks willing to provide project finance.
Mr Jonah said Ashanti now had proven and probable gold reserves of 9.5m
ounces. Total reserves, including those in the 'possible' category, were
22.1m ounces of gold or 97m tonnes of ore with 7 grams of gold per tonne.
Ashanti's mining concession covered 125 square miles and 'we believe we have
touched only a small part of the resources. We will continue to explore
aggressively because there is even greater long-term potential.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Relyon, the bedding and cabinet furniture manufacturer, fell from
Pounds 3.24m to Pounds 2.67m pre-tax for 1991.
Turnover was static at Pounds 42.54m.
First half profitability had been maintained but recessionaryinfluences
together with exceptional costs of product development resulted in a sharp
profits erosion in the second half.
A proposed final dividend of 3.15p makes a same-again 4.9p total. Earnings
amounted to 8.37p (9.28p).
The Trident subsidiary continued to suffer from weak demand and was
currently in talks that may lead to its management taking over the company
for a nominal sum. That would result in a write-off of some Pounds 2m in the
group's balance sheet.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Greenpeace attacks Waste Management on eve of flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, is renewing its attack on the
US methods of Waste Management (WMI), the world's largest waste disposer,
which is raising Pounds 450m for European expansion. But WMI has accused
Greenpeace of 'outrageous manipulation of information'.
In today's statement, timed to influence the flotation of 20 per cent of
WMI's international operations on April 7, Greenpeace is warning European
investors to 'consider the dangerous practices' of the US group.
The share sale, valuing WMI at more than Pounds 2bn, in one of the largest
flotations in recent years, will be achieved through a placing in London and
offers for sale elsewhere including the US.
Earlier this year Waste Management and Wessex Water, its partner in a joint
venture set up last year, refuted allegations in a Greenpeace report on
WMI's operation in the US.
'Greenpeace's stated belief is that NO waste disposal is acceptable because
the group maintains that waste simply should not be produced,' said WMI.
Greenpeace has claimed that WMI paid Dollars 45m (Pounds 25.9m) in
US-related environmental penalties and settlements during the 1980s.
According to WMI, the Dollars 45m included capital costs of meeting
ever-tightening environmental standards.
Waste Management said it had a 'good relationship' with most environmental
organisations, and consultants Arthur D Little had conducted an external
audit which placed WMI 'firmly among the leaders of industry as a whole with
regard to corporate environmental management'.
Last December Chicago-based WMI paid a Dollars 1.9m penalty after a consent
decree - a form of out of court settlement - following what it called a
difference in interpretation of the laws at its Sauget, Illinois, hazardous
waste incineration plant.
The case revolved around alleged violations of the operating permits at the
facility and carbon monoxide levels in its incinerator.
WMI said the CO levels had not constituted a threat to the environment.
In 1990, WMI paid a Dollars 3.75m penalty in connection with operating
procedures at its Chicago hazardous waste incineration plant.

FT  30 MAR 92 / UK business failures increase during first quarter of 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS failures in the UK in the first quarter of this year have continued
to rise above the high levels of 1991.
A survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, shows that
14,881 British businesses collapsed during the first quarter, 4.5 per cent
more than the 14,245 failures recorded by the same survey in the last
quarter of 1991.
The current weekly rate of business failures, 1,240, shows a dramatic
increase over the 800-level recorded for the first quarter of last year.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, stressed yesterday
that in previous recessions the failure rate had peaked some time after a
recovery was under way. 'The larger company has the ability to cut back
fixed costs while the smaller business, so far into the downturn, does not
have that option.'
The survey was drawn immediately into election campaigning when Mr Gordon
Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said it showed that business
failures would exceed 100,000 during the recession, with more than 1m lost
jobs.
'This makes this recession election a referendum on Conservative economic
failure,' he said. Labour intends to step up its economic campaign this
week.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's figures show a slight slowing in the weekly rate of
company liquidations, from 479 to 467, between the last quarter of 1991 and
the first quarter of this year. Individual or small business bankruptcies,
however, rose from 708 to 773 per week.
London and the south-east were the worst-hit areas, with nearly 40 per cent
of all business failures and more than half of liquidations. Business
failures in the south-east, excluding London, were 87.5 per cent higher in
the first quarter of 1992 than during the same period last year. The next
highest rates of increase in corporate liquidations between the first
quarters of 1991 and 1992 were in the West Midlands and Wales. The lowest
were in the East Midlands and Scotland. Bankruptcies rose by more than
two-thirds in all regions except Scotland, where the increase was 29.4 per
cent.
The survey is reinforced by figures released yesterday for county court
judgments on debt claims. There were 221,538 debt judgments in England and
Wales in the second half of last year, compared with 164,185 in the same
period of 1990. The total for 1991 was a record 397,000.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Race for second place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the fashionable City sayings of the moment is that whoever wins this
election will be in power for years to come. The theory is simple: the
recovery may be a bit late, but it is bound to come soon enough for the
incoming government to steal all the credit.
This is not quite straightforward, because the same people are likely to say
that if Labour wins, there will be such a crisis of confidence in the City
that the recovery may not happen after all. However, the saving clause
sounds like rightwing wishful thinking. Portfolio managers know that Labour
governments have usually been pretty good for markets after an initial
hiccup, and most will regard any early setback as a buying opportunity.
Whatever they say, they believe in the coming recovery.
This suggests a touching faith that the market's in-house forecasters, of
whom about half projected a recovery in 1991, were simply a bit premature.
The underlying model, they seem to be implying, is sound. But is it? The
fact that no City guru went even half way to foreseeing the fall we actually
experienced suggests a more radical mistake. This is underlined by what
looks at first sight like a triumph for the City: poor as the City's desktop
efforts were, the professionals with large economics staffs and big models
performed even worse.
Only one academic team (at Oxford) so much as got the sign right; one of the
worst, suggestively, was the London Business School, which produced the
whole Treasury top economics team. The really big battalions fell on their
faces in a row. In rising order of disgrace, the Treasury, the EC and OECD,
the National Institute and the IMF all got it wildly wrong. All these
professionals are very good at modelling  - the art of getting a computer to
find a suitable bit of history to repeat. The commonsense conclusion from
their errors is that history - or at least recent history - is not repeating
itself.
Half of the problem is that private debt has reached levels in relation to
income not seen for some 60 years. The professionals know this, and are
busily trying to model debt deflation. But the other half concerns the
relation of debt not to income, but to asset values; and we still don't know
the half of it. Last week's announcements from Olympia &amp; York and Heron
offer a grim reminder of how debt crises work: the really bad news may not
appear until you thought it was all over.
There are two reasons for this. First, both banks and property companies
feel compelled to conceal some ugly truths as long as they can, because to
do otherwise would mean admitting heavy and sometimes insupportable losses.
If you are a developer, an empty building can still be valued on the rent
you are asking, but a rent cut to win a tenant reveals the truth. If you are
a banker, lending good money after bad can put off the day of provisioning.
Confession in these circumstances can be a sign of strength.
But it can also be a sign of weakness. Canary Wharf is a sad example. The
potential losses on this and other London property developments have
inspired the banks to prodigies of economy, closing branches and reducing
staff. But each economy by the banks has further weakened the City property
market, and so increased the potential losses. Now the banks, trying to push
up their margins, have imposed charges that discourage borrowing; and so
troubles which may seem restricted to one asset market can infect the whole
economy.
This kind of vicious spiral repeats itself again and again in a shrinking
economy. Repossessions delay a housing recovery, bankrupt sales undermine
retail markets, rising insurance premiums mop up part of rising incomes,
falling government revenues push up long-term interest rates.
At its worst, as 60 years ago, this process can lead to a self-feeding cycle
of economic and market weakness, the kind of thing which wiped 90 per cent
off Wall Street equity values in a collapse punctuated by a whole series of
'recoveries'.
In its milder form - and although I may sound like a pessimist, I do not
believe we face anything remotely like the 1930s - it means simply that the
disappointments we suffered in 1991 do not make recovery more probable, as
the govern-for-ever school seems to believe. Delay makes recovery less
likely, and likely to be weaker than previously expected.
As for self-starting recovery, that begins to look like Catch 22. The CBI
says recovery depends on consumer spending; but consumer surveys show that
willingness to spend depends on recovery. Repeat, altering where necessary,
for investment. As for an export-led recovery, forget it unless you also
expect devaluation (now tipped in the City as possible from the Tories, but
unlikely from Labour).
You may regard all this as typical Harris gloom, and ignore it; but there
are signs that the big modellers are belatedly beginning to think gloomily,
too. As recently as Budget day, the chancellor was suspected of having
cunningly inflated his borrowing forecast, to leave the less room for
Labour's promises. Now, rumour has it, Labour has learned that the
chancellor understated borrowing to leave room for Tory promises; and that
the estimate is still rising, as the end of the rainbow recedes.
Indeed, Labour's scouts may well have got the message which the late Lord
Kaldor brought back from some Treasury scouting on the eve of the 1974
election. As he emerged from a grim session with the forecasters he met
Stuart Holland, an old pupil and then a rising hope of the radical left.
'Stuart,' he said, 'this is an election we have to lose]'
That was one of Kaldor's sounder pronouncements; and judging from the way
both the main parties are mismanaging their election campaigns, they may
have taken it to heart. Or one of them, at any rate. Labour could buy itself
some political time by blaming the whole mess on the Conservatives - but
seems to have little idea how to use that time. The Conservatives seem
equally bereft of ideas and excuses. Suggestive, that.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: Commission that is hard to justify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MEREDITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bruce Johnsen suggests (Personal View, March 24) that paying soft
commissions through an execution only broker is no worse than paying
commission to an integrated research broker and that commission is good
because it subsidises research - otherwise fund managers would have 'little
incentive to do well-researched trades'.
Fund managers, however, know that most commission is optional and, in a
highly competitive business with few barriers to entry, we have every
incentive to orientate our own research to long-term evaluation rather than
to stimulate trading. Soft commission is particularly hard to justify
because it is so susceptible to abuse - after all, resulting costs passed on
to client funds feed directly to the fund managers' profit line.
Regulators in the UK and US are rightly worried about the rapid development
of this Pounds 1bn money-go-round which leaves investors invariably bemused
and almost invariably poorer.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Britain's baking industry fights for every crumb: Fierce
competition and declining demand from consumers threatens a shake-out among
UK bread producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food manufacturing is supposed to sail through recessions, because consumers
always have to eat. But for Britain's Pounds 3bn-a-year baking industry,
these are proving some of the toughest times since the invention of sliced
bread.
The bakers' plight challenges conventional assumptions about the advantages
of size and cost efficiency in a mature sector. It also offers striking
evidence of how far the rise of powerful supermarket chains has transformed
the balance of competition in Britain's food industry.
Cut-throat competition has slashed the retail price of standard white loaves
 -the biggest-selling type of bread - from about 40p each to less than 30p
in many stores. The profits and share prices of Associated British Foods
(ABF) and Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM), the country's largest bakers, have
been clobbered, and many smaller companies appear to be clinging on by their
fingernails.
With UK bread consumption in long-term decline and surplus production
capacity estimated at 10-15 per cent, the stage seems set for a shake-out of
the kind which forced Spillers out of the business in 1978. Says Mr Mike
Handley, managing director of RHM's bakery division: 'There is just too much
equipment out there making bread people don't want to eat.'
ABF and RHM together account for about two-thirds of bread sales and are the
only bakers with nationwide brands and distribution systems. Both have
invested heavily to cut costs by concentrating production in fewer, bigger
plants equipped to bake as many as 8,000 loaves an hour - more than 10 times
the maximum capacity 20 years ago.
Yet size has not guaranteed invulnerability. Baking neither requires
sophisticated technology, nor depends on expensive equipment. Furthermore,
scale economies are quickly exhausted. 'A bakery doesn't have to be national
to be efficient,' says Mr Garry Weston, chairman of ABF. 'You can be as
efficient with one plant as with 20.'
That has allowed about a dozen small independent bakers to challenge the
industry goliaths by cutting prices to the bone. The Davids keep costs low
by operating only regional distribution facilities and buying flour from
small independent millers for less than ABF and RHM, which have in-house
milling operations. The Davids' trump card is that they can survive on
wafer-thin margins. As family businesses, they have leaner overheads than
ABF and RHM and do not need to earn the financial returns that the City
expects of the two big companies.
But the small companies, many of which have built new plants in the past few
years, could never have succeeded without the large supermarket groups. As
these have come to dominate bread sales, the big bakers' control over the
market has grown steadily weaker.
Their grip began to loosen in the 1970s, when two national baking strikes
halted bread supplies. Since then, the trend has been accelerated by the
spread of supermarkets' own in-store bakeries and by their growing reliance
on 'own label' packaged bread, now more than 40 per cent of sales.
These developments have undermined the big bakers' brands and their
bargaining power with supermarket buyers, who have been increasingly ready
to switch orders to the independents unless their terms are met.
This ought to be good news for consumers. However, there are growing signs
that pressure to compete on price has led to compromises on quality. Says Mr
David Lang, a respected industry analyst with stockbrokers Henderson
Crosthwaite: 'A lot of the cheaper bread on sale is muck.'
That is a further setback for an industry desperate to persuade an already
sceptical market that its product is rich in nutrition. Although the claim
is backed by scientific evidence, opinion polls regularly find many
consumers consider ordinary bread unhealthy.
Despite growth in demand for ready-made sandwiches, the British eat less
bread than any other European nation. In western Germany, where bread is
double the price in Britain, consumption is twice as high and has grown by a
sixth in the past 15 years. UK consumption has fallen by about as much in
the same period.
Many factors have contributed to bread's down-market image in the UK - among
them the disastrous 'styrofoam' loaf produced after EC membership forced
millers to switch from North American to lower-protein European wheat in the
1970s. However, producers have not made much effort to change consumers'
perceptions for the better.
Indeed, marketing has long played poor relation to the relentless drive to
produce ever larger volumes of bread at lower cost. 'The people running the
bakeries now aren't bakers, they're engineers. They're less interested in
how bread tastes than in making it consistently.'
In most other areas of food manufacturing, it is accepted wisdom that high
margins and clout with retailers depend on strong brands. Many leading
manufacturers routinely spend 10 per cent or more of sales on advertising
and brand promotion. By contrast, the entire UK bread industry spent a
paltry Pounds 7.9m on advertising last year, according to Media
Register-Meal, which measures advertising spending.
Mr Weston of ABF argues that heavy brand support is hard to justify because
bread varieties are difficult to differentiate and innovations easily
copied. However, this view is challenged by the experience of Warburton's, a
Bolton-based regional baker which is the market leader in Lancashire. The
company has established a strong brand identity, based on a reputation for
outstanding product quality backed by substantial television advertising.
Unlike its main competitors, Warburton's refuses to make own-label products
for supermarkets or to offer discounts - even though its loaves sell for
twice as much as their cheapest rivals. 'I don't want our bread sold
cheaply,' says Mr Jonathan Warburton, marketing director. 'There's no point
in offering what the rest of the industry offers already.'
Other bakers, while admiring Warburton's achievements, argue that it is a
special case. The company serves a limited region, its local roots run deep,
and its advertising makes much of the skills developed over five generations
of family ownership.
Still, there are signs that the industry leaders are taking marketing more
seriously. Mr Handley of RHM is a marketing man by background while Mr Henry
Jackson, head of ABF's Allied Bakeries until his sudden death in January,
was recruited from Mars, the confectionery maker renowned for its marketing
expertise.
ABF is sponsoring a 'generic' advertising campaign for bread, while RHM has
stepped up its advertising expenditure recently. However, rebuilding brands
is expensive, while resources are limited by poor profits and - in RHM's
case - by concern about falling prey to a hostile takeover.
In any case, the big bakers' immediate preoccupation is with restoring price
disciplines. The recent collapse of one of the small independent millers
suggests a capacity shake-out may be starting. But rehabilitating bread's
image - let alone persuading consumers that it is a quality product which
justifies premium prices - is bound to take longer.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: Share ownership has varying incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREG CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your survey on employee ownership ('Poised at the crossroads', March
24) remarked on growth in employee share-ownership programmes (Esop) during
the 1980s.
Research by the London School of Economics Business Performance Group shows
that the incentive effect of employee ownership varies considerably. While
individual employees are typically motivated by incentive pay, introducing
incentives to those with more collective values may be totally ineffective
in promoting higher levels of effort.
In this case resources would be better applied elsewhere. The blanket
introduction of an Esop is no substitute for sensitive design in pay
systems.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: High class
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In essence, Observer has only one thing to say to readers who tackled last
Monday's numeracy-style questions. It is: 'Go to the top of the class]'
After all, any candidate who got 82.8 per cent of the total marks available
in a test would be considered to have done very well. But that was merely
the average score of the 151 of you who entered the quiz.
The questions, with the answers in italics, were:
1 What is the conventional name for the result of dividing the circumference
of a circle by its diameter? Pi.
2 What is 12 1/2 per cent of 60 per cent? 7 1/2 per cent.
3 If 93 folk enter a knock-out singles tournament at tennis, how many
matches are needed before one player emerges as overall winner? 92.
4 In the A1, A2, A3 . . . series of paper-sizes, what mathematical
relationship does the length of each sheet's longer side bear to the length
of its shorter side? When the shorter side is designated as 1, the longer is
the square root of 2.
5 Name the ancient philosopher specifically associated with the theorem that
sheds light on question 4. Pythagoras.
6 What - apart from the fact that no other number is the same as it - is
unique about the number 1,729? It is the smallest number that can be formed
from the sum of two cubes in two different ways (13x123=1,729;
103x93=1,729).
7 Name the unusual mathematician who saw the answer to 6 instantly.
Ramanujan.
As Observer reported last Thursday, 62 of you produced perfect answers
within the time limit, so necessitating a tie-breaker to find the winner of
the bottle of malt whisky.
As threatened, it is a stinker calling for knowledge both of numerate and of
literary culture. It has two parts.
The focus is the ancient problem: Which number when added to one seventh of
itself equals 19? It is easily solved by algebra which allows a
non-numerical 'place-holder', such as x, to stand for the initially unknown
number constituting the answer - for example, x + x/7 = 19.
But algebra is a relatively recent method which was scarcely known in
England, at least, until the mid-16th century. Before then, there was no
facility for using unknown place-holders, and such problems had to be solved
by calculating solely with whole numbers and fractions (as distinct from
decimals), the preferred method being called 'The way of falsehood.' Now to
the question:
A Show how the problem could be worked out by such a pre-algebraic method.
B Which 16th-17th century English poet hinted that he understood the then
new algebra, and in which poem?
All entries welcome, but only the previous 62 timely and all-correct
entrants will be in line for the prize. Answers by fax to Observer on
071-873 3926 or 071-873 3196 by 6pm London time tomorrow, or by mail
postmarked the same day.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been obvious for some time that the Earth Summit in Rio this June
risked sliding into chaos. That risk has now increased with the belated
discovery - over two years after preparations began - that the proposed
dates coincide with an important Islamic lunar festival.
As a result, 20 Islamic countries have asked the UN organisers to postpone
the event by four days so their government leaders can carry out their
ritual observance of the new moon.
This is no mean request since more than 160 heads of state or government
have been invited, all of whom will have to rejig their diaries if the UN
agrees to shift the date.
As a compromise, the UN is willing to consider a delay of two days. But the
EC countries - which have made no secret of their annoyance at this
oversight - are balking.
The one person who is unaffected is President George Bush who has yet to say
whether he will be coming to Rio at all.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: Champagne stakes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is France's Veuve Clicquot champagne company better at picking Britain's
business winners than the Guardian newspaper? Undoubtedly, to judge by the
track records of the winners of Veuve Clicquot's business woman of the year,
and the Guardian young business man awards.
Admittedly, one or two of Veuve Clicquot's selections, such as Sock Shop's
Sophie Mirman, have hit a rough patch. But the record does not match the
Guardian's uncanny ability to tip future losers such as John Gunn, John
Ashcroft, James Gulliver, George Davies et al. Sensibly, the newspaper has
ditched the award.
Although Body Shop's Anita Roddick could still spoil the Veuve Clicquot
score-sheet, and Ann Burdus has not had a happy time as marketing director
of Olympia and York's Canary Wharf, most of the winners over the last couple
of decades have held onto their reputations. Mair Barnes, for example, has
been doing an excellent job at Woolworths and Nestles' Gill Lewis has just
been given a seat on the Pearson board.
On Thursday the Veuve Clicquot judges try once again. While the Random
Century publishers' boss Gail Rebuck would seem the front-runner, there is
more to business than making loads of money. So Observer's preference is for
Phyllis Cunningham, chief executive of leading cancer hospital, the Royal
Marsden.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: Gold still has glitter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs DAVID GULLEY and ROGER MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While we agree with Kenneth Gooding that it has been a chilly spring
indeed for gold ('All that is gold no longer glisters', March 26), we would
like to set against it the following information, not available to the
market when Mr Gooding was researching his article.
On the basis of those markets for which we have good data, 1991 global
consumer demand for gold appears to have gone from strength to strength. In
fact, preliminary results indicate that jewellery demand may have
outstripped new mine production for the third year in a row.
How can this be true with the stories about weak jewellery demand currently
circulating in the market? Most gold traders look at the demand for
unwrought gold in jewellery fabrication, which is closer to their own
business than final consumer demand. But, obviously, consumer demand will
dictate fabrication demand in the final analysis.
While it is too early for us to assess the first quarter's state of
fabrication off-take, seasonally adjusted, pessimism should be tempered with
the understanding that in recent record-breaking years, first quarter
fabrication looked anaemic at the time.
Second, we continue to think of India as a source of strength and optimism
for the future. When India swapped smuggled gold for foreign exchange last
year, the resulting hue and cry led the government to redeem these swaps and
even to increase its official gold reserves.
The clear intent of the recent India-International Monetary Fund economic
plan is to work with the Indian appetite for gold, rather than to try to
fight it.
While the gold price does tend to revert quite strongly to its underlying
trend, in most recent years it has routinely outperformed equities in at
least one quarter or longer. David Gulley,

FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: A different revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILLMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current debate in the Conservative party about the legacy of
Thatcherism - reflected in the columns of Joe Rogaly and Samuel Brittan and
in the letter from Amstrad's Alan Sugar (March 19) - misses the point that
fundamental economic and social change has come about because of the
technological revolution we have experienced over the past 15 years, not the
Thatcherite revolution, which is a pale imitation of it.
The provision of wider choice has been made possible by the redistribution
of both control and information systems provided by microtechnology away
from central command points to city dealing rooms, car production plants,
supermarket checkouts and building society offices, or, indeed, to doctors'
surgeries, hospitals and schools.
Thatcherism aided this process by destroying the old institutional framework
which would have put a brake on the implementation of the new microcomputer
technology - neatly encapsulated by the Wapping dispute. But as soon as
Thatcherism became in itself a brake on the process, through its inability
to organise investment in human capital and infrastructure, it too had to
go.
The inability of free market institutions to deliver this essential
prerequisite of the information age has now been recognised by all parties,
although as yet only fitfully and partially by the new model Conservatism.
John Smith's alternative budget - which so enraged Samuel Brittan - has
neatly teased out the constricting self-interest of much of the City and
business community. The majority no longer believes that what is good for
Stanley Kalms, and his 'promise' of an investment freeze by Dixons if Labour
is elected - or Alan Sugar, bemoaning his miserly Pounds 170,000 salary - is
necessarily good for the country as a whole.
Amstrad may have done well by packaging and marketing essentially foreign
technology and Dixons by selling it, but in the meanwhile genuinely
innovative companies such as ICL, Apricot, Acorn and Inmos have all had to
find foreign owners to survive.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: ICI breaks waste ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVE COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sure that ICI will be delighted to learn that its hazardous waste
generation has fallen to 475.9 tonnes world-wide in 1991 ('ICI emissions
were cut by 3.7% last year', March 18). Unfortunately, your report is a
factor of 1,000 too small. ICI has still achieved a 30 per cent reduction in
hazardous waste generation, but from 677,900 to 475,900 tonnes. Similarly,
off-site disposal of hazardous waste to landfill dropped from 160,100 tonnes
to 151,300 tonnes, and so on.
It is with some interest that I wait to see how other UK chemical companies
and manufacturers respond to this 'breaking of ranks' by ICI. The view that
such information is either impossible to collate, or is commercially
sensitive, has effectively been put to rest by the efforts of ICI group
environmental adviser, John Coleman, and his team.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Tough line on convergence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1992 is only a quarter gone; but already the Italian budget deficit is
expected, as usual, to overshoot its target. This is not the only
unfortunate Italian tradition that will be continued this year. Next
Sunday's general election is expected to produce yet another weak,
multi-party coalition government, unable to take tough measures to cut
spending and raise taxes. Italy looks less likely than ever to be able to
meet the convergence criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty, and qualify
on that basis to join a European monetary union.
Unless, that is, the convergence criteria are weakened. The potential for
such a fudge exists. The convergence rules for inflation and long bond
interest rates are relatively straightforward and should pose few problems
for most potential members. But the more important rules concerning
government deficits and debts are much more vaguely specified.
The treaty appears, at first sight, to prohibit from membership any country
with a deficit greater than 3 per cent of gross domestic product or
outstanding gross public debt above 60 per cent of GDP. If applied to the
letter, these rules would keep Belgium, Ireland, Greece, Italy, and probably
the Netherlands out of Emu for the rest of the decade. But these ceilings
can be waived if a country's deficit is deemed to be 'only exceptional and
temporary' or if the debt stock is approaching 60 per cent of GDP 'at a
satisfactory pace.'
'Excessive deficits'
The European Commission, responsible for policing these 'excessive
deficits', is likely to interpret the fiscal rules in a relatively soft way.
The 60 per cent debt ceiling has effectively been dropped - Commission
officials argue that it was only ever intended to be a 'a directional
criterion'. Thus the fiscal convergence plan drawn up between the EC and the
Italian government is intended to reduce the Italian budget deficit to 3 per
cent of GDP by 1996. That would produce a primary budget surplus, excluding
interest payments, well above the 2 per cent needed to stabilise the debt
stock, but the stock of outstanding government debt would still far exceed
the Maastricht debt rule. Slow economic growth might also produce a
'temporarily' excessive deficit. Italy would then apply to join Emu while
strictly failing both fiscal rules.
The Maastricht Treaty was, of course, always intended to be interpreted by
politicians and economists rather than statisticians. A rigid numerical
application of the convergence criteria would make little economic sense. It
might seem strange to require countries to reduce their inflation or nominal
interest rates to best European levels before they are allowed to join a
monetary union the aim of which it to force inflation convergence. And there
is no compelling economic logic behind the precise deficit or debt ceilings.
Profligate countries
Yet heavily indebted governments with unsustainable budget deficits or high
inflation should be prevented from joining. There is no reason why the rest
of Europe should bear part of the cost of their profligacy. The fiscal rules
are also politically important. Only a high, if arbitrary, hurdle over which
presently profligate countries must jump will reassure the rest of Europe,
and Germany in particular, that these countries will not be allowed to
destabilise Emu. In Italy, the fiscal rules are also needed to force the
institutional reforms required to bring the budget under control.
Italy's constitution is not up to the task. Last year the deficit overshot
its original budget projection by 16 per cent. For 1992, the finance
ministry already expects an overshoot of 25 per cent. Even to jump the
fiscal deficit hurdle by 1996, a reduction equivalent to 7 percentage points
of GDP, will require tougher choices than its politicians are currently able
to make: to cut public spending, reduce industrial subsidies or embark on an
ambitious privatisation programme.
Without some form of constitutional reform, Italy's budgetary impasse will
remain. The stick of the convergence criteria and the carrot of Emu together
may provide the necessary incentive for reform. It is not in Italy's
interests for it to be offered a soft option. Attempting to provide one
would risk breaking the already shaky political consensus on which the
success of Emu depends.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A very American recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND good month of consumer spending growth in the US, which reflects
rising consumer confidence, gives some ground at last for believing the US
recovery is here to stay. But even now, six months into the uptrend, there
are grounds for caution. Consumer spending will almost certainly weaken this
month, due to vile weather, and real disposable income is only one per cent
up on the last full year. The housing market continues a vigorous bounce
back from a very deep slump, but other sectors remain weak - commercial
building, defence, and recently exports, the main driving force in the
recovery, until recession began to depress overseas demand.
Modified rapture, then. With one voice, the governors of the Federal Reserve
have said that they expect future progress to be sluggish, and hinted that
they are still alert to the possible need for further stimulus. There is
still little sign of employment growth, which may be needed to sustain
confidence; but inflation remains as subdued as ever, allowing the
authorities some room for manoeuvre. In short, this is still, up to this
point, a weak recovery by normal US standards, and certainly well short of
the vigour which the president longs to see - hence the administration's
renewed calls for further interest rate cuts.
Cautious view
However, this could well prove too cautious a view, reflecting only an
over-correction by forecasters. The revised fourth quarter GDP figures
contain the explanation: a considerable and no doubt unwanted build-up in
wholesale and retail inventories. In other words, and not for the first
time, the distributive trades jumped the gun on a forecast of recovery. As
these stocks are cleared, demand should feed through more rapidly to output.
The important feature of the employment figures is not that they still show
no growth, as the pessimists have stressed, but that they have stopped
getting worse. The fear of unemployment - the biggest brake on spending - is
fading in most parts of the US. The south is already enjoying a much more
vigorous upturn. And there are good reasons to hope that as the usual
cyclical recoveries in consumer durables and investment gather force, this
will be at least within the range of normal cyclical recoveries, which
suggests a real growth rate of at least 3 1/2 per cent.
Even if this is too optimistic, the present US outlook, as seen from Berlin
or Tokyo, and above all from London, looks enviable. America's trade
partners may be hoping that the traditional locomotive of world growth is
once again getting up steam, but it is far too early to call this hope
realistic. The structure of demand in the recovery, led by housing,
household durables and cars, will have its main initial impact on US
domestic industry, as soon as still excessive inventories are cleared, and
on its geographically nearest partners - Canadian lumber, and the branch
factories growing so rapidly in Latin America.
Weak dollar
Above all, the continued gross under-valuation of the dollar will make it
difficult for exporters from Europe or Japan to get much benefit from rising
US demand. The European motor industry, for example, had suffered heavy
losses in market share before the recession. In some capital-intensive
industries, such as pulp and paper, recovery may even make the competitive
position still worse, as rising output lowers US unit costs.
Indeed, the thinking which relies on US recovery to trigger growth in the
rest of the world is dangerously out of date. It looks back to two
misleading precedents - the Bretton Woods world of nearly fixed exchange
rates, and the Reagan episode of heroic fiscal stimulus, which made the US
the world's largest capital importer. The best precedent for the present
conjuncture is neither of these, but the era of competitive devaluations in
the 1930s. Japan is facing the consequences of a deliberate domestic
disinflation, while Europe has collectively decided against following the US
example of monetary stimulus in a free float - and would be joining in a
zero-sum game if it tried. A US recovery is much better news than a US
recession, but does not alter the fact that America's trade partners must
work out their own salvation.

<TEXT>
Richard's Cork Leg is Brendan Behan's last play, left unfinished at the time
of his death in 1964. It was left to his friend, the Dublin director Alan
Simpson, to make sense of the play's missing ending from the numerous wordy
and rambling drafts the author left behind, and it is surprising how well
this endearing short satire has weathered since it was premiered in the
early seventies. At the time it caused a good deal of controversy in Behan's
native Ireland, where his work was often banned, being denounced by the
Irish clergy as blasphemous.
The play is set for the most part in a Dublin cemetery - 'one of the
healthiest graveyards in Ireland' - used as a regular gathering place for a
company of off-beat castaways: colourful tarts, phoney blind men, zealous
Protestants and Irish revolutionaries and fascists. There isn't much of a
plot to speak of but rather a college of characters given the opportunity to
air their views on love, religion, politics and death.
The fast dialogue of witty non sequiturs and whimsical comments on the state
of humanity is occasionaly interspersed with bursts of songs of bawdy
humour. Merriment and reflection are the hallmarks of the evening, but in
the background death beckons in the shape of a large coffin placed
centre-stage.
Behan's anarchic world springs to life with energy and verve if little
polish, but in a way this lack of discipline goes hand in hand with the
author's own ungovernable chatter. Julia Hallawell and Paula Hughes are most
engaging as the two mini-skirted and bejewelled prostitutes who protest
against Mrs Mallarkey's report of 'free love' sweeping the island and
threatening their trade.
The central character of Cronin, probably the author himself, is played with
comic tenderness by Anthony Kernan. The scene in which he competes for the
favours of Denise Kean's prim Deirdre is truly touching as she becomes both
a reluctant and a willing object of his attentions. Maxine O'Reilly is the
spoil-sport Mallarkey who strongly disapproves of her daughter's association
with the married Cronin.
Directed sympathetically by Iain Charles Hake, who has left out some of
Behan's rowdy songs, this is an evening of spontaneous laughter, a a welcome
revival of a rarely performed play.

<TEXT>
Sergey Leiferkus, an outstanding artist on the concert platform no less than
on the operatic stage, seems in peak form just now. On Thursday at the
Purcell Room, in the latest instalment of the hall's current song-recital
series, he gave a spellbinding demonstration of his powers.
He imposes a recitalist's cultivated authority on every song; the bounds of
the medium are adhered to with faultless skill and taste, with complete
avoidance of the overblown rhetoric that inevitably betrays an
opera-baritone out of his element. Yet into the current of his performances
the listener is drawn by an irresistible pull of dramatic magnetism.
By means of physical and vocal demeanour exactly judged and allied,
Leiferkus compels attention in a way given to very few of his
contemporaries. This was particularly evident in Thursday's concert. The
programme mixed lesser-known Borodin, Dargomyzhsky, Glinka and Kabalevsky
songs, with only a few Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky favourites as encores; the
hall, even with its new coloured prints and potted palms, remains a
miserable place for song recitals.
The dangers of worthy dullness were all too apparent. Instead, one hung on
every note and word. Simply as an example of a mastersinger's art, the
occasion was continually remarkable - the dynamic range wide, the
phrase-shaping supple, the attack sharp-pointed, a dark brilliance in the
top register giving a special punch to climaxes.
The second-half selection of seven Kabalevsky settings (in Russian
translation) of Shakespeare sonnets seemed in themselves musically mild,
Rakhmaninov-and-water stuff; yet so broad and subtly varied were the
performances (in which the pianist, Semyon Skigin, played a vividly
communicative part in spite of occasional finger-flusters), that a truly
Shakespearean dimension was suggested after all.
*
To the same hall on Tuesday the Hungarian clarinettist Kalman Berkes brought
a no less compelling artistic magnetism. He is the leading light of the
Budapest Wind Ensemble, but here, with the pianist Piers Lane in excellent
form, he showed himself a soloist of virtuoso technique and bold
personality.
In Schumann, Saint-Saens and Rossini, the delivery was light-years removed
from the well-groomed, low-key musicianship characteristic of British
clarinet-players: Mr Berkes made a lean sound, sometimes fiercely (but never
unpleasantly) sharp-edged, and cut his phrases with piquant wit. He shared
the recital, and Mr Lane's piano-partnership, with Ani Schnarch, a young
Romanian violinist with a thrillingly uninhibited approach to Bartok's First
Violin Rhapsody and Second Sonata: pungent, fiery, securely controlled.
*****
The Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and its music director of 15 years
standing, Kazimierz Kord, paid a visit to Barbican Hall on Thursday night,
and the first of their three items - the Polish one - was much their best
performance. Lutoslawski's Trauermusik for string orchestra of 1958, four
concise movements in a continuous mourning sequence, leans heavily on Bartok
and to my ears has a Brittenish feel also, but is clearly moving towards the
more stringent dissonances and the sonorous freedoms of Lutoslawski's mature
voice, and in this intent, sharply focused account came over as a work of
masterful musicianship.
Its sombre tone-colours - greys, blacks, dark browns - promised a satisfying
contrast to Ravel's G major piano concerto immediately following; but the
firework brilliance associated with this music was not forthcoming. Ewa
Poblocka was a soloist of almost spinsterish reluctance and reserve. Her
delicacy and gentleness of approach readily became deadness and gentility;
she lingered so long over the slow stretches of the Allegro first movement
that the real slow movement had little to offer; and she played the latter's
long opening solo with a disarmingly white and lifeless elegance. Of the
concerto's sauciness, blowsiness and jazzy fun we heard next to nothing,
whether from soloist or orchestra.
The brass department had its problems in the first movement, but one would
not have minded fluffs if there had otherwise been flair. In Strauss's great
orchestral showpiece of a tone poem Ein Heldenleben the lack of this
quality, of vibrant individual stylishness from the section-leaders and a
proud collective virtuosity, was fatal. Ewa Marczyk's violin obbligato, it
is true, was perfectly decent, but scant instrumental panache was available
elsewhere; while the immensely sustained climactic tutti of Part 4 was
stodgy and indifferent (the hall's acoustics only partly to blame). The
performance needed a far greater variety and far higher definition of
colour. Instead of dazzling, it sounded routine, and a routine showpiece
makes no sense at all.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Management: Giving credit where it is due / A look at how a
group of retailers are fighting fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much use can a tiny organisation with no technology, a staff of two and
a budget of only Pounds 85,000 a year, be to retailers and financial
institutions in the fight against fraud?
Set against the efforts of Kenneth Baker, Britain's Home Secretary, to
persuade the clearing banks and building societies to put up tens of
millions of pounds to combat fraud, Cifas - the name stands for Credit
Industry Fraud Avoidance System - looks puny.
The system is the brainchild of a group of retailers and others in the
credit lending business who wanted cost-effective ways to beat fraud.
Most anti-fraud measures rely on expensive technology inside organisations.
But as John McCullough, manager of Sears Card says: 'We realised that
companies in the credit business could fight fraud by copying retail traders
and exchanging information directly between themselves.'
The founders also realised that the most effective way for lenders to fight
fraud was to nip it in the bud by spotting fraudsters when they make
applications for credit.
That is easiest done by tapping information about past frauds.
If a credit organisation believes that an applicant has filed false
information or impersonated someone, it sends the information to all UK four
credit reference agencies - CCN, Equifax, Infolink, and CDMS.
Last year, 9,427 fraudulent applications were filed with the credit
reference agencies. When the same address comes up in a subsequent
application, Cifas members are alerted.
The Cifas members must then apply to the organisation which issued the
warning and check the facts. There were checks on about 85 per cent of the
fraudulent credit applications listed on Cifas last year. What sort of
applications generate warnings?
Cifas records five categories of suspicious information.
A false name at a true address.
Impersonation.
The successful use of false data to secure credit, like giving an inflated
income.
The attempted use of false data where credit was not given.
The sale of goods like motor vehicles still covered by hire purchase
agreements.
'Everyone at Cifas would like to see the police take fraudulent applications
more seriously,' says Peter Hurst, credit policy manager at Barclaycard,
Cifas' largest member.
'Some police forces argue that because no money was lost, there is no reason
why they should investigate it. Others take it very seriously indeed, but
there is no national policy among the police.'
About one third of frauds are impersonations and protecting the innocent is
an important concern. 'The worst that can happen to an innocent party is
that their address is on the data base.' says Ken Cherrett, Cifas chairman.
In practice, people who have been the victims of impersonation may find that
they have to spend slightly longer proving their identity when applying for
credit.
Some lenders, notably Barclaycard, write and tell customers when their names
have been used for an impersonation.
Cherrett says that Cifas has demonstrated that a great deal can be achieved
very easily by co-operation between retailers to fight fraud.
The scheme's original members were mostly retailers and smaller credit
institutions, but its 72 members now include all but one of the big high
street banks.
How effective is it? Barclaycard believes that Cifas membership saves it
about Pounds 3m a year in losses from fraud - 1,000 times its annual
subscription of Pounds 3,000 to the organisation, although members also have
to include the day-to-day cost of participating in the scheme by filing
information to the credit reference agencies.

Larry Carleton, a 28-year veteran of the US cable television industry, has
been drafted in to be chief operating officer of the large UK cable joint
venture between TCI and US West.
Until a few days ago, Carleton was presiding over the US operations of the
Denver-based TCI - Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable operator in
the world.
Now he will be running a joint venture with stakes in cable franchises
covering 2.9m homes - equivalent to full ownership of 1.8m, or 12 per cent
of all British homes in cable franchise areas.
'We don't like to leave anything to chance,' says Jim Dovey, managing
director and chief executive of the joint venture, referring to the senior
level of the appointment.
Although the venture does not yet have a name, it could turn out to be the
most powerful grouping in the UK cable industry since it brings together TCI
and US West, one of the large regional telephone companies in the US.
The joint venture holds interests in cable operations with a total of 90,000
cable subscribers. In addition more than 20,000 homes and 5,700 businesses
subscribe to a telephone service.

API, the packaging group beset last year by management changes and a hostile
bid, has found a new chief executive in Mike Smith who joins from Irish
packaging multinational Jefferson Smurfit.
'This is a great recovery opportunity' says chairman Moger Woolley, who took
up his assignment at the beginning of last month. Eric Holroyd, a former
director of Bowater Packaging and a friend of Woolley's since the latter was
chief executive of DRG, has been acting chief executive since last year.
Smith, 45, is chief executive of the print, packaging and converting
division of Jefferson Smurfit. While that is a bigger business than API,
Smith is English and may have felt the top job at API offers greater scope
than staying with Smurfit.
'While the products are different, some of the end customers are the same.
Smith knows his way around the marketplace ' says Woolley.
API last year fought off a bid by NMC which surfaced when the previous
senior management resigned last March.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Management: Power to the people - Changing corporate culture
/ Christopher Lorenz explains the new fashion for shifting authority down
the organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gather together any group of managers, shop floor workers, or frontline
service employees. Plant the concept of 'empowerment' and stand well back.
Wait for a burst of enthusiasm, followed by clouds of confusion.
The principle of empowerment underpins almost every one of the thousands of
corporate 'culture change' programmes now underway in Europe and America. In
simple terms, its meaning seems obvious enough: freeing employees from
instructions and controls, and allowing them to take decisions themselves.
Hence the initial keenness which it engenders.
Such freeing of employees is, some consultants and academics argue, becoming
not just advisable but mandatory in the face of at least three sets of
pressures:
to make organisations more responsive, more quickly, to the market place;
to 'delayer' organisations in order to make them much more cost-effective;
and to get employees of various disciplines to collaborate together with
minimal supervision, by communicating horizontally, rather than vertically
up and down the hierarchy.
As a result, companies all over the western world are abandoning the old
principle that a 'span of control' of between five and 15 people is the most
anyone can manage effectively; many managers used to argue that as few as
eight was the maximum.
Instead, they are installing what Peter Drucker, the doyen of management
pundits, calls 'spans of empowerment' of well above 20, in which the
manager's role shifts from controller to coach, or mentor.
But what does this do to the authority of the manager, whether at senior or
(especially) middle levels? And does it necessarily create what Tom Peters,
Drucker's fellow guru, has called 'purposeful chaos' - a notion which some
managers find downright threatening?
The ambiguity that managers feel about the concept is exemplified by
research undertaken recently among the top managers of 10 large British
companies by Laurie International, a management consultancy. These leaders
all agreed that empowerment was vital to the improvement of business
efficiency and quality, but they detected worry among their managers 'that
empowerment could open up a Pandora's Box'.
Some of the leaders shared this concern quite openly. They were emphatic
'that empowerment boundaries would have to be set'.
For this group of worried managers, and the thousands of bemused others,
help on some of these issues is at hand. It comes in the form of a plain
person's guide to three issues:
why to empower;
how to empower (the guide suggests three basic options);
and when to empower (depending on the situation).
The guide comes courtesy of two little-known business academics in America,
David Bowen of Arizona State University and Edward Lawler III of the
University of Southern California. It focuses on service organisations, but
most of its advice is applicable to all kinds of enterprises.
Reporting their work in the spring issue of the Sloan Management Review*,
which will be published in mid-April, they illustrate it with examples of
companies which embraced empowerment in a big way, such as Federal Express
and Club Mediterranee.
But they also cite competitors which prefer to stick to production line-like
controls and rules, such as United Parcel Service (UPS) and Disney - as well
as McDonald's, American Airlines and Delta.
Rather than adopting an either-or approach to empowerment versus control,
the academics point to three optional courses of action, two of which
combine both of them. The degree of empowerment increases as additional
knowledge, information, power and rewards are pushed down the organisation.
SUGGESTION INVOLVEMENT
This is only a small step away from control - indeed, critics would argue
that this option does not warrant the label 'empowerment' at all. Employees
are encouraged to contribute ideas, but their day-to-day work activities do
not really change.
Also, they are not empowered to implement, only to recommend. McDonald's
follows this approach: its Big Mac and Egg McMuffin dishes were both
apparently invented by employees, as was a system of wrapping burgers that
avoids leaving a thumbprint on the bun.
JOB INVOLVEMENT
A significant departure, this involves extensive job redesign so that
employees use a variety of skills, often in teams. They have considerable
freedom in deciding how to do the necessary work. Supervisors need to be
reorientated towards supporting the front line or shop floor, rather than
directing it.
Despite the heightened level of empowerment that it brings, the job
involvement approach does not change higher-level strategic decisions about
organisation structure, power and the allocation of rewards. These remain
the responsibility of senior management.
HIGH INVOLVEMENT
Here, employees become involved not just in how to do their jobs, or how
effectively their team performs, but also in the whole organisation's
performance. Virtually every aspect of the organisation is different from
that of a control-orientated one. Information on business performance is
shared. Employees develop extensive skills in teamwork, problem solving, and
business operations.
They participate in work-unit management decisions. There is profit-sharing
and employee-ownership.
High involvement organisational designs may be expensive to implement, warn
Bowen and Lawler. Perhaps most troublesome is that these management
techniques are relatively undeveloped and untested.
People Express tried to operate as a high involvement airline, and the
constant struggle to learn and develop this organisational design
contributed to its severe operating problems.
Both empowerment and the production line approach have their advantages, and
each fits certain situations, the academics emphasise. They suggest five
'contingencies' that determine which approach to adopt.
The five are
Type of business strategy (low cost, high volume versus differentiation
through personal service and customisation).
Type of relationship with customer (degree of one-off, short-term versus
extended relationship).
Type of technology (degree of simple and routine versus complex and
non-routine).
Business environment (degree of predictability versus surprise).
Degree to which people in the organisation (managers and other employees)
are control versus empowerment-minded.
Exemplifying these different situations, Bowen and Lawler say that customers
in some situations prefer to be served by an employee who is not friendly
and empowered, but just ultra-fast.
Not all employees want more autonomy, challenge and responsibility at work,
Bowen and Lawler emphasise.
Nor are all employees (including managers) suited to the teamwork that
empowerment generally involves.
Surprisingly, perhaps, research in the US suggests that service companies
tend to use significantly fewer employee involvement practices than do
manufacturing companies.
This may be partly because it can be easier in manufacturing than in service
to see the pay-offs from different management practices, say Bowen and
Lawler. But these differences are now blurring as service competition
increases and service companies become more sophisticated in tracking the
benefits of customer service quality.
Bowen and Lawler conclude with the common-sense adage that before any
company rushes into empowerment programmes, it should determine whether and
how empowerment actually fits its situation.
This may be pure common sense, but it is all too often forgotten in the rush
to create a 'new culture.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Protecting the Dorset coastline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RENDEL GEOTECHNICS, part of the High-Point Group, is preparing a detailed
design for a scheme to protect part of the town of Lyme Regis in Dorset from
coastal erosion and wave attack and improve the town's antiquated sewerage
and sewage treatment system.
The scheme will incorporate 1,500 cu metres of storm water sewage storage
tanks, a tunnel beneath part of the town, a pumping station within the new
sea wall and inland pipelines as part of a major restructuring of the town's
sewerage system.
Work on the new sea wall, stretching from Cobb Gate along Gun Cliff, where
the existing 18th century walls are listed structures, to Church Cliff, is
expected to start in September.
The scheme is being prepared for West Dorset District Council and South West
Water and a prequalification exercise, which is currently underway, will
produce a shortlist of six contractors.
A grant for the coastal protection part of the scheme is being sought from
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
The new sea wall will be reinforced concrete with natural rock facing to
conform with the designation of the town as a part of an area of outstanding
natural beauty. It will be protected by 15,000 tonnes of rock armour.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Sewerage scheme in Cornwall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies within the TRAFALGAR HOUSE group have won the design and construct
Penzance and St Ives sewerage and sewage treatment works scheme. Valued in
the region of Pounds 60m the contract has been placed by South West Water
Services as part of its 'Clean Sweep' programme and involves the
installation of a treatment process which is believed to be the first of its
kind in the UK.
The work will be handled by a consortium of Trafalgar House Construction
(Major Projects) and John Brown Engineering. Acer Consultants are the
consulting engineers responsible for the civil, structural, hydraulic and
marine design work.
The contract is for the design, supply, construction and commissioning of
the scheme which involves diverting outfalls in the Penzance area and
redirecting the sewage to improved facilities at Hayle sewage treatment
works, prior to discharge through a new outfall as treated effluent.
This calls for the installation of 25km of pipelines ranging in diameter
from 150mm to 2,100mm; together with up to seven pumping stations of varying
capacity depending on the catchment area.
Proposals include a long sea outfall of 2.7km and a storm overflow outfall
of 1.6km.
The existing sewers in the Penzance area will be intercepted and the
resulting flows will be pumped via pumping stations at Penlee Beach,
Wherrytown, Battery Rocks, Chyandour, Marazion Bridge, Sailing Club, and
Crowlas to the Hayle sewage treatment works. After treatment the effluent
will be discharged through the 2.7km long outfall near Gwithian.
Work will start shortly on the 154-week project.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Hopes for ship data recorder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROADGATE, the Bristol-based electronics subsidiary of P&amp;O which has
developed a 'black box' for ships, expects voyage data recording equipment
to be made compulsory by the International Maritime Organisation within two
years.
Mr Chris Winkley, managing director of Broadgate, denied that the Voyage
Event Recorder (VER) was not technically advanced enough to be widely
adopted in the shipping industry.
Although the industry seemed more preoccupied with stress-and-strain
monitoring of ships, the recorder would prove invaluable to marine accident
investigators and shipping companies in helping to identify the cause of
incidents on voyages, Mr Winkley said.
The recorder, which costs about Pounds 55,000, provides a continuously
updated record of the last 24 hours of a voyage.
It is designed to monitor sound on the bridge and in the wheelhouse and
engine control room, and to record the course and speed of the ship and
information from two radar channels.
The recorder contains a beacon which can be picked up by satellite or
air-sea rescue, helping to pinpoint a vessel's last position.
The recorder was developed at P&amp;O's request from an aircraft flight data
recorder. It has been in use on 10 P&amp;O vessels including a cruise ship,
cross-Channel ferries, a bulk carrier and a container ship for the past
year.
Mr Winkley said no other shipping company had bought the equipment, but
several companies had expressed an interest in the recorder, including a
Scandinavian ferry operator.
The International Chamber of Shipping, an offshoot of the General Council of
British Shipping, said it was unlikely that such recorders would be widely
used until the technology was more sophisticated, and there was
international agreement on the information to be monitored.
