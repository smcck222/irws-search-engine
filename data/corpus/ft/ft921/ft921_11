FT  13 MAR 92 / Siemens chief sees no end to downturn

<TEXT>
MR KARLHEINZ KASKE, chief executive of Siemens, yesterday warned that a
speedy end to the worldwide economic slowdown was not in sight.
Turnover of the German electrical and electronics group rose 9 per cent to
DM23bn (Dollars 14bn) in the first four months. However, he told the annual
meeting: 'We should not pitch our expectations too high. The economic
climate has become much rougher in the last few weeks and months.'
Mr Kaske said new order inflow dropped 1 per cent to DM28bn in the first
four months ended January. Foreign orders were 3 per cent lower than the
previous year, with a 6 per cent decline in export contracts from Germany.
Domestic orders, however, rose 2 per cent. For the full year, he expected
total orders to be at least DM85bn, only around 4 per cent higher against
last year's 21 per cent.
He said hopes had not been fulfilled that the recession-hit economies of
North America and western Europe would recover before those of Japan and
Germany started slipping. There were also doubts over political development
in eastern Europe. 'This must have a particular impact on Germany,' he said.
Siemens had already noticed a slowdown in demand in Germany, he said. This
was evident in heavy plant business now that the order thrust from east
Germany appeared past its peak.
Mr Kaske, who will be succeeded in October by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, said
net profits - up 7 per cent last year to DM1.8bn - had risen this year at
the same pace as turnover.
One burden on group profits is Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, formed
by merging lossmaking Nixdorf with its own computer operation. Mr Kaske said
SNI hoped to save DM600m a year by shedding staff and cutting production
costs.
At the Cebit electronics fair, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, SNI chief executive,
said the company hoped to halve its losses this year but this would depend
on turnover.
SNI lost DM781m in the year to September 30, 1991, with turnover down 2 per
cent to DM12.1bn. In the first five months of 1991-92, turnover was up 23
per cent to DM4.8bn and the order inflow by 13 per cent to DM4.7bn.
Mr Wiedig said domestic business was as expected, but orders from abroad had
been lower. Restructuring costs would be less than the last year's DM470m.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Legal and General falls to Pounds 11.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL and General, the life assurance and financial services group,
yesterday reported a sharp drop in pre-tax profits in 1991 to Pounds 11.3m,
and said it would have recorded a significant loss without an unusual
accounting transaction that added Pounds 81.5m in exceptional profits.
In 1990, Legal and General had profits of Pounds 68.6m. The transfer of the
group's Unit Assurance and Unit Pensions Companies to the Society's Life
Fund allowed the company to post an exceptional profit by recording the
previously unrealised value of the subsidiaries.
Legal and General has also reduced the exposure of its shareholder funds -
upon which solvency margins are based - to UK equities. A Pounds 130m
holding has been cut to Pounds 100m over the past two months and the company
has purchased a put option on 25 per cent of the remaining exposure. Mr
David Rough, head of investments, said that the put expired in June and was
intended to shield the funds against possible volatility in the stock
markets following the UK election in April.
Meanwhile, Legal and General raised its final dividend of 12.6p for a total
1991 payout of 18.8p - a 5 per cent rise on 1990. Mr David Prosser, group
chief executive, said the dividend rise reflected the company's confidence
in the future of its core life and pensions business.
Profits in that sector rose modestly last year to Pounds 126m from Pounds
122m but general insurance recorded losses of Pounds 176m, compared with a
loss of Pounds 52m the year before.
Mr Prosser said general insurance would continue to lose money this year.
'We expect to see reduced losses in 1992 but still losses, I'm afraid,' he
said. He added that the company was reviewing its future in general
insurance. 'We don't want to be in general insurance if it is not going to
be profitable.'
In general insurance, reserves for losses on mortgage indemnity were raised
by Pounds 97m, with funds set aside for 90 per cent of properties in
repossession and 50 per cent of those with serious arrears.
Analysts said the reserve provisions were more prudent than those of most of
the company's competitors.
Legal and General also said it had been hit by Pounds 50m in subsidence
claims in 1991.
Earnings per share were 6.81p, compared with 12.07p.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Green light for UK gas suppliers: Deborah Hargreaves reports
on the ending of British Gas's monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1bn a year UK gas market has been opened up for independent
suppliers this week with British Gas's agreement to reduce its share of
industrial and commercial customers from a virtual monopoly to 40 per cent
by 1995.
Pressed by the government, British Gas also agreed to run its pipelines as
an arm's length business serving it and other suppliers on equal terms.
The two changes, together with the prospect of independent suppliers serving
retail customers later in the decade, will mark the end of British Gas's
virtual monopoly over UK gas supplies.
This was particularly welcome news for the small number of independent gas
suppliers who now see scope to expand their business. 'We welcome the
proposal to release gas to new suppliers,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing
director of Kinetica, a gas company jointly owned by North Sea producer,
Conoco, and electricity generator, PowerGen. 'But we hope we will be
consulted about the mechanisms of the new arrangements to avoid
disruptions.'
So far, only nine companies supplying 1,900 customers compete against
British Gas. They account for a fraction of the industrial market which
itself is one-third of the total UK gas market. But the government is keen
to encourage smaller, entrepreneurial gas marketing companies to become
active in the market to forge links between a wider range of customers and a
source of supply.
The choice of supplier is a luxury so far enjoyed only by large business
users, but soon small companies will benefit when the government lowers the
consumption threshold for companies to choose an alternative supply.
Large energy users have generally welcomed having a choice of supplier. 'We
are keen to talk to companies that can provide us with one overall price for
gas - the British Gas price schedules are extremely complex,' said one
energy buyer.
Rivals to British Gas have, in the five years since its privatisation, come
from the large oil companies which produce gas in the North Sea. 'The
independents are really gas traders which can balance supply and demand,
making supply available when customers want it by negotiating with producers
and arranging a transport contract,' explains Mr Alan Marshall, managing
director of Agas, a UK independent wholesaler. His company is concentrating
on supply to large industrial sites.
But taking on British Gas will be no easy feat. Some of the independents
have found partners among regional electricity companies eager to diversify
since they were privatised. Seeboard, the supplier to the south-east of
England, recently became the latest of four electricity companies to
announce the formation of a gas supply subsidiary.
The electricity companies are preparing to move into the domestic market
when that opens up. Household customers could then choose a joint gas and
electricity supplier with the cost of both fuels covered on one bill.
United Gas, an independent gas sales company, has teamed up with the
electricity companies to move into the smaller end of the market. 'We looked
at the market and saw there was no point in supplying large users because we
just couldn't compete with British Gas on price,' said Mr Peter Bryant,
deputy chairman. 'But we saw the opportunity for suppliers to medium-sized
customers, and eventually households.'
Midlands Gas, in which United has a 25 per cent stake, was the first
electricity venture pioneered by Mr Bryant. The company has a contract to
provide the fledgling supplier with 36m therms of gas for its first year of
operation.
According to Mr Roger Gill, managing director of Midlands Gas, the company
has 420 customers and will soon sell all its gas allocation for the first
year.
Mr Bryant also wants to develop new forms of energy contracts for the UK
market and be actively involved in building up short-term sales. No
short-term market exists in the UK, but increasing competition could lead to
the sale of some gas on a monthly basis as in the US.
United has experience of the US market as it is an offshoot of Utilicorp,
the second-largest gas marketing company in the US. Utilicorp buys reserves
and sells them on to customers at a small, fixed premium.
Kinetica is looking beyond pure gas supply. The company has grown into one
of British Gas's largest rivals and supplies more than 900 sites. Mr Norman
Ellis, managing director, says: 'We've always believed that just being a
trader has its limitations. A lot of British Gas's strength comes from
owning its own infrastructure such as gas pipelines.'
The company has secured the first contracts to build independently owned
pipelines in the UK to supply two power stations.
British Gas owns the transmission grid, but must hive this off into a
separate subsidiary, a move the government hopes will convince competitors
the company's transit tariffs are fair.
British Gas is obliged to give rivals access to its pipelines, but has been
accused of providing more favourable transport tariffs for its own supplies.
'For a balanced independent company to succeed in what will be a highly
competitive market, I'm convinced it will need its own pipelines,' said Mr
Ellis. 'But getting a foothold in that business has been very, very
difficult.'
The country is unlikely to become criss-crossed by a mass of rival gas
pipelines, however. Once British Gas hives off its pipeline and storage
facilities, competitors will have access to its main pipeline system and the
smaller domestic lines right up to the household meter.
To reach domestic customers, rivals may have to install their own meters.
This is one of a number of criteria being thought through before this sector
is opened.
Mr Bryant believes competition will begin to develop for household users by
the end of the decade. But he stresses the government needs to set some
standards for entry into the market to ensure that rival suppliers are not
likely to run out of supply and cut off domestic users.

The decision by the trade and industry secretary to reopen the Blue Arrow
inquiry is an astonishing condemnation of the UK system of regulation. One
departmental inquiry and subsequent trial have already cost the taxpayer
nearly Pounds 40m. Now, suddenly, more money is to be spent examining
allegations made in court last summer and subsequently widely reported in
the press.
It is a mystery that the government should have delayed so long initiating
an investigation into facts which should have been fully established in the
original inquiry. But it is equally perplexing that National Westminster
waited until the allegations were revived by The Economist before seeking an
inquiry. The position of Mr Tom Frost, National Westminster chief executive,
is unenviable. He utterly rejects the suggestion which emerged in last
year's court proceedings that he was involved in the cover-up. Now he faces
a long wait to have his name cleared. Perhaps, however, in view of the
continuing embarrassment to the bank, it would still be better for him to
stand down until that process is complete.

<TEXT>
Another food manufacturer, another dividend safely in the bag. Yesterday's 8
per cent increase in pre-tax profits from United Biscuits was certainly
better than the market expected from a tough year, the more so because UB
made a novel Pounds 3m provision against US healthcare liabilities.
By clever marketing, UB made ground in its main businesses, notably at
Terrys where profits defied a collapse in demand for boxed chocolates.
Rationalisation of Ross Young's is almost over, so profits there should
bounce once the frozen food market improves. The group looks set for another
solid, if unspectacular year, an outlook fully reflected by a multiple in
line with the market average.
A footnote to the debate over brand valuations: UB sold Ross Young's
catering wholesale business, in the process writing nearly Pounds 13m off
its balance sheet intangible assets. It bought and valued the brand a mere
four years ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board has come to Legal &amp; General's rescue in the
nick of time. It was, at any rate, ASB deliberations on extraordinary and
exceptional items which justified booking profits above the line from the
transfer of L &amp; G's unit linked business to the group's own life fund. The
happy result: a modest Pounds 11m pre-tax profit last year instead of a
thumping loss. The reshuffle no doubt makes excellent sense; it is worth
bearing in mind, though, that raising the payout 5 per cent might not have
been so easy without it.
Investors have to weigh up L &amp; G's solid asset backing and prospective
income flow against the uncertainties of the trading outlook. There is no
doubt that the company wants to limit its exposure to general insurance,
which lost more in 1991 than year end UK shareholders' funds. But with the
UK life and pensions side apparently struggling to pick up new business, and
the company itself so agnostic about the timing of a general insurance
upturn, the strategy looks a little fragile for the moment. At least
mortgage guarantee losses look to be conservatively provided.
None of this is to say that the shares at 367p are expensive. On the
contrary, the Pounds 200m after tax increase in shareholders' interest in
the life fund suggests that they are trading on a 10-15 per cent discount to
net assets. There is room to quibble with some of the assumptions, but that
looks good value compared with those composites still trading at a premium.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 3 per cent gain in RTZ shares in yesterday's weak market had a logic
which went beyond the immediate impact of its results. With 80 per cent of
its turnover abroad, the company can face UK electoral turmoil with
equanimity. Indeed, if that leads to a weak pound, so much the better for
RTZ's earnings. Its products are mostly denominated in dollars and their
price should in any case start to firm as evidence of US recovery grows.
Strip out the Pounds 74m exceptional depreciation charge for Kennecott's
Utah cooper smelter and 1991 profits were above expectations. The strong
balance sheet means the new Dollars 880m smelter, itself likely to enhance
margins substantially, can be financed with ease.
Still, it would not do to get carried away. The metals markets are
vulnerable to upset by selling from the former Soviet Union. This year will
not see a repeat of the strong contribution from Hamersley ore sales to
Japan where the economy is turning down. RTZ says it will not allow its
surplus ACT problem to upset its progressive dividend policy, but that means
investors may have to live with a lower cover ratio than they have been used
to in the past.

29.1)
The more time investors spend analysing the forthcoming UK election, the
more nervous they seem to become. Hence the renewed fall in UK equities
yesterday, although the low trading volume suggests dealers were also
lowering prices to put off would-be sellers. Perhaps more worrying was
sterling's weakness. The dollar was partly to blame after more evidence of
US recovery, but sellers of the UK currency were pushing against an open
door. In trading after official hours, sterling dropped below DM2.86 and
went through its ERM floor against the peseta.
The latter level will doubtless be quickly regained this morning. But after
yesterday's poor inflation figures in Spain, the authorities there are
unlikely to help by cutting interest rates. The question is where that
leaves the UK government if the downward pressure gathers force.
It would be political suicide to raise interest rates, so the government has
to hope that its commitment to the ERM will be enough to deter speculative
excess. The risks of selling short grow larger and the scope for profit
smaller as the currency moves closer to its absolute floor. But, with
sterling still 8 pfennigs above its lower limit against the D-Mark, there is
some leeway. Depending on reaction to the first batch of opinion polls, the
speculators might have a go anyway.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime ministers of Germany's 16 federal states yesterday demanded a veto
on all future transfer of national powers to multinational institutions as
their price for the ratification of the Maastricht treaties.
The moves by the 16 states amount to the most serious potential stumbling
block to ratification of the EC treaties yet to emerge in a member state.
The prime ministers themselves, whether supporters or opponents of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, made clear after a meeting yesterday
that they were determined to prevent any further erosion of their federal
powers, either to Bonn or to Brussels.
In a unanimous decision taken before top-level talks with Mr Kohl, the 16
Christian Democrat and Social Democrat premiers insisted that the German
constitution should be changed to give them effective powers of veto before
they would approve the treaties on European political and economic union.
They also demanded the right to receive and consider a report on the
fulfilment of all the economic and political preconditions for European
economic and monetary union (Emu), before moving to the creation of a single
European currency. The political preconditions would include further
strengthening of European political union, and the powers of the European
parliament.
The states are proposing an amendment to the German constitution 'as
compensation for the transfer of competences' to the EC, in particular
through the Maastricht treaty, and the related loss of their own powers.
In the article concerning the transfer of any German sovereign powers to
multinational institutions, the amendment would make such a transfer subject
to the 'consent of the Bundesrat', the upper house of the German parliament
representing the 16 states.
The amendment would go on to give the states the right to collaboration in
the formulation of German policy with regard to such institutions
Mr Hans Eichel, the Social Democrat premier of the state of Hesse, said the
premiers had decided not to demand renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty,
which they recognised as virtually impossible in EC political terms, but to
concentrate instead on changing the German constitution to protect their
interests.
He said the states were not trying to acquire an 'opt-out' clause by the
back door, comparable to the British clause included in the EC treaties.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Letter: 'Catch-all' concept of fraud is recipe for long
trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SELLAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Catch-all crime to be avoided' (Justinian, March 9), Mr
Blom-Cooper QC made a very valuable contribution to the debate on the
difficulties of prosecuting allegations of complicated financial fraud. In
particular, he warned of the dangers of the introduction into English Law of
a general and therefore imprecise offence of fraud. Might I make certain
comments on his article, as I have practical experience of Company Law in
Scotland and the City and some experience of Scottish Criminal Law.
The fact that there is a general concept of fraud in Scots criminal law has
not avoided some very long trials and, if a trial involving sophisticated
financial practices occurred in a Scottish Court, that court would face the
same difficulties which the English courts have faced. A further point is
that Section 47(2) of the Financial Services 1986 Act, which applies to both
Scotland and England, already creates a general offence of fraud in relation
to 'investments'.
That provision is potentially wider than the English common law concept of
conspiracy to defraud, which was the basis of the Blue Arrow prosecution.
The provision is particularly unfortunate as it provides an offence of
strict liability (punishable by a maximum of seven years' imprisonment)
where a person engages 'in any course of conduct which creates a false or
misleading impression as to the market in, or price or value of, any
investments'.
Section 47(3) provides that it is for the accused to establish not merely
that he was honest, which would be a defence to a common law charge under
either Scots or English Law, but also that he reasonably believed that his
conduct would not create an impression which was false or misleading. The
use of a concept as vague as that of 'value' to create potentially strict
criminal liability seems in principle quite inappropriate and causes
considerable difficulties to practitioners of Company Law in advising
clients as to what conduct is outside Section 47(2).
It is therefore to be hoped that the appropriate criminal authorities in
both jurisdictions, and in particular the Serious Fraud Office in England,
would in applying Section 47(2) show the discretion to which the Court of
Appeal in Jersey referred in the case discussed by Mr Blom-Cooper.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Letter: UK potato board contests reckoning of chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN A MARKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Readers of David Blackwell's article ('Chips down for UK potato board',
February 27) on the industry should be made aware that, since 1989, imports
of processed potato products have levelled off in spite of three consecutive
dry, low yielding seasons.
Fully 70 per cent of British imports of processed products come from the
Netherlands. We imported 150,500 tonnes of Dutch products in 1991. France
imported 100,800 tonnes and Germany 224,100 tonnes from the Netherlands that
year. As neither Germany nor France have area controls, this suggests
British import levels are not determined by the Potato Marketing Scheme, but
relate to competitive advantages and policies of the Dutch.
The prices of potatoes in the UK do not seem to have the adverse effect on
profitability that you suggest. The Grocer (November 11) compares returns on
capital for food companies in the UK. Nearly all those with substantial
potato interests perform above the food industry average; better than most
other industrial sectors.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Personal View: Time to unmask a pensions charade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP CHAPPELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One good could yet emerge from the Maxwell pension saga; we could re-examine
the whole basis of British pension funds and the choice between final salary
and personal pension schemes. The subject is an issue of public concern; the
ill-defined ownership of pension funds is just one aspect of a wider
problem. At least the plundering would have been more difficult if the
assets had been directly owned by individual members.
Britain is unique in its dedicated belief that a funded final salary
occupational pension is the ideal form of retirement saving: money-purchase
personal pensions, on a defined contribution basis, are seen as the
second-rate alternative. Too few people challenge the mathematics of the
choice.
Final salary schemes are certainly advantageous to long-serving employees
with 40 years' service, and especially to those who are able to ratchet
upwards their salary shortly before retirement. It is even better for those
who require as little as 20 years' back-service to earn full two-thirds
pension entitlement. Such pensions are inevitably expensive to the scheme
and have to be paid for by other members: the apparently innocuous Pounds
50,000 bonus for the chairman just before retirement may cost pension fund
members nearly Pounds 500,000.
The huge majority of the workforce does not serve 40 years with the same
employer and is therefore disadvantaged by final salary schemes. Despite the
efforts to drag fair treatment for transfer values out of a reluctant
pensions industry, there is still an inherent bias against job changers.
The evidence lies in the fact that 6m pensioners today enjoy total
occupational pensions of Pounds 18bn, an average of just Pounds 3,000. That
includes spouses, short-service and adjustments for commutation and
inadequate escalation. But if pensions were providing the two-thirds of
average earnings which is the desirable objective, the average should be
nearer Pounds 10,000.
It is time to study the mathematics behind the financial probabilities of
money-purchase provision.
Looking at the numbers in real terms, and assuming average earnings growth
of 2 per cent and a (generous) multiplier of 12 times for an annuity
purchase, to fund a two-thirds salary after 40 years an individual saver
needs to set aside about 13 per cent of annual earnings at an average
investment return of 4 per cent (currently available on index-linked funds).
The same outcome would be reached with 10 per cent on a 5 per cent return
(achieved over the last 40 years from a broad portfolio) or just 8 per cent
on a 6 per cent return. These numbers are well below the contribution rates
of most final salary schemes; so what is happening to the balance where
combined contribution rates of 15 per cent or more are being paid into such
schemes?
The point is even more valid by using the actual numbers over the past
decade. Over this period, national average earnings grew at about 10 per
cent and the average return on all pension funds at 16 per cent. Such is the
power of compound interest at higher rates that, if invested at 16 per cent,
the personal saver would need to save just 5 per cent of annual earnings to
retire on two-thirds of salary.
This arithmetic demonstrates that the concept of employers' contributions to
meet the needs of the average earner is a charade: what is being used is a
variety of devices to fund early retirements and other cross-subsidies. The
final salary funding basis is demonstrated to be mathematically unsound and
inherently inequitable.
Of course, it is not that simple - and existing funds provide additional
benefits such as life cover; but these are benefits that can be cheaply
purchased separately.
The 1986 Social Security Act gave all employees the right to opt out of an
employer's occupational scheme; but it was fundamentally flawed in pandering
to the final salary brigade. It did not require an employer to provide a
genuine choice by compensating an opting out employee for the fact that the
employer was not contributing to the scheme. The argument is even more
devious since senior managers have a vested interest in ensuring that the
contribution costs for their part of the deal should not openly be inflated
by providing such choice.
The solution is simple: the 1986 act must be amended to ensure that any
employer offering final salary schemes must also offer a matching
contribution to employees who decide not to join the scheme.
On these assumptions, personal pensions are not a second-rate alternative,
but a positive financial advantage to the large majority of the workforce.
Personal pensions provide flexibility, simplicity and comprehensibility -
the tax rules impose no limit on pay-outs, and many pensioners could expect
an actual entitlement in excess of two-thirds final salary.
Money-purchase schemes reduce the concentration of power which is inherent
in the cross-subsidisation of final salary schemes; they also identify
employees far more closely with their contributions. The disadvantages of
their cost structures could be hugely simplified by employers running such
schemes on behalf of their workforce. Critics of the alleged uncertainty of
money-purchase schemes can be reassured, since these schemes provide
flexible retirement dates and can offer investment in more secure assets as
retirement approaches. Powers to choose and rights to own more than Pounds
300bn of assets would be restored to 11m citizens.
Oh, there is one other advantage. Actuaries become less significant; watch
the correspondence columns for their crocodile tears.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Letter: Bank of Italy asserts independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CARLO A CIAMPI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the league table of central bank independence accompanying David
Marsh's article ('The road to Emu develops some potholes', Economics
Notebook, March 9), the Bank of Italy is ranked last among those of nine
leading industrial countries.
A meaningful appraisal of central bank independence requires a thorough
evaluation of the institutional setting and of the bank's modus operandi as
developed over time and consolidated in practice.
It would be interesting to know the criteria on which the Financial Times
ranking was compiled.
As far as the Bank of Italy is concerned, its position in the table does not
appear to reflect the autonomy that it has attained, both de jure and de
facto.
Allow me to single out the following points:
The long standing de facto independence of the Bank of Italy in influencing
market interest rates has been recently ratified by a law which has granted
the bank statutory authority to set the official rates on discounts and
advances; it enjoys complete autonomy for the interventions in both domestic
and foreign exchange markets;
There has been no net financing of the Treasury in the last few years, in
spite of the huge deficit and increasing debt of the public sector (see the
letter to the Financial Times from the Italian minister of the Treasury, Mr
Guido Carli, March 6); moreover, there is a bill before parliament providing
for the elimination of direct access to central bank financing by the
Treasury and public authorities.
The members of the directorate of the banks are appointed for an indefinite
term.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Letter: Redressing the refugee and revenue balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr B E HARRELL-BOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's review ('Refugees and wasted revenues', March 11)
strongly misrepresented the thrust of the paper presented to the UK-Japan
2000 Group.
Its message was to donor governments: by earmarking funds for relief,
western governments since the Second World War have been addressing the
refugee issue in terms of their political interests rather than those of
either refugees or their hosts. This is demonstrated by the amounts western
governments spend to keep a minority of asylum seekers out of their
countries, while reducing in real terms their support for the maintenance of
the majority of refugees hosted by the poorest countries of the world.
Now that the Cold War is over, it was argued, international politics need no
longer be the decisive factor in determining 'solutions' for refugees. It
should be possible for donors to reformulate policies so as to use
development funds both as a method of avoiding forced migration and of
ensuring that refugees are permitted to make a positive contribution to the
economies of their hosts. This philosophy has been part of the thinking of
humanitarian agencies since 1984, but donors persist in dividing overseas
aid, on the one hand for 'development' and on the other for 'relief'. Host
governments and humanitarian agencies, both UN agencies such as the office
of the High Commissioner for Refugees and non-governmental agencies, are
thus the victims of western donors who earmark money for particular relief
programmes. Any positive change will require leadership from the major
donors. Britain and Japan, having committed their overseas development aid
to human rights conditionality, were challenged to provide such leadership.
These points were clearly made in my paper. I was criticising donor
('western', in Mortimer's inappropriate phrase) governments.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Policy choices for the US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PAST US presidential elections, foreign observers have often been
frustrated by the lack of attention paid to foreign policy. Decisions made
by a US president can sometimes have more effect on the fate of people in
other parts of the world than decisions made by their own national leaders;
yet those parts of the world may not be mentioned by presidential
candidates, and the vast majority of the electors may cast their votes
without having even heard of them.
This year's election is different. Not that the details of foreign policy
are receiving any more attention than before. But, thanks especially to Mr
Patrick Buchanan, the US's world leadership role itself has become an
election issue. Mr Buchanan has tapped into a strong current of popular
feeling which holds that, having won the Cold War, the US can now afford to
leave the world to its own devices, and needs to do so in order to
concentrate on solving its economic and social problems at home.
Those who would follow Mr Buchanan's isolationism all the way are still
probably quite a small minority. There is no mass movement, for example,
calling for the immediate withdrawal of all US forces from Europe. Nor, in
spite of all the 'Japan-bashing', does there appear to be strong support for
protectionism: it is the less protectionist among the Democratic candidates
who have done best in the primaries so far. There is not even much criticism
of President Bush's foreign policy as such. His opponents are, by and large,
quite happy to concede that foreign policy is what the president is good at.
Domestic problems
But what many Americans do feel is that foreign policy takes up much too
large a share of his time and effort, while problems at home are crying out
for more attention. Before Mr Buchanan on the right, the message was
powerfully rammed home by Mr Harris Wofford, the surprise victor of last
November's Senate by-election in Pennsylvania, on the left: 'It's time to
take care of our own.'
That message has certainly reached Mr Bush, via the primary results. He has
not yet translated it into convincing remedial action on the home front -
which is hardly surprising, for in reality there is no automatic
correspondence between presidential time spent on a problem and progress
towards its solution. Nor is it quite fair to say, as one Democratic
congressman has, that 'for the next three months, Patrick Buchanan is going
to be president of the United States'. Foreign policy has not come to a
sudden halt. On several international issues - the Uruguay Round, the
Arab-Israel peace process, Iraq's continued defiance of UN resolutions,
re-employment of Soviet nuclear scientists - the administration continues to
be very active.
Pulling teeth
What is true is that Mr Bush has less and less freedom of manoeuvre when it
comes to spending money on his foreign policy objectives. To withhold loan
guarantees from Israel is proving surprisingly easy. But to get money out of
Congress for IMF recapitalisation, or to pay for UN peacekeeping efforts in
Cambodia and Yugoslavia, is like pulling teeth. Above all Mr Bush has, in
former president Richard Nixon's words, done 'pathetically' little to help
'Russia's first democratic, free-market-oriented, non-expansionist
government'. Stung by the criticism, he pleads that 'there isn't a lot of
money around', and in one sense this is clearly true, with the budget
deficit expected to reach Dollars 400bn next year - especially for a
president who now says his biggest mistake was to abandon his 'no new taxes'
pledge in 1990.
If asked to choose between saving Russia and improving America's schools or
urban infrastructure, there can be little doubt what the voters will say.
But that need not be the choice. Mr Bush is still committed to maintaining
1.6m men under arms over the next five years, at a cost of about Dollars
1,200bn. It would surely make sense to spend a few billion of those dollars
now, on foreign policy objectives which, if achieved, would make the US more
secure even with much smaller armed forces.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Legacy of the curate's egg: Peter Norman on the economic
consequences of the past 13 years of Conservative rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major would hate the comparison. But the last sitting prime minister
to fight an election against such a troubled economic background was Mr
James Callaghan in 1979, and he lost.
There are differences, of course. Mr Callaghan failed because he could not
control the labour unrest unleashed by an inflationary boom. Mr Major will
be campaigning with the economy still mired in recession, unemployment
rising, a deteriorating current account deficit, growing government
borrowings and the worst recent growth record of the group of seven leading
industrial countries.
Economic growth over nearly 13 years of Conservative rule has averaged a
meagre 1.7 per cent a year. Unemployment, currently around 2.6m, is 2.4
times higher than in May 1979, when 1.09m were out of work. Unemployment
affects 9.2 per cent of the workforce against 4.1 per cent in May 1979.
Economists would say that such statistics do not compare like with like. May
1979 marked the peak of the economic cycle that began with the mid-1970s
recession, while at present Britain may be in the trough of the
Conservative's second recession. But the figures are a measure of the
problem that Mr Major must overcome.
On the other hand, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, claimed in his Budget
speech this week that the economy had been transformed. Retail price
inflation, at 4.1 per cent in January, is down to German levels and producer
prices are rising more slowly than for a generation. New businesses continue
to be created. Japanese companies such as Nissan, Toyota and Honda invest in
the UK rather than other European Community countries. Labour relations
present a picture of unprecedented calm.
So which view is right? Did the UK experience an economic miracle during the
1980s or was it all an illusion? Has the present Conservative recession
negated the apparent progress of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first two terms as
prime minister? Will whoever wins on April 9 preside over the sick man of
Europe? Or are Britain's current economic problems a hangover that will
pass?
An appraisal of the Conservatives' years of power suggests that the Tories'
economic legacy will be a curate's egg: good in parts only.
Starting with the abrupt abolition of exchange controls in October 1979, the
Conservatives exposed a protected nation and its institutions to the rigours
of competition and deregulation.
The economic history of the past 13 years can be summed up as an often
difficult adaptation to this changed environment. The new regime has claimed
victims among individuals, companies and policymakers. People have lost
their homes through repossessions that originated with imprudent borrowing.
A string of former high-flying companies which grew by acquisition and debt
have overextended themselves, and in some cases collapsed. A former
chancellor is among the losers. With hindsight, one of the main causes of Mr
Nigel Lawson's problems in his later years at the Treasury was his failure
to appreciate the effects of financial liberalisation on credit growth and
inflation.
Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mrs Thatcher's first chancellor, once said that the
abolition of exchange controls was the only decision of his political life
to have given him a sleepless night. It remains one of the most underrated
economic reforms of the postwar period. Ending controls did more than open
up hitherto-protected areas of the UK economy to international competition.
It provided an impetus for domestic deregulation, including the government's
privatisation programmes and its assault on trade union power.
The most enduring legacy of the 1980s has been in terms of labour relations
and productivity. The curbing of trade union power, culminating in the
defeat of the miners' strike in March 1985, has greatly increased the
ability of managements to manage.
As the illustration shows, only 800,000 working days were lost to industrial
disputes in the UK last year. This was the lowest yearly total since records
began 100 years ago, and lower even than in 1940, when the nation was
threatened in a world war.
Output per worker grew strongly in manufacturing as Britain emerged from the
recession of the early 1980s. It maintained a high rate of growth later in
the decade after a 'growth pause' in 1985. Whereas Britain had the lowest
growth in manufacturing output per head of the G7 economies in the 1970s, it
was at the top of the G7 productivity league in the 1980s. Recent research
from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggests that
the UK's productivity gap against Germany narrowed sharply between 1980 and
1987.
But this only tells part of the story. Productivity fell in the first half
of last year and it is unclear whether its recovery in recent months marks a
return to the strong growth of before. Moreover, productivity growth
elsewhere in the economy has been less impressive than in manufacturing.
More serious, and perhaps symptomatic of a deeper problem, the productivity
gains of the past few years were reflected in job cuts rather than in
significant expansion of the UK's manufacturing base. UK manufacturing
employment fell by 2.4m to 4.7m between 1979 and the end of 1991.
A similar picture of better performance on a narrow base emerges from the
UK's international trading record. The UK has increased its share of exports
among the main manufacturing nations from about 7.5 per cent in the
mid-1980s to roughly 8.6 per cent last year. Yet the insufficient size of
Britain's tradeable goods sector is highlighted by the persistence of a
Pounds 4.5bn current account deficit last year in conditions of depressed
domestic demand and Treasury projections that the current account deficit
will expand again to Pounds 6.5bn this year, as the economy recovers.
Despite strong investment growth for much of the past decade, the British
economy is therefore unable to meet in full the demands put upon it. Skills
shortages are a particular problem, according to Professor Charles Bean who
teaches economics at the London School of Economics. The government's
'biggest error was to underestimate the importance of training and skills
and to overestimate the ability of the economy to meet demand', he says.
Undoubtedly other policy mistakes have contributed to the difficult economic
background on which the government is fighting the election. The decision in
1986 to allow sterling to fall in value with the oil price meant that
Britain, unlike its competitors in the European community, did not lock into
a low-inflation regime in the late 1980s. Then followed the Treasury's
failure to realise the inflationary dangers of the late-1980s house price
boom, the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies associated with Mr
Lawson's experiment of shadowing the D-Mark and his tax-cutting 1988 Budget,
and the growing estrangement between Mr Lawson and Mrs Thatcher over Europe
that upset policymaking. Individually, these problems might have been
manageable. Together they helped pave the way for the longest recession
since the 1930s and acceptance of a new form of economic discipline in
Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
But whoever wins the election, the last 13 years of Conservative government
have resulted in profound changes in the economy and the way it is managed.
All leading parties acknowledge the power of market forces. Although tax
policy will be at the centre of the campaign, there is no question of Labour
returning to the top tax rates of 98 per cent on unearned income levied in
1979.
According to Mr David Kern, National Westminster Bank's chief economist:
'The biggest success of 10 years of Thatcherism is a modern Labour party.'
For Mr Major, that must be the most worrying economic legacy of three Tory
governments.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Arts: Cabal and Love - Lyric Studio, Hammersmith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is Friedrich Schiller's early, fiery prose-drama Kabale und Liebe. It
deserves revival because it is not only a 'seminal' play, but a masterly
one, granted its dated conventions. Which is to say: it uses its
melodramatic scaffolding to soar above it - but the challenges confronting
any modern revival are that the dusty scaffolding must hold firm, and that
the ardour of Schiller's rhetoric should come up fresh.
As directed by Patrick Wilde, the Theatre Manoeuvres company partly manages
those things: well enough, at least, to make its Cabal and Love a
fascinating discovery. The passion is sometimes muted. In the close quarters
of the Lyric Studio, the actors are inclined to play safe, and David
Paisey's new Englishing is no more than tamely faithful. Its diction slides
between 20th-century colloquial and 19th-century fustian. Yet the drama is
set out lucidly, without extraneous tricks.
Schiller's play was first a pillory for his native principality of
Wurtemberg, and then - much less precisely, but with a huge overflow of
feeling - a manifesto for radical Romantic ideals. There is a remote,
self-indulgent Prince, whom we never see, and around him a cabal of minor
aristocrats, who insulate him from the people while advancing their own
interests, and below them the docile burghers.
The mainspring of Cabal and Love is the unsuitable love of the executive
President's son for a burgher's daughter: the kind of story which holds the
stage now only in the likes of Giselle and early Donizetti, fairy-tales in
which everybody is fated to his or her station. In Schiller's genuinely
political drama, however, every twist of the plot-screw illustrates the
power-relations between divided classes. Against that cruel spiral young
Ferdinand's and Luise's protests rise to prophetic vehemence, and their
final trap has the hard shape of tragedy.
The translation and the playing alike fudge one aspect of the dialogues:
that the speakers - however angry or bitter - know their places to a nicety,
and speak accordingly. That enforces a formal mode, upon which Schiller
capitalised grandiloquently. Here, the players are too politely
modern-democratic. Gil Sutherland's clever President has to be feline and
insinuating, not the formidable power-figure of the German production seen
at the Aldwych several years back; and only toward the end does Christopher
Hollis's personable Ferdinand get nearer to passion than well-bred,
low-wattage petulance.
Sarah Burghard's Luise, winsomely sincere and self-deprecating, acquires
moral force only in her face-off with the Prince's mistress, the exotically
English 'Lady Milford'. In fact Adrienne Thomas is no believable English
Lady, but a rampant Dynasty character - which is all to the good: she
strikes vital sparks. Best of all is Steve Hodson as the President's devious
secretary Wurm, finding intelligent depths in a character Schiller wrote as
a pure, slimy villain.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Arts: The survival of the Jews - Jackie Wullschlager reviews
'Patterns of Jewish Life' in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year marks two, chillingly connected, anniversaries in Jewish history:
1492, the date of the expulsion of all Jews from Spain, and 1942, when the
Nazis fixed on 'the final solution' in a Berlin villa and Auschwitz began
operating as a murder factory which killed 6000 people a day. 'Who in the
world would go voluntarily to Berlin?' asked the novelist Joseph Roth in
1927, when there were over 150,000 Jews in the German capital. Today, there
are 5,000.
Patterns of Jewish Life, at Berlin's Martin Gropius Bau (to April 26)
commemorates not the terror but the survival, continuity and range of Jewish
experience. 'Two Jews, three opinions', goes the proverb; this exhibition is
at once a triumph of diversity, a feast of visual delights and an
enthralling history told through paintings, objects, books, archives.
Everyday life - Moroccan costumes, mementos from the Polish shtetl - rubs
along with all the richness and colour of spirituality made tangible: a
thousand-year-old Pentateuch (the five books of Moses), a model of the
Indian synagogue of Cochin's 'white Jews', a painting of the Altneushul in
Prague, the oldest synagogue still in its original form.
The elegantly-proportioned Martin Gropius Bau sets the story of 2000 years
of exile and world-wandering to fine advantage: its open courtyard is a
'holy tent' where the core of Judaism, the written word, is explored;
leading off in all directions, a circle of bright, large rooms allow the
visitor to pick up historical or thematic links at any point. There is no
dogma, but cumulatively, the chronicle of cultural exchange between Jews and
the varied regimes within which they have lived, and the restrictions and
fear which Jewish thought and aesthetic expression have provoked over the
centuries, waves like a banner trumpetting the power and importance of
artistic and cultural life in any society.
Nothing demonstrates this better than the cultural history of Berlin itself.
By the 19th century, Jews hoped to gain acceptance by converting - 'the
certificate of baptism is the entrebillet to European culture', wrote
Heinrich Heine - and, when they were granted citizenship rights in the
founding of Germany in 1871, most identified strongly with the Wilhelmine
empire and later with the Weimar republic. The parade of political notables
here ranges from Bismarck's banker, Gerson von Bliechroder, the curled
moustache and stately pose of Emile Wauter's 1888 portrait the very essence
of Prussian dignity, to Edvard Munch's picture of the cigar-puffing patron
of expressionist artists, Weimar Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau (later
murdered by the Nazis).
The run of assimilated bankers and entrepreneurs who gained public success
lulled Jews into a false sense of security. Those from the east, passing
through en route to America, often stayed; the city's high point as capital
of the European avant-garde in the first third of this century would have
been impossible without artists like Max Brod, Joseph Roth, Max Reinhardt,
who settled there until their works where burned or banned by the Nazis and
Berlin was denuded as a cultural centre.
Arthur Kaufmann's massive triptych, 'Intellectual Emigration', tells the
story: its three parts - leaving occupied Europe, the Atlantic crossing,
arrival in New York - contain life-size portraits of 38 Jewish artists, from
Kurt Weill to Klemperer, who fled. A Hanukkah menorah draped in the Stars
and Stripes, each of its eight branches a statue of liberty clasping a
birthday-cake candle, makes a companion piece of joky optimism.
In 'Ulysses', Stephen's teacher Mr Deasy proudly declares Ireland's record
as the only country which never persecuted the Jews - 'because she never let
them in'. The great contrast of this exhibition is between 19th and early
20th century American religious liberalism and European repression, and the
resulting erratic relationship between the Utopia of Jewish idealism, the
return to the promised land, and the actual Utopia of the new world.
Cultural conflict in America became that of Jew against Jew - bourgeois
Americanised German Jews versus proletarian, orthodox,
Zionistically-inclined Russian Jews: a foreshadowing of similar tensions in
Israel today.
'We German Jews are spiritual proletarians, while the Polish Jews, who live
in proletarian conditions, are aristocrats of their spirits', wrote Franz
Rosenzweig in 1918. Among the highlights at the Martin Gropius Bau is the
reconstruction of the shtetl world of east European Jewry. Famous pieces
like Chagall's appear here in the context of Jewish folk art such as
Issachar Ryback's topsy-turvy villages and frenzied violinists in the cycle
'The Little Town'.
Cultural centres which disappeared completely with Hitler - Vilna, for
example, the 'Jerusalem of Lithuania', where newspapers appeared in six
languages, exports included the international hit play The Dybbuk, and half
the population in 1939 was Jewish - are evoked through paintings,
photographs, manuscripts, with the nostalgic intensity and mystery of a
Bashevis-Singer novel.
Even in an account designed to celebrate Jewish achievement, pogroms and
forced baptisms and persecution form as inescapable part of the tale. What
is valuable in a show of this scale is the long view, which shows how minor
indignities imposed over the centuries were built upon as the foundations
for the horrors of the Third Reich. Special degrading clothing for Jews, for
instance, was ordered in 13th century Vienna; by 1551 Ferdinand I's Jews
were forced to wear a yellow ring; later, Prague Jews wore a yellow collar:
Hitler's yellow star, therefore, must have initially been seen not as
uniquely menacing but as a variation on a long-ordained 'yellow stain'.
The Dreyfus case in the 1890s, where justice was eventually done and the
Jewish officer Dreyfus rehabilitated, had by ironic contrast a vehement
impact in persuading European Jews that they were not as assimilated or safe
as they had thought: Theodor Herzl's response, the book The Jewish State,
laid the foundations of Zionism.
Without driving at specific answers, 'Patterns of Jewish Life' throws up all
the timeless questions about Jewish identity, the significance of faith -
'J'ai trop peu de religion pour en changer', was the celebrated reply of an
old French lady when asked why she did not convert - the essence of Jewish
art and thought, the differences between anti-Judaism, anti-Semitism and
anti-Zionism. The exhibition is a magnificent record of the entwined fate of
a people, a religion and a culture which no one interested in recent history
would want to miss.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There is room - there is need - for good chamber ballet, for work of quality
suited to small performing areas. The concert groups sent out by Scottish
Ballet and English National Ballet fulfil a very necessary function in
taking classic dance to audiences who might otherwise have no easy occasion
to see it. The Royal Ballet makes no such effort, and it was the enterprise
of former Royal Ballet artists, led by Jennifer Jackson,
which created Dance Advance a few years ago. The inspiration for the troupe
was to sustain new and adventurous choreography for modest 'concert'
presentation.
Dance Advance had notable dancers and gained one major piece in MacMillan's
Sea of Troubles: its failure to continue, for varied reasons, was a distinct
loss. Now Jennifer Jackson has revived the idea  - with different
collaborators - as Voltaire, a madly resistible title but a thoroughly
worth-while venture. Distinguished dancers, present and former members of
the Royal Ballet, are involved - Bryony Brind, Mark Silver, Laura Hussey,
Michael Corder - and even after one viewing I am tempted to suggest that the
Royal Ballet benefit from closer association with an ensemble which could
take good dancing and good dances to audiences who otherwise might never see
our national ballet.
Not that this first programme was all beauty and light. Jennifer Jackson
was, I believe, misguided in juxtaposing the work of the saxophonist John
Surman and the pianist John Taylor with Debussy's Trois chansons de Bilitis
in her Alter Ego. Sally Burgess sang these most exquisite melodies with
loving intelligence, and moved gracefully through poses plastiques with
Bryony Brind, Michael Corder and Mark Silver - her musical and dramatic
subtlety, Silver's intensity, making something memorably sensuous of La
chevelure. But the subsequent musical fantasies from John Surman and John
Taylor on Debussian phrases, as accompaniment for predictable dances, were
indefensible, philistine.
Music and dance were happily reunited in Michael Corder's new In the Mists.
Corder is a true craftsman as well as a true choreographer, and he judged
the small dance area of the Baylis Theatre
and the qualities of his interpreters exactly. Thomas Kaurich played
Janacek's four eponymous piano pieces very well indeed. Henk Schut provided
a mist-filled stage marked by three poles,
dressed the quartet of dancers (Brind, Silver, Laura Hussey, Michael
Rolnick) in grey leotards, and lit the piece brilliantly.
Corder produced dances as allusive, haunting, riven with fleeting emotions,
as his score. It was a pleasure to see dance so poetic, and so featly made
for close observation in a restricted area. It was no less a pleasure to see
the authority and distinction of manner of Bryony Brind and Mark Silver.
Here is a perfect example of how ballet of real worth may be made available
for the smallest stage. I hope funding and touring authorities take note.

Car theft, described as a 'multi million pound industry', is investigated by
Public Eye (8.00 BBC2). It seems that the number of vehicles now being
stolen by professional thieves (as distinct, presumably, from being 'taken

FT  13 MAR 92 / Management: Car-makers drive a hard bargain with ease -
Nicholas Denton reports that western executives are finding unparalleled
freedom in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernst Hofmann, like many before him, has found crossing the line of the Iron
Curtain a liberation. But Hofmann, no refugee, is a senior executive with
General Motors and it is eastwards he travels every morning from his
Austrian home to run the US motor group's new factory just across the
east-west border in Hungary.
At GM's car and engine plant near Szentgotthard in western Hungary, which
turns out its first Opel Astra hatchback today, Hofmann is freer to manage
than he has ever been elsewhere. 'I have total flexibility,' Hofmann says
enthusiastically.
GM Europe, one of the three western car-makers leading a rush of foreign
investment into Hungary, has been pleased, too. Pleased enough to boost its
investment at Szentgotthard from DM250m (Pounds 86.8m) to DM350m even before
production has started.
GM knew that the plant's labour costs would be the cheapest in Europe and
tax treatment among the most generous. All-in labour costs are DM4 per hour,
compared with DM35 or DM40 in Germany, while Hungary has given GM a
five-year tax holiday. The happy surprise is productivity. Output per
man-hour - at the engine-making facility, at least - will be 'at the top' of
GM's European rankings, if Hofmann's reckoning proves right.
'We can introduce a different manufacturing system here,' explains GM
Hungary's managing director. 'To do it from scratch is so much easier.'
Szentgotthard has implemented the 'team concept' to an extent unparalleled
in GM's western plants and matched only by Eisenach in eastern Germany.
Teams of production workers are responsible for everything from safety to
quality assurance. In parallel, the layers in the organisational hierarchy
have been cut to four from the six or seven that GM averages. 'I have no
foreman,' says Hofmann in a tone verging on wonder.
All this has been possible because no rigid demarcation lines, trade unions
or established working practices cramp the managers' right to manage.
Workers cannot refuse a draft from car-making to engine-making. Nor is there
any segregation of salaried and hourly-paid staff, nor of skilled and
unskilled.
GM has been far from alone among western car companies in embarking on a
management revolution in Hungary. Ford, GM's US rival, is equally bullish as
it gears up for next month's start of production at its Dollars 83m car
components plant at Szekesfehervar.
There is one vital ingredient, neglected at a car-maker's peril, that makes
Hungarian workers amenable - pay. Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation, on the
brink of completing a Dollars 235m assembly plant at Esztergom for Swift
cars, found that out the hard way.
Hungarian trainees sent to Japan went on strike and 10 per cent of them
returned home early, some sacked for smoking on the factory floor, refusing
to wear safety equipment and, in one case, working on only every other car.
Besides, a diet of rice and fish - innards and all - that both sickened and
starved the Hungarian meat eaters, compulsory overtime and the unremitting
pace of work, were grievances. What made the unpleasant unbearable, said
returnees, was mean pay that was only average by Hungarian standards.
Hungarian workers expect more of foreign companies.
Suzuki still thinks it will have a good workforce in the end. The Japanese
transplant is, in any case, the exception that proves the rule. GM and Ford
show that, handled carefully, Hungarian workers can be exceptional value for
money.
The irony is that the quality of the workforce, praised so much by the car
multinationals, was not the determining factor in their Hungarian
investments. The decisions were made to gain market access. The plants were
set up to satisfy the Hungarian government's requirement for countertrade -
to offset the balance of payments effects of selling cars locally.
That logic went out of the window when Hungary, in line with the rest of
eastern Europe, liberalised car imports. Hungarian consumers, strapped for
cash in a deep recession, bought second-hand cars from western Europe, if at
all. Investing car-makers have pressured Hungary, as they have its east
European neighbours, into tightening up car import quotas this year to
restore some of the lost local advantage. But sales remain disappointing.
GM sold only 2,200 cars in Hungary last year and is likely to fall into the
absurd situation of exporting some of the 15,000 Hungarian-assembled Astras
back to western Europe each year. The costs of transporting parts and cars
back and forth, and the uneconomic scale of the car-making facility,
outweigh the savings on labour.
But the car-makers are in too deep to draw back now. GM, Ford and Suzuki are
inclined to make the best of the situation, mainly because they are still
enticed by the long-term prospects for east European car sales. The belief
remains that Hungarians, who own 152 cars per 1,000 people, less than a
third of the western level, will buy cars as soon as they have the money.
In the meantime, the quality of the workforce is giving reason to hold on.
Car-makers may have come to Hungary for its consumers but they are staying
for the country's workers.

FT  13 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Oil rig contract is not frustrated by revised
drawings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCALPINE HUMBEROAK LTD v MCDERMOTT INTERNATIONAL INC Court of Appeal (Lord
Justice Lloyd, Lord Justice Wolf and Lord Justice Russell): March 5 1992 A
CONTRACT is not frustrated by pre-signature events of which the parties are
fully aware when they sign, and which are provided for in its terms. And
where time is of the essence, delay which on the evidence is caused by the
contractor does not displace lump sum provisions for his payment so as to
entitle him to increased prices going beyond those provided for in the
contract.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant,
McDermott International Inc, from a decision of Judge Davies QC sitting with
two assessors that a contract between it and the plaintiff, McAlpine
Humberoak Ltd, had been frustrated. An appeal on McDermott's counterclaim
was allowed.
The appeal was the first on fact under the new procedure under Order 58 rule
4(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court.
LORD JUSTICE LLOYD said that north of Aberdeen was an off-shore drilling
rig, known as the Hutton Tension Leg Platform.
The contract for construction of the deck structure was placed with
McDermott.
The top deck consisted of nine massive steel pallets, welded together to
form a platform. Each pallet comprised nine plate girders joined together by
tees, and covered by deck plating.
On November 18 1981 McDermott awarded the sub-contract for four of the
pallets, numbers W3, W4, W5 and W6, to McAlpine. It was not signed until
March 24 1982, but was to take effect from November 18 1981.
The total sub-contract price was Pounds 890,330. Completion dates for W3 and
W4 were February 8 and 1 1982 respectively.
W3 was not delivered until July 17, and W4 was not delivered until September
11 1982.
The costs actually incurred by McAlpine came to Pounds 2.59m. It claimed
Pounds 3.54m. It said that sum was due under the contract, or as damages for
breach of contract.
Judge Davies QC held that the contract had been frustrated.
That came as a surprise to the parties, since frustration had not been
pleaded or argued.
The judge awarded McAlpine a quantum meruit (the amount it deserved for work
done) equal to its costs, plus 10 per cent profit, less Pounds 1m already
paid by McDermott. He dismissed a counterclaim by McDermott.
On the present appeal Mr Thomas for McAlpine did not support the judge's
finding on frustration, but sought to sustain his conclusion on other
grounds.
Under the sub-contract time was of the essence. McAlpine was to complete
work by the specified dates. It was entitled to be recompensed if
acceleration was necessary due to McDermott's actions.
By clause 35 McDermott might at any time direct McAlpine to make a change in
the scope of the work. The change was not to be carried out until McAlpine
had received a change order, signed by McDermott.
McAlpine was to prepare shop drawings, and no fabrication was to be
performed until they had been completed and reviewed by McDermott. Shop
drawings were to be based on 'approved for construction' (AFC) drawings, and
should show all details required for fabrication.
McAlpine was to be paid lump sum prices for fabrication, assembly and other
work. The lump sum was to be based on quantities agreed and stated in the
sub-contract.
Performance of the sub-contract fell into three stages.
The first was the pre-production stage. It included preparation of shop
drawings based on AFC drawings issued by McDermott's employer, preparation
of steel for welding, manufacture of jigs, qualifying weld procedures for
use in fabrication, and qualifying welders.
The second stage was fabrication of the plate girders and tees. It was
planned to take 11 days. In fact it took seven weeks.
The third stage was assembly of the pallets.
The greater part of the delay, and by far the greatest part of the
additional costs, occurred during phases two and three.
McAlpine's case was that the main cause of delay was the issue of a large
number of revised AFC drawings after the contract had been placed. The first
issue, consisting of 45 drawings, was received by McAlpine on December 1
1981. The second, consisting of 17 drawings, was received on December 11.
There were 22 new issues in all. They meant that the shop drawings had to be
revised. It was said the revised AFC drawings created havoc in the drawing
office and disrupted production in phase 1, and had a knock-on effect in
phases 2 and 3.
The second cause of delay, according to McAlpine, was McDermott's failure to
answer technical queries (TQs) as promptly as it should have done. The third
cause, it said, was the issue of variation orders (VOs) under clause 35,
changing the scope of the work.
McDermott's case was that the revised drawings, and the failure to give
prompt answers to TQs, were no more than was to be expected in the North Sea
oil industry, and had no disruptive or delaying effect. It said it had paid
more than McAlpine was entitled to under clause 35 in respect of the VOs,
and that they did not disrupt production.
McDermott also said the delay in phase 1 was caused by McAlpine's failure to
qualify its weld procedures until just before fabrication started on
February 16, and to complete manufacture of jigs for fabrication of plate
girders until early February 1982. It said the main causes of delay in
phases 2 and 3 were the vast amounts of remedial work due to poor quality
welding.
The judge found it was the revised drawings which generated the excessive
number of TQs.
He said they 'transformed a contract based on 22 drawings into one based on
161 drawings . . . They distorted its substance and identity.'
He said time went out of the window with the first two issues in December
1981, and the effect was 'to put paid to the lump sum constituent of the
contract as well. From that time, time was at large'.
He concluded that the effect of the changes was to frustrate the original
venture virtually from the start.
The present court could not agree with his reasoning, nor with the
conclusion that the contract was frustrated.
The revised drawings did not 'transform' the contract into a different
contract, or 'distort its substance and identity'. It remained a contract
for the construction of four pallets until March 24 1982, when W5 and W6
were withdrawn.
The judge found the contract was frustrated as early as December 11 1981 on
receipt of the second drawing issue.
That was over three months before the sub-contract was signed.
The sub-contract when signed provided expressly that receipt of drawings
would constitute change instructions for the purposes of clause 35, and that
McAlpine should be recompensed for the additional time and work involved.
If the court were to uphold the finding of frustration, it would be the
first contract to have been frustrated by matters which occurred before the
contract was signed, and were not only well-known to the parties, but were
provided for in the contract itself.
The judge held that, since the contract was agreed to take effect from
November 18 1981, one must construe it in the light of circumstances then
existing, and what the parties then knew.
If that meant the court was to disregard the fact that the contract was
signed by the parties with their eyes open on March 24 1982, when the causes
and consequences of the alleged frustrating events were already largely in
the past, it could not agree.
The inherent probabilities, the contemporaneous documents and the
overwhelming weight of the oral evidence all pointed in one direction. The
cause of delay in starting fabrication was McAlpine's failure to qualify its
weld procedures before February 15 1982. It had nothing to do with the
causes found by the judge.
The contract was not frustrated. The lump sum price was not displaced.
The appeal was allowed. Judgment was given for McDermott on its counterclaim
for damages in respect of additional site personnel employed after the
period representing the overall impact of the extra work had expired.
For McAlpine: Christopher Thomas QC and Peter Coulson (Glovers).
For McDermott: John Uff QC and Lionel Persey (Ince &amp; Co).

<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank showed off two of the most technically advanced
buildings in the City of London last week to a party of schoolteachers in a
drive to boost the image of engineering in UK secondary schools.
Some 20 staff from Sackville secondary school in East Grinstead toured
NatWest's multi-million pound dealing centre in the City's Broadgate
development and its Goodmans Fields cheque-clearing building in nearby
Aldgate on an open-day for the engineering that underpins both buildings.
The tours were part of the Engineering Council's Neighbourhood Engineers
scheme set up in the early 1980s to put local schools in contact with
engineers in their community.
'Engineering has been looked on as an oily rag profession,' says Dennis
Jones, head of technical services in NatWest's property management arm. 'I
wanted the teachers to see situations they could readily imagine. Everyone
sees dealing on TV and cheques being paid into branches. We wanted to
demonstrate the depth of engineering that underpins this process.'
At County NatWest the teachers saw how an 11,000 volt power intake was
refined through various stages to support two dealing rooms serving some 440
dealers.
The four-year-old building was one of the first in the UK to use 'structured
cabling' which means equipment can be changed or moved around the building
without ripping up the floor each time.
Dealers terminals are supported by a standby generator, and a room
containing 1,400 car-batteries which ensure a power supply free of bumps.
At the Goodmans Fields site, the teachers saw cheques being sorted by
machine in a building that generates its own power. 'This sort of experience
certainly broadens our horizons,' said John Cunnington, Sackville's head of
lower school after a debriefing session this week. It is more likely to
influence the careers department than teaching, he says.
Neighbourhood Engineers is run by the Engineering Council which was
established by Royal Charter in 1981 to set and monitor standards in the
education, training and experience of UK engineers.
The scheme aims to bring 24,000 qualified engineers into contact with some
6,000 schools across the country.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology: Roll in the log cabins - Low-cost housing built
for the third world is finding its way back west, writes Stephen Fidler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alejandro Stein, a Venezuelan academic-turned-businessman, reckons the
construction system that he has helped to develop could cut 40 per cent off
the cost of building a house in Nicaragua. In western Europe, where people
expect more in a new home, he says building a house his way would be 15-20
per cent cheaper than using traditional methods.
Stein, a 44-year-old professor in the faculty of architecture and urban
design at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, set out with
colleagues about a decade ago to find ways to reduce the costs of housing
the poor in the third world.
For the Venezuelan academics, the problem was close to home: flimsy shanties
rise vertiginously on the hills surrounding their city. The idea they
developed for the third world has already been used in the first: for
example, in a housing development in Orlando, Florida. Stein and others
believe it also has potential to improve housing standards in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union, for example in housing the homecoming Red Army.
Stein, now the chairman of the company which is licensing the product,
called his system 'Tronco', Spanish for log, since the structures resemble
metallic log cabins.
Housing projects in the third world usually involve the manufacture at a
remote plant of prefabricated concrete sections which are then transported
to the housing site. This requires a substantial investment in plant and
transportation costs which rise with the site's distance from the plant.
Skilled labour is needed at every stage of the construction process and it
is scarce. Often the buildings do not look traditional, and do not reflect
local preferences, such as that of central Americans for solid walls.
The Tronco system attempts to avoid these problems by creating, on site,
hollow 'logs' of aluminium or galvanised steel which are slotted together.
The logs form the walls, upper floors and roofs of the building, although
they can be hidden by attaching cladding to the structure to give the house
its character.
The system requires neither skilled labour nor big transportation costs.
There is no large investment in production because the 'plant' - a machine
that produces the tubes - can be moved from site to site.
The raw material is a metallic strip which arrives on the building site in
coils and is fed into the machine, which uses a similar process to that used
for making central heating or air-conditioning ducts. The machine forms the
hollow helicoidal tube or log by wrapping the metal strip rather like a
bandage around an imaginary arm. It folds the overlapping parts of the strip
mechanically to prevent the log from unravelling. The length and diameter of
the logs can be altered, giving the system more flexibility than traditional
prefabrication, while connectors at one or both ends keep them in place.
These logs are light enough to be carried into position by one person. Each
machine requires eight people for maximum efficiency, including a
semi-skilled machine operator and a supervisor. Because the majority of the
workforce is unskilled, building costs are reduced and the houses can be put
up where traditional building skills are not available.
Buildings can be put up very rapidly: each machine and team of eight can
construct an estimated 300 square metres of built area a day - up to three
times as quick as conventional methods and helping to keep costs down. This
speed, Stein suggests, could be useful in the former Soviet Union, where the
severe winter restricts the housebuilding season and which is also
plentifully supplied with unskilled labour and the metallic raw material.
Although the logs, being hollow, have insulating qualities, this can be
supplemented in cold climates with additional insulation between the logs
and the cladding. In warm climates, the logs are more efficient at keeping
out the heat than concrete, which after sitting in the sun will begin to
radiate heat inside a dwelling.
Stein has laid a strong emphasis on obtaining building certification in the
US. Now obtained, it means the buildings are acceptable in earthquake-prone
California and hurricane-swept Florida. He claims this as a strong
advertisement for the buildings' stability.
However, there are limits to its application. It is not practical for
buildings with more than three storeys, because the extra strength and
weight needed to make such a construction sound would negate the savings in
construction.
Furthermore, in rich countries, resistance to the concept can be expected
from private buyers who usually prefer more traditional brick or wood-frame
houses. A well-established building trade is likely to favour traditional
construction methods.
Stein now spends much of his time travelling to potential licensees in many
parts of the world. He has secured agreement with Japan's Sumitomo Group,
and is in discussions in France, Turkey, Italy, Mexico and other countries.
In Britain, he is talking with the construction company John Laing.
This is not expected to lead to a proliferation of metallic log cabins in
the English countryside; the British company is apparently more interested
in using the method to put up buildings in the Middle East, Far East and
eastern Europe.

SADDLE SORE cyclists could soon be sitting more comfortably thanks to
research which will be presented to the Ergonomics Society's annual
conference at Aston University in Birmingham next month.
Dutch ergonomists put cyclists in the saddle to measure the 'subjective'
experience of riding a bicycle. They found that cycling discomfort was a
problem that had forced some would-be cyclists off their bikes.
'The results make it clear that something is wrong with the present bicycle
saddles. Particularly for women it is hard to find a proper saddle,' said
Henri Christiaans, an ergonomist at Delf University.
Since there are clear anatomical differences between the sexes and
differences between age groups and fitness categories, the researchers
recommend that group-specific saddles should be developed and guidelines
drawn up to help cyclists choose a suitable saddle.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Decathalon drain clears the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW KIND of drain that can clear large volumes of water and clean itself
at the same time has been developed by UK engineering group Hodkin and
Jones, Ian Holdsworth writes.
The group claims its Decathlon drain is capable of clearing up to 192 litres
of water per second. This is at least 50 per cent more efficient than a
conventional drain.
Decathlon's cross-section resembles that of a flower-pot rather than the
traditional circle or inverted egg which has been in widespread use since
Victorian times.
With this profile, the drain expels water even when it is flat, says Hodkin
and Jones. A normal drain must be laid at a gradient. 'An ordinary circular
drain works well up to two-thirds of its capacity,' says David Monks, Hodkin
and Jones's chairman. 'Above that you get air blockages in the system - but
that can't happen with our drain.'

<TEXT>
'ROBOTIC eyes' can now be made from a photosensitive protein called
bacteriorhodopsin (BR) found in salt-saturated water such as the Dead Sea.
A team from Fuji Photo Film in Japan has developed a retina-like light
sensor which rivals the most sophisticated silicon devices. It mimics some
of the functions of the eye in a simpler, less costly and more compact
package.
The sensor is constructed by wedging a thin film of the protein between two
oxide electrodes in an electrically conductive gel. When light hits the
sensor the BR molecules react by changing shape, generating a quick electric
pulse that travels through the electrode. But if the light remains constant
the protein returns to its original shape. No charge is generated until the
light level changes again.
Potential applications include recognition systems for security purposes and
factory automation.

THE Radio Authority is considering launching new regional commercial radio
stations, to extend to the rest of the UK the choice available in London.
The new regional stations would be thematic, offering specialist radio such
as jazz or 'easy listening' formats.
There are 11 London commercial radio services including Jazz FM and Melody
Radio. The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, believes
other cities are too small to sustain such a choice in addition to
conventional radio stations.
The potential solution, which will be outlined in a consultative document
next month, will suggest that regions rather than individual cities could
have more choice.
The document will also set out the proposed ground rules for the
re-franchising of the UK's existing commercial radio stations.
Starting later this year, the Authority will begin re-licensing nearly 130
radio services. The work will be tackled in two tranches - first 52 services
followed by a further 77. The total includes the likely splitting of AM and
FM channels to allow more groups into commercial radio, a business which at
the moment produces revenues of about Pounds 140m.
The re-franchising will be under the old rules - the judgment of the Radio
Authority will prevail rather than highest bids, though winners can be taken
over.
Independent National Broadcasting, which last month made the highest bid of
Pounds 4.01m a year for the second national commercial radio franchise, is
expected to issue a fund-raising prospectus next week. The company plans to
raise Pounds 14m and is talking to a number of potential trade investors to
lead the fund-raising exercise.
The authority would like to see evidence of the company's ability to raise
the necessary financing by the end of this month.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Manchester airport set to lead tour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER airport said yesterday it expected to overhaul London's Gatwick
this year as market leader in holiday charter traffic.
The airport says expanded summer programmes by more than 270 tour operators
will push Manchester's share of the UK inclusive tour booking market to
nearly 30 per cent, with an estimated 28 per cent for Gatwick.
Its scheduled services also continue to expand. In the year to February
Manchester handled a record number of passengers - more than 11.1m. Holiday
charter traffic accounts for about half of passenger throughput.
The airport yesterday announced new scheduled services to Prague, Istanbul
and Bangkok, bringing the number of scheduled airlines using the airport to
99, serving 165 destinations. This compares with 38 airlines and 72
destinations 10 years ago.
Growth in demand has led charter operators - principally Britannia, Air
2000, Caledonian and Excalibur - to base more or bigger aircraft at
Manchester this year, with a noticeable rise in long-haul traffic to the US,
the Caribbean and Africa. Bookings for popular destinations in Spain and
Cyprus have also risen.
On the scheduled side, American Airlines is to double its Chicago service to
two flights a day in the summer, while Air Canada and Canadian Airlines will
each increase their Toronto service from four flights a week to 10. There
will also be extra flights to European destinations.
Manchester expects to open the first phase of its second terminal in a year.
Terminal 2 will cost Pounds 570m, with the first phase costing Pounds 265m.
BAA, the airports operator, said its eight airports handled 4.8m passengers
last month, a 33 per cent rise on February last year, when numbers were
badly affected by the Gulf War, and 3.4 per cent above the February 1990
total.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Cumbrian bus plant sale sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEST Cumbria Develop-ment Agency is this week launching a worldwide
marketing campaign for Volvo's unwanted bus factory at Workington in an
attempt to attract an inward investor to Cumbria's hard-hit coastal strip,
Chris Tighe writes.
With the financial backing of Swedish-owned Volvo, the WCDA is targeting the
US, Germany, Japan and Taiwan to find a buyer for the 500,000 sq ft plant.
No price has been specified, but Volvo said yesterday: 'We're looking for a
balance between getting a sensible price for it and trying to provide some
longer-term job security.'
The closure of the plant this year, with the loss of 370 jobs, follows the
slump in bus sales after deregulation. It is a serious blow to the economy
of West Cumbria, which is already losing 5,000 construction jobs from the
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site and up to 7,000 jobs after cuts at
Trident submarine builder VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness.

FT  13 MAR 92 / February car production up 4.9% year-on-year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CAR production last month was 4.9 per cent higher than in February last
year - the first year-on-year increase in output for seven months.
Commercial vehicle production rose by 13.2 per cent, reinforcing the
stronger trend of recent months.
Output of commercial vehicles has been higher than a year ago in three of
the last four months, helped by rising small van production by Ford, which
added its Courier high-roof Fiesta van range at its Dagenham plant late last
year.
Car production last month rose to 114,492 from 109,160 in the same month a
year ago, when Ford's Halewood, Merseyside plant was operating a shortened
working week.
The production increase resulted from a surprising 23.5 per cent jump in
output for the still depressed domestic market to 66,485, which more than
compensated for the 15.7 per cent fall in output for export markets to
48,007.
In the wake of the heavy 16.1 per cent fall in car output in January, car
production in the first two months of the year at 209,737 was still 5.8 per
cent lower than in the same period a year ago.
According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office, car output in
the last six months on a seasonally adjusted basis was 10 per cent lower
than in the previous six months and 15 per cent lower than in the same six
months a year ago.
By contrast commercial vehicle output in the six months to the end of
February on a seasonally adjusted basis was 23 per cent higher than in the
previous six months and 2 per cent higher than in the same six months a year
ago.
Commercial vehicle output last month alone at 21,315 was 13.2 per cent
higher than a year ago and production in the first two months of this year
at 22,639 was 27.3 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Cardboard box recycling scheme launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR packaging associations yesterday launched a scheme to recycle more of
the 5bn cardboard boxes used in the UK every year.
A company, Repak, has been formed to run the UK Fibreboard Transit Packaging
Recycling System. Repak will issue a recycling symbol to companies
registering with the scheme, which will signify that products are made of
recyclable material and can be collected for reprocessing through existing
recycling facilities.
Mr Bernard Stonestreet, Repak chief executive, said: 'The packaging sector
will pay on a tonnage basis for the licensing of the logo. We are looking at
a cost of about 10p per tonne.'
The money raised will cover the administration of the scheme and pay for
further research and development. Almost half the 2m tonnes of fibreboard
packaging used in the UK is already recycled.
The scheme aims to encourage an even greater proportion of recycling through
co-operation in manufacturing, retailing and waste collection.
Many retailers welcomed the scheme, but some feared it might cut across
profitable recycling agreements that they had established individually.
The development of the Repak system mirrors environmental initiatives in
many other European Community countries and its backers believe that
exported products marked with the triangular symbol will be accepted for
recycling in other countries at no extra cost.
The sponsoring associations fear, however, that dumping of excess packaging
on UK markets by other European countries, in particular Germany, may wreck
the economics of recycling schemes in the UK.
The government has complained to the European Commission about the threat,
but its representations are believed to have been met with a cool response.
The commission is drawing up a packaging waste directive, due to be released
later this year.
The Repak scheme will initially cover only transport packaging, but the aim
is to extend it to sales packaging.
The four associations setting up the scheme are the British Fibreboard
Packaging Association, the British Paper and Board Industry Federation, the
British Waste Paper Association and the Independent Waste Paper Processors'
Association.

FT  13 MAR 92 / DTI may release some companies from audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is considering removing the legal
requirement that smaller companies be subject to annual audit, in a radical
overhaul of company reporting.
An estimated 250,000 companies below the threshold for paying VAT - about
one quarter of all registered companies - could be freed from mandatory
annual external audits conducted by accountancy firms.
Mr John Redwood, minister for corporate affairs, said in an interview with
the Financial Times yesterday that consultation on the policy had started.
He said no firm decision had been made but he supported the idea of reducing
the coverage of audits and general thinking was moving in that direction.
He said it might remain a condition that smaller companies would be required
to retain the services of a professional accountant.
All limited companies have been required to have an audit since 1908. The
requirement was reaffirmed in the early 1980s after the introduction of the
fourth EC directive on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Audit fees charged by accountants to the smallest companies often run into
hundreds of pounds and the change in regulations could threaten income from
many smaller practitioners.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Highlands enterprise jobs cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLANDS and Islands Enterprise, the government body which handles economic
development and training in the north of Scotland, is to cut staff at its
Inverness headquarters by more than a quarter.
It will create a smaller number of new posts in its 10 local enterprise
companies (Lecs), some of which are at far-flung sites.
The move will accompany a large transfer of responsibilities and funding
control from the headquarters to the Lecs. This is in line with the original
aim but is to be achieved a year ahead of schedule.
Staff at the headquarters listened in silence yesterday as Mr Iain
Robertson, HIE's chief executive, told them that 55 of the 200 jobs there
would go in the next year.
A total of 41 jobs are being created in the Lecs, which already employ 110
people. Efforts will be made to find Lecs jobs for people who will lose
their posts at the headquarters but there will be no guarantee of
employment.
HIE hopes to avoid compulsory redundancies but some headquarters staff are
not qualified for the jobs being created and some are likely to be be
reluctant to move from Inverness.
The enterprise body took over last year from the Highlands and Islands
Development Board.
Lecs were set up with chief executives and private-sector led boards in
places such as Lerwick in Shetland, Stornoway in the Western Isles, Thurso
in Caithness and Invergordon in Ross and Cromarty.
Lecs controlled by Scottish Enterprise in lowland Scotland were allocated 83
per cent of the funds in Scottish Enterprise's budget, but Lecs under HIE
were given only 25 per cent of its budget - although they were allocated
larger amounts to be spent under control from Inverness.
Mr Robertson said yesterday that the HIE network had achieved 'rapid
success'. He added: 'The momentum and clear need now is for the early
transfer of sufficient people and powers of decision to the Lecs.'
Details of how the Lecs will share HIE's budget of Pounds 78m for the next
financial year and their extra responsibil-ities have not yet been
disclosed.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Rise in sales of new homes reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS anxious for evidence of the long-awaited upturn in the economy
will today take comfort from a report suggesting sales activity in the
housing market is beginning to show a marked improvement.
The House Builders' Federation said a recovery in sales experienced in
London and the south-east in January had started to spread to the rest of
the country.
Mr David Holliday, federation president, said there was positive evidence
that purchaser interest in new homes was being converted into sales.
The federation report is based on responses from 41 of Britain's biggest
building companies, which together account for about half of new house
sales.
In January 80 per cent of builders reported improved sales compared with
January last year. The figure rose to 84 per cent in February. Nearly half
of the respondents said February sales had jumped by more than 25 per cent.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Politics and drought trap Brazil's poorest: Christina Lamb
visits the north-east where aid workers describe conditions as 'African'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCISO Soares Alamedo laughs when asked when he last ate meat. Standing at
the doorway of his wattle and daub hut, he stares at the sky, praying for
the first rain for three years. The surrounding land is scorched and cracked
and last year the beans he planted died. Through the Dollars 3 a week he
earns labouring on a plantation the family survives on a breakfast of coffee
without sugar and a lunch of flour and water. Dinner they save on by going
to bed early.
The scene might be typical of a famine-struck African nation but is hard to
credit in Brazil, the world's ninth-largest economy with a vast richness of
resources and a per capita income of Dollars 2,200. While the country is
consistently among the world's top three agricultural exporters, two-thirds
of the population have an inadequate daily calorie intake, according to the
World Health Organisation.
Mr Alamedo lives in the interior of Pernambuco state and like many
north-eastern farmers is a vivid example of the inequality of Brazil's
income distribution - often cited by the World Bank as the world's worst.
National Institute of Nutrition figures show more than half the 20m rural
population of the north east suffering some form of malnutrition.
'The rest of Brazil may be a France but what we see here is a Ghana,' says
Dr Malaquias Batista from the Maternal Institute in Recife, capital of
Pernambuco. 'I'm ashamed that in a country as rich as Brazil we still have
so many going hungry. Countries with far lower per capita incomes have
better health indicators.'
He points out that infant mortality in Brazil's nine north-eastern states is
100 per 1,000 (the national average is 60 per 1,000) compared with 15 in
Costa Rica.
The north-east, with vast sugar plantations, was once the economic and
political centre of Brazil. But it has always been synonymous with
inequality and most of the region's music and poetry is based on two themes
 -waiting for rains and exploitation by the coroneis, the prominent figures
granted large tracts of land when the Portuguese colonised the area in the
early 16th century.
The north-east has not kept pace with the development of the industrial
south and, during the 'economic miracle' of the 1960s and 1970s, was left
way behind. While the rich south spawned world-class companies and glitzy
shopping malls, north-eastern farmers must compete with goats for
subsistence during the region's periodic droughts. In Ouricuri, where Mr
Alamedo lives, a state of emergency was declared last September and in
December alone 23 children died of malnutrition.
Yet with an average 800mm precipitation a year the area generally has enough
rain - 'the problem is lack of infrastructure to take advantage of it', says
Mr Eliezer Menezes, superintendent of Sudene, the regional development
authority for the north-east. Ms Constance Clark, a specialist in hunger,
says: 'Other countries such as Egypt with far worse aridity do not suffer
such misery. Only the most primitive degree of technology is needed to
maintain water in place.'
But in Brazil, rather than tackle the problem, governments have reacted on
an emergency basis, waiting for things to become critical then sending in
food parcels or creating emergency projects to provide work. Ms Clark
believes the reason is political - a deliberate suppression of the
population to keep them backward and maintain a hold over them through
paternalism. The buying of votes and siphoning off of emergency funds by
corrupt authorities even has a name - the drought industry.
President Fernando Collor's reaction has been no different, recently
ordering the distribution of food baskets to 650,000 families. Mr Manuel
Santos, president of the Pernambuco Rural Workers Federation, complains:
'This is an ancient tactic to keep the peasant dependent and divided. It is
not hard to see the connection between who gets the baskets and the way they
vote in the municipal elections in October.'
Mr Collor has called on Sudene to draw up a strategy for a definitive end to
the problem. However he is not the first president in the organisation's 33
years of existence to suggest this and Mr Menezes admits: 'The problem is
that governments each want their own projects so they abandon those of their
predecessors and if there is no drought during their mandate they do
nothing.'
Those irrigation projects initiated by governments have been aimed at big
exporters rather than small farmers. Uneducated and rarely owning their own
land, farmers have made little improvement themselves though some grassroots
organisations are being formed to teach how to survive drought.
It is the plight of people such as Mr Alamedo which is at the root of two of
Brazil's main problems - the deforestation of the Amazon and the growing
slums of the big cities. During the 1970 drought, rather than tackle the
problem and fearing social unrest, the Medici government decided to open the
Amazon and colonise it with north-easterners.
Between 1970 and 1988 more than 1.5m left the north-east and 60 per cent of
all Brazil's migrants are from that region. The policy was a failure -
migrants were not given credit or technology for farming and resorted to
burning trees or fleeing to cities.
Today, with the south undergoing its worst recession for a decade and the
world watching Amazonian destruction, this safety valve no longer exists.
The last decade of high inflation has made the situation worse, widening the
gap between rich and poor.
Recently rain returned to the north-east, ending three years of drought. But
the next drought is never far off.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Paramount makes a pitch for the Yankees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FANS of the New York Yankees gave a rousing cheer yesterday as it emerged
that Paramount Communications, the cash-rich entertainment and publishing
conglomerate, was preparing to make a pitch to acquire the once legendary
baseball team.
The cheering, however, was not so much an appreciation of Paramount's
expected bid - which might total as much as Dollars 250m - as in
anticipation that Mr George Steinbrenner, the team's much-hated majority
shareholder, might finally be ready to sever his 19-year-old ties with the
team.
The 62-year-old Mr Steinbrenner - who in 1990 was banned by America's
baseball commissioner from any day-to-day responsibility for the Yankees
after allegations related to a payment he made to a gambler - is roundly
despised by Yankee fans who accuse him of letting the team stagnate amid
endless controversy.
Paramount, which is sitting on a cash balance of nearly Dollars 1bn, already
has a significant investment in the Yankees. The entertainment group's MSG
cable television sports network three years ago paid Dollars 500m for an
exclusive contract to broadcast Yankee games until the year 2000.
Paramount also owns Madison Square Garden, the site of many sports events,
as well as two of New York's champion clubs, the Knickerbocker basketball
team and the Rangers ice hockey team.
The Yankees, alas, are far from being champions. The Bronx-based team
remains both profitable and America's most prestigious baseball franchise -
it is, after all, the team that was made great by legends such as Mickey
Mantle and George Herman 'Babe' Ruth. But fans blame the imperious Mr
Steinbrenner for wreaking havoc at the club and most would be delighted to
see him sell his 55 per cent shareholding, along with 19 other minority
investors.
Mr Steinbrenner has made some 20 managerial changes at the Yankees in the 19
years since he bought the team from CBS, the television network. Mr Billy
Martin, the best known manager of the club, was fired and reinstated as
manager no fewer than five times.
In the summer of 1990 Mr Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, suspended
Mr Steinbrenner from engaging in day-to-day decisions after finding his
conduct to be 'not in the best interests of baseball.'
The conduct in question was a Dollars 40,000 payment made to one Howard
Spira, a gambler who was alleged to have provided Mr Steinbrenner with
damaging information about Mr Dave Winfield, a superstar Yankee player with
whom Mr Steinbrenner had feuded.
The full story remains murky, but Mr Steinbrenner is said to be determined
to get his own back against the baseball commissioner, even if this means
launching a lawsuit after selling out his majority control of the Yankees.
Mr Steinbrenner, meanwhile, was keeping a low profile yesterday. He was said
to be discussing the possible sale with his partners in Florida, where the
team is warming up for the forthcoming new season.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Unemployment rate rises to 10.5% in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to 10.5 per cent in February from a
revised level of 10.4 per cent a month earlier, according to figures
released yesterday.
Unemployment remained below the post-war record of 10.6 per cent, reached in
December, but the increase suggested that the slight fall in January was an
aberration.
Mr Kim Beazley, the employment minister, said unemployment was 'on track' to
reach 10.75 per cent in June, the level foreshadowed in the government's
budget last August. 'That is not a source of joy; it is not an acceptable
situation, and clearly we have to have policy settings right to bring that
down,' Mr Beazley said.
Economists said the fall in the number of employed people was slowing down,
although the improvement would not be sufficient to absorb increases in the
labour force over the next few months.
The expectations are that unemployment will peak at around 11 per cent
towards the end of the year. That would imply double digit figures in the
run up to the federal election, which must be held by mid-1993. Private
economists remain divided about whether recent improvements in some leading
indicators reflect the beginning of a recovery.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Deng scores economic reform coup: China's top leader has
stolen a march on party hardliners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY Chinese looking at it would know, without even reading the text, that
something significant had happened,' said a western diplomat in Beijing
yesterday.
The 'it' he was referring to was the front page of yesterday's People's
Daily (Renmin Ribao), the newspaper of the Chinese Communist party.
Occupying the top half of the page was a report - with eight decks of
headline - of a full Politburo meeting that took place on Sunday and Monday
of this week. 'The party's basic line should be adhered to for 100 years,'
said the main headline. 'Grasp the chance to speed up reforms and opening up
(to the west) so as to improve the economy.'
This story was carried by every party newspaper in China yesterday, giving
it a theoretical readership of more than 1bn people. Diplomats can not
remember an occasion since the Tiananmen massacre of June 1989 when the
People's Daily gave such prominence to a meeting of the Politburo.
The article is the outward expression of a struggle that has been taking
place for at least two months at the highest level of the party.
The debate is about the pace of economic (not, of course, political) reform
and the degree of foreign participation China should allow. Equally, it is
about who will lead China into the 21st century.
At an economic level, the debate seems to have been resolved in favour of
the line advocated by Deng Xiaoping, China's 87-year-old paramount leader.
As the paper said yesterday: 'Borrow and absorb from other countries,
including western developed countries, their advanced methods of running
business and management skills.'
China's managers will have to grab that opportunity with both hands. Since
1988 China's state companies have amassed losses of Yuan31bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
and debts to each other far in excess of that. Along with price reform,
there is the pressing problem of China's bloated and inefficient state
industry.
What is still unclear, however, is what the economic reform means for the
political future of China's party hardliners. These men and women have
opposed quickening the pace of economic reform. Others fear that 'opening
up' to the west risks the importation of western ideas as well as western
technology and capital.
The People's Daily said: 'Be wary of the right, but mainly be guarded
against the left' - the first high profile reference to the left (hardline
faction) for years. It may mean a 'soft' purge of anti-reformist elements in
the leadership is in the offing.
This, if it happens, will be played out in the coming months as the 14th
party congress nears. The congress, due this autumn, will decide the
composition of the new central committee and the politburo - in short, who
will run China for the next five years or more.
Party committees in the provinces are in the process of choosing delegates,
so Deng's intervention is seen as an attempt to influence the choices.
The struggle first came to light at the beginning of this year when Deng
went to southern China and praised the economic development in the region.
This trip culminated in a letter he wrote to the Politburo and circulated
among top officials.
Much of this document has leaked out in the Hong Kong Chinese-language press
over the past two weeks and it is remarkable how close yesterday's story in
the People's Daily follows what the colony's press has reported of Deng's
letter.
If these reports are correct, China's bureaucrats will soon be reading
reassuring noises from Deng about the merits of foreign investment.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Devaluation results in a stern test for Lagos

RISING consumer prices and a weakening naira were being closely monitored by
Nigeria's military government yesterday as the market responded to last's
week's decision to float the national currency.
Foreign exchange bureaux in Lagos valued the naira at between 19.50 and
19.75 to the US dollar, down from Monday's Central Bank fixing of 18. The
rate was 10.6 naira to the dollar before last Thursday night's announcement.
The bureaux do not set the official rate, which will be done each Tuesday by
the Central Bank in response to demand, but they are an important market
indicator.
Uncertainty about the implications dampened initial responses to the
devaluation, but prices of many items, with and without an imported content,
have started rising sharply over the past 48 hours.
Government officials point out that the prices of many goods already
reflected the premium on scarce foreign exchange, and were hoping that
post-devaluation increases would be comparatively modest. The cost of
domestically produced staple foods, they say, should change significantly.
Lagos bankers believe the naira should stabilise, and perhaps recover
slightly, as a liquidity squeeze and other measures - including promised
curbs in government spending - take effect.
But a testing period lies ahead, in which government will come under
pressure to back down from a decision widely seen as causing Nigerians more
pain, with no gain.
Neither the local press nor the government have linked the devaluation to
terms for a new stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund,
which would pave the way to further external debt rescheduling.

An Israeli soldier points his rifle at a Palestinian man in bed in the town
of Jenin yesterday during a crackdown on armed militants in the occupied
West Bank, official military sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem. The soldiers killed a Palestinian gunman and wounded three in the
two-day action. Dozens were detained in the search-and-arrest operation in
the area of Jenin, a flashpoint of armed clashes between Israeli troops and
Palestinians. Residents were confined to their homes under a curfew order.
The operation appeared to be a response to recent Palestinian attacks.

SYRIA'S President Hafez al-Assad yesterday bitterly criticised western
attempts to deny Arab countries advanced weaponry, while allowing Israel to
continue to develop its arsenal of modern weapons.
'That is not international legitimacy. That is the law of the jungle, the
law of wild animals,' Mr Assad said in a speech marking his swearing in as
president for a fourth term. Mr Assad also denied that a North Korean ship,
which docked earlier this week at the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, was
carrying improved Scud-C missiles for Syria.
'These ships they are talking about are not carrying missiles to Syria,' he
declared. 'Everything you have heard is untrue.'
The US, which had come under intense pressure from Israel to stop the ship,
said it had eluded surveillance by hugging the Iranian coast. But it seems
more likely the US decided not to intercept the North Korean vessel to avoid
an international incident.
'If they want to limit arms, the Israeli factories which produce the nuclear
bomb, tanks, missiles and electronics should be closed,' he declared.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Japanese fear trouble as trade surplus soars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Japanese government, reacting to the surge in the country's trade
surplus, said yesterday it would intensify attempts to strengthen the yen
and consider new means of stimulating a slowing domestic economy.
The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(Miti) said that the yen, which closed at Y134 to the dollar in Tokyo, was
'unacceptably weak'. Their comments came after the announcement of a record
monthly surplus of Dollars 10.2bn for February.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Miti's vice-minister for international affairs, said
yesterday the present trend of the surplus, which is on course to surpass
the record of Dollars 82.7bn in 1986, 'will cause a lot of trouble for us'.
'We have to maintain our domestic demand-led economy, and we have to
strengthen our micro-level import promotion efforts,' said Mr Hatakeyama,
who fears that trade friction will rise in tandem with the surplus. He is
also 'not happy' about the yen's weakness, and hinted that the currency
should be around the Y120 level.
The February trade figures showed sharp increases in exports by the
electronics and car industries, which had been warned by Miti in the late
1980s to exercise caution in expanding their production facilities. Despite
that advice, new orders for machinery rose by a striking 25.2 per cent and
17.5 per cent in 1988 and 1989, and the slowdown in the domestic economy has
left companies with surplus production capacity.
While careful not to condemn particular industries, Mr Hatakeyama said 'some
sectors had invested excessively', and that this past expansion of capacity
was prompting companies to increase exports this year.
'It seems to be true that they invested heavily because they enjoyed
low-cost equity finance. Of course, if we look at the other side of the
coin, it was good for us to see this strong growth in our economy,' he said.
He said that the ministry would not advise companies to restrict exports
because such guidance would violate Gatt rules.

JAPAN Aviation Electronics Industry, a defence equipment maker affiliated to
NEC, the electronics combine, has been fined Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.5m) for
illegally selling US military technology to Iran, Stefan Wagstyl reports
from Tokyo.
The company paid the fine and pleaded guilty to 10 of 22 charges in a plea
bargaining agreement with the US Justice Department.
The US and Japanese governments are lifting most of the sanctions imposed on
JAEI last year when the offences came to light. The company was banned by
the US from manufacturing defence-related products made under licence from
US companies. The Japanese Defence Agency suspended contracts with JAEI.
The US authorities plan to keep the company on a watch-list for three years,
during which the export ban would be automatically reimposed if any
suspected new offences were unearthed.
JAEI is a world leader in aerospace navigation technology and if the bans
had persisted, Japan's defence procurement programmes could have been
disrupted.
The company was charged with selling Iran navigation equipment for military
jets which had been made under licence from US contractors. JAEI allegedly
conspired with Aero Systems, a Florida-based company, to carry out the
illegal exports in 1986. The sales contravened the US Arms Export Control
Act.
Mr Hisao Kaneko, the JAEI president, yesterday apologised to the defence
agency, to other ministries and to clients for having caused a scandal which
influenced even Japan's defence programme and the US-Japan security treaty.
After the settlement, JAEI revised its corporate financial forecast. It
expects a Y3.3bn pre-tax loss in the year to the end of March, more than the
previous estimate of Y2.4bn. The results would be worse but for the sale of
a Y3bn parcel of land.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Germiston swallows its fear of black domination: Patti
Waldmeir visits a 'house meeting' to hear South Africans debate the
whites-only referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN MY heart, I'm right wing. But if I use what's between my two ears, I
have to vote yes and face the future.' Oom Hannes Booysen commits himself to
vote 'yes' in South Africa's white referendum, with a deep sigh and an
abiding anxiety.
None the less, he - a branch chairman of the ruling National party in the
Johannesburg suburb of Germiston - is about the best the National party can
hope for: a voter who swallows his reservations, suppresses his economic
grievances against the government, and casts a vote for reason.
But Oom Hannes's support for the 'yes' campaign - like that of so many other
'yes' voters - depends crucially on a vision of the future in which the
National party retains a huge share of political power, at least equal to
that of the African National Congress. It depends on a belief that standards
will not fall substantially in white education or health care.
For President F W de Klerk will not succeed in gaining the landslide victory
he has demanded from whites unless he can convince them that he can prevent
reverse apartheid - the domination of whites by blacks.
On Wednesday night, in the dormitory suburb of Germiston, his plan was put
to the test before a group of National party voters gathered in the home of
Oom Hannes for a 'house meeting', the traditional tool of the white South
African politician.
Mr Derek Christophers addressed the meeting; he is National party MP for
Germiston, which he describes as the Pittsburgh of South Africa, a
metal-bashing centre down on its luck, where 60 per cent of the 110,000
residents are working class and suffering deeply from a three-year
recession. Mr Christophers is an English-speaker (35 per cent of Germiston
speak English) but everyone gathered in Oom Hannes's sitting room was
Afrikaner.
Mr Christophers was adamant on the question of domination: 'There is not a
chance that we are going to be dominated, not a chance. By the time we vote
in 1994, there will be 13m voters: 3.5m whites, 3m Zulus, 1m coloureds and
3/4 m Indians. Taken together, that's already more than the voters of the
ANC.'
Rank and file National party supporters believe fervently that such a
multi-racial coalition can be formed at the centre of South African politics
 -and that the country's black tribes are too fractious to unite outside it.
This is the logic of apartheid: that blacks are terminally divided against
themselves, and must be kept separate from each other as well as from
whites, just to keep the peace. But National party voters believe it will
still operate to their advantage in the new South Africa.
Still, Oom Hannes and his more liberal neighbour, Mr Chris Geyer, a retired
dentist, agree they are very worried about domination. 'What's going to
happen if they (a black government) tear up the constitution and the bill of
rights?' asks Oom Hannes, echoed by Mr Geyer, who adds: 'There's no
constitution that can prevent domination'.
Pieter, a businessman, consoles them by assuring them that blacks are so
divided they could not even agree to tear up a constitution, let alone to
govern. He believes that whites need not fear the threat of communism from
the ANC - the biggest bogey of most white voters - arguing that only the
ANC's rhetoric is socialist. He, along with the others in the room, make the
big leap of faith to believe the National party will defeat the communists
in the ANC.
Oom Hannes does not seem so sure. But of one thing he is certain: white
sportsmen will succeed, against the odds, in persuading blacks to accept the
Springbok as the country's national sporting symbol. Some of the company
seem to believe the South African flag might also survive, possibly even the
national anthem, Die Stem - seemingly unaware of the obvious anger these
symbols provoke in blacks.
But Mrs Sonet Jordaan, young mother of a four-year-old son, sums up the
feeling of most of Oom Hannes's visitors: 'The referendum is in God's hands
now. He will decide. He knows what is best for South Africa.'

FT  13 MAR 92 / East Asia arms build-up is other side of peace dividend
coin: Weapons makers turn to Pacific's western shores to compensate for
declining business elsewhere, writes David White
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA LOOKS likely to see the fastest growth in military spending of any area
of the world up to the end of the decade. Facing declining business in North
America and Europe, arms manufacturers are plying the route to growth
markets on the western shores of the Pacific.
Since 1988 developing countries in south and east Asia have overtaken the
Middle East in purchases of weapons, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).
At a recent Singapore conference on Asia-Pacific defence, senior officials
and academics from 10 countries in the region underscored the extent of
military modernisation plans.
Dr Yeo Ning Hong, Singapore's defence minister, predicted a continued rise
in the region's military outlays. He cited widespread fears - despite
reassurances by Washington - that US involvement would continue to shrink.
Japan, he said, might then feel compelled to arm to safeguard trade routes,
prompting a 'chain reaction' from the Chinese and Koreans.
'No country in south-east Asia is overjoyed with the reduction in US
presence,' he warned. 'None of them has declared a peace dividend. None has
reduced its defence expenditure.'
An impressive array of sophisticated armoury is being acquired. Ten
countries in the region have warships armed with French Exocet or US Harpoon
anti-ship missiles, or both. Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea
all have US F-16 fighters. Around them, Japan is equipped with US F-15s,
Australia with F-18s, India with MiG-29s and French Mirage 2000s, and China
is buying Russian Su-27s.
In the five years to 1990, according to Sipri, India and Japan were the
world's biggest importers of large conventional weapons. During the same
period, five other Asian counties - North and South Korea, Pakistan, Taiwan
and Thailand - all imported more arms than Libya.
Annual US military sales to east Asia and the Pacific have been running at
more than Dollars 3bn, but face strong competition from Europe and from
local industries.
South Korea has ordered 120 F-16 jets in a Dollars 5bn deal, as well as US
Black Hawk helicopters, British Lynx helicopters (already delivered),
British Hawk jet trainers, Mistral ground-to-air missiles from France and
submarines from Germany.
Taiwan, looking to European shipyards to update its navy. has also shown
interest in German submarines. It has two Dutch submarines and was reported
to be considering more, but the Netherlands has vetoed any new sales to
protect its relations with China. France has hit on a compromise by selling
six frigates to Taiwan without weapons.
Most members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) -
comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand - are also actively arming. Thailand is the biggest military
spender of the group, embarking on what Mr Sukhumbhand Paribartra, director
of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok's
Chulalongkorn university, describes as 'the largest arms procurement
programme in the kingdom's history'. This is despite the outbreak of peace
in Indochina and the withdrawal of Russian warships from Vietnam's Cam Ranh
Bay base.
Thailand has switched from reliance on Chinese weapons to US army surplus
and more state-of-the-art weapons. It has ordered a helicopter carrier from
Germany, Swiss trainer aircraft and in addition to its US F-16s has been
dithering over procurement of a light strike fighter.
Mr Sukhumbhand says the plans partly reflect a 'bureaucratic momentum' built
up during the 1980s.
Indonesia has received the sixth in a series of second-hand Dutch frigates
and is considering buying and co-producing British Aerospace Hawks.
Singapore is completing a fleet of six German-design missile corvettes.
Malaysia was to have bought Tornado strike jets from Britain but changed its
mind and ordered 28 Hawks instead. It is in protracted discussions over two
corvettes which would bring its purchases from the UK under a 1988 arms
supply agreement to more than Pounds 1bn. It is meanwhile considering
another aircraft buy - possibly one or two squadrons - and is studying the
Russian MiG-29 as well as US and French options.
Brunei also wants Hawks from the UK, providing its air force with its first
jet aircraft. But, along with plans for three offshore patrol vessels, it
has delayed the purchase.
Western military consultants in Asia find the rationale for new weapon
acquisitions - other than sheer prestige - in many cases unclear.
Vice Admiral Soedibyo Rahardjo, chief of Indonesia's general staff, said the
Asean countries felt menaced not by a definite military threat but by
uncertainty about how the balance in the region would evolve between the US,
Russia, Japan, China and India.
New US 'access facilities' are being set up in south-east Asia to compensate
for the withdrawal, at Manila's behest, of forces from the Philippines,
where the US Navy is due to complete its pullout from Subic Bay by the end
of the year.
Singapore has agreed arrangements for rotating deployments of US fighters,
port calls and the transfer of a naval logistics branch from the
Philippines. Malaysia is to let US ships use a naval repair yard. Expansion
of arrangements with Thailand is under discussion. According to Vice Admiral
Soedibyo, Indonesia could in future also provide maintenance facilities.
A continued US presence is seen as preventing a 'power vacuum' which would
encourage the flaring of tensions in a region henceforth bristling with new
weaponry.

FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan agrees limited increase to cartel
fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Fair Trade Commission (FTC)
have agreed that the maximum fine for violators of anti-monopoly laws should
be raised from Y5m (Pounds 22,000) to Y100m, far below the Y300m earlier
proposed by the FTC, writes Robert Thomson.
Senior politicians told the commission that they would not approve the
introduction of legislation containing penalties of above Y100m, as Japanese
companies had complained to the ruling party that the FTC's proposal was
excessive.
The US had demanded that Japan revise the schedule of fines for violators
and increase the staff at the commission - which has been condemned by
corporate Japan for being too vigorous in its pursuit of offenders.
In reaching the Y100m figure, Japanese officials attempted to balance their
responsibilities to politically influential companies and to the US, which
has complained that cartels are common in Japan, making foreign market
access difficult.
It is expected that the legislation will be presented to parliament later
this month.

FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Delta deal fuels Airbus-Boeing subsidy row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS in the transatlantic dispute over Airbus aircraft subsidies have
been heightened following complaints by Boeing that its European rival won a
Dollars 675m (Pounds 383.5m) order for nine Airbus A310 aircraft from Delta
Air Lines last week by providing the third largest US carrier with creative
lease financing, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent.
But Airbus yesterday denied providing Delta either special leasing terms, or
a so-called 'walk away' clause, emphasising that it was 'an outright
purchase'.
Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, claimed in the
US this week that Airbus had offered bargain-basement lease terms to Delta
to clinch the A310 order against a rival offer by the Seattle manufacturer
for Boeing 767-300 extended-range aircraft.
Boeing said it planned to complain to the US government as part of its case
against Airbus government subsidies. The latest controversy coincides with
an imminent showdown between the US government and the European Commission
on the eight-year-old dispute.
The US has set a deadline of March 31 to resolve the controversy and has
warned it would consider taking either unilateral action against Airbus or
lodge a formal complaint with the subsidies committee of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
The Delta contract has further inflamed the dispute because the deal
represents a significant inroad for Airbus into the US market at a time when
large aircraft orders are rare.
Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus managing director, said this week he feared the US
was hardening its stance in negotiations over subsidies: 'I have the feeling
the Americans are no longer seeking a compromise and that they believe
Europe is too weak to react in an election context which weakens the French
and British governments,' he said.
'I fear they may have chosen to force matters, either by suspending talks,
or by submitting a complaint before Gatt, or by taxing European aircraft.'
While denying that the Delta deal involved any special lease agreements, a
senior Airbus official claimed yesterday that US aircraft manufacturers had
offered customers 'walk away' clauses in the past.
These clauses enable an airline customer to return aircraft to the
manufacturer after a set period of time.
Airbus has already won big orders from American Airlines, Northwest
Airlines, Continental, TWA and now Delta.
Boeing claimed it could not match the Airbus-Delta deal which had reinforced
its concerns about Airbus subsidies. But Airbus reiterated its own complaint
about Boeing's 'special relationship' with British Airways which led to a
big BA order for Boeing 777 airliners last summer. Boeing had also beaten
Airbus on an order from Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, because the
European consortium could not match 'the predatory pricing' of its US
competitor.

<TEXT>
UK-BASED travel companies have written to the Indian government warning that
a proposed 20 per cent expenditure tax on hotel food and accommodation for
foreign visitors could damage the country's tourist industry, writes Michael
Skapinker.
The protest against the tax, led by Cox &amp; Kings, the market leader in Indian
holidays, has been supported by Thomas Cook, British Airways Holidays, Kuoni
and others. The International Federation of Tour Operators has warned that
the tax could cut the number of foreign visitors to India.
In letters to Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, and Mr Madhavrao
Scindia, civil aviation and tourism minister, Mr Peter Kerkar, Cox &amp; Kings'
chief executive, said much of the increase in costs caused by the tax would
be passed on to consumers, adding: 'the foreign exchange generated . . .
will be affected by the negative impact that this levy will have upon new
business.'
Mr Kerkar asked India to consider deferring the tax until the end of 1993,
so that it could be included in new brochures, and to reduce its level.
Britons made up about one-fifth of the country's 1.2m visitors, he said.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Mafia assassinates Euro MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE assassination in Palermo yesterday of Mr Salvatore Lima, a prominent
Christian Democrat politician and European member of parliament, brought
Mafia violence to the forefront of the campaign for Italy's general
elections on April 5.
He was gunned down inside his car by two men on a motorcycle near his home
on the outskirts of Palermo in a well prepared operation. His driver was
slightly injured by glass and another passenger was unhurt.
His killing followed the murder on Wednesday at Castellmare di Sabbia, near
Naples, of Mr Sebastian Corrado, a leading local councillor belonging to the
Party of the Democrat Left (PDS) who had denounced activities of the Naples
camorra. In another development, police yesterday found the body of Mr
Luciano Carugo, a Milan businessmen with large construction interests who
had disappeared two days ago.
Mr Lima, three times elected to the Italian parliament, was a former mayor
of Palermo and on the national executive of the Christian Democrat Party. He
was the second Christian Democrat mayor of Palermo to have been murdered
since 1984. The anti-Mafia commission in Sicily issued a statement saying:
'The fact that this happened three weeks before the elections suggests that
the killing was an attempt to influence the election campaign."
Mr Lima was a controversial figure.
On at least four occasions parliamentary commissions in the 1970s had
unsuccessfully attempted to investigate his connections with the
construction business while he was in the Palermo municipal administration.
Italian politicians universally condemned his killing yesterday, but several
reactions were cautious.
'Faced with the killing of such a controversial political figure, I can only
express human sympathy,' said Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the Republican
Party.

<TEXT>
MR Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats (FDP) in Germany's ruling
coalition, yesterday spoke out against the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)
being developed jointly with Britain, Italy and Spain.
His intervention in the debate over the fighter, known as the Jager-90 in
Germany, adds to growing resistance in political circles in Bonn to
continued participation in the project, or at least in favour of sharply
reduced German participation.
Mr Lambsdorff said he had long had doubts about the EFA, above all in the
light of the transformation in the world security situation. Although he
could not propose an obvious alternative - the EFA was designed as an
air-to-air fighter specifically for the defensive role required by the
Luftwaffe - 'there is always an alternative'.
He emphasised that if the German purchase of the aircraft were to go ahead,
at the estimated cost of DM26bn (Pounds 9bn) in the long-term defence
budget, 'there would be such an imbalance between the three arms of the
military that the Jager-90 would damage our overall defence capacity'.
Earlier Mr Lambsdorff told Die Welt, the conservative newspaper, it was
clear that 'the Jager-90 will not be built, and I will certainly not vote
for it'.
The fate of the aircraft is still under debate in a working group
representing all three parties in the ruling coalition, in which the FDP is
the junior partner. The group meets again next week, and is supposed to
report by the summer.
The Luftwaffe remains committed to the aircraft, although its budget is
looked at with some fear by the other services. Airforce chiefs from the
four nations this week confirmed their support.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Inflation gloom for Spain's planners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S economic planners, who have identified inflation as the chief hurdle
to convergence with the EC's leading economies, suffered a setback yesterday
when the February consumer price index (CPI) showed a 0.7 per cent jump,
writes Tom Burns. This took the accumulated CPI increase this year to 2.2
per cent and lifted year-on-year inflation to 6.8 per cent. The increase
last month was well above predictions. Analysts had expected a rise of
O1-0.3 per cent.
The increase will force the government to revise its target of a 5 per cent
price rise by the end of this year. It is also likely to delay indefinitely
any reduction in interest rates and it will fuel union demands to seek large
pay increases in the annual spring round.
Analysts said that raised excise duties and value added tax levels which
were introduced at the begining of the year had fed through into the
February figures. Shares on the Madrid stock market index fell by just over
four points in early trading but rallied slightly to end the day at 260.77,
down 2.46 points.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Demands grow for ex-Soviet army to leave trouble spots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE is growing on the former Soviet army to pull all of its forces out
of the three Caucasian republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Demands for a pull-out followed the capture, and subsequent release on
Wednesday night, of 10 army hostages seized by Armenian militants at a base
at Artik, near the Turkish border with Armenia. The Armenians demanded Grad
rocket launchers and other military hardware, but the army would not say
yesterday if these demands had been met in exchange for the soldiers'
release.
They had been seized after fighting in which two soldiers and three Armenian
fighters were killed.
Georgian police, meanwhile, reported that they had shot dead two former army
soldiers, both Azerbaijanis, who were said to be running guns and ammunition
from Georgia to Azerbaijan for use against the Armenians in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
The mood for withdrawal was evident at a meeting yesterday of the
Co-ordinating Council of officers of the Commonwealth of Independent States
 -the successor to the Soviet Union. Colonel General Bronislav Amilichev,
deputy chief of staff, told the meeting that 'no matter how events evolve,
any withdrawal must begin with getting servicemen's families to safety, to
save them from any trouble'.
This echoed the call earlier this week by Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian
vice-president, who denied that any nuclear weaponry was at risk in the
conflict and called for the army to return to Russia. 'There is sovereign
Azerbaijan, sovereign Armenia, sovereign Georgia, let them work it out among
themselves,' he said.
The Armenian side yesterday reported heavy rocket attacks on Stepanakert,
the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, and a tank assault on the Armenian-held town
of Askeran, close to the Karabakh border with Azerbaijan.
Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister who has been charged
by the Nato co-operation council with leading a mediating mission to
Stepanakert, said on Czechoslovak TV that the mission, by member countries
of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), could only
go to Karabakh after a ceasefire had been declared.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Italy's state sector shake-up: Rationalisation deal on
railways and defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S principal state holding company, IRI, and the third largest state
industrial holding group, Efim, yesterday announced agreement on a
significant rationalisation of their interests in railways, mass-transit and
the defence sector.
This is the first serious move to co-ordinate the activities of state
companies operating in similar sectors of advanced technology in an attempt
to make Italian industry more competitive in international markets. It also
involves parts of the private sector.
The move, first mooted five years ago, also breaks new political ground
since IRI and Efim have jealousy guarded their independence, being
respectively controlled by Christian Democrat and Socialist appointees. The
combined sales of the new consortium in the railways sector are worth
L1,500bn (Pounds 693m).
The logic of the move is the eventual disappearance of Efim, burdened by
over L6,000bn of debt, mainly because of accumulated losses in the aluminium
business. Yesterday's agreement involves two separate but similar
arrangements. The first concerns railway rolling stock, engines and
mass-transit systems. Under this IRI's engineering subsidiary, Finmeccanica,
will form a joint management consortium through Ansaldo Transporti with
Efim's transportation subsidiary, Breda CF and the privately owned, Firema
group.
This link will be reinforced by a mutual exchange of shares of up to 20 per
cent in one direction via Ansaldo Transporti and Breda CF, and in the other
via Aviofer Breda and Ansaldo Transporti. Both the latter will in turn
acquire a stake in Firema. The value of the shareholdings is still to be
assessed.
The main absentee from the deal is Fiat's railway's division, Fiat
Ferroviaria, which has opted at the moment for a technical co-operation
agreement with France's Alsthom. However, IRI officials hope this
rationalisation will bring Italy into line with alliances already made in
this sector in Europe - notably Alsthom and GEC, Siemens with a number of
small German groups including Kraus Mafei, and Sweden's Asea with
Switzerland's Brown Boveri to form Abb.
In Italy alone over the next eight years the national railways, FS, are
expected to place orders worth L12,000bn. Finmeccanica recently signed a
technology agreement with Siemens for the production of carriages and
traction; while Efim has signed a letter of intent to co-operate with Abb.
The second part of the agreement, concerning the defence sector, involves
Efim and Finmeccanica forming a joint partnership to pool resources in
defence avionics and aircraft protection systems.
However, details of share swap arrangements have yet to be worked out.
Beyond this, Efim, through its stake in the jet trainer manufacturer, Sai
Marchetti, and Finmeccanica, through its minority holding in the jet trainer
manufacturer, Macchi, will work on a plan of joint industrial development.

ARMENIAN rocket attacks on the Azerbaijani town of Agdam yesterday killed at
least five people and injured about 60, writes Jim Bodgener from Agdam,
Azerbaijan.
The town's market, school and about 40 houses were hit. Ambulances, cars and
jeeps were still bringing in the wounded to an improvised hospital at the
railway station two hours after the second salvo at midday
The intermittent rumble of artillery duels echoed from the Karabakh
mountains, about 8km from Agdam.
A school teacher said they had been attacked by 'tanks with the help of
uniformed Russians'.
Chrystia Freeland adds from Kiev: Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian
president, said yesterday that Azerbaijan had requested Ukrainian protection
from what it described as 'Armenian aggression'.
Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would not become involved militarily in the
conflict.
He added, however, that it would put forward a peace plan at the March 20
meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kiev.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Catalan leader has sights set high: Madrid faces challenge
from the economic hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JORDI PUJOL, the leader of Catalonia's autonomous government since 1980,
is poised to win comfortably his fourth successive mandate in Spain's
richest community and is likely to emerge as an arbiter of domestic politics
in the 1990s.
Opinion polls for Sunday's Catalan elections indicate that Mr Pujol's
moderate nationalist coalition Convergencia i Unio (CiU) will increase its
existing overall majority in the Barcelona-based 135-member parliament,
taking up to 48 per cent of the vote, from 45 per cent in the 1988 election,
and opening a 20-point gap over the second-placed Socialist party.
The expected result will reward Mr Pujol for consolidating both the wealth
and the nationalist identity of Spain's north-east corner, an area that is
larger than Belgium and whose 6m inhabitants represent 15 per cent of the
Spanish population.
Styling itself as the economic hub of the western Mediterranean and fuelled
by foreign, particularly Japanese, investment, Catalonia accounts for 27 per
cent of Spain's industrial GDP. Its per capita income is 25 per cent higher
than the national average and is only slightly below that of the European
Community.
During his 12 years in power Mr Pujol, 62, has ably extracted growing
administrative powers from the central government in Madrid and has
single-mindedly promoted the widespread use of the Catalan language.
Catalonia's government, the Generalitat, has some 100,000 employees on its
payroll and runs one of the most efficient health services in the country.
Sunday's poll will also reinforce the position that Mr Pujol, who leads the
CiU nationally and is the country's longest serving elected leader, holds as
a potential powerbroker in national politics. Spain's general elections, due
next year, are likely to return a hung parliament.
The bloc of 18-20 members of Mr Pujol's CiU coalition in Madrid's national
parliament is courted by both the ruling Socialist party of the prime
minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, and by the Partido Popular, the opposition
conservative party.
Mr Pujol, an essentially pragmatic politician, is highly motivated by deeply
held nationalist convictions that earned him a spell in prison in the 1950s
during General Franco's dictatorship. He will undoubtably seek greater
devolution in Catalonia.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Chinese opt for economic reform in victory for Deng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S Communist party has committed itself unequivocally to economic
reform in a victory for the reformist strategy of the country's 87-year-old
paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, over hardline Marxists.
The ruling 15-man politburo, after a meeting this week in Beijing, said the
policies of reform and opening to the outside world would remain unchanged
'for 100 years'.
The reform strategy masterminded by Deng Xiaoping has been the subject of a
fierce power struggle between Deng's supporters, who want to speed up
change, and the party's Marxist hardliners, who warned that reform would
lead to capitalism. Deng, who has officially retired, disappeared from
public life last year but re-emerged in a visit to southern China early this
year. His tour was seen to back the opening of the economy, particularly
evident in provinces close to Hong Kong.
In a rare departure from the secrecy usually surrounding of China's main
newspapers - including the People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece -
yesterday gave the politburo session splash headlines on their front pages.
The People's Daily had taken a consistently hardline stance since the
crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. For
months, it frequently warned of the threat of 'peaceful evolution' to
capitalism and the dangers of bourgeois liberalism.
But it announced yesterday that the politburo had decided to 'firmly hold to
the party's basic line and not waver for a century, grasp the opportunity to
quicken reform and opening to promote the economy.'
Using language rarely seen in the official media in the months since the
1989 military action against student demonstrators, the People's Daily
reported the politburo's warning that the greatest threat comes not from
western-style liberalism, called 'rightism', but from hardline leftism.
'While keeping vigilance against 'right' deviation, the main attention
should be paid to guarding against 'left' deviation,' the paper said.
It echoed almost word for word the pro-reform language used by Deng when he
paid his visit in January to Guangdong province and the Shenzhen special
economic zone, the southern provinces which are seeing rapid economic growth
spurred by private enterprise.
Deng's strategy is to invigorate the economy using capitalist techniques
while maintaining the party's absolute monopoly of political power. It has
led to rapid growth and an influx of foreign investment, although the
economy still faces huge problems in its stifling bureaucracy and grossly
inefficient public sector.

FT  13 MAR 92 / US envoy joins Nixon attack over help for CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Strauss, the US ambassador in Moscow, has berated Americans from
both parties for ignoring the situation in the former Soviet Union in the
primary campaigns.
'I find it amazing,' he told a Senate hearing,' to come back in the middle
of a presidential campaign and find that a subject as important as what we
ought to be doing with respect to the republics of the former Soviet Union
hasn't been the subject of any appreciable discussion at all.
'The Russians want our leadership and the Europeans want to see us lead and
I think that can be put together,' he said. 'If it isn't, the great debate
we'll be reading about one of these days is why we blew it.'
The language is similar to the warnings issued this week by former President
Richard Nixon. But coming from a prominent Democrat appointed to Moscow last
year by Mr George Bush, a Republican president, Mr Strauss brings a certain
objective weight to the argument.
He stressed yesterday that aiding former Soviet republics ought not to be a
partisan political issue.
At a dinner on Wednesday night following a conference organised by the Nixon
Library, Mr Bush declared that 'we must find a way to square leadership with
the requirements of domestic renewal.' However, he said little about what
the US practically would be doing to assist Russia and the other republics.
Earlier, at his press conference, he had emphasised: 'We're living in a time
of constrained resources. There isn't a lot of money around and we are
spending too much of it as it already is.'
Though Mr Bush and Mr Nixon were careful to play down any differences
between them, the former president renewed warnings of the dangers of 'a new
isolationism.'
If Russian President Boris Yeltsin were to be overthrown, he would certainly
be replaced by a more unpleasant form of despotism, which would end up
costing the US much more to combat.
Mr Nixon's intervention, widely seen as another stage in his rehabilitation
after the disgrace of Watergate, has attracted widespread interest.
Wednesday night's conference dinner, attended by many members of his
Administration, was reported in the US press as much as a social and
political event as for its policy substance.
Even some of his inveterate opponents were moved to approve of what he had
to say. Senator Alan Cranston of California, for example, said he agreed
with Mr Nixon for the first time in years.
Seeking to exploit this in his inimitable manner, Mr Strauss argued that
'there is nothing more important that we can do' than provide full US
backing and funding for the International Monetary Fund's new focus on the
republics.
Proposals to help create a stabilisation fund for the rouble and on a new
IMF facility are currently held up in Congress and also the subject of
internal divisions inside the Administration.

Torrential rains have flooded a huge area in northern Bolivia, leaving

The government declared a state of emergency in the department of Beni late

(40,000 square miles) of grazing lands, a Beni civic committe official said.
Beni congressmen in La Paz said that the flood had swept away the homes of
some 10,000 families.
Local civic committee president Millan Rivera said the waters were
threatening to break a levee surrounding Trinidad, a city of 60,000 people
about 500 km (310 miles) northwest of La Paz.

BOWING to pressure from the army-backed provisional government, Haiti's
parliament yesterday delayed ratification of a proposed accord reinstating
ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Reuter reports from Port-au-Prince.
After meeting three government ministers, Senate Speaker Dejean Belizaire
said a special joint session of parliament's two houses to vote on the
accord was being postponed from yesterday to next Monday.
Members of the Chamber of Deputies, which wants to ratify the accord as soon
possible, accused Mr Belizaire of stalling on the government's behalf and
voiced fears of an outbreak of political violence.
It was the second time this week that the Senate's leader had delayed voting
on the accord, brokered by the Organisation of American States (OAS) and
aimed at settling the crisis set off by President Aristide's ouster in a
September 30 military coup.
The OAS has promised to lift a crippling trade embargo when the accord is
implemented.
Centrist Deputy Samuel Madistin said the government installed after the coup
was said to be holding out for two ministries in the incoming cabinet as a
guarantee it would not be investigated for corruption.

FT  13 MAR 92 / Mexico's proposal for dam upsets environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is planning to build a hydroelectric dam on the river
bordering the Guatemalan frontier, in a project that could seriously damage
the Lacandona rain forest, according to environmentalists and archaeologists
in Mexico and the US. It could also flood some of the country's most famous
archaeological sites, they say.
The dam would be built on the Rio Usumacinta, which flows through the
Lacandona, North America's largest rain forest. The dam, if sufficiently
high, could lead to the flooding of the ninth century Mayan city-states
Yaxchilan and Piedras Niegras. Ms Linda Schele, professor of art at the
University of Austin, Texas, said she had 'no doubt that one of the greatest
heritages of the human species will be buried and lost forever without ever
having been investigated.'
Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission has said that the project would not
damage archaeological sites and would not be approved until an environmental
and cultural impact study was completed.
The project, an earlier and larger version of which was dropped in 1989, has
particularly enraged environmentalists since President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari last month declared Yaxchilan part of an extended eco-archaeological
reserve in the Lacandona. Mr Homero Aridjis, president of the Grupo de los
Cien environmental group, said: 'It is another example of the government
keeping people in the dark and spreading disinformation.'
Mr Jeffrey Wilkerson, of the US institute for Cultural Ecology of the
Tropics, feared that the building of the dams would lead to new roads, and
settlements that would break up the rain forest's fragile eco-system, and
disrupt the culture of the Lacandon, an Indian tribe that lives in the
forest.
Mexico has just completed a census that shows population growth is slowing,
that the average age is rising, and, amazingly, that Mexico City is
shrinking.
The census estimates that just 81.3m people live in the country, of whom 38
per cent are less than 40 years old  - compared with unofficial estimates of
around 88m. The average age has increased from 16 to 19 years old.
The population as a whole rose by an average of just 2.3 per cent in the
decade.

FT  12 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Election news prompts heavy setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION yesterday that a general election will be held in the UK next
month fuelled increasing doubts in the stock market regarding the
vote-winning capacity of the government's Budget measures. Mounting concern
among market firms prompted the biggest one-day fall in the FT-SE 100 Index
since last year's failed coup in Russia.
In the late afternoon, after Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had
announced that April 9 would be general election day, share prices went into
almost free fall, and the Footsie closed 52.4 down at 2,522.4, or about 2
per cent lower.
The City's relatively negative view of the Budget put forward by Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, was quickly translated into
doubts over the electoral chances of the governing Conservative party.
However, the market's fall was restrained at first by a steady performance
from sterling.
Belief that it will now be difficult for UK base rates to be reduced ahead
of the election reinforced worries over the government's prospects of
remaining in office. Tomorrow is expected to bring the results from first
post-Budget opinion polls; the last opinion polls ahead of the Budget showed
the government dragging three points behind the opposition.
The setback in the Footsie largely reflected heavy arbitraging between stock
index futures and the underlying equities. At the close, the March contract
on the FT-SE Index was at a 10-point discount to the index itself.
While some lines of stock did come on offer, there was no great sell-off in
the share market. At last night's close, the FT-SE Index was only 11 points
below Friday's closing level.
A senior trader at one leading UK house commented: 'The market was telling
us that the pre-Budget rally should never have happened.' Nearly half of
yesterday's fall represented a correction of the 24-point gain in the
Footsie on Budget Day, when equities brushed off the less favourable
performance from government bonds.
As expected, equities opened lower and the Footsie was 12 points down in
early trading, although turnover was light at that stage. At Strauss
Turnbull, traders were advised to 'sell into any rallies'.
With sterling steady at first, some analysts suggested that base rates might
be cut during the election campaign - April 9 had long been pencilled in as
general election day by most of the leading UK-based securities trading
firms.
Share prices tried to rally but soon lost heart again as it was confirmed
that the election date would be announced at midsession. Firmness in the
pound failed to shake the views of many equity strategists that base rates
could not be cut this side of the election, and shares began to give ground.
Once the market started to slide, it was clear that there were few, if any,
buyers around. Tuesday's gains in interest rate-orientated stocks, such as
stores and building material groups, and also in brewing shares, were
sharply reversed. There were losses in the privatisation issues, which are
always highly vulnerable to fears that a Labour government might seek to
reverse their status.
Seaq-reported trading volume rose to 554.8m shares from the subdued total of
431.7m recorded on Budget Day.

<TEXT>
NEGATIVE sentiment about Tuesday's Budget sent stock index futures tumbling,
as dealers unwound positions taken on ahead of the chancellor's statement,
writes Joel Kibazo.
A modest advance fell away as the negative mood towards the Budget took
hold, and a sharp fall was seen in the March contract, which led the cash
market down.
The announcement of the election date, together with falls in the gilts and
money markets, only served to further weaken March, sending it to trade
around its fair value premium to cash and briefly at a discount to the cash
market.
The contract eventually closed at 2,525, down 45 on the day and below its
estimated fair value premium to cash of around 4. Turnover at more than
7,000 contracts was healthy. Further falls were recorded in after-hours'
dealing, with March at one point trading at 2,512, 10 points below the
closing level of the cash market, leading to speculation of a poor opening
today.
In the LTOM, volume reached 21,886 lots, with the FT-SE 100 index option
accounting for 1,035 contracts, as dealers took to hedging positions. BT,
seen as a defensive stock, was the busiest stock option on 911 lots dealt.

FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falters on interest rate
concern
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US EQUITIES faltered as Wall Street registered concern about the direction
of interest rates, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 22.36 to 3,208.63 in
unexceptional NYSE volume of 186m shares. Big board declines led advances by
more than two-to-one.
This negative sentiment was mirrored in the broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500, which receded 2.86 to 404.03, and there were similar declines in the
secondary market, where the Nasdaq composite fell 6.32 to 617.14. On Tuesday
the Dow rose about 16 points.
Both the stock market and the long end of the bond market were depressed
after President George Bush said he was 'more concerned about stimulating
the economy than pushing rates down'. While economic recovery is generally
positive for the market, Wall Street's recent strength has come from the
additional liquidity created by falling interest rates.
Weakness yesterday in overseas markets also contributed to the selling on
Wall Street.
The most active issue was Valassis Communications, which was quoted at
Dollars 16 3/4 . The initial offering of 22.1m shares was priced at Dollars
17 a share through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers, significantly below
the Dollars 20 to Dollars 23 price talked about before the flotation.
The company said it will have 43.3m shares outstanding after the offering,
with about 49 per cent held by a unit of Consolidated Press Holdings, the
company controlled by the Australian financier Mr Kerry Packer.
Shares in The Limited, the US fashion retailer, slipped Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 27 1/4 in very heavy trading. Home Shopping Network, a televised
24-hour shopping service, also saw heavy turnover and eased Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 8 1/4 .
The most active blue chip issues included RJR Nabisco, up Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 10 1/8 , Glaxo, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 27 1/8 , Philip Morris,
Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 76 5/8 , and AT&amp;T, Dollars  1/4 cheaper at
Dollars 38 1/4 .
The oil field equipment and service sector was weak, with Schlumberger
falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 , Halliburton losing Dollars 1 to
Dollars 25 3/4 and Dresser Industries slipping Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19
7/8 .
In the secondary market, United Retail Group led trading. The stock was
quoted at Dollars 16: an initial public offering of 4.4m shares was priced
at Dollars 15 a share.
Synalloy climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 5/8 after Oppenheimer initiated
coverage of the stock with a 'buy' recommendation.
Agouron Pharmaceutical jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 16 3/4 on reports
that its AG-331 drug has been effective against tumours in animal tests. The
company plans to make an investigational new drug filing later this year.
Canada
THE Toronto market dropped to its lowest level since late December on
growing concern about domestic interest rates.
The composite index fell 26.4 to 3,503.6 and declining issues outscored
advances by 371 to 192. Volume came to a heavy 33.2m shares. The gold group
was the only sector to post an appreciable gain, rising 0.72 per cent as
spot gold firmed USDollars 1.50 to Dollars 350.75 an ounce in New York.
Roman Corp had higher income from continuing operations in 1991 against
1990. The stock put on 5 cents to CDollars 2.20.
John Labatt was off CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 26 in spite of reporting
higher earnings for its third quarter and nine months.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Selling spoils dollar party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR saw earlier advances eroded in furious late trading as
speculative selling and central bank intervention dampened the market's
earlier optimism, writes Neil Buckley.
Sterling, meanwhile, had a quiet day after Tuesday's UK Budget, up a touch
against the D-Mark, and strengthening against the US currency at the end of
the day.
The dollar had approached the DM1.68 barrier, and surged against the yen to
a high of Y134.35 as a range of sellers gave the Japanese currency a
battering. In late afternoon, however, action by both Swiss National Bank,
which intervened to sell dollars and D-Marks, and a major south-east Asian
player, sparked off dollar profit-taking.
It closed at around DM1.6640, down from a DM1.6755/65 start, and at Y133.55
from Y133.87/97.
In Tokyo, intervention by the Bank of Japan had not been able to halt the
dollar's steady climb to Y133.69/74. The BoJ was reported to have sold a
total of Dollars 500m in five bouts of intervention between Y133 and
Y133.50, but without success.
'The Bank of Japan seems to have been whistling in the wind,' said Mr Peter
Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. 'I do not think other central banks
are interested in intervening and all the indicators point to a bearish
yen.'
Mr Luxton said good February US retail sales figures today - with estimates
varying from a 0.4 to 0.7 per cent increase - would reinforce dollar
optimism, and see it challenging the top of its range. Its next target could
be Y135.
The D-Mark was also stronger against the yen, reaching Y80.13/24 compared
with Y79.47/58 on Tuesday, although the Swiss National Bank intervention
achieved its aim by keeping it below SFr0.9100, to finish little changed at
SFr0.9070.
The D-Mark also fell against the French franc to its lowest level since last
August, but was little changed against most EMS currencies.
The pound was unruffled by a fall in UK equities and gilts, and final
confirmation of the date of the general election as April 9. It remained
close to its floor against the peseta, but firmed slightly against the
D-Mark to DM2.8716, from DM2.8697 at the opening.
Dealers said the strength of the peseta against the D-Mark was putting a
technical floor under the sterling/D-Mark rate which was preventing some
dealers from following their inclination to sell sterling short.
Attention today, however, will be focused on the first telephone opinion
polls since the Budget, although some are worried that it is too early to
assess its real impact.
Mr Luxton added: 'It may take some time for the Budget to feed through into
the opinion polls. It is a slow-fire Budget as opposed to a quick-fire one.'
Sterling firmed against the dollar at the close to Dollars 1.7257, from
Dollars 1.7187 on Tuesday.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian coffee exporters
favour return of quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COFFEE markets rose sharply yesterday in response to the radical
reversal of position by Brazil's coffee exporters, who late on Tuesday night
ended their opposition to export quotas, paving the way for a new
international coffee agreement.
The May robusta contract on the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox)
touched a high of Dollars 875 in early trading before closing at Dollars
858, up Dollars 26 on the day. Two weeks ago the May contract plumbed a
17-year low of Dollars 787 a tonne.
The May arabica contract in New York opened more than 3 cents ahead before
easing to 72.70 cents a lb, up 1.85 cents, at midday.
The Brazilian decision - taken after a tense meeting of 40 leading exporters
 -comes after intense diplomatic pressure on the country to come up with a
proposal before the next meeting of the International Coffee Organisation in
London on April 3. Last week a meeting of other Latin American producers
claimed they had lost Dollars 6bn in export revenues since the ICO export
quota system collapsed in July 1989; they said they would be seeking support
from Brazil, the world's biggest exporter.
Mr Oswaldo Aranha Neto, President of the Brazilian Coffee Exporters
Federation (Febec), said yesterday that Febec had decided to examine various
mechanisms for lifting prices and these might include a return to quotas.
Febec had decided to drop its steadfast resistance to quotas and a new
international agreement after seeing the worsening situation of growers,
many of whom are abandoning coffee cultivation because of falling prices.
Coffee prices have almost halved since the last agreement was broken in
1989. 'Our absolute priority is an increase in international prices and for
this Febec has to sacrifice some ideals,' he explained.
Mr Aranha played down the shift in Febec's position, stressing that
willingness to negotiate did not necessarily mean an acceptance of the quota
system, which he said 'had never benefited Brazil in the past'. But one
local trader described it as 'the demolition of the Berlin Wall of the
coffee world'.
The Brazilian Coffee Council, which brings together growers and exporters,
will now meet to agree on a joint position to be presented to the Brazilian
government. It will then decide whether to formulate a specific proposal at
next month's ICO meeting.
It is not yet clear whether the government will drop its resistance to
quotas. One Rio-based coffee trader commented: 'Febec has finally accepted
that Brazil was gaining nothing by sitting on the fence and refusing to
negotiate. It will be hard for the government to ignore such a clear
signal'.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said the
exporters had been forced to reverse their position. 'They realised that
given the level of prices and the political climate they could no longer
resist.'
The news was 'very positive' for a coffee agreement, he said. 'It removes
the last major obstacle to negotiate an accord.'

FT  12 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan expects to climb oil
reserves league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the Azerbaijani oil industry believe the politically troubled,
former Soviet republic will soon have proven oil wealth equivalent to that
of a 'middle ranking Middle Eastern state'. Several billions of barrels of
reserves have already been proven by their own experts and by Western oil
companies and more is expected in the next few months.
They are calling for extensive Western investment in the industry, a big
exporter before the 1917 Russian revolution.
Mr Valekh Alekserov, deputy chairman of Azeroil, the state concern grouping
all the republic's oil-related industries, said the reserves were very big,
and 'we expect that we will know about still bigger reserves'. That was also
the view of all the oil men who came to Azerbaijan from the US, Britain and
elsewhere, he added.
Mr Alekserov stressed that the company was anxious to sign a range of
agreements with Western companies - on the basis of production-sharing with
oil companies, which would exploit the reserves, and on a joint venture
basis with industrial companies, which would modernise and develop the
potential of the enterprises, building oil platforms and making oil
production equipment.
The Azerbaijani industry supplies 65 per cent of the equipment to the former
Soviet oil industry, the biggest in the world.
Mr Alekserov said that he was now discussing with western banks and
companies the financing of an oil pipeline, probably from Baku to a port in
the Black Sea, which would allow Azerbaijan to export its own production,
which it refines in the capital but which it must send through a pipeline to
Russia. He said that he expected a decision on this 'very soon'.
A consortium including Amoco and British Petroleum is now conducting a
feasibility study on offshore exploitation, which Mr Alekserov said should
be completed 'in the first half of the year'. He also said that a separate
study was being discussed with BP to prove further oil deposits in a
different sector.
His bullish estimates were borne out by Western oil men in Baku this week,
who talk in the same terms as he does about the potential for offshore
production in the Caspian Sea but with the important proviso that
legislation is soon put in place to protect foreign investment. Another is
that the government - at present a caretaker one following the resignation
of President Ayaz Mutalibov last week - will assure investors of its
support.
However, Mr Alekserov dismissed such fears, saying that 'the government here
did not interfere with us and will not interfere with us. They know that
they cannot develop any policy which runs against the interests of oil
production here. Everyone here understands that they must act in this way if
we want to co-operate with other countries and with foreign companies'.
He admitted, however, that while some legislation had been put in place,
more needed to be passed to bring the framework of law up to international
standards.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further output cuts ruled out
by Alcoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINUM COMPANY of America would make no more production cuts even though
the metal's price was near its lowest-ever level, said Mr Paul O'Neill,
chairman of the world's biggest aluminium group, yesterday.
He also echoed the industry's sense of frustration and impotence about the
flood of exports from Russia which were mainly responsible for pushing
aluminium prices down by 30 per cent last year.
Some estimated that Russian exports reached 1m tonnes in 1991, 'effectively
adding 10 per cent to the world supply out of the blue'. He suggested that
Russian smelters were 'an environmental disaster' and that if they were
forced fully to cover costs they would be out of business. Russian smelters
appeared to pay almost nothing for labour and capital, while the energy they
used 'is given away'.
But it would be difficult to square the principle of free markets and open
world trade by asking the Russians to curtail exports, said Mr O'Neill at a
briefing in London.
He predicted that Russian aluminium exports would continue high for some
time because producers there faced severely reduced demand from the defence
industry while domestic demand for consumer products would not build up
until the country had a stable currency. Until that time metal would be
exported to obtain the foreign currency to pay for essentials such as food.
The western world had no institution in place to deal with the break-up of a
country of 250m people, said Mr O'Neill.
Alcoa had set up a team to visit all the Russian aluminium production
centres, he revealed. 'We will do an intensive and careful analysis to see
if there is a place for (Alcoa) there.'
Alcoa's aluminium ingot shipments remained at 1.18m tonnes last year, two
thirds to its own fabricating plants. Its average realised price fell from
75 cents a lb to 67 cents. Its affiliate in Mexico shut its smelter and
Alcoa postponed negotiations to build a new smelter in Venezuela.
Mr O'Neill insisted that Alcoa's financial strength would carry it through
the industry's present problems. He said he was 'not pessimistic' about
1992. There were signs of renewed economic growth in the US which should
help a European recovery and 'along with that a greater potential for the
developed countries to help Russia get over these hard times'.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Move to push futures funds in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWPORT Investment Management is launching the first offshore managed
futures fund to be advised solely by UK-based specialists. The Newport
Number 1 Fund, launched today, will focus on growth, while two subsequent
funds will focus on protection and income and will be marketed to investment
managers, writes Tracy Corrigan.
The move represents a further effort to promote the growth of a European
managed futures industry. While the US managed futures industry now has more
than Dollars 20bn under management, the market in Europe is still at an
early stage.
European investors have shown some resistance to the concept of futures as a
separate asset class, and often view futures funds as risky.
Those funds which have been marketed in Europe are typically managed in the
US, where there is a large pool of expertise among so-called commodity
trading advisers (CTAs). The Newport fund will have a team of six
sub-advisers who come from both trading and fund management backgrounds.
'Derivatives have emerged as a new asset class at a time when conventional
instruments are struggling to meet investors' expectations,' said Mr Garnet
Harrison, chairman of Newport Investment Management.

business rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Exchange Commission voted yesterday to propose a new rule
that would ease registration rules for initial share offers from small
companies, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The SEC proposal would expand an existing rule known as Regulation A, which
allows small businesses to use a simplified disclosure document for initial
share offers. The new proposal would allow companies to use this regulation
for offers of up to Dollars 5m, against a current level of Dollars 1.5m.
The proposal would also allow small companies to use simplified disclosure
forms when they file quarterly and year-end financial statements.
The vote to propose the relaxed rules for small companies followed a long
and contentious meeting, during which Mr Richard Breeden, SEC chairman,
objected to an alternative plan from Mr Edward Fleischman, a senior SEC
member. The Fleischman plan would have allowed small companies to file
semi-annual, instead of quarterly, reports.
Mr Breeden noted that the agency's Regulation A - designed to make share
offers easier for small companies - was 'hardly used by anybody'.

GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that is controlled by
Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche, is planning to spend Dollars 260m, or more
than 50 per cent of its expected 1992 revenues, on research and development,
writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The company said yesterday its 1992 earnings would be between 10 and 12
cents a share, which contrasts with 1991 full-year earnings of 39 cents a
share, or Dollars 44.3m. Genentech's 1992 revenues would be unchanged on

Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the largest French commercial banking

General Mills, the US food and restaurant group, yesterday reported a small
drop in third-quarter profits, from Dollars 134.1m to Dollars 132.1m after
tax, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
This takes the total for the first nine months to February 23, to Dollars
402.5m, compared with Dollars 381.8m a year earlier.
However, General Mills said the comparisons were muddied by unusual charges
and earlier asset sale gains.
The group said the restaurant side saw operating profits improve by 24 per
cent in the third quarter ahead of one-off charges, while the consumer food
division advanced by 9 per cent.
General Mills shares fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 1/2 .

FT  12 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slide further as fears over PSBR
plans deepen

UK GOVERNMENT bonds continued to slide in the wake of the Budget, as the
market showed concern over the government's forecast borrowing requirement
for the next financial year.
With a forecast Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 28bn for
1992-93, the gilt market expects to see gross issuance of about Pounds 33bn,
or Pounds 2.75bn a month. Gilts lost between  3/8 and  3/4 of a percentage
point, continuing Tuesday's sharp fall in prices. Traders said the fall in
the US bond market also helped to depress gilts.
The Liffe gilt futures market fell from 95.21 at its opening to close at
95.13 on a volume of about 50,000 contracts, more than double the average
level. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 dropped from the
overnight level of 114 1/4 to end yesterday at 113 15/32 . Short-dated
issues fell by  3/8 of a percentage point.
Following yesterday's announcement of a general election on April 9, traders
said the market was expected to focus even more keenly on the opinion polls,
looking to see what effect the Budget has had on the Conservative Party's
popularity.
US TREASURY bond prices slipped slightly on the back of continued
profit-taking ahead of today's release of the February sales report.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year bond was off  19/32 in light trading
at 100 1/2 , yielding 7.95 per cent. The two-year note firmed 1/16 to yield
5.5 per cent.
In addition to fears of strong February sales data, the long end was further
depressed by comments by President George Bush indicating that economic
growth was of more pressing concern to the government than the level of
long-term interest rates. Furthermore, players are becoming worried that an
impending federal tax package will prove inflationary.
The Federal Reserve entered the market to arrange overnight matched sales
when Fed Funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were trading at
3 13/16 per cent. The operation, which drains liquidity from the banking
system, was widely expected, with Fed Funds trading below the Fed's
perceived target of 4 per cent.
THE combination of a weaker US Treasury bond market and concerns over German
wage inflation depressed German government bond prices.
Volumes in the Liffe bund futures were below average at about 34,000
contracts. The bund futures contract fell from its opening of 88.44 to close
at 88.30.
Traders said news that Germany's white-collar union workers may step up
their strike action did not help the market. In addition, bunds have been
held in check by the poor inflation figures released recently. The west
German annual inflation rate rose to 4.3 per cent in February from 4 per
cent in January.
JAPANESE government bonds ended mixed, with the futures market outperforming
the cash market, traders said.
The yen weakened against the US dollar, from Y132.5 on Tuesday to Y133.70 in
Tokyo yesterday, in spite of intervention by the Bank of Japan which sold
dollars for yen. The weakening prompted some selling of cash bonds, and the
benchmark No 129 issue ended at a yield of 5.435 per cent, against 5.410 per
cent at Tuesday's close.
However, traders added that hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate
appeared to spur buying of Japanese bond futures. The futures contract
opened at 102.30 and reached 102.42 before closing at 102.35. Interest rates
on three-month certificates of deposit fell back from 5.00 per cent to as
low as 4.93 per cent on rate-cut speculation.

AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported unchanged profits
after financial items of SKr1.43bn (Dollars 236m) for 1991 and predicted
that earnings will remain broadly the same in 1992. The dividend is going up
to SKr8.50 from SKr8.
Sales rose by 2.5 per cent to SKr12.7bn.
However, the operating profit after normal depreciation fell by 7 per cent
to SKr1.45bn due mainly to lower earnings in its gas division.
Profits for the gas operations fell by 13 per cent to SKr1.1bn, reflecting
decreased earnings in its Brazilian subsidiary.
Gas sales were unchanged at SKr8.5bn.
Frigoscandia, its food processing and cold storage business, reported a 22
per cent growth in profits to SKr202m due to higher capacity use of cold
store units. Sales increased by 6 per cent to SKr2.8bn.
Aga's Uddeholm energy unit, which was sold last month to the Swedish power
company Gullspang, reported a 18 per cent increase in earnings to SKr118m,
while sales increased by 9 per cent to SKr1.3bn.
Huhtamaki, the Finnish confectionery, packaging and pharmaceuticals group,
reported a 6 per cent increase in profits after financial items to FM251m
(Dollars 55m) for 1991.
The dividend has been increased to FM2.70 from FM2.60.
Sales rose by 2 per cent to FM5.9bn. Huhtamaki said that 1992 would be
another year of slow growth in both sales and earnings.
The confectionery group, which accounted for 55 per cent of total corporate
sales, increased sales by 12 per cent to FM3.2bn. But its operating profits
were virtually unchanged. There was a slight decline in profits for the
packaging sector, although sales rose by 2 per cent to FM1.2bn.
The food units recorded a more steep fall in profits while sales slumped by
21 per cent to FM767m due to the depressed Finnish economy and the virtual
cessation of exports to the former Soviet Union.
The pharmaceutical business was mainly responsible for Huhtamaki's earnings
increase as the division increased operating profits by a third, although
sales fell by 6 per cent to FM644m.
Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and enzymes producer, increased
pre-tax profits by 28 per cent to DKr1.46bn (Dollars 225m) last year, while
net profits rose by 22 per cent to Dkr928m, a return on equity of 11.2 per
cent.
Sales increased 16 per cent to DKr9.37bn. An unchanged dividend of DKr4 per
share is planned on increased capital.
The only set-back reported in the preliminary statement after a year of
advance on almost all fronts was that the development of a nasal insulin
preparation, for which promising trials were reported last summer, required
'further optimisation' and would be delayed by one to two years.
Substantial new investment would be made in Denmark and abroad in expanding
production capacity in 1992, the company said.
The group made no forecast for 1992, but said that it hoped to achieve a
result compatible with its aim of a long-term annual increase in pre-tax
profits of at least 15 per cent.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: A very good place to own a bank
 -The numbers behind the 83% rise at HSBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What's good for Hong Kong is clearly good for the Hongkong Bank . . . and
vice versa. So said Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings on Tuesday
night after announcing an 83 per cent rise in 1991 profits to HKDollars
5.66bn (USDollars 730m).
Some in the colony may take issue with Mr Purves's afterthought but none
would question the validity of his first observation.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank had a year to turn many a British or US banker
green with envy. But the results continued to underline the importance of
Hong Kong to its profitability and future; it remains the bank's treasure
trove.
The bank does not make it easy to divine the source of its profits.
Regulators in the US and Australia make it come clean about its profits and,
more to the point, losses in their jurisdiction, but not in Hong Kong where
banks are allowed to salt away earnings in hidden reserves.
The best way to get an inkling of the bank's domestic Hong Kong business is
to restate its declared profit on a 'before losses' basis.
As all its loss-making operations are in the US, Australia and, until
recently, the UK, then its profit centre must be the Asia Pacific region, of
which Hong Kong is known to represent the bulk.
By adding back the losses it appears that the board of the bank decided on a
profit before losses of HKDollars 7.4bn, a virtually identical figure to the
before losses profit in 1990. By keeping that figure virtually constant the
rebound in last year's profits is explained by the turnround in the bank's
operations in the developed world.
However, Mr Purves gave a hint as to what the bank transferred this year to
hidden reserves. He said the transfer to inner reserves was greater than the
profit the bank made on the sale of part of its stake in Cathay Pacific, the
Hong Kong airline. That sale produced an exceptional profit of HKDollars
1.6bn.
That takes 1991 net profit, before transfers to inner reserves, to more than
HKDollars 7.3bn.
While this figure accounts for a lot of the bank's profit last year it does
not appear to account for much profit growth in the Hong Kong part of the
business.
So what happened in Hong Kong? Mr Purves said that the local bank did well
last year. He added that its growth in profits was of a similar order to
other local banks.
Hang Seng, the nearest in size to the bank - excluding the 13 member banks
of the Bank of China group, which do not report - reported a near 30 per
cent growth in net earnings last year.
The Bank of East Asia - a distant third in the rankings - reported a 30 per
cent rise in its net profits.
Hong Kong was one of the best places in the world to own a bank last year.
Last June the government, in an attempt to dampen a feverish housing market,
engineered a rise in bank lending rates but did not allow an increase in
deposit interest rates. It wanted to preserve the colony's fixed link with
the US dollar and a rise in local deposit rate could have fuelled demand for
the Hong Kong dollar.
Bank analysts at Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, estimate that
the average lending spread for all banks in the colony rose from about 3 per
cent mid-year to more than 5 per cent by the end of 1991.
This is a large change in margins, and one which seems likely to prevail at
least until the middle of this year, but possibly longer - underwriting bank
profitability for much of the year.
Mr John Gray, the bank's executive deputy chairman, said yesterday that a
close eye was kept on costs and further gains in productivity sought in the
Hong Kong operations as well as in overseas subsidiaries.
There is more. Mr Gray said the board had taken a decision this time to put
a lot more into the bank's general reserve. This was prudent because of the
uncertainty surrounding the economic situation in North America, Europe and
Australia, Mr Gray said.
At Tuesday night's press conference Mr Purves killed two hares, until then
scampering through financial markets, stone dead. The bank would not be
having a rights issue this year and it would not be making a European
acquisition either. Its preference remained for an 'alliance' along with the
one it enjoys with Wells Fargo in the US.
However, he did set another hare running. Last April's changes to the bank's
structure - the bank's assets were rearranged and ownership vested in the UK
incorporated HSBC Holdings - prompts the thought in some analysts' minds,
notably Mr John Mulcahy of Peregrine, the local broker, that it could float
equity in Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, the subsidiary which manages
the Asia Pacific assets.
Mr Purves said he would not preclude it, but added that it was not on the
agenda and not before the board.
He did say that the holding company would begin to take on responsibilities
best handled at a global level, and that the board of the bank in Hong Kong
would become more localised, while the board of the holding company would
become more international in its representation.
Changes are happening at a senior management level. Mr Gray said that within
18 months a general restructuring of the bank should be complete, involving
the transfer of treasury risk and policy analysis, legal and management
information systems, and human resources, among others.
'This process will evolve,' Mr Gray said. 'We want to avoid creating more
management layers and additional costs.'
However, as 1997 appr-oaches, it is not impossible to conceive of a
situation where a large minority interest in the main subsidiary were
floated - or placed.
This would satisfy the appetite for international investors to own a slice
of one of the best regional banks in Asia; if a part were sold to a mainland
Chinese company it may be a way for the bank to secure its relations with
Beijing.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hertz modifies NY plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERTZ, the largest car rental company in the US, yesterday qualified its
highly controversial plan to introduce surcharges for New York City rental
customers - just one day before the New York City Council is due to vote on
a plan to ban residence-based surcharges, writes Nikki Tait.
Hertz, 49 per cent owned by Ford Motor Company, is now proposing to exempt
certain New York City residents who qualify under a 'responsible renter'
programme from the daily surcharge scheme. To qualify, a resident would need
a driving record free of accidents for three years, and to have been
employed for at least one year.
Someone applying under the scheme would pay a one-off processing fee of
Dollars 25.
Hertz's decision earlier this year to introduce daily surcharges on cars
rented by residents living in four of the city's five boroughs, unleashed a
storm of protest.
The surcharges would range from Dollars 3 a day for Manhattan residents to
Dollars 56 a day for Bronx residents. Queens residents would pay Dollars 15
a day, and Brooklyn residents, Dollars 34. Cars rented in New York,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New Jersey would be affected.
Critics claimed that this was illegal discrimination, weighing unfairly on
areas with large ethnic populations.
But Hertz claimed its action reflected the underlying cost situation - with
rentals in these areas tending to result in more accidents and suits from
pedestrians and others injured.

THE END to another big US retail bankruptcy came into sight yesterday, when
a US bankruptcy court approved the reorganisation plan put forward by Revco.
The plan is likely to take effect within a few weeks.
Revco, based in Ohio, operates 1,150 drug stores in 10 states and is one of
the nation's largest chains.
The retailer's prospective 'rebirth' echoes the successful re-emergence from
bankruptcy of the Allied and Federated Department Stores chains - previously
part of Campeau Corporation - earlier this year.
Revco was taken private via a leveraged buyout in 1986, and filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy less than two years later.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y acts to allay concern on
financial state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the Canadian property group and developer of London's Canary
Wharf, has been taking steps to allay concerns about its financial
condition.
A quiet word from senior O&amp;Y officials is understood to have contributed to
a decision by Dominion Bond Rating Service, Canada's largest credit-rating
agency, to reaffirm ratings late last week on publicly-traded O&amp;Y
securities. The ratings, which classified the securities as investment
grade, had been issued only a few weeks before. The decision to reaffirm
them was 'unusual, but the circumstances were unusual,' said a DBRS
official.
Shortly after the DBRS announcement, Mr Oskar Lustig, O&amp;Y's comptroller, set
up a conference call to the seven Canadian securities dealers who make a
market in the company's commercial paper.
According to other participants in the call, Mr Lustig stressed the
reaffirmed ratings, and outlined O&amp;Y's plans for an orderly retirement of
the commercial paper programme.
An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday the redemption of the commercial paper was
'being done in a very orderly way'. About CDollars 270m of CDollars 500m in
one of two series of paper has already been redeemed. The intention is to
retire all CDollars 800m outstanding as it matures.
As part of its efforts to raise cash, O&amp;Y is also understood to be on the
point of selling its controlling interest in Home Oil, a Calgary-based oil
and gas producer. It is also seeking buyers for its stakes in Abitibi-Price,
the large newsprint producer, and Gulf Canada Resources, another energy
group.
These moves appear to have had only limited success, however, in restoring
outsiders' confidence in O&amp;Y. For instance, trading has dried up in bonds
secured by First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey Toronto flagship building.
One tranche of the bonds, maturing next year, currently yields 3.2
percentage points more than equivalent Canadian government paper. By
contrast, the spread on 10-year bonds issued by Hammerson Canada, another
property developer, is only 1.9 percentage points.
The Reichmann family, which owns O&amp;Y, has consistently refused to disclose
details of the parent company's financial condition, even to backers of
their projects.
One senior Toronto real estate expert said yesterday that 'they're paying
the price for all their secrecy'. He said outsiders were unable to assess
the full extent of the Reichmann family's debts.
On at least two occasions in the past fortnight O&amp;Y has made an unusually
late redemption of maturing commercial paper. A trader at one securities
firm said that Royal Bank of Canada, which acts as O&amp;Y's issuing and paying
agent, waited until after 6pm last Monday to redeem paper maturing that day.
It is usual for redemptions to take place earlier, during the main part of
the working day. A Royal Bank official said yesterday that the time of
payment generally reflects when the paper is covered by the issuing company.
O&amp;Y is also understood to have turned down a proposal last week by
securities dealers that it become more active in creating a secondary market
to support its commercial paper.
On March 5, O&amp;Y sold its controlling shareholding in Interprovincial Pipe
Line (IPL), which operates the world's longest oil pipeline network.
GW Utilities, which is 89 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, sold its 63.5 per cent
stake in IPL for CDollars 26 a share, which was below the prevailing market
price. The shares, trading at CDollars 27 3/4 before the deal, are being
sold on an instalment basis, with full payment due only in March 1993. But
GW Utilities said it plans to pay a special dividend of CDollars 4.50 a
share 'at the earliest possible date'.
The IPL sale, which will bring O&amp;Y CDollars 160m in dividends, marks the
fourth time since January 1991 that GWU has paid a special dividend to O&amp;Y
as a result of asset sales.

<TEXT>
SOARING interest charges forced Whitegate Leisure, the bowling alley and
discotheque company, into the red with losses of Pounds 1.1m for the year to
December 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.1m last time.
Interest charges shot up by 80 per cent to Pounds 4.1m, with borrowings of
Pounds 31m at the end of the year. The group reassured shareholders that it
was trading within its banking facilities.
The result was further depressed by extraordinary provisions of Pounds 8.5m
(Pounds 1.6m). The charges were taken to cover expected losses on the
disposal of the group's French leisure business and nursing homes
subsidiary.
An exceptional write-down on assets and the costs of restructuring totalled
Pounds 784,000.
Mr Nick Oppenheim, chairman, said the group had an 'unsatisfactory year',
despite cutting administration costs by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2.5m. Turnover
at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 21.7m) had been below expectations.
As a result the group was passing the dividend payment. Last year, Whitegate
paid 1.5p.
The loss per share was 4.2p, compared with a profit of 3.3p last time.
Mr Oppenheim said Whitegate intended to reduce its 90 per cent gearing
through the disposal of non-core assets. However, he warned that such sales
would take time in the current depressed climate.
Mr Oppenheim was giving his final statement as chairman of Whitegate. He
will resign at the annual general meeting, to be replaced by Mr Alexander
Cassells, a chartered accountant.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant Vimto sales behind JN Nichols rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising sales of Vimto helped JN Nichols (Vimto), the Manchester-based soft
drinks manufacturer, to an 8.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
7.1m to Pounds 7.71m in 1991.
The advance was achieved in spite of a 5.6 per cent decline in turnover from
Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 47m as a result of a drop in contract canning.
A poor British summer and the recession failed to damage Vimto, with cordial
sales up 12 per cent and a small increase in sales of bottled carbonates.
Sales of canned Vimto were down 5 per cent, but the company estimates that
there was a downturn of some 12 per cent for the industry as a whole.
Growth continued at Cabana Soft Drinks and Nichols Foods. Earnings per share
rose to 32.6p (28.5p) and a final dividend of 7.7p is proposed making a
total for the year of 12.3p (11p).

SIMON Engineering's shares fell 34p to 246p yesterday after the company
announced halved profits and an unchanged, but uncovered, final dividend.
Simon, the engineering, environmental and industrial services group,
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.3m in the year to the end of
December, compared with Pounds 36.5m. The company blamed the recession,
which was deeper than expected especially in the US, and said this year
would again be difficult.
Earnings per share fell from 30.4p to 12.5p but the company is recommending
the final dividend be maintained at 10.7p for an unchanged total of 15.7p.
Mr Roy Roberts, chairman, said: 'Prospects are such that we think it's
reasonable to leave the dividend uncovered. I think we will earn enough in
the current year to cover the dividend.'
Turnover slipped to Pounds 514.5m (Pounds 545.7m) including Pounds 13.1m
(Pounds 56.3m) from discontinued activities. Operating profits of Pounds
26.2m (Pounds 38.7m) included losses from discontinued activities of Pounds
1.47m (Pounds 62,000 profits).
Sales and profits from the access division were affected by recession in the
construction industry. Operating profits fell to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 12.1m).
Process engineering also reported lower operating profits of Pounds 5.1m
(Pounds 8.7m). The figure was dragged down by losses in the paper
engineering business, which has been affected by a downturn in the US, and
lower pulp prices.
But industrial services lifted operating profits 6.3 per cent to Pounds
15.1m. This included seven months of profits from Robertson. Environmental
services increased sales to Pounds 97.1m (Pounds 72.5m) but profits slipped
to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.9m), partly due to restructuring costs.
The lower contribution from property disposals of Pounds 279,000 (Pounds
3.86m) has been taken above the line as exceptional income for the first
time. There was also an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 4.17m)
for rationalisation costs, including 750 redundancies.
Interest charges more than doubled to Pounds 5.92m (Pounds 2.24m),
reflecting borrowings taken on to purchase Robertson. Net debt at year end
was Pounds 37m for gearing of 30.5 per cent.
COMMENT
Yesterday's sharp fall in Simon's share price looks a little harsh,
especially since it has already underperformed its sector by more than 50
per cent over the last 12 months. The reason for the fall is simple.
Although dividends have been maintained, the market is now worried this
year's will also be uncovered, and therefore probably cut. The company is
cautious about the year so far, but a number of factors will work in its
favour, even if the access and process engineering divisions continue at
these depressed levels. This year will see rationalisation benefits rather
than costs. Last year's Pounds 6.5m extraordinary loss on disposals should
not be repeated, and Robertson will make a full contribution for the first
time. Forecast profits of about Pounds 23m give a prospective multiple of
17, while forecasts for 1993 of Pounds 35m brings the multiple down to 10.
But Simon is likely to benefit later rather than sooner from economic
recovery, and it is difficult to see much upside in the shares at this
stage.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Bowed down by a spate of disputes: Japan's troubled
securities houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Masahiro Dozen was appointed president of Daiwa Securities at the
peak of the bull market in Japanese equities, he jokingly talked of
promoting a selection of stocks as 'Dozen's dozen'.
Yesterday he was in a different mood when he resigned saying his short term
of two years and five months in office had 'seemed like a very long time'.
Daiwa forecast a Y43bn (Pounds 189.4m) net loss for the year to March 31,
compared with a profit of Y146bn in Mr Dozen's first year. He was also
forced to announce yesterday the Y72bn loss caused by tobashi disputes - in
which brokers manipulated clients' accounts to help them dress up the
accounts.
Even before taking this extraordinary loss into account, Daiwa's results are
forecast to be the worst in real terms since the Japanese stock market
crisis of the 1960s. At the pre-tax level, Daiwa forecasts a profit of just
Y13bn, against Y119bn in 1991 and Y313bn in 1990.
While the extraordinary loss is particularly severe, Daiwa's troubles are
shared by the rest of the Japanese securities industry.
All the 250-odd stockbroking companies are suffering the worst slump in
prices and turnover since the 1960s. They are also having to settle disputes
with clients over trading losses suffered since the bull market ended in
1989.
To make matters worse, they have to regain their reputations following a
spate of stock market scandals, including allegations of wrong-doing arising
from the tobashi disputes.
Daiwa is in no immediate financial trouble. All the Big Four brokers -
Nomura Securities, Nikko Securities, Yamaichi Securities and Daiwa -
accumulated substantial reserves in the bull market.
Daiwa's consolidated shareholders' equity stood at Y1,069bn at the end of
March 1991. It is less profitable than Nomura, the largest house, but
comfortably ahead of Nikko and especially Yamaichi, which has already
forecast an expected pre-tax loss of more than Y10bn for the year to the end
of March.
Daiwa's net result will probably be worse than Yamaichi's but the fact that
it expects to be in the black at the pre-tax level is crucial - it means it
is not losing on its day-to-day business.
Smaller companies are in a far worse position. Ten out of 14 second-tier
houses expect losses for the year. However, even the larger groups are
concerned about continuing disputes with clients over portfolio losses.
The total capitalisation of companies listed on the First Section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange has dropped from Y590,000bn at the end of 1989 to under
Y350,000bn - a loss of more than Y240,000bn.
Only a small fraction of these losses is in dispute. But there is no
estimate yet of how big that fraction might be. Worse, the success of the
claim made by Tokyo Department Store, which won Y49.5bn from Daiwa, is bound
to encourage other suits.
Moreover, in as much as the disputes bring to light shady commercial
practices, such as window-dressing accounts, the disclosures will put the
industry under renewed scrutiny from the finance ministry.
That, in turn, will hurt efforts to restore the market's reputation
following last year's scandals involving links with gangsters and
compensation pay-ments for favoured investment clients.
So far, only small broking companies have lost their independence. But even
medium-sized companies are being forced to make drastic cost savings, even
closing offices. The longer the industry recession goes on, the more likely
it is the Big Four, Daiwa included, will have to resort to such extreme
measures.

FT  12 MAR 92 / MPs criticise role of Bank in BCCI affair: Dissenting Labour
members of committee take tougher line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's role in the supervision of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International yesterday received comparatively mild criticism in a report
prepared by a cross-party House of Commons committee.
Although the report implies that the Bank should have closed BCCI long
before July 5 1991, when it was shut, it does not state this explicitly.
The committee said it was important that henceforth the 'minimum criteria
for authorisation (of a bank) should be strictly interpreted'.
One Bank official admitted: 'The report was surprisingly tame in some
respects.'
Last night, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England,
dismissed calls from two Labour MPs, Mr Brian Sedgemore and Mr Keith Vaz,
that he should resign. He said there was 'nothing to resign about'.
The four Labour MPs on the committee, who include Mr Sedgemore, disagreed
strongly with the report's conclusions and have made much sharper criticisms
of the Bank, which are recorded in committee minutes.
The Labour group accused Mr Leigh-Pemberton of the 'grossest negligence' for
failing to close down BCCI after receiving many warning signs that it was
corrupt. They also accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of a
'dereliction of duty' for his failure to recommend closure at the time when
he was chancellor of the exchequer.
Responding to the main report, the Bank repudiated 'the implication' that it
should have closed BCCI earlier. It received information long before July
1991, such as BCCI's links to terrorist organisations and to drug money
laundering, which put in doubt BCCI's fitness to carry on business as a
bank. But the Bank said yesterday that it believed at the time that the
interests of depositors would have been damaged by closure.
'Under banking legislation, when we contemplate what action to take against
a bank, we have to consider both the behaviour of the bank and the effect on
depositors of closure,' the Bank said.
The Bank said that it was not until July 1991 that it had incontrovertible
evidence that depositors' interests would not be served by keeping the bank
afloat.
The report said that there was a 'climate of opinion' in the Bank which
'favoured reconstruction and reform rather than restrictions and closures'.
It said: 'We . . . question why the Bank of England did not at least
restrict BCCI's ability to accept new deposits.'
The report added that the interests of potential depositors were damaged by
the failure to close BCCI earlier. 'In retrospect that is true', the Bank
said. Though it said it had no way of knowing that at the time.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UN spurns Iraqi plea on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council yesterday flatly rejected Iraq's claim that it had
honoured its obligations under the Gulf war ceasefire terms and the US and
Britain again raised the possibility that force might be necessary to compel
it to comply.
In Washington US President George Bush said he would 'contemplate all
alternatives' to force Iraq to destroy its dangerous weapons. 'There will be
no compromise on the part of the US with full compliance with the UN
resolutions,' he said.
At the United Nations his words were echoed by Sir David Hannay, British UN
ambassador, and by his American counterpart, Mr Thomas Pickering. They were
speaking at a meeting of the UN Security Council, attended by Iraqi deputy
prime minister Tariq Aziz, at which Baghdad was accused of trying to outwit
and sometimes harass UN teams sent to find and scrap its weapons of mass
destruction.
Mr Hannay said force was used to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait 'because
Iraq miscalculated and believed that this council was bluffing'. He said he
hoped Iraq would 'not again miscalculate'.
In his hour-long address to the council, Mr Aziz said Iraq was 'no longer in
possession of any weapons, munitions or major or minor systems' prohibited
by UN resolutions, and asked how long the council would maintain the
crippling economic embargo imposed on his country after its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
'The question constantly asked by 18m Iraqis, together with millions more
honest free people in the world, is: for how long will this iniquitous siege
continue to be imposed upon Iraq?' Mr Aziz said.
Minutes after the Security Council gathered in extraordinary session
yesterday, Mr Diego Arria, chief delegate of Venezuela and current
president, read an 11-page list of Iraqi transgressions.
Drafted privately by the 15 members, this again demonstrated the remarkable
cohesion that has marked the council's handling of the Gulf crisis since
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
The UN council concluded that 'Iraq has not fully complied with the
obligations placed on it' but welcomed this opportunity to air the problem.
Mr Aziz, leading a 14-member team he termed a goodwill mission, sat
stone-faced in a reserved seat near the council's horseshoe table as Mr
Arria read the document.
Emphasising the inferior role accorded to him in the council proceedings, he
was made to deliver his statement only after speeches from all the council's
members.
The council said Mr Aziz's claim that innocent women, children and old
people were suffering 'very, very bad effects' from continued sanctions was
belied by Iraq's refusal to sell Dollars 1.6bn of oil under special UN
authority, with Dollars 1bn of the proceeds permitted to be used for
humanitarian needs.
Mr Aziz's plea was also undermined by a warning from Saddam Hussein, Iraq's
leader, early today that he would not tolerate polls planned for next month
by Iraq's Kurdish minority for a new parliament unless they cut links with
Western countries who are protecting them from his army.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Bush and Clinton look to crucial Midwest primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas yesterday set
their sights on the industrial Midwest after convincing victories in
Tuesday's round of presidential primary elections.
Mr Bush, conspicuously relaxed at a press conference, avoided direct
reference to Mr Clinton or his Republican challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan,
preferring to direct his fire at the Democrats in Congress.
In sweeping all eight Super Tuesday party primaries and winning nearly 400
delegates to Mr Buchanan's 30, the president is about halfway to the 1,105
delegates he needs for a first ballot nomination in Houston in August.
Mr Buchanan, acknowledging that Mr Bush had done well, nevertheless pledged
to make a big fight of it next Tuesday in Michigan, which has a high rate of
unemployment and is therefore discontented with the administration's
economic policies.
On the Democratic side, Mr Clinton took eight of 11 primaries and caucuses
and won about 430 delegates, compared with just over 200 for former
Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas and 25 for former California Governor
Jerry Brown. However, with just over 700 delegates, he is only one third of
the way towards the 2,145 needed for the nomination.
Mr Tsongas yesterday said he would not allow Mr Clinton to 'pander' his way
into the nomination by appealing to everyone. He also said that his national
credentials were better than those of Mr Clinton because he had won more
primaries outside his home base than the Arkansas governor had outside the
south.
On Tuesday Mr Tsongas won the Delaware caucuses, as well as the
Massachusetts and Rhode Island primaries, while Mr Clinton swept the south,
Florida and Hawaii.
For all the candidates, next week's Illinois and Michigan primaries are
important. Mr Bush could reduce Mr Buchanan into a polemical irritant, and
Mr Clinton, whose organisation is far better than his rivals, could leave Mr
Tsongas trailing so badly that money and support will dry up.
Mr Brown, however, survives on less financial support, appeals to a big
dissident Democratic minority, and will undoubtedly continue. For the
Democrats, the battle is for the union vote in these two states.
At his press conference Mr Bush was happy to float above the partisan fray,
apart from his criticisms of Congress. In particular he distanced himself
from a recent and controversial Pentagon study paper which foresees the US
doing whatever is necessary to maintain its status as the sole military
superpower.
He also said he did not disagree with ex-president Richard Nixon over the
importance of helping the states of the former Soviet Union, adding that his
administration was studying issues such as a rouble stabilisation fund.

FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be premature to advocate the stockmarket rehabilitation of
Hillsdown Holdings. But judging by yesterday's results, things were never as
bad as the group managed to make them seem. A disastrous year in the UK
poultry business apart, Hillsdown's was a respectable trading performance in
1991. If only that had been mirrored in its investor relations.
Shareholders, whose dwindling faith was shattered by last September's rights
issue, were offered the sop of a 10 per cent dividend increase, surprising
enough to move the shares higher.
Given how damaging the rights episode has proved, it is worth pointing out
Hillsdown's enviably healthy gearing of 12 per cent. Management is gradually
setting out its long-term strategy, which finally includes the disposal of
non-food businesses. But it will take more than a year of steady progress to
convince the market that Hillsdown can be trusted to play to its strengths.
Meanwhile, the case for any further acquisitions will have to be rock solid.
Despite its much fitter operational base, Hillsdown must also run fast to
overcome the handicaps of a rising tax charge and dilution following the
rights issue. Although it is hard to see the shares ever recovering their
premium rating of old, a 6.7 per cent historic yield already discounts a
fair degree of scepticism. Once the UK poultry market improves, they might
just join those of Dalgety in the dull but reliable class.

FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an air of anti-climax about Standard Chartered. Though its 1991
results were tarnished by a Pounds 36m retrospective tax provision for Union
Bank of California, the main picture is of a bank finally on the way to
recovery. Unfortunately, healthy is also revealed as dull.
Rising costs have taken the sparkle off the abnormally wide interest margins
in Hong Kong last year. Net interest income remains depressed by the
suspension of payments by UK problem borrowers. Provisions may not be on the
scale of the other UK clearers, but that leaves less scope for profits to
bounce. The shares will hardly out-perform much longer: they have risen 40
per cent against the sector during the last six months.

FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BTR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of whether BTR deserves its below average rating will not be
easily resolved by yesterday's 3 per cent slip in pre-tax profits. The good
news is that there were no nasty surprises in the 1991 figures, while, if
anything, the case for buying the shares as a cyclical recovery stock has
been enhanced. Not only are costs being extracted in BTR's ferociously
efficient way - 10 per cent of the workforce last year, excluding Hawker
Siddeley, after a 7 per cent cut in employee numbers in 1990. The company is
now talking for the first time about a pick-up in the US and, more
guardedly, Australia.
A lot depends, though, on how quickly action on Hawker will translate into
higher margins. Any pressures on the profit and loss account will certainly
be relieved by the Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m of provisions already taken, and
by the Pounds 50m or so which might be added in the current year once
Hawker's long-term contracts have been given a careful going over.
BTR's utilisation record cannot be faulted; the worry is that at least half
of the provisions could involve cash outlay rather than asset write-downs.
Gearing may therefore fall more slowly than it did after BTR's previous
mouthfuls. Along with the inconsistent dividend signals and lack of
strategic clarity, that may keep the bulls in check a while yet.

FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so long ago, the gilts market was unruffled by the prospect of a sharply
increasing PSBR. The perceived wisdom was that with sterling in the ERM,
gilts were attractive to a broad base of European investors. Declining
inflation meant higher real yields. Capital gains were in prospect as UK
yields converged with those of Germany. So was the market over-doing things
in driving prices down by up to  3/4 of a point yesterday?
The answer depends on the time horizon. Strip away the election and much of
the original argument holds true. A borrowing requirement which in relative
terms is still lower than that of Germany should be absorbed without too
much impact on yields. Foreign investors may, however, need a stronger lead
from domestic investors. They will have to be prised away from equities. As
a result, gilt yields might fall marginally less fast in response to
declining inflation. The government will also need to resume funding in the
very long 25-to-30-year range where yields have been artificially depressed
by shortage of supply.
So far, so good. But election uncertainty in the short run has thrown up the
fear that an incoming government may yet succumb to the temptation to
devalue, rekindling inflationary worries and destroying long-term confidence
in gilts. Particularly vulnerable to panic selling during the next four
weeks is 10-year paper, in which overseas investors are most heavily
invested. Pronounced weakness could make gilts a bargain, but only for
investors who believe there will be no devaluation, even by a minority
government.

FT-SE Index: 2,522.4 (-52.4)
The uneasy lull in the UK stock market of late was spectacularly interrupted
yesterday by the biggest one-day fall in the FT-SE this year. Dashed hopes
of an interest rate cut had something to do with it and, given the City's
still widespread assumption of an outright Conservative victory next month,
so did Mr Lamont's failure to deliver a knock-out punch in the Budget.
For the next four weeks fundamental analysis will take second place to
opinion polls. In this context it is worth recalling that while the market
performed well during the last three election campaigns, it dived 9 per cent
in September-October 1974 when the Tories also began the formal political
fighting 3 points behind. Bad news is likely to be exacerbated this time by
traders' emotional response to the prospect of a 59 per cent effective tax
rate and by the fact that many veterans of today's markets were in short
trousers when a Socialist was last spied in Downing Street.

FT  12 MAR 92 / BR plans assault on telecoms market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is seeking the go-ahead to compete with BT and Mercury in the
international telecommunications market with an investment of up to Pounds
500m over the next decade.
British Rail Telecom (BRT), its wholly owned subsidiary, announced yesterday
that it was applying for a public telecommunications operator licence two
years after it signalled its intention to enter the Pounds 15bn-a-year
telecommunications market.
BRT, which already operates the biggest private telecommunications network
in the UK, aims to capture about 7 per cent of the public market by the end
of the century.
It plans to use the Channel tunnel to carry cables linking its British
network to European customers. A radio system is being developed to allow
individuals to tap into BRT's main network.
British Rail is one of the first large organisations to challenge BT and
Mercury Communications, the country's two existing licensed operators.
Its move follows last year's telecommunications white paper which, in
effect, opened the UK market to all-comers. BT dominates telecommunications
in the UK and Mercury has won only just over 5 per cent of the market.
BRT was established two years ago to manage the group's private network.
Some 3,000km of optical fibre cable carrying voice and data messages run
along UK rail tracks.
Mr Peter Borer, BRT managing director, said yesterday: 'Our existing
nationwide network means we have the capability to provide
telecommunications services to the public very rapidly.'
The licence application has been made in BRT's name alone, but the company
is known to be negotiating with potential partners and is expected to
conclude agreements in the next two months.
BRT is applying for a full international licence with the aim of focusing on
routes to North America, the Far East and the rest of Europe. It plans to
collaborate with local companies in the US and the Far East. Services to
mainland Europe would be provided in conjunction with Hermes, a joint
venture involving most European railway operators and providing a broad
range of services, including telecommunications.
It plans to offer customers comprehensive services including voice and data
communication, digital private circuits and mobile radio services. Capital
expenditure of between Pounds 350 and Pounds 500m has been planned over the
next 10 years.
Since the white paper, more than 20 companies have lodged licence
applications with the Department of Trade and Industry and a further 20 have
expressed interest in doing so. Six companies have been granted licences but
only two - Sprint of the US and National Network of the UK, which resells
use of the Post Office network - have so far put forward plans to build full
international networks to compete with BT and Mercury.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Pros and cons of Pounds 32bn deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Norman Lamont had rigorously stuck to the balance-over-a-cycle doctrine,
and rejected, as he claimed, the case for giving the economy a kick-start,
then he would not have remitted any taxes at all in net terms. As it is, he
is facing the election as the chancellor who courageously insisted on only a
moderate bribe. Whoever wins the UK election on April 9 will inherit a
mighty Budget deficit. The Pounds 28bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement -
or Pounds 36bn without privatisation proceeds - is only the beginning. The
Treasury estimate for 1993-94 is Pounds 32bn.
Although these are huge numbers in terms of the money with which most of us
are familiar, a reasonably confidence-inspiring British government of any
party would have no difficulty in financing the coming deficit, if it really
were just the peak resulting from a recession, and it started shrinking fast
in later years.
I do not agree with all the arguments of the cynics, for instance on growth.
The Treasury projects a path for real growth excluding North Sea oil output
of 1 3/4 per cent in the coming financial year, rising to 3 per cent the
year after and averaging 3 1/2 per cent in the middle 1990s.
Why should there not be an output recovery? Taking into account the
recession years, the average growth rate would still be only 2 per cent per
annum over 1990-97. Are the cynics saying that productivity will not rise
enough to support such a growth rate? This is not supported by the data.
Or are they saying that growth at this rate, starting from a very high
unemployment rate, and a substantial margin of unused capacity will lead to
a resumption of inflation? Or are they saying that there is a balance of
payments constraint on growth? The UK in a hard ERM, leading to Emu, has the
same kind of balance of payments constraint as Sussex or Normandy.
Alternatively, will growth be low because the demand will not be there: that
is, people will not spend enough? If that were so, there might be a case for
budgetary red ink after all. Let me, as my computer keyboard would say,
'save' this possibility to discuss below.
Meanwhile there is another and more likely reason why the Treasury forecasts
are too optimistic. This is that they assume no further addition to public
spending plans and no tax remissions before 1995, and then extremely modest
ones. (The forecasters could easily adjust their computers to tax increases
under Labour, coupled with a corresponding boost to spending.)
The dubious assumption is that spending will be limited in this way. An
analysis by Goldman Sachs suggests that Pounds 10bn of next year's PSBR,
representing 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, represents
discretionary increases in spending or tax remissions.
Such political pressures will not come to an end after an election; and they
will be encouraged by the lessening of the automatic penalty on excess
borrowing of a run on sterling which was experienced in the 1960s and 1970s.
* * *
It is thus necessary to ask more coolly what harm a Budget deficit does. The
verbal puritanism of City folk, who make a living from lending and
borrowing, is inadequate.
The harm is expressed simply by the slogan: 'Today's borrowing is tomorrow's
taxes.' In other words we will have to suffer the deadweight burden of
raising taxes from one sector of the population to pay as interest to
another. Such transfers and the consequentially high tax rates, do distort
the economy.
If the debt to GDP ratio is rising, the amount of such deadweight transfers
will increase. The maximum borrowing consistent with stability in the ratio
is about 1 1/2 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP or about Pounds 10bn in today's
values. The balanced budget doctrine simply gives a margin of error and
enables us to avoid controversies over issues such as the treatment of items
like privatisation revenues or council house sales. So far so good.
Unfortunately, most of the people who raise the alarm about rising debt and
the Italian-type traps which could emerge, take one thing for granted,
without bothering to argue it. This is that the national income is given and
that servicing extra debt is a pure deadweight burden. This does not answer
but simply ignores the Keynesian argument that a fiscal stimulus raises
output and employment and thus has something real to show in return for the
irritations of the transfer.
But the argument changes radically if a fiscal stimulus really will lead to
more real jobs and output. The gain could far exceed the transfer burden of
the Debt interest.
Let us suppose that there were a problem of demand deficiency. The concept
can be illustrated by the Red Book projections showing a growth of Nominal
GDP of 6 1/2 per cent on the next financial year falling steadily to 5 1/4
per cent by 1996-97. By this time, the hope is that underlying inflation
will be down to 2 per cent, leaving 3 1/4 per cent for real growth. Demand
expansion of much less would leave insufficient headroom for growth.
So the question boils down to whether extra borrowing will generate extra
output or jobs, more than temporarily, or not. Some three years of borrowing
at the current rate would add nearly Pounds 100bn to the National Debt and
cost very roughly Pounds 10bn in gross interest payments. If there were
nothing to show for it in current output, the result would be something like
3p on the basic rate of income tax.
So before resorting to red ink, we need to be sure (a) that extra output
really will result, and (b) that a fiscal stimulus is the best way of
providing it.
The UK's Medium Term Financial Strategy is based on the assumption, as the
Red Book puts it, that growth depends on supply side forces, and by
implication that demand deficiency is temporary and self-correcting. During
every recession voices can be heard saying that this is no longer the case
and that depression is once more a danger. Like the boy who cried 'wolf',
these voices may one day be right, but have up to now been wrong.
One monetarist argument against a fiscal stimulus is out of date. This says
that if a deficit is financed by selling bonds, interest rates will rise,
and the demand stimulus thus be cancelled out. The argument has lost its
force in a liberalised international capital market where the borrowing of
one medium sized government has little impact on international real interest
rates.
There are, however, other reasons for hesitation about using the Budget to
stimulate demand. There is the old argument about dangers of bad timing.
There is the newer one that stimulation may be ineffective in view of the
private sector's tendency to offset tax giveaways by saving more and tax
increases by saving less.
My own way of cutting the Gordian knot is to regard monetary policy as the
main instrument for demand management. It is more flexible, operates with
fewer lags, and does not have the transfer burden associated with fiscal
policy.
None of these arguments lose their force because monetary policy is being
run by the Bundesbank. If it really were the case that a radically different
monetary policy were required in Germany to underwrite growth without
inflation than in other European countries, then indeed the ERM would have
outlived its value.
Experience suggests, however, that very similar forces are at work in most
European countries, even if they operate with a lag; and I can hardly
imagine that a much higher real interest rate would be appropriate east of
the Rhine than west of it. So we are left with a rather low-level case for a
temporary fiscal stimulus while the pressures of German reunification give
Bundesbank policy a restrictive bias.
Given all the many other uncertainties about how far a fiscal stimulus,
going beyond the automatic stabilisers, really helps, and the looming
increase in the deadweight burden of debt interest, I would compromise by
saying that any fiscal injection should take the form of investment - not in
the accounting sense, but in the more fundamental sense of raising the
country's underlying productive capacity. Mr Lamont's remissions were not of
that kind. Nor are the Labour alternatives.

FT  12 MAR 92 / The man who would be king: Super Tuesday put Bill Clinton
ahead of the Democratic pack, but he is still an uncertain bet for the smart
money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The smart money, of course, was always on Bill Clinton. The smart money is
also not infallible. At various times this year it thought Bob Kerrey was
the visionary answer to the Democratic prayer and that Pat Buchanan would
fold his tent after New Hampshire and leave the Republican right-wing field
to David Duke. But at least the bet on the governor of Arkansas looks good
today.
Looking good in March, however, is not a great guide to November, as any
number of would-be presidents have discovered. Winning eight out of 11 Super
Tuesday primaries puts Mr Clinton comfortably ahead of the pack, the
incontestable front runner. But it also makes him a target for those left in
the race and for those inside the Democratic party who do not want him as
the candidate.
Over the next six weeks, he must continue to win big in big states -
Illinois and Michigan next week, New York, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania next
month. The way the Democrats apportion delegates to their convention, using
proportional representation and an allocation of votes to the uncommitted
and to party grandees, means he might have to wait until California on June
2 to wrap things up - and a lot can go wrong between then and now.
Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown will continue to nip at his heels. The former
senator from Massachusetts must do very well next week in order to prove his
claim, still technically valid after Super Tuesday, that he, not Mr Clinton,
is the national candidate. The former governor of California will probably
endure to the end, as Mr Clinton's Pat Buchanan, unable to kill but
infinitely able to wound. Nor can it be completely ruled out that some
Washington heavyweight (Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas is occasionally
mentioned) will express profound discontent and get into the late primaries,
or make a pitch for the non-Clinton delegates, as Hubert Humphrey did
against George McGovern in 1972 and Mr Brown did against Jimmy Carter four
years later.
But, all these caveats dutifully noted, the nomination is probably now Bill
Clinton's to lose, and, therefore, a Bush-Clinton presidential contest in
the autumn the most likely outcome. Public opinion polls, not worth much in
the spring, put them about level. The question, since so much more is known
about President Bush, is whether the Democrat can stand up to the test.
Perhaps the most important thing to know about Bill Clinton is that he is a
pure politician. This is no movie actor, or lawyer, or peanut farmer turning
a hand to politics. The Clinton career has been exclusively in politics, as
perfectly illustrated by the painfully honest letter he wrote, as a
23-year-old Rhodes scholar, at Oxford, to his military draft board in 1969.
In spite of his opposition to the Vietnam war, he would, he said, 'accept
the draft . . . for one reason; to maintain my political viability within
the system'.
And thus it went after university for the man from Hope, Arkansas; to
running the 1972 McGovern campaign in Texas, to becoming, at 28, state
attorney-general, to a narrow loss in a House race, to the governor's
mansion in Little Rock at 31, (only Harold Stassen in Minnesota had been a
younger governor), to defeat after one term, to re-election after a public
apology for arrogance, and ever since (he is now the longest-serving
governor in the nation) and on to the road to the White House. This is not a
man who is deflected from his chosen path.
He is obviously a product of the 1960s. He has already faced a sex rap; it
is a fair chance someone will claim he smoked marijuana; his opposition to
the Vietnam war is on the record. But whereas so many of his generation, the
great political activists of the Vietnam protest era, eventually backed off,
went to law school or grew vegetables, Clinton relentlessly stuck at it.
And this was in Arkansas. Now this may be the state which produced J William
Fulbright and Wilbur Mills and was once governed by a Rockefeller (Winthrop)
but it is not exactly in the political major leagues. It ranks behind
Georgia, which produced Jimmy Carter, and ahead of Alabama (George Wallace).
New York or California or Texas it is not and no matter how effective a
governor of Arkansas Mr Clinton may have been - and he gets generally decent
reviews for his reforms of the state's social infrastructure - running
Arkansas is not, in itself, a prime qualification or training ground for the
White House.
But it is 'southern' and, as it is necessary to point out, over the past 40
years the Democrats have only won the presidency with a southerner somewhere
on the ticket (in 1960, 1964 and 1976.) Put another way, they have lost the
presidency because they have lost the south - and California, too. What
really worries party professionals about the Tsongas and Brown candidacies
is the conviction that both would ensure that the south stays lost without
sufficient compensation elsewhere.
Mr Clinton's southernness is worn almost as a uniform. He answers to the
nickname of Elvis (the other is Slick Willy) and the accent is southern,
though easier to understand than Jimmy Carter's. But he is not a Rhodes
Scholar and Yale Law graduate for nothing. He is, in the current jargon, a
'policy wonk', someone who loves nothing more than a complicated brief that
he can argue through to its logical conclusion.
(One small example of this: four years ago he invited himself to visit the
FT in London; we sought, cutely, to sandbag him by asking him to justify the
withdrawal, after pressure from congressmen from Arkansas and Louisiana, of
US funding to the Rice Research Institute in the Philippines; we half
expected some cornpone invocation of the need to protect local rice farmers;
what we received was an extremely well-informed lecture on the world rice
market and new rice strains.)
This sort of smartness, bordering on over-achievement, is reminiscent of
Jimmy Carter. Mr Clinton, like Mr Carter, brings no formal foreign policy
experience to his campaign and, because of the introspective nature of it so
far, has not needed to display much expertise. In order to prepare himself
for Mr Bush, he will now need to widen his horizons and the 'foreign policy
speech' is surely high on the agenda. He will now be getting the benefit of
the advice of more and more of the party's foreign policy establishment.
As it stands, the record shows only a few slogans - 'America must change so
it can become competitive in the world' - and one address to his alma mater,
Georgetown University, last December. This was a perfectly sensible,
unexceptional exposition of the US role in a changing inter-dependent world.
It naturally called for big cuts in defence spending and the use of the
proceeds to strengthen the country. It had no quarrel with the broad thrust
of US national security policy over the 1980s, but argued that the end of
the Cold War posed fresh challenges. It called for a larger role for the
United Nations (with Germany and Japan on a revamped Security Council),
urged the early recognition of former Soviet republics, and criticised the
administration for 'coddling' China. It was bare bones stuff, with no
visible hostages to fortune and easy to flesh out.
Where Mr Clinton seriously differs from Mr Carter, as a candidate and, if he
makes it, as president, is that he is very much a political insider, albeit
from a long way from Washington. He was not chosen to give the keynote
speech at the 1988 convention because he was a fresh face, but because he
had earned the respect of those who ran the party, for better or worse. (The
speech, curiously, was a disaster.) He had aligned himself very closely to
the Democratic Leadership Council, the middle-of-the-road grouping as
influential as any in the mid-1980s. The party professionals like him.
But the party at large has its reservations and, by extension, so must the
nation. The reservations are less about policies than about character. The
policies have shifted, naturally enough, during the campaign. He is now more
blue collar than white, more populist than intellectual, but not to the
irrevocable point that he cannot easily move back to the centre, which is
his home. He has yet, for example, to lapse into outright protectionism, as
the Democratic left and Republican right have, though the Michigan and
Illinois primaries, with their strong union presence, will test this
resolve.
The character issue is harder to define. His camp says his survival of
imputations about his sexual behaviour, courage and financial probity
attests to strength of character and purpose. The fear is that the
electorate has not forgotten and ultimately will find it difficult to vote
into the White House a man who seems to have 'erred' on so many fronts.
There is an unspoken assumption that more dirt will be flung at him in the
campaign proper, by better marksmen than Jerry Brown and Bob Kerrey, and
some of it might seriously stick. What the Republicans did to Michael
Dukakis in 1988, above all in its Willie Horton commercials, is a salutary
lesson.
Mr Clinton has his defences in good order. He says, fairly enough, that if
personal perfection was a necessary qualification, nobody would run for
president. His articulate wife, Hillary Clinton (she now uses her husband's
surname) is an eminent lawyer and formidable campaigner in her own right.
They seem the very model of the youngish, modern, two-career couple. Whether
America is as comfortable with this as it is with George and Barbara Bush,
whose concessions to modernity are minimal, is debateable.
Nor is there yet about Clinton that sense of arrogance, certainty even, that
usually marks out a winner. He has found it hard to distance himself from a
pretty average pack of opponents. His telegenity - the carefully styled
hair, the fleshy, babyish face - sometimes seems wafer thin. All of which
mysteriously combine to explain why as many as half the Democrats who have
voted in this year's primaries confess dissatisfaction with the choices put
before them.
And if they are still unhappy, then the discontent inside the Republican
party with President Bush's performance, registered again on Super Tuesday,
assumes a different perspective. Only the unforeseen can now stop Mr Bush
winning the nomination, and beating off Mr Buchanan in Illinois and Michigan
should do the trick. The question is only how he conducts himself in the
process and when he chooses to put Mr Clinton in his sights.
He ducked a chance to do this at his press conference yesterday, preferring
again to go after the Democrats in Congress and threatening to veto any bill
that contains a tax increase. There may be mileage in this but it is not
without risk. The nation is more than fed up with business-as-usual in
Washington and is as capable of blaming the president as the Democrats for
further impasse. And Mr Clinton can at least point out that he is not a
formal member of the Washington establishment.
So the game is now seriously joined and even the old axioms do not help.
Tall men normally beat short men in presidential races, it is said. Mr Bush
and Mr Clinton are the same height. No wonder the smart money is puzzled.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Arts: The mid-life crisis of an out of work drugs courier -
Cinema

<TEXT>
LIGHT SLEEPER (15) Curzon West End
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE (15) Odeon Haymarket
HEAR MY SONG (15) Odeon Marble Arch
If Paul Schrader's lithe moral thriller Light Sleeper were a pop single, it
would be issued as the flip side to The Last Temptation Of Christ. Here is
star Willem Dafoe as another vernacular-tongued martyr, this time a drugs
courier crucified on New York's narcotics-for-the-rich business. Here is
Susan Sarandon as his lady boss playing two neo-Biblical Marys in one, part
mother figure, part universal hooker. And here is the film's backing group -
let us call it 'Paul Schrader and the Calvinists' - thumping out chords of
guilt and redemption as our turning-forty hero tries to process a mid-life
crisis into a giant gesture of salvation.
Miss Sarandon is about to go straight, swapping cocaine for cosmetics. And
Mr Dafoe is about to be left on the street with sirens whistling around him,
a lady friend high-diving from a penthouse and a crimeworld Mr Big pointing
at him the business end of his Smith and Wesson.
Film-maker Schrader screenwrote The Last Temptation and also wrote and/or
directed Taxi Driver, American Gigolo, Mishima and The Comfort Of Strangers.
His world is one of violence, hedonism and late - tragically late - attempts
at spiritual self-improvement. He is Bresson cocktailed with Peckinpah and
one is amazed that he has taken so long to direct a film in New York. Here
America's doomed high-rollers gather in strength, stacked up from the
sidewalks to the stars. And the wail of human distress - police cars,
ambulances, fire engines - is the city's non-stop municipal anthem.
Wonderfully, Light Sleeper combines outer turmoil with an intricately mapped
inner life. Dafoe's hero leads a flyweight-Dostoevskian existence. His
off-duty hours are spent penning a diary and compiling existentially
gratuitous 'lists' (famous people whose eyes don't match, famous left-handed
people). His duty hours are spent eyeballing death and degeneration. As an
expensive door-to-door supplier, he feels conscience-bound to visit clients
when they are ill or to hear their confessions or to nod interestedly at
their stoned philosophising.
Meanwhile his ex-wife (Dana Delany), a former addict now turned squeaky
clean, resists his renewed overtures. And Miss Sarandon, a human bird of
prey with a flair for scarlet dresses and throat-ripping executive
efficiency, politely discourages his interest in her planned cosmetics
take-off.
In addition to larger matters the movie is all about what it feels like, on
a bad day, to be 40. The despair-bearing future presses down from above; the
guilt-bearing past presses up from below; and the present is a tiny
crawlspace where we try to do what we can in limited time with limited funds
in limited daylight.
Schrader may leave his characters naked and desperate, but he gives his film
a rich metaphorical set-dressing. He sites his tale of silted-up lives
seeking salvation in a garbage-strewn Manhattan (there is a collectors'
strike) where hotels and apartments are full of wry beckonings to a better
life. Their interiors even hint at spiritual grace through New Testament
visual echoes. A reproduction of a Vermeer portrait leans Madonna-like over
a love-making sequence; fishing tableaux gaze down on smart eaters in a
restaurant. And a montage of overhead shots catches the sleeping Dafoe in a
sculptured swirl of bedsheets like a low-life Pieta.
My only, not quite minor question: Should we even ironically be looking at a
drug runner's life as if he were a modern-day messiah? Unlike Robert De Niro
in Taxi Driver, Schrader's other Manhattanite agonistes, Dafoe is no
psychotic purging society of its ills. He is a nice guy - or made to seem so
 -even when helping people shovel poison up their noses or into their veins.
The drugs trade in Light Sleeper is made a milieu as morally neutral as
accounting or trout farming. Is this a comment on the world, on America, on
Schrader; or on what the cinema thinks fit for our jaded appetites as
filmgoers?
*****
Old actresses never die, they are put out to pasture in wrinklie farms like
Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Cafe. A wrinklie farm is a
narrative environment in which biddies with print dresses and Southern
accents yatter on dispensing wholegrain folk wisdom. Here Jessica Tandy,
1990 Best Actress Oscar-winner for Driving Miss Daisy, draws the short straw
 -indeed all but wears it in her mouth - as a silver-haired pastoral crone
given to long-haul reminiscence. The slightly longer straw is drawn by Kathy
Bates, 1991 Best Actress Oscar-winner, playing a downtrodden Alabama
housewife schooled to rebellion by Miss T's tales of her own tomboy
childhood.
They meet in a hospital waiting room and are soon fast friends. Did I say
fast? The film lasts 130 minutes and dawdles 'lovingly' over every
flashbacked Tandy anecdote - ah the times she had running the racially
defiant Whistle Stop Cafe (Negroes welcome) and helping best friend
Mary-Louise Parker escape her rotten hubby - and alike over every one of
Bates's asinine present-day adventures in spouse defiance. Miss B knocks
down walls, serves nouvelle cuisine meals and shocks her husband with frank
talk. The last time Bates treated a man like this, James Caan in Misery, it
was considered a horror story.
This extended feminist fable is directed by Jon Avnet from Fannie Flag's
Pulitzer-nominated novel. I have not read it, but I feel as if I have. I
also feel Miss F should be flagged down before providing further
quaint-old-dear fodder for actresses who deserve better. As it is, Tandy
does what she can with tiny flourishes of wit, mischief and expressive
rubato: shining like a naughty deed in a goody-goody world. And Bates, not
yet a wrinklie but apple-cheeked enough to be press-ganged 30 years hence if
not careful, has one gloriously destructive scene showing how to park in a
crowded shopping mall. Take your least favourite driving-test examiner.
*****
We have all had those experiences when what we thought was dead suddenly
sits up and proclaims itself alive. It may be a well-loved aunt or a
semi-recumbent aspidistra. Peter Chelsom's Hear My Song is a good British
comedy, a genre we thought long defunct, and thus enrolls itself instantly
in the same syndrome.
Indeed the genre not only sits up here, it dances across the hospital floor,
seizing carnations between its teeth and molesting the nursing staff. The
star and co-writer is Adrian Dunbar, a young actor who resembles a tousled
ant-eater. He blarneys his way beguilingly through the tale of an
Irish-Liverpudlian cabaret agent (himself) who seduces from retirement the
famed tenor and tax exile Joseph Locke (Ned Beatty).
Locke's warbling heyday, you recall, was the 1950s: hence the film's
fictionalised swarm of older fans who enthuse Dunbar with their oohs and
aahs at Locke's memory. They include the singer's one-time girlfriend,
Shirley Anne Field, now the mother of Dunbar's own girlfriend Tara
Fitzgerald.
But never mind all that. The film catches alight in the gaps between its
narrative planks, when improvisational flames shoot up between one 'What
next' and another. Two overweight bouncers do a delicate soft-shoe shuffle
on a pavement. A bewildered cow on a chain almost disappears down a well. A
chap in a battered trilby called Franc Cinatra outshines the real thing.
This is Broadway Danny Rose gone to its spiritual home, Ireland, via framing
scenes in Dunbar's adoptive Liverpool. In both habitats first-time director
Peter Chelsom displays blissful assurance. He stalks and outsmarts the
lurking comedy (from a chaos-prone cattle auction to a vainglorious Locke
impostor), he never mugs it. And look at the thoughtful richness of the
visuals. An eerie, tremulous tracking-shot captures the menace of a moonlit
field; a firelit cellar glows fiery orange in one corner, for a row between
comeback-shy Locke and our hero, leaving a cold blue space in another where
they complete the business end of their chat. The film could have been a
birdbrained Carry On Cabaret Agent.
Instead it is a sly, imaginative, off-the-wall delight, somewhere between
early Bill Forsyth and any-time Flann O'Brien.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Arts: Death in Venice - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This remarkable opera returns to Covent Garden nearly 20 years after its
first appearance there (four months after the Aldeburgh first performance,
in the Aldeburgh staging). Then, and in the subsequent 1975 and 1978
revivals, the performer of Gustav von Aschenbach was Peter Pears, for whom
the role was written; thereafter, three leading English tenors proved able
to develop it beyond the confines of the 'premiere production' - Anthony
Rolfe Johnson (for Scottish Opera), Philip Langridge (also for Scottish
Opera), and Robert Tear (for Glyndebourne Touring Opera).
On Tuesday the Aschenbach was Mr Langridge; and his magnificent performance
may be taken as a symbol of the way the work itself has taken root and
blossomed over the intervening years.
He is, needless to say, not 'better' than Pears or the other tenors also
mentioned; but he makes the work so completely his own that, at least while
we watch and listen, it seems impossible to imagine it differently done. In
the last 12 months Mr Langridge has already shown to London audiences his
superbly achieved accounts of Peter Grimes and Captain Vere at the ENO, so
his ability to compass with absolute mastery the last, longest and perhaps
most taxing of the roles Britten wrote for Pears was hardly in question.
It is the combination of completeness and naturalness in the delivery that I
find so astonishing. No touch of 'art' seems to mark Mr Langridge's eloquent
utterance of words, no sense of voice-managing his leanly graceful colouring
and shading of phrases. Every hint of actorish self-consciousness has been
purged from his absorption, physical and spiritual, into the character's
development.
The conversational tone adopted at the start is fluent, accurate and easy;
it lends to Aschenbach's piano-accompanied recitatives of meditation a
quality of privacy, of rugged, rueful honesty-with-self that sets the tone
for the opera's journey into uncharted areas of the psyche. A theatre
properly a couple of sizes too large for this opera shrinks in dimensions
around its central character; and because Mr Langridge and the producer,
Colin Graham, appear to have worked so closely together to shape the drama
as a fluid unfolding with Aschenbach as its fixed focal point, the
performance gains a musico-dramatic intimacy of rare vibrancy.
One seems to see the world through Aschenbach's eyes, breathe with him, feel
his shocks of emotional awareness at first hand. In theory (formed by past
experience of the work in the theatre) Act 1 is badly in need of nips and
tucks to the 77-minute-long text that Britten was never able to authorise;
in practice I was, on this occasion, gripped almost without let-up
throughout the whole opera. This is, of course, not just the hero's doing;
the parts played by the conductor, Steuart Bedford, in supporting and
sustaining the peculiar quality of intimacy noted above, and by Mr Graham in
creating an ensemble that catches and contains it, are splendidly evident.
In common with Deanne Bergsma (a consummately elegant and delicately
characterised Lady of the Pearls) but unlike Mr Langridge, they belonged to
the 1973 team of Death in Venice 'creators'; it is wonderfully satisfying
that their grasp of the work should have matured so obviously. The
diaphanous sound-world of the opera, its transformations from mysterious
murkiness to translucent brightness, its 'psychological' uses and contrasts
of timbre, are native territory to Mr Bedford; its structural forms are
second nature to Mr Graham.
The production is in fact entirely new, though linked with the old one by
John Piper's original designs, which now serve (along with
turn-of-the-century black-and-white Fortuny photographs of Venice) as
projections on the three screens, framed by gleaming silver poles, that form
the entire set. A revolve whirls new scenes and locations into place, and
proves a vivid, never too obvious metaphor for the sea-changes which, in all
senses, Aschenbach undergoes.
On Tuesday the manipulation of imagery seamlessly growing and fading in
intensity seemed not yet entirely smooth; but the style of the production is
so carefully gauged, and so 'right' in arguing its own case, that passing
imperfections were of small importance. Mr Graham has not sought out a Death
in Venice stripping-away, of the kind so brilliantly undertaken by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera in 1989. In its freshness and acuity of
understanding his staging has its own proud modernity.
Alastair Macaulay will be writing about Kim Brandstrup's new choreography.
My feeling is that, in its closer involvement in the 'story-line', the dance
element now serves the larger demands of the opera more successfully than
first time around, marvellous though Ashton's beach games were in dance
terms; and that the Tadzio of Giacomo Ciriaci is the best the work has yet
seen, an embodiment of the 'mortal child with more than mortal grace'
unforced in dramatic vigour and un-cloying in beauty and grace.
Of the large singing cast, expertly positioned and moved, there must be at
least brief mention of Michael Chance's limpid offstage Voice of Apollo and
of Linda Kitchen's onstage Strawberry Seller, Paul Crook's Hotel Porter and
Bruno Caproni's English Clerk (a marvellous small part strongly sung). To
the various embodiments of the Traveller Alan Opie brings virtuoso
showmanship infused with a perfectly judged degree of menace, and a voice
impressively clean and flexible if lacking a degree of bass-baritone
darkness.
This is an opera whose protagonist, a mature man and artist, embarks on a
voyage of sensual self-discovery which brings with it both life and death;
substitute Aids for cholera, as many in Tuesday's audience must constantly
have done, and Death in Venice becomes (in the words of Mr Graham's
programme postlude) 'more topical than ever for all such sufferers and to
those who must have compassion for them'. But topicality alone is not the
reason why the stature of the work should seem to grow with each passing
year.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Arts: Measure for Measure - RSC, Young Vic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trevor Nunn's riveting RSC staging of this great, imperfect, ambiguous and
infinitely rewarding play has now reached London after a national tour. On
this page Andrew St George praised its premiere at Stratford's The Other
Place in September; here I add my voice to his. The RSC has done this play
proud before, and this production does not surpass some of the versions we
saw in the 1980s. Shakespeare's vague Vienna here becomes fin de siecle
Vienna, and Nunn has gone overboard on realism. The play begins with
waltzing to Strauss; tramlines mark the floor.
Where this account scores is in tension and intimacy. The audience, seated
close on three sides, follows excitedly the moment-by-moment development of
the big scenes: in particular, the dilemmas and conflict raised by
Isabella's staunch adherence to chastity and Angelo's hypocritical and
blackmailing siege of her virtue.
The production's most daring stroke is in casting young Claire Skinner as
Isabella. I have never heard a Shakespearian heroine spoken less musically.
Her bright teenage voice, spanning no more than a half-octave, shakes and
breaks the text into short half-phrases. Yet all of this flies fresh like a
dart from her heart. This is the most artless of Isabellas, with both the
fervour and the nervousness of the young; she has a streak of St Joan in
her.
Most brilliant is the psychological acuity - especially in terms of
body-language - of her scenes with Angelo (David Haig). His first special
attention to her is that of a schoolmaster with a keen pupil; he sits her
down and explains how things must be. But then she, with unthinking
precocity, tells of authority's medicine. 'Go to your bosom, Knock there,
and ask your heart . . .' she says, and she listens to his heart, half like
a doctor. So, unintentionally, she thaws this stiff-bodied ruler to guilty
sexual arousal.
Nunn has elsewhere tinkered with the text. Lucio's 'Grace is grace, despite
of all controversy' line, often cut, is back, but some scenes are
re-ordered, some words altered and the Duke's big central rhyming-couplet
speech has been chopped into three and redistributed around the play.
This production avoids the grand scale whereby Nicholas Hytner's 1987-89
staging showed so movingly the layers and connections of a complex society.
Shakespeare's abiding questions about governance and fitness to rule count
for little, and the strange and wonderful role of the observer Duke is
diminished. Philip Madoc further spoils this by adopting, for his scenes in
disguise as Friar Lodowick, a sustained Welsh kind of Mummerset accent. But
every role is sharply characterised, and the mood swings finely between
serious and comic.
Though not definitive, this staging (running until April 25) is to be
urgently recommended to anyone remotely interested in Shakespeare. (It could
even convert some who aren't) Its suspense and intensity are rare, and they
illumine some vital facets of this perennially fascinating play.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Lighting the hidden side of directors'
reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT storm over political donations made in the 1980s by Polly Peck
International, the collapsed fruit to electronics group, failed to highlight
one vital issue: whether it is time for the annual directors' report to
receive far greater scrutiny.
It was widely reported that Mr Asil Nadir, chairman of PPI, had contributed
funds to the Conservative party. Touche Ross, which has had partners working
on the administration of the group since October 1990, confirmed that it had
unearthed payments from companies within the group.
Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, said that Pounds 440,000 had
been received via Mr Nadir. Even Mr Nadir, through a statement from his
solicitors, confirmed that he had donated the money to the Conservatives and
appeared to express surprise that those payments made through PPI companies
had not been disclosed in the accounts.
While some commentators swiftly called for the return of the money, and
others questioned the ethics of political parties receiving large
contributions from any one individual or organisation, few addressed the
lack of disclosure of the contributions in the company's accounts, and why
this had gone unnoticed.
Political embarrassment there may have been. But under current legislation
the donation of funds by companies to political causes is not illegal. The
only law in question is the 1985 Companies Act, which requires the
directors' report to list the sums and the recipients of any donations to
political or charitable causes above Pounds 200.
PPI's reports for the periods in question are blank. The accounts for 1989,
for example, discuss Pounds 485,000 given to charities 'particularly upon
the needs of children and young people in the community who are
underprivileged or chronically ill'. It then states simply: 'There were no
political donations.'
Stoy Hayward, auditors to PPI, would not comment on the episode. But the
Companies' Act appears to place the onus for disclosure on the directors of
a company rather than its auditors. 'In respect of any failure to comply . .
. every person who was a director of the company immediately before the end
of the relevant period is guilty of an offence,' it states.
Auditors, the Act continues, must report on the accounts of both
subsidiaries and the group company where one exists, including the balance
sheet and the profit and loss account.
The existing auditing guidelines from the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales explicitly reflect this legislation, and seem to
exonerate Stoy Hayward from any blame. 'The auditor has no statutory
responsibilities in respect of items in the directors' report which in his
opinion are misleading but not inconsistent with the financial statements,'
it says.
The auditor's report in every company annual report makes the same point.
The statement appears after the directors' report and refers only to the
accounts, contained on subsequent pages. The 1989 PPI version, for instance,
begins: 'We have audited the financial statements set out on pages 31 to 55
in accordance with auditing standards.' The directors' report is on pages 27
to 29.
Undisclosed donations each year for a few tens of thousands of pounds in a
company with PPI's turnover are hardly likely to be judged material. They
are therefore not likely to be judged 'inconsistent' with the accounts, and
the auditors would not be obliged to highlight the failure to disclose these
political contributions even if they did manage to detect them.
So who is responsible for verifying the contents of the directors' report,
for both PPI and in general? The Department of Trade and Industry says
Companies House, based in Cardiff is responsible for examining accounts, and
is able to impose fines for any which are found lacking.
Companies House states that it fined 1,864 directors from 1,284 companies
during the last financial year for failing to file accounts on time, and has
recently announced stiffer penalties for this offence to begin in July. It
says it can also take action where there is incomplete information, such as
the omission of the auditor's statement or the balance sheet.
But it has no record of any occasion on which a company had been fined for
failing to disclose - or for inaccurately disclosing - information in the
directors' report. It says that its thrust is ensure compliance, not to
punish errors.
Companies House argues that it has no staff to examine reports for evidence
of abuse. 'We accept all the information that is given to us in good faith,'
says one senior official. He points out that there are about 1.1 million
'live' companies on record, most of which file annual returns, and the
average report is probably examined for 'one-and-a-half to two minutes'.
The same message - that there is no systematic monitoring of reports - comes
from the Department of Trade and Industry, with which Companies House works
closely. 'We don't have a pro-active role,' says a DTI official. 'Accounts
are taken as being correct. Shareholders, creditors and investors can bring
things to our attention. We rely on informants.'
If PPI was an isolated incident, the importance of non-disclosure in a
directors' report might be of questionable importance. But it is not. The
accounts for the year to June 30 1991 of Sovereign Leasing, a leasing
company now owned by Z-Landerbank Bank Austria, for example, reveal a
similar episode.
The directors' report describes a detailed investigation into the company
carried out as a result of substantial losses made during the financial
year. As a result, it says, 'the new management discovered that a donation
of Pounds 100,000 to the Conservative Party made in 1990 was not recorded as
an expense in last year's accounts. The expense is therefore included in
this year's accounts.'
But the issue goes far wider than non-disclosure of a few political
donations and whether these particular companies should be fined.
Governments over the years have placed increasing emphasis on the provision
of information in annual reports outside the scope of the accounts and
therefore beyond the scrutiny of an auditor.
Some impinge directly on the financial affairs of the company, including the
requirements for a review of the business and its future developments,
expenditure on research and development, post-balance sheet events, and the
directors interests including share options. Others are designed to reflect
wider social concerns and objectives, like policies on employee
participation, the disabled and health and safety at work - as well as
donations.
There is no sign of the demands for this type of information drying up. Even
in Tuesday's budget proposals, the chancellor called for large companies'
annual reports to publish details of how quickly they pay their bills, to
give potential suppliers warnings of late payers. These figures will
presumably become yet another new section in the directors' report.
It may be that shareholders and others with interests in or knowledge of a
company should be more vigilant about the information they are given.
Perhaps auditors should be required to examine the directors' report in more
detail, or the government should institute spot checks to verify the
figures. What is the point of requiring more information to be disclosed if
no one checks on its quality?

FT  12 MAR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Honda in damage
limitation drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mitsuru Sato, manager of Honda Motor's newly-established vehicle import
division, President George Bush's visit to Japan in January had one positive
result.
Thanks to the flood of publicity about trade friction in the motor industry,
nearly everyone in Japan now knows that Honda dealers are selling
Chrysler-made Jeeps.
The downside is that nearly all of these people also think that the Chrysler
Jeep Cherokees and Wranglers are poor in quality and overpriced.
Sato's unenviable job is to undo the damage and to avoid the embarrassment
to Honda should the company fail to reach its target of 1,200 Jeep sales a
year by 1994.
Sato confesses that the criticisms of Chrysler vehicles are, at least
partly, justified. 'People say the selling price is too high, which we
admit,' he says. The Jeep Cherokee sells for Y5.2m (Pounds 22,900) compared
with competing products by Japanese makers which cost between Y3.5m and Y4m.
As for quality, Honda was at first surprised when its customers complained
about fit and finish problems in the Jeeps because the vehicles had already
established a certain following among customers who bought directly from
Chrysler Japan Sales, the importer. Honda customers had higher standards and
they were holding Honda accountable for any problems.
It did little good to tell customers that Honda was not the importer and did
not set the price or have any control over quality. It was becoming the sort
of problem that could erode the loyalty of Honda's customer base.
Sato is attacking the problem in several ways. First, he says Chrysler has
been responsive to requests that the company beef up pre-delivery
inspections, which are now all done in Japan. He is also encouraging
Chrysler to pare down the delivery cost to reduce prices.
Sato is also trying to persuade Honda dealers to adopt a more positive
attitude toward the Jeeps. There is clearly a potential market in Japan
where 200,000 four-wheel-drive vehicles were sold last year. Chrysler Jeep
sales totalled only 1,700, of which 437 were sold by Honda.
Sato is trying to convince Honda dealers that problems with quality are not
as severe as many believe. After all, Sato reasons, Chrysler is selling
180,000 Jeeps a year in the US. And while the Jeeps have been recalled in
Japan for defects, it is not uncommon for Japanese cars to be recalled too.
Perhaps more important, Honda has set up a service support system for the
Jeeps. 'We are saying (to our dealers) - don't worry, we'll take all
responsibility,' says Sato.
Slowly, Honda dealers are coming around to support the idea and about 100 of
Honda's up-market and sports car dealers have expressed interest in selling
the vehicles.
Sato figures that selling cars is like multiplication, in which quality
multiplied by image, price, service, and promotion equal sales.
Unfortunately, a zero in any column reduces the final result to nil and that
is not very far from where matters stand today.
Sato says the image of the Jeep name itself is potentially a great asset,
since the Japanese think of it as a vehicle that storms through deserts and
jungles and wins wars. And the snob appeal of owning a foreign vehicle -
even in Japan - means that Jeeps may still sell well, even if priced
Y500,000 higher than the competition.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: TUC criticises move on taxes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGET tax changes will have a significantly smaller impact on employment
than if the same amount had been used to increase public spending, according
to an analysis by the Trades Union Congress.
The TUC said the tax measures could increase employment by between 30,000
and 40,000 jobs. A similar amount on public spending would have generated
more than 100,000 jobs.
Its analysis said the reduction in the uniform business rate was the only
significant across-the-board help for industry. But even here the scale of
relief was 'tiny' compared with the total business rate yield of Pounds
15bn. 'There is really very little for industry in the Budget,' the TUC
added.

GOVERNMENT officials are set to be blamed tomorrow by a Commons committee
for failing to stop the export of parts for the Iraqi 'supergun' project,
Ralph Atkins writes.
The Commons trade and industry committee is rushing through consideration of
a draft report which stops short of blaming ministers for the affair - but
does not explicitly rule out the possibility that intelligence services
deliberately allowed the project to go ahead.
Some MPs on the all-party committee believe the report's conclusions raise
vital constitutional questions about the accountability of the security
forces. However the draft veers towards the 'cock-up' rather than the
conspiracy theory.
The committee will meet today, and again tomorrow if needed, to complete the
report.

cut

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the UK would be able to cut interest rates during the election
campaign as the result of co-ordinated credit easing by European central
banks were firmly quashed yesterday.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the governor of the National Bank of Belgium - on
which speculation of an early cut in rates had centred - said yesterday that
no change was imminent.
The Bank of Spain, which has most room to cut rates in view of the strength
of the peseta within the exchange rate mechanism, also dampened predictions
of any significant easing. The Swiss, French and Dutch central banks all
look likely to wait for the German Bundesbank to ease policy before risking
independent action to lower lending rates.
The Bundesbank prompted an unpopular round of rises in European interest
rates with an increase in official lending rates before Christmas. It
indicated yesterday that it would keep monetary policy tight at least for
several months to counter inflationary pressures. Mr Karl Thomas, a member
of the German central bank's policy-making council, said in London that high
interest rates were 'not a pleasure'. Germany had, however, to give priority
to bringing down its 4 per cent-plus inflation rate.
Forecasts of an early cut in European interest rates, which would have given
the Bank of England leeway to reduce base rates, were sparked earlier this
week by Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister. He said 'informal
talks' between the German, Dutch and Belgian central banks were under way,
which might permit Belgian rates to go 'slightly lower' than German rates.
His remarks prompted a slight drop in Belgian rates for three-month Treasury
bills. But they appeared based on a wish to improve the debut of the
government in Brussels.
After exchanging views with his German and Dutch counterparts at this week's
Basle meeting of central bank governors, Mr Verplaetse played down the idea
of any action. However, he added: 'Obviously, if the situation improves in
the Netherlands and Germany, then we could think again about lowering our
interest rates.'
Dutch officials backed up the cautious message. The central bank in
Amsterdam is reluctant to risk sacrificing confidence in the financial
market by taking an interest rate stance independent of Germany. With Dutch
inflation above 4 per cent, they said an interest-rate decline engineered by
the Nederlandsche Bank would send the wrong signals.
Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, also drew attention
yesterday to the link with German interest rates. He warned that high German
interest rates limited the scope for reduction of Swiss rates, even though
Switzerland has been in recession for more than a year.
The position in Madrid is more complex, in view of the peseta's strength in
the ERM. But the Bank of Spain said yesterday that room for easing interest
rates would be determined by inflation and consumption.
Some indication of the Bank of Spain's room for manoeuvre will come today
with publication of Spain's February inflation rate. The markets expect a
rise of between 0.1 points and 0.3 points. A rise of 0.2 points would lift
the annual inflation rate to 6.2 per cent - making it hard to justify an
interest rate cut.
With 10 days to go before important French regional elections, the Bank of
France is in an even more uncomfortable position. It is thought unlikely to
stage a unilateral interest rate cut in the near future. The economy is
unable to support such a move without a marked weakening in the franc.
Reports: David Buchan in Brussels, Tom Burns in Madrid, Will Dawkins in
Paris, Ron van de Krol in Amsterdam, David Marsh in London and Ian Rodger in
Zurich.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Plan to speed up actions over debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor's Office yesterday announced a five-point plan to
improve the handling of claims for the payment of debts made under county
court small-claims procedures. The proposed changes are due to take effect
in July.
This followed the Budget announcement of plans to simplify court procedures
for the recovery of debts. Ministers have faced many complaints from
business organisations that slow payments were putting companies out of
business.
The planned changes involve:
Dispensing with preliminary hearings in all but the most exceptional cases
so claims can be dealt with at a single hearing.
Changing court procedures so judges can help litigants who are not legally
represented to put their case.
Allowing claimants to be represented in court by someone who is not a
lawyer. This could include a Citizens' Advice Bureau official, an accountant
or a family member. Providing better information on reclaiming expenses.
Requiring judges to explain orally their decisions.
Claims for the repayment of debts make up 90 per cent of all civil actions.
Most are dealt with in county courts under the small-claims procedure. The
maximum size of claim which can be dealt with under this process was
recently doubled to Pounds 1,000.
The changes were welcomed by the Federation of Small Businesses. It has
campaigned for the courts to take on automatic responsibility for enforcing
judgments. Claimants currently have to return to court if a defendant does
not pay up.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Carmakers reduce prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARMAKERS moved quickly yesterday to reduce retail prices by about 4 per
cent to reflect the cut in special car tax announced in the Budget, but the
industry appears reluctant to follow Ford, the UK market leader, into a
further price war.
Ford suffered a heavy fall in sales last mont, but it is moving aggressively
to try to regain lost ground with a series of price cuts.
In a letter to dealers, it has set a target of winning a 30 per cent market
share this month compared with the share of less than 20 per cent it
achieved in February.
Peugeot yesterday reported an immediate gain in sales in the wake of the
Budget with the confirmation of several fleet orders amounting to Pounds 11m
and a higher number of visitors to showrooms.
Several other carmakers said that the first real impact in higher 'showroom
traffic' would come at the weekend. Peugeot and Ford said that the
chancellor's moves had freed a large number of orders delayed pending the
Budget.
Ford, which suffered a much steeper decline in sales in February than most
of its rivals, has added further price cuts to some of its best-selling
Fiesta and Escort models beyond the cuts reflecting the reduction of car tax
from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Ford is anxious to repair the damage of its
February sales performance, when its new-car sales plunged 30.3 per cent.
One leading carmaker said last night that the Ford move was 'a clear sign of
distress marketing', while Rover claimed that its priority was 'to maintain
an orderly market' so that resale values could be 'kept sound'.
Vauxhall and Rover said they were considering the Ford move, but Rover added
that it did 'not envisage a specific response to Ford's actions'. Ford
triggered a price war in July in a failed attempt to stimulate the market.
It was followed by rivals including Vauxhall, Volkswagen and Fiat.
Ford said its additional price cuts averaging 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent
would affect about 30 per cent of its sales volume.
The most significant reduction has been made in the price of its cheapest
model, the 1.1 litre 3-door Fiesta, where the pre-tax list price has been
cut by 10.5 per cent.
Along with the car tax reduction, the price of this model has been reduced
by 14.1 per cent from Pounds 7,250 to Pounds 6,230.
Part of the reduction has been achieved by cutting the dealer margin for
this model from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. This will reduce the scope for
bargaining over discounts between dealers and customers, a pattern set by
Vauxhall last autumn.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Revolution that exploded into uncertainty -
The upheavals that have shaped the past five years in parliament

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
less a parliament than a paroxysm. The Thatcher revolution turned into the
Tory rebellion. An economic miracle turned into a mirage.
The political giants of a generation staggered bloodied from the national
stage they had dominated for a decade.
Now their disbelieving understudies in the House of Commons must take a leap
in the dark. Mr John Major will fight the first general election since the
1970s which the Conservatives could lose. Mr Neil Kinnock has a fighting
chance of proving that Labour is no longer predestined to be the party of
permanent opposition.
It has been a parliament which shifted decisively the terms of the political
debate. The poll tax, Europe and a boom-to-bust economy stranded extremists
of right and left. Mr Major and Mr Kinnock have converged on safer
centre-ground. As a cabinet minister confided this week as he contemplated
April 9: 'We're all pragmatists now.'
The voters were given the window of television to watch the drama and the
brawls, the anger and the pathos. The timing could not have been better.
Images of Sir Geoffrey Howe's bitterly brilliant resignation speech and Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's tragically defiant farewell etched themselves on the
national consciousness.
Mr Bernard Weatherill, hitherto just a voice floating across the radio
airwaves, brought cult status to the role of the Speaker.
It is hard to believe that it has been only five years.
The poll tax then was nothing more than a single paragraph in the
Conservative manifesto. Mrs Thatcher, resting on a triumphant majority of
102 seats at Westminster, was privately pondering the break up of the state
health and education systems. The water and electricity industries were
still owned by the government. The national curriculum was no more than a
nostalgic gleam in Mr Kenneth Baker's eye. Hospital trusts were not even
that.
Of the 21-strong cabinet class of 1987 only eight survive. Some - such as Mr
Peter Walker and Mr Norman Fowler - resigned to spend more time with their
families (and businesses). Others, such as Mr John Moore - one of that
unhappy breed of former future prime ministers - were cast into obscurity.
Mr Nicholas Ridley self-destructed. Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey
departed angrily. Mrs Thatcher had no choice.
The opposition parties did not escape the upheavals. Dr David Owen, the man
who had promised to break the mould, instead led the SDP into oblivion. The
then obscure Mr Paddy Ashdown was left to salvage something akin to the old
Liberal party from the wreckage of the Alliance. The Greens grabbed 15 per
cent of the vote in the European elections before vanishing again into
anarchic obscurity.
Then there was the trivia - important in that it demonstrated that an
apparently impregnable majority at Westminster was insufficient shield
against political mistakes. Who remembers now the abortive identity card
scheme for football or the political miscalculation which embroiled
ministers in a public row over salmonella in eggs?
The biggest mistake, of course, was the poll tax: the project of a prime
minister who had come to believe that she could lead the electorate in any
direction she chose. But, as in 1381, the peasants revolted. Mr Major has
spent much of his 16 months in Downing Street consigning the the 20th
century version of this medieval impost to a later chapter in the history
books.
It was the interaction of economic management and Europe which proved fatal.
The image of Mr Lawson's tax-cutting Budget in 1988 - Mrs Thatcher declared
him 'brilliant, brilliant, brilliant' - disintegrated into the Downing
Street row over the exchange rate mechanism.
The economic miracle turned out to be an old-fashioned boom. Mrs Thatcher
denied her chancellor the anti-inflationary shelter of the ERM. Mr Lawson
stormed from the cabinet as recession clouds gathered.
It was Europe too that brought the cataclysm; and with it the images which
seared themselves into the political memory.
There was Mrs Thatcher at her most dangerously defiant as she shouted 'No No
No' to European integration after the Rome summit. It was a step too far.
Sir Geoffrey, a sheep transformed into a lion, shocked himself, the Commons
and the nation with a devastating indictment of Mrs Thatcher's leadership.
She was fatally wounded.
Mr Michael Heseltine seized his moment. Yet she returned to the despatch box
to deliver a valedictory speech which left her cabinet colleagues visibly
shame-faced. Even Mr Kinnock, it was said, felt for her.
So these last few days it has been Mrs Thatcher rather than Mr Heseltine who
has sat brooding on the backbenches as her successor prepared for the
election her party would not let her fight. She will campaign for Mr Major
but she long ago made it clear that he could not be judged 'One of Us'.
Mr Major has done as much any leader could in 16 months to quell the
turmoil. There are no longer the angry, unscripted explosions from the
despatch box. He has managed his party at Westminster rather than dragged it
by the scruff of its neck. Consensus has replaced conviction, ideology has
given way to pragmatism. British troops fought in the Gulf with none of the
partisan chauvinism or Tory triumphalism which accompanied the expedition to
the Falklands. The Maastricht deal on European union created only a
resentful ripple, the poll tax was ditched without fanfare.
It may not be enough. This was the parliament in which the Labour party
learnt again that it could win as well as lose elections. It took its
chances. Mr Kinnock began to align policies with presentation. Ideological
baggage like unilateral disarmament, the trades union closed shop and
anti-Europeanism was thrown wholesale from the Labour wagon. He is still
voluble, and occasionally, volatile, but the Labour leader has regained his
confidence.
Mr Kinnock might yet lose. But so might Mr Major. And therein lies the
legacy of this parliament.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Lamont aims to extend 20p lower tax band
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday said he hoped in the next
parliament to expand the 20p lower income-tax band proposed in Tuesday's
Budget.
He said that, if re-elected, the government would have the choice of either
lowering the present 25p basic rate or extending the lower tax band to more
than the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income as a way of fulfilling its
commitment to reaching a 20p basic rate.
The chancellor denied at a Treasury briefing that the new band was a
political ploy to embarrass the Labour party at the beginning of the general
election campaign proper.
He said he had always thought that the 25p basic rate was a high starting
rate of tax for the lower-paid. The new tax rate would give the government
greater flexibility.
It would be able to move towards a 20p basic rate by extending the band in
steps that might only cost the the equivalent of  1/2 p off the present 25p
basic rate.
Mr Lamont warned that it could take longer than the life of a single
parliament to reach a 20p basic rate of tax.
The medium-term financial strategy, published with the Budget, suggests that
the government will not be in a position to make net tax reductions in
1993-94 or 1994-95. It has pencilled in reductions of about Pounds 1bn in
1995-96 and 1996-97.
By that time the government envisages that the public sector borrowing
requirement will have declined from the very high levels envisaged for the
coming two fiscal years.
Mr Lamont said yesterday that the forecast doubling of the PSBR to Pounds
28bn in 1992-93 from Pounds 13.75bn in the current financial year largely
reflected cyclical factors. A 'very rough' calculation suggested that Pounds
12bn of the Pounds 14bn deterioration was due to the effects of the
recession on tax revenues.
He said he believed that the underlying PSBR, after extracting cyclical
effects, was very close to balance. He therefore denied the deficit was a
structural problem that might necessitate tax increases.
Tax changes introduced by Mr Nigel Lawson had increased the 'cyclicality' of
the tax system, particularly of corporation tax, he said.
He appeared unworried about financing the deficits, and said that other
European countries were able to finance higher PSBRs than Britain.
Mr Lamont said the recovery forecast for this year might be 'slightly
sharper' than expected because of the delayed activity. He said earlier on
BBC Radio that there was 'a tremendous amount of pent-up demand in the
economy' and considerable potential spending power because of rising
earnings and lower mortgage rates. He added, however, that uncertainty about
the election could be hurting confidence.
The chancellor did not rule out an interest-rate cut during the election
campaign, but said some people might consider it a 'high-risk' move.
By convention, governments have not cut rates immediately before an
election. There have been exceptions, however. In 1974, the official minimum
lending rate was much more closely linked to market rates than bank base
rates are today, so that a move in market rates triggered an official rate
cut.
In 1979, the Labour government cut rates in the campaign after widespread
expectations of a Conservative victory prompted a large inflow of foreign
funds that was pushing sterling higher.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Scots reject Tories
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE support in Scotland has fallen to 18 per cent, according to an
opinion poll for The Scotsman newspaper and Channel Four released last
night.
Tory support has fallen from 23 per cent in January, the ICM figures show.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both risen by one percentage point to
42 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The Scottish National party is up
two points to 28 per cent.
The figures imply five seats for the Tories compared with 10 after the 1987
election. Losses would include Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary and MP for
Galloway.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Mellor attacks Smith over policy on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister launched the Tories' election campaign yesterday with a
confident prediction of winning a 'clear and working' majority.
Mr John Major's long-awaited announcement in Downing Street came as party
managers made final adjustments to the manifesto for approval at today's
cabinet - the last before the election.
He said voters had a clear choice between Tory policies of low taxation and
greater independence and the Labour approach of a return to the 'disastrous'
policies of the past.
The prime minister suggested that he had waited to announce the election
until after the Budget statement, as well as December's EC negotiations at
Maastricht and the completion of the bill to replace the poll tax with the
council tax.
He will use a speech to a party rally in Torquay at the weekend as the
springboard for the campaign, before the manifesto is published next week.
'We have a clear idea of the sort of Britain we want to see,' he said. 'We
are going to set it out, we are going to move towards it and after the
general election we are going to implement it.'
The Tories' determination to focus on Labour tax plans, in particular the
Opposition's decision to vote against the introduction of a 20p lower-rate
income tax band, was underlined by Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to
the treasury.
To cheers from Tory MPs, he used the second day of the Budget debate to
highlight Labour's initial disarray over the inclusion of one of its own
favoured tax reforms in the Budget.
Mr Mellor argued that by finally deciding to vote against the 20p tax band
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, and his colleagues had made clear their
intention to 'soak' the poor as well as the rich.
The minister ridiculed Mr Kinnock's failure to clarify Labour's attitude
when challenged to do so on Tuesday, and claimed that some Labour
backbenchers, including Mr Austin Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, and Mr
John Garrett, MP for Norwich South, had publicly supported the 20p
lower-rate band.
To further cheers, Mr Mellor condemned the 'absurd spectacle' of Labour MPs
insisting that it was imperative to help low earners through a statutory
minimum wage while proposing to meet the cost of its introduction by
increasing the marginal rate of tax on the same low earners by 25 per cent -
from 20 pence to 25 pence.
Defending Labour's decision to vote against the lower band, Mr John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, insisted: 'I think it is wrong in our economic
circumstances to borrow for tax cuts for anyone.'
Mr Mellor emphasised that only Pounds 1.8bn of the Pounds 28bn public sector
borrowing requirement planned for the coming financial year would be used
for tax cuts.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Donation to Tories not disclosed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEASING company now owned by Bank Austria made a donation of Pounds
100,000 to the Conservative party in 1990 which was not disclosed in the
company's accounts, it emerged yesterday.
Annual returns for Sovereign Leasing, based in Manchester, show that the new
owners discovered a political donation made in February 1990 but not
previously recorded in the accounts.
News of the contribution comes a week after it was revealed that Mr Asil
Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, contributed Pounds
440,000 to the Conservative party during the 1980s. Some of the money was
drawn on cheques from companies in the group but not disclosed.
The 1985 Companies Act requires that any political or charitable donations
of more than Pounds 200 should be shown in an annual report.
Sovereign was founded by Mr Paul Green and Mr Martin Harrison, two
Manchester entrepreneurs. Mrs Thatcher opened the company's Manchester
headquarters in 1990.
Bank Austria acquired a majority stake in Sovereign in summer 1990 and
bought the remaining shares last June. Mr Green and Mr Harrison resigned at
that time.
Bank Austria said the donation was included in the accounts for the year to
June 30 1991 after it took over the company.
The Conservative party said yesterday: 'We have no duty to police company
law. We accept donations, but they are a private matter.'

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Budget relief among marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Budget bears the hallmark of Mr John Major, he seems to have recalled
his days in the whips' office and thought of the need to hearten those
troops with the hardest battles to fight in the coming campaign.
In terms of Conservative marginals, Tuesday's package contained something
for just about everyone.
The best value for money may be the changes to the transitional arrangements
for the uniform business rate.
For a cost of Pounds 480m next year and Pounds 590m the following year, the
Budget has relieved the position in southern seats where small retail
businesses had suffered under revaluation. Two examples are Bath, where Mr
Chris Patten is defending a majority of less than 1,500, and Ipswich, where
Mr Michael Irvine won by less than 1,000 in 1987.
It has also helped in some seats in the north of England, where the gains
from the business rate will flow through more quickly. Mr Tim Devlin,
defending a 800 majority in Stockton South, was among those welcoming the
change.
There was also a heartfelt sigh of relief at the halving of the special car
tax, and other measures to help the motor industry, from a swathe of West
Midlands marginals.
These include not only Mr Roger King's constituency of Birmingham
Northfield, held by just over 3,000 and containing the Rover plant at
Longbridge, but others with factories making car components, such as
Wolverhampton North-East, held by Mrs Maureen Hicks with a majority scarcely
over 200.
Another measure welcomed across a range of marginals was the removal of
family businesses - including working farms - from inheritance tax.
This was highlighted for country constituencies containing family farms
central to the local economy.
The extra money for pensioners on income support may particularly benefit
not traditionally safe Tory seats, but some industrial marginals and a few
rural ones where the proportion of poorer pensioners can be higher than
average.
The new 20p tax band is also versatile. In southern urban marginals - such
as Thurrock where Mr Tim Janman defends a 700 majority and Swindon where Mr
Simon Coombs is defending a majority of just under 5,000 - it is seen as
crucial in retrieving or shoring up the blue-collar C1 and C2 vote that
brought the Tories victory in the past.
It also helps in more rural seats, many of them targeted by the Liberal
Democrats, where there are large numbers of workers in low-paid farming and
tourism jobs. One is Torridge and West Devon, held by Miss Emma Nicholson
with a 6,500 majority.
The Budget also proved a little can go a long way. Mr Lamont's robust
comments about the future of the cider industry did not add anything to
public borrowing but will doubtless find their way into election addresses
in the south-west.
Most Tory MPs seem reconciled to the limits on what the Budget could do and
appreciative of the skill shown. But there was still some wistful talk of
cut in interest rates.
'It hasn't lost it for us, but ask me next week whether it's won it,' one
backbencher with a 6,000-odd majority said yesterday. 'People should be
grateful, but they can be perverse.'

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: As one door closes, there's always Lord Sutch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THAT it?', exclaimed the seasoned Downing Street watcher as Mr John Major
gave a second left-handed wave and retreated behind the black door of Number
10.
After so much waiting, the manner in which The Day was named was
anti-climactic in the extreme. A brief speech. A handful of questions. And
it was all over.
As a media event, it was low-key even by the right honourable member for
Huntingdon's standards. It was little surprise that Mr Major finally made up
his mind over a hearty 8am breakfast of poached eggs on toast.
An early indication of the day's undramatic tenor came later in the morning
as ministers arrived at Downing Street for a cabinet meeting.
Tired television crews broke into a chorus of the chant: 'Ere We Go] Ere We
Go]' in a bid to induce an official nod or wink of confirmation.
Most ministers had left their official cars at the far end of Downing Street
to walk the last few yards, perhaps preparing for life after government.
As little as 10 minutes before Mr Major's 1pm announcement was due, the
distinctly subdued atmosphere persisted. One political editor scrutinised
the Cheltenham racecard.
There was a mild stir among waiting journalists as the famous black door
again swung open to reveal a bouquet of flowers. This was whisked - along
with a personal note from the prime minister - to a waiting car and onwards
to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the 'delighted' recipient.
At 12.58pm precisely, Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman, the formidable
Conservative MP for Lancaster, put in an unexpected appearance, taking up a
strategic position among waiting journalists.
Her presence was a mystery, but all was revealed a few moments later when
she greeted the emerging prime minister with a shrill cheer.
During his brief stint at the microphone, Mr Major was accompanied by an
inscrutable Mr Chris Patten. As he listened, one of the Tory party
chairman's few discernible gestures was to shake his head vigorously at one
pressman's suggestion that this might be a dirty campaign.
'There's Lord Sutch,' shouted a man with a ponytail as we threaded our way
back through the gaggle of tourists clustered around the gate separating
Downing Street and Whitehall.
And, sure enough, there was the life and soul of the Monster Raving Loony
party, resplendent in trademark top hat and glittering gold suit.
The notorious rocker was telling anyone who would listen that he had come to
be notified of the election date in his capacity as Britain's
'longest-serving party leader.'
Meanwhile, Britain's shortest-serving party leader was preparing for the
most important month of his political life.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Labour set to push 'time for a change'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK will today kick off Labour's election campaign with a news
conference to promote his party's 'time for a change' message, followed by a
rousing rallying call to his MPs at Westminster.
The Labour leader dusted off what was once described as the 'oldest and most
potent slogan in politics' yesterday when he welcomed the election
announcement.
Exuding confidence, he told a television interviewer: 'The country needs an
election, the country needs a new government and new leadership.'
Later, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, took up the theme in a
television broadcast condemning the Tories for using tax cuts to win votes.
In a softly-spoken presentation, he claimed that the Budget had offered a
simple if important choice between 'consumption and investment, between
borrowing to spend now and borrowing to invest in our future.'
Labour's election machine was up and running long before yesterday's
lunchtime announcement, as frontbench spokesmen weighed into the
government's Budget as 'a shallow, transparent and weak attempt to gain
favour'.
Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign co-ordinator, said the Budget was
intended to see the Tories through until election day, but had withered
under widespread criticism within 24 hours of its delivery.
He was backed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, and Mr Tony
Blair, the shadow employment secretary, who both attacked the package for
failing to address rising unemployment and the need for investment.
As all eyes turned to Downing Street, Labour campaigners across Britain had
begun delivering some 14,000 opening electoral addresses. A total of 4m are
expected to have been posted across the country by the end of the weekend.
In the Commons, Mr Smith launched a bravura attack on the Budget to the
delight of his backbenchers.
Pouring scorn on the government's record with a sheaf of statistics on the
country's economic performance, he said: 'The hallmark of Majorism is to
promise that good times are round the corner.
'Unfortunately, we never seem to turn the corner.'
Instead of a Budget for recovery, he said, the Tories were 'borrowing money
they don't have to buy votes they don't deserve'. He concluded: 'Time has
run out for a government living on borrowed money and borrowed time.'
Throughout the day, it was clear that the slogan - 'It's time for Labour' -
will be mercilessly promoted throughout Labour's campaign. Several Labour
MPs conceded privately that the party's greatest obstacle in the coming
campaign would be voters' nervousness of change.
'Our job is to persuade people we don't bite,' one MP said.
Mr Kinnock will speak at the Scottish Labour party conference in Edinburgh
on Friday while other senior shadow frontbenchers are due to make platform
appearances at a London rally throughout the weekend.
The first important hurdle for Labour will come on Tuesday when Mr Smith is
due to submit the party's alternative Budget plan to the close perusal of
economists.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Ashdown stresses need for 'coalition'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday made his strongest
call yet for 'coalition' government, warning that Britain faced a 'crisis of
governability'.
His first election speech eschewed Labour and Tory attempts to focus on
health or the economy, echoing instead 1970s fears that the UK could become
ungovernable.
Rather than union or business domination, he said, the danger now was 'the
long-running failure of British democracy to modernise itself, and its
inability to produce governments that command national support'.
Neither Labour nor the Tories had a 'theme' to their campaigns and it was
'quite likely' that no party would have a majority after April 9, Mr Ashdown
said at a Commons press gallery lunch.
Liberal Democrat MPs were last night completing the party's manifesto,
expected to be launched on Monday or Tuesday. Still to be resolved was
whether the party would back the new 20p lower rate of tax - or propose a 1p
increase in the 25p basic rate to fund an extra Pounds 2bn education
spending.
Mr Ashdown hinted at the manifesto's theme, setting constitutional reform as
his priority. He argued that 'the ground for political reform has never been
so well-prepared'.
A hung parliament would mean 'that the other two minority parties - who
haven't since 1951 won more that 50 per cent of the vote in a general
election - have failed even to win a majority of seats under our rigged
electoral system'.
The Liberal Democrats expect most attention to focus on their conditions for
a coalition government.
So far, Mr Ashdown has set electoral reform, an agreed four-year programme
of government and ministerial posts for Liberal Democrat MPs as his demands
 -and he has shown no sign of softening his stance.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Hammond admits to talks with Murdoch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS FOR reconcilia-tion between the EETPU electricians' union and the
Trades Union Congress deteriorated yesterday as the union's leader revealed
his role in events which led to printworkers losing their jobs at News
International, the newspaper publisher, in the mid 1980s.
Mr Eric Hammond, EETPU general secretary, says he held secret talks with Mr
Rupert Murdoch, News International chief executive, for nearly a year over
proposals which led to EETPU members taking the jobs of printworkers in new
premises in Wapping, London.
The disclosure in Mr Hammond's autobiography will cast a shadow over talks
on the re-affiliation of the EETPU to the TUC as part of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union. The AEEU will be formed in May with the
merger of the EETPU and the AEU engineering workers' union. The EETPU was
expelled from the TUC in 1988 for refusing to implement rulings on
inter-union disputes.
The EETPU had said previously that early discussions with News International
were conducted at local and branch level and by a national secretary. Senior
EETPU officials had implied they considered the talks to be a mistake.
Although Mr Hammond steps down as general secretary tomorrow, leaders of
other unions will want to know whether senior colleagues - including Mr Paul
Gallagher, his successor - were aware of Mr Hammond's role.
Mr Gallagher was unavailable for comment yesterday, but colleagues indicated
he was surprised by the extent of Mr Hammond's involvement. Mr Gavin Laird,
general secretary of the AEU, said he was disappointed by Mr Hammond's
account.
Mr Hammond recalls telling Mr Murdoch as early as February 1985, nearly a
year before Wapping opened, that his members could operate print machinery
at the new plant. 'There was an almost audible click as Rupert suddenly
realised that here was an opportunity to end print-union power once and for
all,' Mr Hammond writes.
News International subsequently sacked 5,500 print workers, sparking a
year-long dispute which led to violent clashes with police outside the
plant. Some 180 EETPU members worked as printers at Wapping, but the company
refused to sign a recognition deal with the union. 'He (Rupert Murdoch) has
shown no spark of gratitude, even though he couldn't have succeeded without
us,' says Mr Hammond.
The disclosures are likely to strengthen the resolve of some leftwing
unions, including the GPMU printers, to extract harsh terms from the EETPU
in the TUC affiliation talks.
Mr Hammond says in his book that in 1984 he offered a deal in confidence to
Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM miners' union president, by which he would have
balloted power workers on striking if Mr Scargill had agreed to ballot the
NUM on a strike already in progress.

FT  12 MAR 92 / MMC threat to British Gas lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GORDON BORRIE, director-general of fair trading, yesterday lifted his
threat to refer British Gas to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in
return for undertakings from the company to withdraw from more than half of
the UK industrial and commercial gas market, David Lascelles writes.
British Gas, which had been resisting the Office of Fair Trading's efforts
to make it reduce the extent of its dominance of the UK gas business,
promised to implement the agreement 'in a constructive spirit and orderly
manner'.
British Gas will reduce its share of the industrial and commercial market
from 95 per cent to 40 per cent by 1995 by handing over the difference to
new shippers.
At the same time, it will split its pipeline and storage operations from the
rest of its business. They will form an independent unit which will provide
equal treatment to British Gas and other shippers. A transparent pricing
system is to be drawn up.
The Gas Consumers' Council said the success of the deal depended on whether
British Gas would be able to recover lost profits by raising gas prices.
'New challenges face the regulators in ensuring that shareholders do not
benefit at the expense of the customers,' said Mr Ian Powe, its director.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions to assess NHS offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders in the National Health Service yesterday agreed to consult
their members on a pay offer worth 4.93 per cent to administrative and
clerical workers.
The offer, described as final, is the first of the present pay round to be
negotiated in the NHS, and will be seen as a strong pointer to offers to be
made elsewhere in the public sector.
The above-inflation amount falls short of increases offered to other workers
in the public sector, where the government has agreed to implement
pay-review body recommendations. The average for nurses, doctors, teachers
and members of the armed forces was nearly 6.5 per cent.
The five unions representing white-collar health workers had claimed a rise
of Pounds 16 a week, or 10 per cent, whichever was greater.
Nalgo, the public sector union which represents most of the 140,000 workers
covered by the talks, said: 'After 10 hours of talks, an offer of Pounds 400
or 4.75 per cent, whichever is the greater, was made.' It said the offer
meant 61,000 Nalgo low-paid members would receive a flat-rate increase of
Pounds 400 a year.
The unions said most of the administration and clerical workers covered by
the talks earned between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 9,000. BT, the
telecommunications group, won a test-case ruling yesterday that it was
within its rights to send home two managers without pay after they returned
from strike action during a continuing wages dispute. That was because the
two refused to sign a pledge when they returned not to take part in any
further industrial action.
The Court of Appeal allowed BT's appeal against county-court compensation to
the two managers for wages lost as a result of not being allowed to work
during the 1989-1990 dispute. The ruling will be applicable to more than 100
other people who took similar action. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords
was refused. Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain, said yesterday it was
freezing pay for a year for all of its 65,000 employees except a few
low-paid workers covered by the Food Wages Council who will receive a 4.2
per cent rise next month.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Deal with Borrie helps to clear clouds of acrimony: An
agreement that ends months of hard bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RON PROBERT, who has been representing British Gas in its tortuous
negotiations with the Office of Fair Trading, said: 'It's the end of a long
road marked by bumps and pitfalls.'
It was something of an understatement. Yesterday's agreement was the
culmination of months of hard bargaining in which Mr John Wakeham, the
energy secretary, had intervened at times to prevent collapse. Nor is it the
end of the road - implementing the deal will take three years.
The agreement, designed to reduce the dominance of British Gas in the UK
market, obliges the company to retreat from more than half the industrial
gas market, which represents about a third of the total market. It will also
have to split its pipeline business from the rest of its operations so it
can be managed as an arm's-length entity serving British Gas on equal terms
with other gas shippers.
All those close to the deal - the OFT, British Gas itself and Sir James
McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the regulator - welcomed it yesterday.
It dispels the acrimony surrounding gas, and removes the threat of a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission with its attendant
uncertainties.
They were all also agreed that the success of the agreement depends on
British Gas abiding by the spirit as much as the letter. This is something
the company was keen to stress it would do. 'We are totally committed to
these undertakings,' said Mr Probert. 'We're not going to undermine them.'
British Gas will withdraw from the industrial market in stages over the next
three years. It will do this by on-selling gas it is contracted to buy to
other shippers. It is assumed that other companies will be willing to buy
this gas, but if the quantities or prices offered fail to attract buyers,
the OFT will be able to step in and set terms which ensure sales.
Instead of being a direct supplier, British Gas will become a middleman for
this segment of the market. But the danger is that this could leave some
industrial consumers without gas or facing sharp price rises - particularly
in the market for interruptible supplies, which can be less profitable if
supplies become unbalanced. The OFT has accepted British Gas's promise to
satisfy 'so far as it is economical to do so, any reasonable request for a
supply of gas'.
Sir James said there was an element of 'competition for its own sake' about
this aspect of the deal, and he warned that he would use his powers to
compel British Gas to keep supplies flowing.
British Gas has until January 1994 to set up its separate transportation and
storage unit, so the shippers who take over its business will have access to
a transmission network. But in the coming weeks British Gas will have to
publish a discussion document laying out the pricing arrangements. This will
have to be approved by the OFT.
Overall, the agreement marks something of a victory for British Gas, which
went into the negotiations uttering dire warnings about the danger of
massive disruption to the gas market if attempts were made to break it up.
The OFT has scaled back its original aim of reducing British Gas's share of
the industrial market to 25 per cent. Instead, the target share is now 40
per cent. Also, British Gas will be able to keep its transmission business,
albeit as a separately accounted unit. Provided the gas-release negotiations
go according to plan, the company need not face another review until 1995.
Although the deal will cost British Gas a sizeable segment of its existing
business, the impact on profits could turn out to be smaller than feared.
The company estimated yesterday that the overall cost, by the time of full
implementation in 1995, would be less than Pounds 100m before tax. (Last
year it earned Pounds 1.16bn after tax).
The loss of profits from the divested business will be offset by two fresh
sources of revenue. One will be the on-selling, for which British Gas will
charge a handling fee and a premium to reflect its risk. The other will be
transmission fees for the pipeline business.
'People are relieved that a monopolies reference has been removed,' Mr Paul
Spedding, gas industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, commented on
the overall deal.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): RMT probes claim of ballot-rigging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RMT, Britain's largest transport workers' union, is to investigate
allegations of ballot-rigging in the NUS seamen's union, which merged with
the NUR rail union to form the RMT in 1990.
The allegations, first made in the mid 1980s, have resurfaced after the
widow of a senior official said she helped him fill in nearly 2,000 stolen
ballot papers. The 1985 ballot was cleared by a TUC inquiry in 1987.
The RMT's decision to set up a seven-member committee of inquiry is
potentially embarrassing for the Labour party because the RMT is likely to
question Mr Sam McCluskie, the party treasurer, who was NUS general
secretary at the time.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, promised a thorough
investigation. No timescale has been set, but the investigation is likely to
be long. The committee will report to the union's executive committee.
The union denied it had a vested interest in not finding evidence of fraud.
'It is an honest inquiry into allegations made about a union that no longer
exists, technically,' it said.
The inquiry committee will have a minority of former NUS officers, said the
RMT. None of them had been the subject of allegations.

FT  12 MAR 92 / EC opens new inquiry into BAe 'sweeteners'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday opened a new inquiry into the legality of
'sweeteners' paid to British Aerospace by the UK government when the company
bought Rover, the carmaker, in 1988.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner and a former Conservative
cabinet minister, promised to open a new probe last month after the European
Court of Justice overturned on a technicality the commission's 1990 decision
to order repayment of the Pounds 44.4m of sweeteners. The court said the
commission should have opened a separate investigation to discover whether
the sweetners were illegal state aid. It did not look into the substance of
the case.
Sir Leon's fellow commissioners, meeting in Strasbourg, backed his call for
a full state-aid inquiry. Their decision is set to revive the controversy
surrounding the original BAe/Rover deal - and Sir Leon's reaction to it - at
a time when all British political parties are seeking electoral ammunition.
But commission officials said the election campaign was not a factor in the
timing of the announcement.
The commission said it was 'still of the opinion that the measures taken by
the British government in 1988 constituted illegal state aid'. In spite of
that, the inquiry is unlikely to be completed before the election.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Two cheers for proposals on life assurance sales: The new
disclosure regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINDING a way of putting price-tags on life assurance policies has not been
easy for regulators. The Securities and Investments Board's new regime for
disclosure of policy charges treads a fine line between the demands of
consumer groups and those of the industry, giving both some of what they had
demanded but falling short of what each had long sought.
'I'd give it two cheers,' said Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of the Consumers'
Association's money group. 'It will force the industry to come clean on
up-front costs.'
The new regime was prompted by pressure from the Office of Fair Trading
(OFT), which in 1989 ruled that life companies inhibit competition by
telling prospective buyers too little to make informed choices.
It also said that, because agents failed to disclose how much commission
they were paid, consumers were paying for life companies' efforts to win
market share.
Yesterday Sir David Walker, SIB chairman, stressed the extent to which the
new disclosure regime was likely to meet those objections.
'What we are proposing will have a significant effect on competition,' he
said.
He also acknowledged the greatest fear of the life industry - that the new
rules may prompt consumers to choose other savings products, such as those
offered by building societies, which did not penalise investors for early
withdrawal. He joined the life industry in calling for those savings
products to come under a disclosure regime.
Any protests are likely to be in vain. There will be a two-month
consultation period, but Sir David said the proposals were not likely to be
revised significantly unless the Department of Trade and Industry or the OFT
objected to them.
Consumer representatives say the new regime falls short in two important
ways. It will not force sales agents to disclose the amount of commission
they earn, and it allows companies to use in advertisements industry-wide
averages of expenses rather than figures specific to the company. Thus,
consumers do not see the exact cost of a product.
The Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association, said
it shared the regulators' objectives. But it was unhappy about having to
tell prospective customers the amount by which charges are likely to reduce
investment returns by the time the policy matures.
'Policyholders may look at the information and be confused,' the association
said.
Mr Brian Sharp, manager of life assurance at the association, said it would
try to persuade SIB to change its mind, and if not successful, would take
its case to the DTI.
It is precisely the pounds-and-pence expression of cost that consumer groups
have been seeking. Sir David said SIB's own research showed that charges
varied vastly among insurance companies, reducing each pound of return by
anything from 6p to 40p. Average costs are between 11p and 19p per pound of
final maturity value.
The association is also unhappy about disclosing the cross-over point - at
which a policyholder's payback is equivalent to the total of all premiums
paid. According to Lautro, the self-regulatory body for life assurance and
unit trust sales agents, this can take seven to 10 years on a 20-year
policy. The association says this can change during the life of a policy, as
investment returns vary.
Consumer groups - and indeed the government - have sought this type of
information for years.
Until now, insurance companies have not had to disclose more than the
percentage by which the final investment return might be reduced on maturity
to cover the costs of the policy. This is known as reduction in yield.
Under the the new regime, prospective buyers must be told:
The amount of their premiums which will be retained by the company to cover
expenses if they surrender the policy in each of the first five years.
Companies will also have to show the cross-over point.
The amount of pence per pound by which expenses will reduce investment
returns over the life of the policy.
Who the sales agent is working for and the relationship to the company whose
products are being sold.
A written statement of why a particular product has been recommended.
After the contract is signed, a customer must be given cost information
specific to his or her own case, and must be told the surrender values of
policies in years beyond the cross-over point.
SIB satisfied a number of industry critics by abandoning plans to allow unit
trusts to be 'depolarised' - sold through outlets tied to another producer.
It also abandoned plans for 'multi-tying', which would have allowed sales
agents to sell the products of another company if their own did not offer a
competing product.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Guy's hospital trust avoids deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS at Guy's Hospital, London, have told staff that the trust hospital
will break even this financial year in spite of predictions of a Pounds 2m
deficit.
Guy's and Lewisham, the best-known of the government's first self-governing
trusts established last April, was identified as heading for a Pounds 2m
deficit in a Department of Health memorandum leaked by the Labour party last
month.
Yesterday Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive, said that the trust would
break even. Staff have been told that in its first year of operation the
Guy's and Lewisham trust will have treated 6,000 more patients than in the
previous 12 months while remaining within its income.
There have been allegations - denied by managers at Guy's - that additional
government money has been channelled to the trust by ministers, who would
find it embarrassing for the most prominent trust hospital to fail to meet
its targets.
During a stormy first year as a trust, expenditure at Guy's was cut by
Pounds 9m, largely through eliminating posts.
Mr Griffiths said Guy's had reduced its overall unit costs by 9 per cent. He
hoped this would enable the trust to remain competitive in the new
contract-based system of funding health care.
While Guy's managers say they hope to avoid further cuts such as this year's
loss of posts, 1992-93 will see the start of a big drive for improved
productivity. London's hospitals face a maintenance backlog of nearly Pounds
450m, according to the King's Fund Commission, a charity concerned with the
development of the health service. It found that the four Thames regional
health authorities faced a maintenance backlog of more than Pounds 900m.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Ferry operators rebuffed on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-CHANNEL car ferry operators were yesterday rebuffed by the government
in their request to be allowed to merge their Dover-Calais services to fight
competition from the Channel tunnel, Richard Tomkins writes.
The Department of Trade and Industry, accepting a recommendation from the
Office of Fair Trading, said it would not release the ferry operators from
earlier undertakings preventing them from merging their cross-Channel
operations.
The approach to the Department of Trade and Industry was made in January by
P&amp;O, the market leader on the route. P&amp;O and Sealink Stena Line, its biggest
rival, have long argued that their only chance of competing with the tunnel
is to join forces and offer a single high-frequency service between Dover
and Calais.
P&amp;O wants to remove Sealink from the Dover-Calais route so that it can run
the service on its own.
DTI officials pointed out that P&amp;O's submission had been followed by an
announcement from Eurotunnel that the tunnel's full operation would be
delayed until mid 1994, a year later than planned.
The Department of Transport has approved a British Rail order for 1,000
wagons costing Pounds 65m for Channel-tunnel freight services.

FT  12 MAR 92 / 'Green' lobby wins a victory on road plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE environmental consequences of schemes for trunk roads and motorways are
to be given more weight when deciding whether roads should be built, the
Department of Transport announced yesterday.
The decision is a significant concession to the 'green' lobby, which has
long argued that procedures for assessing the environmental impact of road
schemes are inadequate and unfair.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, an independent lobbying
group on conservation issues, called the decision 'a ray of sunshine from
the Department of Transport.'
Concern over damage to sites of special scientific interest or areas of
outstanding natural beauty has been at the forefront of objections to many
big road schemes such as the extension of the M3 through Twyford Down,
Hampshire.
It has also brought allegations from Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European
environment commissioner, that Britain's methods of assessing the
environmental impact of several recent infrastructure schemes has been
defective.
Yesterday's announcement stems from a study of the Transport Department's
methods for assessing environmental costs by the Standing Committee on Trunk
Road Assessment, an independent advisory committee.
The long delay in publication of the committee's findings, which was
expected last summer, has given rise to the belief that transport ministers
have lost a battle with the Environment Department on the need for a more
pro-environment approach.
Mr Christopher Chope, minister for roads and traffic, said the government
had accepted the main principles of the standing committee's report. As a
result, it would integrate environmental concerns more directly into
transport policy, ensuring that environmental objectives and concerns were
given full weight when carrying out a cost/benefit analysis. It would also
accept in principle the idea of putting a financial value on environmental
effects and incorporate this into the cost/benefit equation. Tougher
penalties for motoring offences will come into effect on July 1, Mr Chope
said yesterday.
The changes, which include the new offence of causing death by dangerous
driving, were created in the Road Traffic Act 1991. Penalties will include
possible disqualification after just two speeding offences, and up to six
months' imprisonment for 'hit and run' drivers.
Assessing the Environmental Impact of Road Schemes. Standing Committee on

FT  12 MAR 92 / Nuclear Electric cuts prices further for industrial
consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned company that operates the English and
Welsh nuclear power stations, is offering cut-price electricity to
industrial consumers signing 12-month contracts before Monday.
The offer of power at 2.3p per unit plus an adjustment for inflation, 5 per
cent below the previous price of 2.425p, follows a warning this week by
Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, that it would monitor Nuclear
Electric after customers accused the company of withholding power to force
up the price.
Nuclear Electric cut its prices by just over 1 per cent and then a further 3
per cent earlier this month when Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, was
understood to have been concerned about its influence on the market.
Although National Power and PowerGen, the privatised electricity generators,
are bigger than Nuclear Electric, contracts put into place at privatisation
mean they have to sell most of their power to domestic consumers until March
31 next year. This has left Nuclear Electric dominating the industrial
market and setting a benchmark power price.
But Nuclear Electric said its latest price-cuts decision was purely
commercial. 'We have always challenged the view that we were squeezing the
market,' said Mr Gerald Cavalier, the company's marketing and sales manager.
'We are committed to act commercially, despite having one big shareholder.'
He said the latest price would not satisfy the large industrial customers
which received government subsidies before privatisation, and want prices of
1.9p to 2.2p.
Nuclear Electric is unlikely to sell much power at the latest price - the
cut comes too late for many consumers whose contracts came up for renewal
last week.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Terms agreed in sale of BTG to managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday concluded one of the final privatisation deals
before the general election by agreeing as expected to sell the British
Technology Group to a management-led consortium.
The group is paying an initial Pounds 27.75m for the technology-transfer
organisation. It will make further payments over the next five years if
BTG's net income from patent royalties exceeds a base level agreed with the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The deferred payments could reach several million pounds if some of the
inventions in BTG's portfolio - ranging from drugs to a continuously
variable transmission system for cars - are successful.
BTG management and staff will participate in the company directly through
individual share subscriptions and indirectly through an employee trust
which will acquire up to 26 per cent of the share capital.
Apart from the trust, no member of the consortium will own more than 15 per
cent.
The consortium includes 10 UK financial institutions, with CIN Venture
Managers, the venture-capital arm of the British Coal pension fund, as lead
investor.
In addition, 12 UK universities will take a stake of up to 5 per cent in BTG
under the aegis of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. The
only non-UK investor is Anvar, a technology-transfer organisation owned by
the French government.
Announcing the sale, Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said:
'The government is convinced that the consortium offers the best prospect
that BTG's present activities will be continued as an independent
organisation.'
The government had also negotiated with a UK-US group chaired by Mr John
Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, with Research
Corporation Technologies of the US as lead investor.
It is believed that the rival consortia offered similar initial payments,
with the UK-US group promising larger performance-related payments for the
future.
But the government rejected the rival bid largely because it was not
satisfied that it would keep BTG independent in the long run.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Treasury and Civil Service Committee Report: Sedgemore
attacks Bank over BCCI affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee examining the collapse of
Bank of Credit and Commerce International was sharply divided down party
lines yesterday over the severity of its criticism of the Bank of England.
The most damning remarks were confined to a lengthy amendment supported only
by Labour MPs which the Tory members refused to accept.
While no criticism is aimed at Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the
main report, he is accused in the amendment by Mr Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP
for Hackney south and Shoreditch, of negligence and dereliction of duty when
he was chancellor for failing to respond to warning signs.
The Sedgemore amendment singles out the Bank of England's decision in 1985
to transfer BCCI's London-based treasury division to Abu Dhabi. The
decision, it says, was 'incomprehensible and one which bordered on the
criminally negligent'.
The Labour members say the Bank of England's view seems to have been 'out of
sight, out of mind', and adds: 'This decision guaranteed that there could
not be proper supervision or regulation'.
The report confines its criticism of the Bank mainly to an observation that
the 'climate of opinion in the Bank of England . . . favoured reconstruction
and reform rather than restrictions and closure'. The Bank's aim to
'preserve rather than terminate', it says, lasted well into 1991.
It adds that this led to a Bank of England decision that a change of
management and an injection of capital justified keeping BCCI open. The
committee says: 'The promise of additional funds from a major shareholder to
make good any deficiencies does not exonerate a regulator from ensuring that
the criteria for authorisation are met. We believe that in future a clear
distinction should be made between solvency and probity, and that the
'minimum criteria for authorisation' should be strictly interpreted.'
The main report seems more notable for what it does not say. The committee
accepts the argument from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor,
that 'it is asking a lot of (auditors) or of supervisors necessarily to
uncover deliberate and well-designed fraud'.
But the report notes that 'the fact that BCCI had two auditors until 1987
must have made the deception easier and helped BCCI conceal the true facts'.
It also criticises the decision by Price Waterhouse not to qualify the 1989
accounts. The integrity of the audit statement, it says, rested only on a
short note to the accounts.
Mr Sedgemore's amendment lists 33 warning signs on BCCI up to the date of
its closure. Even the main body of the report concedes that 'the Bank of
England was well aware that there were problems at BCCI even as far back as
the 1970s'. The committee refers to a Financial Times article in 1978 that
said Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the bank's former chief executive, had been viewed
with suspicion by the financial establishment.
'We believe that warning signs were always there,' the MPs say. 'The rapid
expansion across the world of an unorthodox and opaque banking group had
concerned international regulators as early as 1976. BCCI's existence in the
UK was never challenged, but its structure and methods were constantly
criticised and periodically examined.'
Mr Sedgemore focuses on several points that he believes would have indicated
fraud earlier if they had been properly investigated.
He says the Bank was negligent in not knowing that CAPCOM Financial
Services, a company which had Pounds 200m of BCCI money channelled
fraudulently into it, was an associated company of BCCI through ownership
and management links.
Mr Sedgemore says the Securities and Investments Board, chaired by Sir David
Walker, a director of the Bank of England, had reason to know of CAPCOM's
criminal activities with BCCI from 1989. 'Here was another startling warning
of the need to close down BCCI years before the event,' he adds. 'In short,
the Bank of England had every reason to investigate this company but did
not.'
Another crucial indicator, over which the Labour MPs say the Bank of England
was negligent, was a qualification by Price Waterhouse, the BCCI auditors,
of the accounts of ICIC Foundation. The accountants made their qualification
because they had been unable to value the foundation's part-ownership of the
BCCI holding company.
'We believe that had the Bank of England known this, as most of the
cognoscenti in the financial world did, then they would have been forced to
ask questions about how it was possible to pass the accounts of BCCI
(Holdings) SA without qualification,' says the amendment.
Mr Sedgemore includes a suggestion in his amendment that the Bank might have
been more concerned about Middle East relations than protecting depositors.
It says: 'We believe the Bank was not anxious to expose corruption in Abu
Dhabi or the part that Saudi Arabia's biggest bank, the National Commercial
Bank, owned by Sheikh Khaled bin Mahfouz, played, according to the
uncensored Section 41 report which we have just seen, in hiding huge frauds
in BCCI. If this did happen, then it constitutes a clear fraud on the
depositors by the Bank of England.'
The Labour MPs spell out five points which they said the Bank of England was
aware of before March 1990:
Weaknesses in BCCI's accounting controls.
Bad management.
The resignation of Ernst &amp; Whinney from auditing one arm of the bank.
Laundering of drug money by BCCI.
The existence of BCCI accounts held by terrorists.
With this knowledge, says Mr Sedgemore, Mr Major was 'in dereliction of his
duty as chancellor in failing to suggest to the governor the closure' of
BCCI.
Mr Major, he adds, 'must take his share of the blame in allowing the
greatest financial fraud in political history to continue.'

MRS Carla Hills, the US trade representative, continues to hope for a
successful outcome to Gatt's Uruguay Round before June next year, so that
she will not have to ask Congress to renew her negotiating authority again.
Implicitly leaving the Gatt talks without a deadline, Mrs Hills told a House
of Representatives trade sub-committee yesterday that EC disarray on farm
trade reform continued to delay a final pact. By contrast, negotiations for
a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) might be concluded this year,
even in spring.
If a Gatt agreement was not in place by June 1993, she would have to engage
in another debate with Congress over fast-track negotiating authority. The
last debate, which resulted in a two-year extension of the authority last
year, was a strenuous exercise that dominated her agenda for several months.
She had urged renewal of the authority on the grounds that the EC was at
last ready to reform its farm support, thus removing an obstacle to
agreement. But the EC was still not 'of one mind on its negotiating
position'. The US and EC had held 'some quiet meetings', she added.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Pragmatism rules the day as Drexel saga concludes:
Settlement leaves issues untried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Monday afternoon, as yet more lawyers poured into Room 1305 in the
Manhattan district courthouse, someone noticed that the clock was slow.
'Is that 'Pollack' time?' muttered a former employee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert, referring to the fierce octogenarian judge who has overseen a mass
of civil litigation flowing from the investment bank's collapse in 1990.
'Pollack mean time,' remarked his neighbour, tartly.
It was an appropriate quip. It took another hour's wait and more last-ditch
manoeuvring before a beaming Judge Milton Pollack could complete his final
act of coercion, and declare that a single 'global' settlement to hundreds
of suits resulting from the bank's demise had been reached. What had looked
to be 'mission impossible' when negotiations started at Thanksgiving, he
declared triumphantly, had been achieved in less than four months.
In one respect, this final act in the Drexel saga should be welcomed. Had
the cases been contested in the courts lawyers estimate they would have been
extended into the next century, with associated expenses.
But, in other respects, the settlement, which creates a Dollars 1.3bn
(Pounds 730m) 'pool' to be divided between the numerous claimants, is less
satisfactory. It leaves much of the controversy about Drexel - probably the
most significant force on Wall Street in the 1980s - untried in any
objective forum.
It also allows Mr Michael Milken, former head of the bank's junk bond
department and its chief money-spinner, to remain extremely rich. The
political niceties of this - Mr Milken has, after all, pleaded guilty to six
breaches of securities law - appeared to give the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, a leading government claimant, pause for thought. However, it
approved the settlement, with some added safeguards.
Finally, the deal permits 200 former Drexel employees to swap the bulk of
their lucrative interests in the Drexel employee partnerships (which
invested in many of the bank's junk bond offerings), for immunity from
future lawsuits. That is an option which few can probably afford to refuse.
But the notion that money buys legal peace, regardless of innocence or
guilt, is scarcely an admirable judicial cornerstone.
The debate surrounding Drexel has always involved two issues, connected but
often confused. The first centres on the use of junk bonds, which the bank,
via Mr Milken's department, pioneered. Critics claim that this was
'boot-strap' financing, allowing ill-qualified entrepreneurs to gain control
of big corporations. Many of today's bankruptcies are cited as evidence of
the folly.
Mr Milken, to judge from a recent Forbes magazine interview conducted in his
prison's canteen, remains unrepentant - although he acknowledges that
debt-financing should have ended much sooner.
The argument will probably rage on - and no court would have ever addressed
the matter. But there was a second, narrower aspect to the Drexel debate,
which might have been resolved by litigation. Did the junk bond department,
as many believe, function so successfully thanks to a carefully cultivated
network of customers to whom it offered illegal favours and inducements? Or
was it a basically honest operation?
A partial, and largely unsatisfactory, effort to prove the former was made
by government lawyers in Milken's pre-sentencing hearing last year. Now any
full-scale trial of this matter has been obviated.
Pragmatism overtook principle in the Drexel litigation long ago. In June
1990 the FDIC set up a special task force to investigate whether Drexel had
contributed to the failure of various thrifts, which had been big customers
of the bank. A few months later - in conjunction with the Resolution Trust
Company, which is overseeing the savings and loan industry bailout - the
federal agency called in a New York law firm to see if monies could be
recovered from Drexel's demise.
The FDIC/RTC and their lawyers have since been a driving force in both the
Drexel bankruptcy and the civil litigation. The bankruptcy, which began in
February 1990, was tackled first. Drexel assets were relatively easy to
calculate - about Dollars 2.6bn - and a deal struck which split these
between the bank's creditors and the various parties suing Drexel.
One lawyer calculates that once priority claims and expenses have consumed
around Dollars 750m, the other 'fixed' creditors will share well over
Dollars 1bn. The rest will be divided between the 'securities litigants' -
including the FDIC/RTC and the individual investor 'class action' suits.
(The bankruptcy reorganisation plan, essentially winding up the bank's
affairs, was also approved on Monday.)
All parties then looked at the more ill-defined monies that might be
recovered from former Drexel employees, notably Mr Milken. The result has
been to create the Dollars 1.3bn settlement pool. Of this a small amount,
perhaps Dollars 85m, flows back to Drexel's fixed creditors, while the
bank's own interests in the employee partnerships - valued at about Dollars
185m - are released from litigation. The rest gets split between the
litigants under court and SEC supervision.
The chief contribution to this Dollars 1.3bn pool comes from Mr Milken. Some
Dollars 400m comprises monies he had already paid into a Securities and
Exchange Commission disgorgement fund, and to this he is adding a further
Dollars 500m. The new money will be contributed in tranches over five years.
This Dollars 500m is said to represent 80 per cent of his remaining personal
wealth - but that does not allow for the assets held by his wife and
immediate family.
Meanwhile, 200 former Drexel employees - a small proportion of 10,000 which
the bank once employed - are giving up Dollars 300m worth of partnership
interests. Some lawyers have suggested the total value of these is Dollars
500m. A final Dollars 100m in the Dollars 1.3bn pool comes from insurance
carriers, including Lloyd's, under directors' and officers' liability
policies.
'You know you have a good settlement when nobody likes it,' said one lawyer
at the hearing. That seemed to sum up the pragmatic outcome of one of Wall
Street's most controversial episodes.

FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Ireland explores its yachting havens -
Low-cost moorings could provide a bolt-hole from high UK fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Irish priest St Brendan, set off on his many voyages of discovery
in a tiny curragh over a millennium ago, missionary zeal rather than tourism
was his motivation.
Despite these nascent manifestations of a maritime tradition, Ireland has
until now achieved little in exploiting its unquestioned potential as a
tourist attraction for the growing numbers of sailors and yachtsmen in the
European Community. It has 1,000 miles of coastline, much of it bathed in
the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and perhaps some of the best cruising
areas off north-west Europe.
Bord Failte, the Irish Tourist Board, has since 1989 been promoting a plan
to build a string of marinas at 40-mile intervals around Ireland's southern
and western coastlines.
Only 10,000 of the 3m tourists who visit Ireland each year go there on
sailing holidays. Bord Failte's plan is to develop the infrastructure
necessary to attract yacht owners big and small, not only to spend their
holidays exploring the inlets, small-town pubs and the food of the south of
Ireland, but to base their boats in Ireland to escape the high costs of
marina fees in the UK.
According to Mr Peter Waring, the National Moorings and Marine Co-ordinator
of the UK's Royal Yachting Association (RYA), there are 2m people in the UK
who participate in sailing activities - 'more than watch football'. In the
UK there are 190,000 mooring berths, 45,000 of them walk-on marina berths.
The RYA estimates that there will be a demand for 85,000 new marina berths
over the next 10 years.
He said that berthing fees charged by the big marinas 'have increased by
between 50 and 100 per cent over the last three years', and that as soon as
the recession ends 'the suppliers of berths will again be dictating the
terms'. Mr Waring said UK sailors 'are voting with their keels' and moving
their boats to lower-cost marinas, or selling their larger boats and
returning to dinghy sailing.
Ireland is hoping to tap that market, but despite the availability of
IPounds 3m (Pounds 2.8m) in funds from European Regional Development Funds
for marina development, only two projects have so far come to fruition since
1989 - the 250-berth Kilrush marina, which opened on the west coast of
Ireland last year, and an 80-berth marina at Kinsale in the south.
Mr Jim McGuigan, the investment manager of Bord Failte, said the entire
strategy was under review. In future greater emphasis would be placed on
involving local authorities in developing simpler low-cost facilities at
frequent intervals along the coast, instead of a few large multi-million
ventures which require long pay-off periods and tend to make yachting
prohibitively expensive.
This shift in focus follows a similar trend in the UK. The RYA this month
set up a new venture with Tenershire Marine Limited (TML), a Swansea-based
pontoon manufacturer, to create new low-cost marina-style moorings through
the 1,500 yacht clubs associated with the RYA.
One such development at Swansea marina has created 200 berths which can be
purchased outright for Pounds 1,800 each, the same as a commercial marina
would charge for one year's mooring fees for a modest-sized yacht. 'We can
solve the mooring problem without spending millions,' said Mr David
Nicholas, the marketing director of TML.
Mr McGuigan said: 'That direction is probably the way we shall go in our
next operational programme for 1994-98.' With the development of marinas,
will come the growth of a yacht-chartering industry which is still in its
infancy in Ireland. Bord Failte has in the past 18 months approved five new
charter projects, which will soon quadruple the number of charter boats
available for coastal cruising to more than 60.
BCP, a Dublin-based stockbroker and financial consultant, this year set up a
financing package for charter-boat companies, under the Business Expansion
Scheme (BES), an investment through which top-rate taxpayers can get full
tax relief for five years. Two new companies will be operating out of
southern Ireland this summer.
Mr David Cullen, a chief executive of BCP and a keen yachtsman said: 'Its
virgin territory down there and marvellous sailing.'
Problems over planning permission have seen two commercial-style marina
proposals turned down by local communities on the south coast in the past
two years.
'It's a dichotomy you suffer in Ireland. There is a shortage of jobs, but I
suppose the last thing they want is Ireland becoming like the Solent,' said
Mr Cullen. However, Bord Failte's changing approach, similar to that of the
RYA in promoting low-cost pontoon moorings, 'is the way to go', he said.
St Brendan might scoff at modern-day sailors in their sleek glass-fibre
boats, who demand the walk-on moorings, the hot showers and restaurants that
today's marinas are expected to provide, but as the Irish patron saint of
sailors, he would at least be pleased to know that his country is at last
rediscovering the maritime tradition he began in sackcloths and curraghs.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Commanding lead bolsters Clinton: After Super Tuesday
Arkansas governor has twice as many committed delegates as Tsongas
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas now holds a commanding lead in the battle
for delegates to the Democratic convention in New York in July, which will
decide the party's presidential nominee.
With results in from the 11 states that held presidential primaries and
caucuses on Super Tuesday, Mr Clinton has got the bulk of the delegates from
seven states, including heavily populated Texas and Florida. He now has more
than twice as many delegates committed to him as his closest rival, former
Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts.
Former Governor Jerry Brown of California continued to win respectable
minorities of the votes in many states, but ranks far behind in delegates.
President George Bush, who swept all eight states holding Republican
primaries on Tuesday, has almost 10 times as many delegates as Mr Patrick
Buchanan, his Republican right-wing challenger.
But both Mr Clinton and Mr Bush are a long way from victory. Mr Clinton is
only about a third of the way towards the total 2,144 delegates he needs to
ensure the Democratic nomination on the first ballot.
He cannot achieve this before mid-May and appears unlikely to clinch the
nomination until June, the last big primary day. Mr Bush is half-way towards
the total of 1,105 delegates he needs for the Republican nominating
convention in August in Houston. Mathematically, he too cannot eliminate his
challenger for some weeks.
Bush campaign officials believe they have baulked Mr Buchanan's best chances
of winning a state. Mr Buchanan, a former Nixon speechwriter, saw his share
of the vote fall in several states well below the 30 per cent level he has
previously achieved. In Mississippi, Mr Buchanan had to split the right-wing
and racist vote with Mr David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, and
scored only 17 per cent. In Texas and Tennessee, he scored less than 25 per
cent, although Tennessee - one of the rare Republican states which does not
use a winner-takes-all system for allotting delegates - also provided him
with one of his best harvests of delegates to the Houston convention.
But the Buchanan-Duke combination continued to eat into Mr Bush's vote. In
no single state - even his adopted home of Texas - was the president able to
reach 75 per cent of the Republican vote.
Mr Tsongas sought on Tuesday to play down the significance of Mr Clinton's
victory. 'He won on his home turf and I won on my home turf. The only state
which was neutral territory was Delaware, and I won that,' he said.
This claim might have some foundation were it not for the size of Mr
Clinton's victory in Florida. Although loosely described as a southern
state, Florida is much farther - both geographically and demographically -
from Arkansas than Delaware is from Mr Tsongas's native Massachusetts.
"This is not a regional state, this is a diverse state,' said Mr Jeff Eller,
Governor Clinton's Florida campaign manager. Mr Eller said he was hoping
last week for a 5 to 8 percentage point margin of victory, and described
Tuesday's 15 point margin as 'a rout'.

<TEXT>
CANADA yesterday seized on a debate in Gatt about US trade policy to pursue
trade grievances against its powerful neighbour. Mr Gerald Shannon, Canada's
ambassador to Gatt, said the US seemed to be drifting towards managed trade
and greater protectionism. He singled out US anti-dumping and countervailing
duty laws, which had become the 'instruments of choice for US industries
seeking protection', citing 'arbitrary and capricious' findings of injury,
dumping and subsidy.
Mr Shannon's remarks follow rising US-Canada trade friction. Canada was
yesterday considering retaliatory action against the US for last week
imposing countervailing duties against allegedly subsidised softwood exports
from Canada. Ottawa is also angry at a US customs decision that Honda cars
assembled in Canada do not qualify for tariff concessions. A report by the
Gatt secretariat on US trade policies will be published today.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has named an anti-corruption
campaigner as interior minister as part of a new cabinet of national unity
that includes two figures from the main opposition party.
The appointment of Mr Luis Pinerua Ordaz to one of the most powerful jobs
after the presidency is intended to satisfy popular demands for a serious
government attack on corruption and violent crime.
Although Mr Pinerua has long been prominent in the ruling Democratic Action
(AD) party, his appointment represents a blow to many other senior figures
in the party.
Most of AD's leadership see the new minister as a maverick figure who may
try to put some of their party brethren behind bars.
Mr Perez also named six other new cabinet ministers, but kept the
government's free-market reformers in place in other key ministries and in
the presidency of the central bank.
The president thus refused to cave in to demands that he roll back unpopular
economic reforms initiated three years ago.

<TEXT>
GERMANY is to open a new Federal exports office, increase customs and
inspection staff, and toughen legal penalties, in an attempt to block
exports of goods which could be used in making weapons, Christopher Parkes
reports from Bonn.
Products which could be used to make or transport weapons will need export
licences from the new office, to open on April 1, the cabinet agreed
yesterday. The list of controlled goods includes machine tools, components
which could be used in rockets or uranium enrichment and civilian plant
which might be 'misused' to make chemical weapons. Licences will not be
issued for such shipments to 'sensitive' countries.
The cabinet agreed Chancellor Helmut Kohl would urge adoption of a uniform
international arms control policy while chairman of the forthcoming western
economic summit in Munich. Breaches of the new German controls or UN
embargoes will be punished by up to 15 years' jail. German technicians
working overseas will be covered by the legislation, an economics ministry
paper presented to the cabinet said.
The paper said Germany must introduce new rules to stop it being used as a
staging post for suspect or illegal shipments from other countries. Other
measures include 100 extra staff at the the customs crime bureau, raising
the workforce there to 370, and a staff of over 400 for examining exports
and issuing licences. About 18m export shipments leave Germany a year.
Peru has introduced a system whereby all imports will be inspected by an
independent company before shipment. Four have been nominated: Cotecna Group
and SGS of Switzerland, Bureau Veritas of France, and SSI, part of the UK
Inchcape group.

PRESIDENT Bush yesterday named Mr Daniel Goldin, whom he described as a
leader in the US aerospace industry, as head of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (Nasa), Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Goldin is a senior vice-president in TRW, the US defence company, and has
been general manager of its space and technology division since 1987.
He will replace Nasa chief Admiral Richard Truly, a former astronaut forced
out of the agency in a power struggle with vice-president Dan Quayle's
National Space Council. Admiral Truly was in charge of rehabilitating Nasa
after the 1986 Challenger disaster and headed the space agency for two
years.
During Mr Goldin's tenure at TRW the company has built 13 spacecraft which
are still in orbit, including a tracking and data relay satellite.

THE US semiconductor industry will seek trade sanctions against Japan unless
evidence emerges of Japan opening its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) chip
market to foreign suppliers, writes Louise Kehoe in Washington.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said it wanted compliance with the
US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement signed last year.
The foreign share of the Japanese market has been virtually stagnant, at
about 14 per cent, for the past 21 months.
Concern is also growing in the US industry group about the potential for
Japanese 'dumping' of memory chips in the US and third-country markets.
Under the 1991 trade pact, the Japanese agreed to increase their
semiconductor imports towards a 20 per cent foreign-market share target by
the end of this year and act to prevent dumping.

MacSharry

<TEXT>
'SOME progress' has occurred in EC-US talks on farm subsidies, still the
chief sticking-point in Gatt's stalled Uruguay Round negotiations on world
trade liberalisation, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said
yesterday.
But he played down the significance of a letter President Bush sent to Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, last week. The letter suggested that
more of the direct-income support the EC plans to pay its farmers could be
shielded from the full brunt of farm subsidy cuts under Gatt.
Mr MacSharry, in Strasbourg to hear the European Parliament's opinion on
farm reform, refused to comment on details of EC-US talks or on Tuesday's
exchange on Gatt between Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr
Delors. 'We are continuing to discuss a package of issues. We have some
progress to report in some areas, but there are still major outstanding
difficulties.'
Brussels officials said the Commission would send Mr Bush an early reply,
perhaps today. They were taken aback on Tuesday, when, at a press conference
on Yugoslavia, Mr Baker mentioned almost ironically, the 'extraordinarily
generous' US offer in the Gatt negotiations. Some movement had occurred,
'but nothing in the context of the package (under discussion) to make one
say there's going to be an agreement tomorrow,' Mr MacSharry said. He was
still optimistic the Uruguay Round could be ended by mid-April.
Brussels officials declined to comment on yesterday's talks between aides to
Mr Delors and Mr Baker. The US has seemed to be moving nearer the EC
position in Gatt, mainly on EC plans to compensate farmers for price cuts.
But problems still exist over elements such as export subsidy cuts.

Lebanon's government limited rises in prices of bread and fuel yesterday to
try to calm public discontent, Reuter reports from Beirut.
A government decree reduced the rise in bread prices from 32.5 per cent to
16.5 per cent and petrol prices from 28 per cent to 17 per cent.
President Elias Hrawi's government made up the shortfall by raising tax on
imported alcohol by 400 per cent. Taxes on imported cigarettes were also
increased.
The decision was taken after a six-hour cabinet discussion on the economic
crisis caused by a sharp drop in the value of the Lebanese pound, down 25.8
per cent in three weeks, which has sent prices of commodities, many
imported, soaring by 30 to 50 per cent and provoked public discontent.

PALESTINIAN negotiators engaged in peace talks with Israel have shown
bravery and resilience, Mr Yassir Arafat said yesterday in a spirited
defence of continued Palestinian participation in the peace process.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, who appeared to be answering
strong internal criticism of his decision to sanction the process without
direct PLO participation, said: 'Negotiating is a way of fighting in a calm
voice. In it there is a time to attack and a time to retreat. An hour of
negotiating with the enemy may be tougher than years of war.'
Opposition within the PLO stems partly from a fear among senior cadres of
the organisation being marginalised. Concern is also being expressed over
the growing visibility of Palestinians from the occupied territories at the
possible expense of the Palestinian leadership in the diaspora.
Both the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine - the
two largest PLO factions apart from Mr Arafat's dominant Fatah group - have
stepped up criticism of the PLO's exclusion from direct participation.
Israel vetoed face-to-face negotiations with the PLO, and said it would only
deal with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) are in danger of
losing their absolute majority in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany's richest
federal state, and of allowing right-wing extremists to gain a foothold in
the state parliament.
The latest opinion poll, published less than four weeks before the state
election, shows support for the CDU, which has ruled Baden-Wurttemberg
unchallenged since 1972, slipping to 44 per cent. At the same time, the
extreme right Republican Party is backed by 4.9 per cent, only a fraction
short of the 5 per cent mark needed to gain seats in the regional
parliament.
Total support for the extreme right stands at 8 per cent, including the
National Democrats (NPD) and the German League, according to the poll
carried out by the respected Allensbach Institute for the Frankfurter
Allgemeine and SAT-1 TV. The figures suggest a drift by voters away from the
mainstream parties. Mr Kohl and his CDU colleagues have raised the issue of
controlling the influx of asylum-seekers as a campaign theme to prevent
erosion of their vote to the far right.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Arrest over 'terrorist ultimatum from east'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN police have arrested a man suspected of threatening a wave of
terrorist attacks unless the interior minister, Mr Rudolf Seiters, handed
over DM12m (Pounds 4.1m).
The government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, quoted the justice minister, Mr
Klaus Kinkel, as saying the extortion attempt may have been made by former
members of the East German secret police. He said the cabinet discussed the
issue when it met in Bonn yesterday.
The Federal Crime Office (BKA) said anti-terror units seized the suspect on
Tuesday after a pre-dawn motorway chase near the Polish border as police
couriers were being directed by car telephone to a money drop in Germany's
former communist east. The suspect was named as 'Dieter Z', a 36-year-old
east German who moved to Bremen in 1987.
Police said they were alerted after a letter was sent to Mr Seiters in
February signed by 'members of a special military unit of a state that no
longer exists'. The letter claimed the group was trained to assassinate
political and business leaders, attack public places, knock out
communications, and poison drinking water.

<TEXT>
THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday passed a law offering foreign investors
extensive tax breaks and the right to repatriate profits in hard currency.
'If you look carefully, this is a revolution,' said one of the bill's
architects, Mr Oleksy Duntau, chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee on
foreign economic relations. 'Our country is open to foreign investment.'
Foreign investments, defined as ventures with a foreign stake of at least 20
per cent or with a foreign capital contribution of at least Dollars 100,000,
are granted a five-year tax holiday and thereafter pay only 50 per cent of
local taxes.
The law should serve as a tool for cutting through red tape which western
businessmen say is the biggest obstacle to investment in Ukraine. The
Ministry of Finance is obliged to register foreign businesses within three
days of making an application and the law requires government to swiftly
recompense foreign investors for any losses due to governmental 'activity or
inactivity.'
Nationalisation of foreign enterprises is forbidden and existing foreign
ventures are protected for 10 years from any changes to the legislation.
Foreigners are permitted full ownership of enterprises except as yet
undefined strategic sectors. They may also use locally earned currency to
bid for property when it is privatised later this year.
Profits may be fully repatriated, but are subject to a 15 per cent tax.
Goods imported for the use of foreign enterprises or their personnel are
exempt from customs and tariffs and the products of foreign enterprises may
be exported without export licences or duties.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Shares drop after Budget fails to please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN London fell sharply yesterday on concern among investors that the
Conservative party faces a tough struggle in the general election campaign.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares, which has been trading in a narrow
range since the start of the year, lost 52.4, closing at 2,522.4.
The index has shown a larger drop on only two occasions since the stock
market crash in November 1987, in each case sparked by an international
crisis in the shape of the Gulf war and last summer's Soviet coup.
In contrast, sterling made a firm showing against the D-Mark and
strengthened against the dollar on foreign exchange markets.
Behind the stock market jitters was the reckoning by the Tories' natural
allies in the City that Mr Norman Lamont's Budget had failed to deliver a
vote-winning package for the party.
There was disappointment that Mr Lamont had been constrained by a weak
economy and rapidly rising public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) from
announcing the across-the-board cut in income tax that many had expected.
Many investors also took the view that reduced possibilities of a cut in
interest rates over the next month will hold back any economic upturn. The
lingering effects of the 18-month recession may, on this analysis, tilt the
balance of votes towards the Labour party.
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, a US investment
house, said: 'A lot of people are worried that Mr Lamont failed to deal an
ace. Instead we've got a high PSBR, and not much to show for it.'
Mr Richard Kersley, equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London
securities house, said: 'The Conservatives have a lot of work to do (in
making their case to the electorate).'
Share prices, which on Tuesday had stayed firm after an initially optimistic
reading of the Budget by the City, took their cue from a continuing slide in
prices of government gilt-edged securities, which dropped half a point.
Gilt prices fell on Tuesday, immediately after Mr Lamont announced a large
increase in the PSBR, a development which will require the government to
issue large volumes of bonds over the next two years and push up yields.
According to the Treasury, the PSBR will rise from Pounds 14bn in 1991-92 to
Pounds 28bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn the year after.
One source of comfort yesterday for the government was sterling's
performance. The pound gained a quarter of a pfennig in London at DM2.87 - a
level maintained in New York - quelling speculation that the fall in share
prices could prompt large numbers of international investors to switch funds
out of sterling.
Nonetheless, the recent weakness in the pound, which is trading well below
its central rate in the European exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95,
diminished expectations on the London money market about an early cut in
borrowing costs.
Reflecting this, the three-month interbank rate, which shadows base rates,
closed  1/8 percentage point firmer at about 10 5/8 per cent.
Mr Lamont yesterday did little to encourage hopes about a rate cut, saying
this would be a 'high risk thing to do', even though he failed to rule out
such a move during the election campaign.

settlement of disputes with five clients. Daiwa estimated that, as a result,
it would suffer a net loss of Y43bn in the year to March 31.
The revelations follow similar ones by other brokers. They could further
erode faith in the Japanese stock market, which was last year hit by
scandals involving brokers' links with gangsters and compensation paid to
favoured clients.
The Nikkei index yesterday fell by 262 points to 20,592, its lowest level
since October 1990.
Daiwa's loss is the largest so far to arise from a practice known as tobashi
in which brokers manipulated clients' accounts in order to help them dress
up their accounts. Other cases are expected to emerge as companies close
their books at the end of March.
In the past, brokers transferred losses from one client to another, with
little trouble. By using clients with different book-closing dates, brokers
could keep the network going for a long time in the hope that a stock price
recovery would eventually eliminate losses on the offending portfolio.
Although such window-dressing is discouraged by the finance ministry,
brokers acted under pressure from clients. In some cases, brokers had given
their clients illegal guarantees that their investments would not suffer
losses. So transfers were carried out to save the broker as well as the
client from disclosing losses.
However, the revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, which followed
last year's scandals, outlawed the practice of brokers' guaranteeing to buy
back stock at a preset price.
Without a guarantee, investors are refusing to accept loss-making portfolios
on to their books. So brokers cannot find new homes for tobashi portfolios.
But clients left holding stock they accepted under tobashi agreements are
demanding the brokers take the stock off their hands.
Most of Daiwa's loss is accounted for by a Y49.5bn loss arising from a
dispute with Tokyu Department Store, a leading retail group. Tokyu took
Daiwa to court claiming it had lost Y60.5bn. The court ruled that Y11bn of
the loss was Tokyu's responsibility.
Mr Peter Johnson, head of sales at Baring Securities, the UK-owned
stockbroker, said other brokers would be badly affected by news of Daiwa's
settlement with Tokyu Department Store since other clients would be
encouraged to sue.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Lautro board member quits over rules on disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING financial services executive resigned yesterday from the board of
Lautro, the life assurance and unit trust industry's self-regulatory body,
over a new disclosure regime which he described as 'inherently
anti-competitive'.
Mr Tim Miller is director of marketing at M&amp;G Group, Britain's biggest
specialist unit trust company, and head of Lautro's advertising and product
disclosure committee. He said the decision of regulators to allow life
companies to show average charges throughout the industry rather than
require them to show their own will not offer adequate protection.
Mr Miller's resignation followed yesterday's announcement by the Securities
and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, of the new regime, which
is designed to help consumers shop more wisely for life assurance.
The regime was prompted by urging from the Office of Fair Trading and the
Department of Trade and Industry which said in 1989 that the absence of cost
information in the sale of life products inhibited competition.
'What we are proposing will have a significant effect on competition,' said
Sir David Walker, SIB chairman. He said giving more cost information to
consumers would shift insurance business to low-cost providers and encourage
producers to design more short-term investment products which offer smaller
penalties for early cancellation.
Consumer groups generally hailed the new disclosure regime as vastly
improved on current rules which do not require sales agents to tell
consumers anything about charges until after they have agreed to buy the
product; even then, the information is not easy to understand. They
expressed disappointment that the SIB would not insist that companies
disclose their own charges in advertising material.
Defending the decision, Sir David said: 'We've reached the conclusion that
it's very hard to require them to use standard projections of investment
returns and not allow standard projections of expenses.'
He said consumers would be given a basis for comparison in other data which
will now be required to be shown along with the projections.
Under the proposed rules, customers must be told how much of their premiums
will be deducted as expenses if they cancel a policy within the first five
years. They must also be told how many years' premiums must be paid
regularly before the policyholder is entitled to a 100 per cent refund.
Companies will also have to tell prospective customers by how many pence
each pound of final maturity value will be reduced in order to cover costs.
David Owen writes: The effectiveness of Lautro and the regulator for
independent financial advisers, Fimbra, was questioned in the Commons last
night by Tory MP, Mr Michael Colvin. He highlighted the losses faced by some
investors in investment bond home income schemes and said self-regulation
was not working as intended.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Major calls April 9 poll with parties neck and neck: All
sides promise most elaborate, expensive and frenetic campaigns in British
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR set the stage yesterday for the most open political contest
for a generation after asking the Queen to dissolve parliament for an April
9 general election.
The prime minister's confident prediction of a Conservative victory was
followed by an equally upbeat forecast from Mr Neil Kinnock that Labour is
set to return to power after 13 years.
The two main parties were joined by the Liberal Democrats in promising the
most elaborate, expensive and frenetic campaign ever seen in British
politics.
Speaking on the steps of 10 Downing Street, Mr Major said that a
'spectacular' Budget earlier this week had put in place the final plank in
his election platform.
The choice at the general election would be between a Conservative party
committed to low taxation, individual choice and greater independence and an
opposition tied to higher taxes for rich and poor and more trades union
power. 'That is a very clear decision indeed for the public to make and I
shall be inviting them to make it on April 9', he said.
Mr Kinnock declared that his party would 'make history' by securing the
biggest swing against an incumbent government since Mr Clement Attlee's
defeat of Mr Winston Churchill in 1945. He needs an 8 per cent swing to
overturn the 102-seat majority which Mrs Margaret Thatcher won for the
Tories in June 1987.
The Labour leader declared that 13 years of Conservative government had left
Britain deep in recession and debt. 'We have the policies, we have the team
and we have our offer to the British people of government by partnership in
building together the best for the people, the families, the businesses and
industries of our nation,' he said.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy Ashdown set economic recovery and
constitutional reform at the heart of his programme. He warned of a 'crisis
of legitimacy' if the main parties tried to form a minority government in
the event of a hung parliament.
In private, senior figures on all sides agreed that this would be the first
time since 1974 that the outcome of the election would be decided during the
four campaign weeks.
Mr Major's announcement, taken after consultation with cabinet colleagues
and an audience with the Queen, marks him out as the first prime minister in
the post-war period who has voluntarily called an election while his party
is behind in the opinion polls.
The FT's weighted average of the latest six polls gives Labour a slight
lead, but points to a hung parliament, with the Conservatives holding
fractionally more seats than Labour.
Senior ministers drew comfort from a Gallup poll conducted for today's Daily
Telegraph which suggested more than two thirds of voters backed the tax cuts
in the Budget. It was less clear from the survey, however, that the package
would boost Conservative support on April 9.
The ministers said that the tax debate - alongside Mr Major's personal
popularity - would be at the centre of the government's election campaign.
But they would be accompanied by an 'imaginative' election manifesto
promising personal choice, ownership and opportunity.
Mr Major, who informed Mrs Thatcher in a personal letter of his decision,
was rewarded with the immediate public endorsement of his predecessor. She
said he was the 'right man' to continue her policies.
In Washington, Mr George Bush said Mr Major was 'a superb leader' but sought
to sidestep questions on whether it mattered to the US who was in power in
Britain. 'I expect the worst thing an American president could do would be
to try to intervene in an election in another country. Having said all that,
the respect I have for the prime minister knows no bounds,' he said.
Mr Kinnock will set out his prospectus in a speech to his party's Scottish
conference tomorrow. Yesterday he drew comfort from the City's lukewarm
response to the Budget, as Mr John Smith underlined Labour's opposition to
any tax reductions paid for by borrowing. He called instead for a 'Budget
for investment'.
That political fault line will be highlighted again when MPs vote on the
finance bill tomorrow. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is determined the
main measures, including the tax cuts, should become law.
Mr Smith, however, voiced confidence that he could counter the tax cuts with
a more attractive package when he presents his shadow Budget on Tuesday. He
said Labour would put the recession, training, health and education at the
centre of its campaign.
Mr Major chose April 9 as his favoured election date some weeks ago and
confirmed the decision in a weekend telephone conversation with Mr Chris
Patten, party chairman. But he decided to 'press the button' only at 8am
yesterday.
The government was last night negotiating with opposition parties on which
other outstanding legislation it might get through before dissolution on
Monday.

FT  12 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UTILITIES sectors of the markets were especially sensitive to worries
about the post-Budget political outlook. Dealers said they had had to
accommodate increasingly large selling orders in both the water and
electricity areas.
In the former sector the Footsie constituents were heavily sold, with
Anglian sliding 12 to 355p on 2m traded, North West Water 16 to 364p on
1.3m, Severn Trent 16 to 340p on 3.2m and Thames 13 to 361p on 1.1m.
Specialists pointed out, however, that there had been an element of
correction in the water sector, having outperformed the equity market in
recent months.
Mr Angelos Anastasiou, at Panmure Gordon, said water shares were delicately
poised ahead of the general election: 'Although I think the Tories will win
I still think, whatever the outcome of the election, there is more upside
than downside in the sector.'
The regional electricity issues closed marginally above the day's lows,
leaving the Electricity Package 97 down at Pounds 2723.
Oils upset
Enterprise Oil and Lasmo, the UK's two leading exploration and production (E
&amp; P) stocks, led the oil sector lower as the market was affected by a bout
of nerves ahead of Enterprise's preliminary figures, due this morning.
Enterprise dropped 20 to 369p, some 5.7 per cent, while Lasmo retreated 12
to 196p, or around 6 per cent, with much of the activity concentrated in the
latter, where turnover expanded to a hefty 5.3m shares. Volume in Enterprise
was just short of 1m shares.
The nervousness surrounding Enterprise was said to have been focused on the
dividend, where there were rumours that one influential broker had cut his
forecast. The dividend stories were unfounded, but there remained
considerable unease about the size of the expected fall in Enterprise's net
income over the past year.
Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said he expected the E &amp; P stocks to
trigger another downward lurch by the oil sector. 'The E &amp; P's are the most
exposed to weak oil prices,' he added, 'and a slide by the E &amp; P's will be
followed by BP and lastly by Shell.
BP, where there was evidence that the recent US support has dried up,
receded 5 1/2 to 263p on turnover of 12m. Shell lost 7 to 442p.
Forte active
Following its recent strong showing, further support for Forte pushed the
shares forward 3, before slipping to end a halfpenny down on the day at
231p. Turnover was a busy 2.6m shares.
The hotel group will today announce that a majority of holders of the
group's warrants - which were attached to an Pounds 83m maturing Eurobond -
had exercised them into 30.4m ordinary shares, providing Pounds 70m for the
company out of a potential Pounds 93m.
A spokesman for Forte said the company was 'very pleased' with the result.
For technical reasons, the deadline for exercising warrants may be extended
until tomorrow, and the spokesman said the figure could rise further.
Laporte lower
Chemicals group Laporte came under pressure as two brokers moved to a sell
stance on differing worries over share dilution and company performance.
Hoare Govett changed its position due to the technical nature of Laporte's
disposal of the 25 per cent stake held by Solvay, the Belgian chemicals
group. Around 9 per cent is due for an imminent share placing, while the
remainder is to be cancelled, and the broker believes this will lead to some
institutional shareholders becoming overweight on the stock. The shares fell
14 to 599p.
Credit Laing Lyonnais also moved to a sell, arguing that Laporte's stated
objective of a 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profits would not be realised,
mainly because of tight margins and its need to make acquisitions.
Kingfisher weak
Among stores, Kingfisher looked particularly weak, falling 28 to 503p after
County NatWest recommended selling the shares. County produced a strategic
reassessment, suggesting that it is very difficult to believe the company
will deliver above-average growth unless it makes a major acquisition.
Fears of a price war in the do-it-yourself market was seen as particularly
damaging for Kingfisher, which makes above-average profits from this sector.
Brewery issues, like stores, held a premium rating ahead of the Budget and
were liable to profit-taking as nervousness increased after the naming of
the general election day. Shares in the major brewers slipped, with
Allied-Lyons retreating 19 to 630p, Bass 21 to 552p, Grand Metropolitan 26
to 907p and Whitbread 'A' 13 to 431p.
A pegging of the Uniform Business Rate and a cut in the lowest rate at which
income tax is levied was seen as helpful for stores, but the sector already
had a premium rating and lost ground in general disappointment with the
Budget.
Analysts had doubts whether the chancellor had done enough 'to help the
Tories get back in' and therefore saw stores as particularly vulnerable to
profit-taking. Boots gave up 12 to 450p, Marks and Spencer 6 to 317p and WH
Smith 10 to 470p.
The Budget had few implications for the tobacco sector in spite of a rise of
13p in the price of 20 cigarettes. UK volume of Rothmans International
accounts for only 8 per cent of total group sales, but the shares fell 18 to
1050p.
Standard Chartered's excellent profits performance failed to prevent a slide
in the shares of 7 to 456p. Other banks were given a rougher ride by the
market, with Barclays finally 13 off at 350p.
Bespak, which makes valves for inhalers, jumped 14 to 525p as stock came
into the market following a recent rights issue.
Good two-way business in Fisons saw the shares off 4 at 367p in busy
turnover of 5.4m.
US sellers were prominent in a fall for Glaxo, adding to the market's
negative sentiment. The shares lost 20 to 777p.
Food group Hillsdown surprised the market with a rise of 10 per cent in its
full-year dividend to 8.8p, in spite of a decline in last year's profits to
Pounds 186.8m from Pounds 191.2m. The profit figures were slightly above
average market estimates of around Pounds 184m, and the shares put on 3 to
172p as the dividend announcement showed continued confidence in the
company's prospects.
Other food manufacturers followed the general downward trend, with Cadbury
Schweppes falling 7 to 457p and Unilever losing 11 to 939p.
BTR followed the market south, ending 13 down at 386p in spite of reporting
favourable figures slightly better than market expectations. Mr Jack Jones
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was particularly encouraged by the 'positive
statement' accompanying the results and predicted 1992 profits of Pounds
1.065bn. Turnover was 4.8m.
P &amp; O surrendered gains made earlier this week and fell 10 to 402p after the
Department of Trade and Industry vetoed a request from the company and
Sealink Stena to set up a joint cross-Channel service. The DTI said the link
would damage competition ahead of the Channel tunnel's opening.
Shares in Eurotunnel responded by firming a penny to 451p, making it one of
a handful of FT-SE 100 stocks to buck the market trend. Turnover was,
however, poor.
NFC was another transport stock favoured by investors. Some 2.6m shares were
traded as the stock gained 1 to 253p.
Simon Engineering experienced a volatile session. The shares initially rose
modestly as the market appreciated the company's maintained dividend in
spite of a 50 per cent profits setback to Pounds 18.3m. But fears for the
1992 dividend following a gloomy analysts' meeting surfaced and sent the
shares tumbling to end 34 down at 246p.
However, Mr Sandy Morris at County NatWest, who is forecasting 1992 profits
of Pounds 24m, believes a modest recovery should help the company maintain
the dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graeme Elliot, executive vice chairman of Slough Estates, is the latest
high-profile casualty of the property slump.
Slough, a company specialising in industrial property, has made him
redundant on the grounds that 'with the changing market place, the role of
executive vice chairman did not offer a sufficient challenge for someone
with Graeme's qualities'.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman and chief executive, stressed that Elliot was not
a 'scapegoat' and the timing of his departure was unconnected to the group's
results in two weeks' time. Elliot, 49, and a chartered accountant, joined
Slough in 1985 from RTZ.
Sir Nigel says his own role is likely to increase after Elliot's departure.
Paul Orchard-Lisle, a senior partner of surveyors Healey &amp; Baker, who has
been on the board since 1980, has been appointed non-executive deputy
chairman.
Derek Wilson, finance director, and Roger Carey, the director responsible
for UK development, have been appointed group managing directors.
*****
Aad van Adrichem, group operations director of Marling Industries, the
industrial textile and vehicle-body manufacturer which on Monday put out a
profits warning that wiped nearly a third off the value of the shares, 'has
agreed' to leave the board to pursue other interests.
David Abel Smith, chief executive since the beginning of the year, claims
the departure of van Adrichem and the warning of a loss for the financial
year ending March 31 were wholly unconnected.
Hinting that some rather grand titles had been doled out around the company
before his time, Abel Smith says that in practice Dutch-born van Adrichem,
48, who joined a Dutch arm of the company in 1985 and has since also run the
Canadian operation for a while, had been the director of a single subsidiary
 -producing air bags. Marling said on Monday it could not tell when the air
bags venture would contribute to group profits.
Abel Smith says the company will not be looking for another group operations
director. 'That's me.'
'We're good friends. It was all very amicable,' he adds.
*****
Scholes, the Cheshire-based electricals company which just last Friday
announced its chief executive designate had left six weeks after his
arrival, said yesterday that chairman and chief executive Reg Harrington has
been taken seriously ill and will not return.
The plan had been that the ebullient and extrovert Harrington, who turns 55
today, would split his role during the year, allowing the newly recruited
Barrie Lawson to take over as chief executive. Harrington has been struck
down in the past few days with the recurrence of an earlier illness. Exactly
a year ago group managing director Chris Fitzpatrick took early retirement
because of ill health.
Finance director Bill Riches, 55, who assumes Harrington's executive
responsibilities for the time being, says Scholes is now looking to recruit
someone to assume the role of chief executive as soon as possible - 'someone
with whom the chemistry works, who is adaptable and whose style of
management fits in with the company's philosophy.' Non-executive director
Richard Morgan has been appointed non-executive chairman.
*****
Morgan Stanley, which has been one of the most successful of the US
investment banks at establishing a European presence in recent years, has
appointed two executives jointly to run its European business. The division
of the top job reflects the growing scale and complexity of the business in
Europe, the bank says.
Stephen Waters, joint head of the bank's worldwide mergers and acquisitions
business, moves from New York to head Morgan Stanley's European investment
banking business. He becomes co-head of the 1,500-strong European business
along with Steven Ward, the head of fixed income operations in London.
Former head in London, Timothy Hulquist, returns to New York, where he will
be in charge of foreign exchange, commodities and the bank's trust company.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Business Law: Risk for professional advisers in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEO HERZEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court has just agreed to decide an important case involving
the egregious Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO)*.
In 1984 the Farmers' Co-operative of Arkansas and Oklahoma Inc filed for
bankruptcy. As a result, the holders of certain unpaid demand notes issued
by the co-operative instituted a class action under rule 10b-5 of the
federal securities laws, RICO and state law against several defendants
including the independent auditor for the co-operative, Ernst &amp; Young.
The main allegation against Ernst &amp; Young was that it had intentionally
departed from generally accepted accounting principles in an effort to
overstate the co-operative's worth.
The same case had been decided once before by the US Supreme Court but on a
different legal issue. In its first decision the Court had decided that the
notes were securities under the federal securities law. As a consequence,
the plaintiffs became entitled to a judgment of Dollars 6.1m.
This time around the legal issue is whether Ernst &amp; Young violated RICO. If
so, the plaintiffs would have a right to treble damages. In its past
encounters with RICO, the US Supreme Court has not provided much help in
placing reasonable limits on the statute. Essentially, the Court's attitude
has been, Congress did it to us and it is Congress's responsibility to
extricate us.
The relevant section of RICO, section 1962(c), provides: 'It shall be
unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . .
.'
The precise issue the US Supreme Court is being asked to decide is whether
section 1962(c) requires proof that Ernst &amp; Young participated in the
management or operation of the alleged racketeering enterprise.
The lower court had concluded that Ernst &amp; Young's involvement with the
co-operative (which had been limited to audits, meetings with the board of
directors and presentations at annual meetings of the co-operative's
members) did not rise to the level of participation in the management or
operation of the enterprise required by section 1962(c).
Except for the warning against violating federal securities laws in the US,
a foreign reader reasonably might ask why he or she should be especially
interested in this peculiar US legal misadventure. But there are several
important, general lessons for non-American readers in RICO. In particular,
those readers who are in European Community countries should be interested,
since the EC is now embarked on the creation of a vast new system of
statutes and regulations:
Lesson 1: it is very difficult to predict how a new statute will be
interpreted in litigation under circumstances that are still unknown. RICO
had its origins in a congressional investigation of the activities in
business of ordinary hoodlums.
Lesson 2: bad statutes are difficult to change. No matter how bad, or even
absurd, a statute is, it quickly develops an avid constituency who resists
change. RICO, for example, has become an industry for plaintiff's lawyers in
civil cases and aggressive prosecutors in criminal cases. The RICO lobby in
the US remains adamant that the statute is essential to protect us from
white-collar crooks. Unfortunately, the US, Japan and Europe provide a
continuous stream of financial scandals which can be used by the RICO lobby
to support this argument.
There is another, even more remarkable, recent example of the high risks
involved in giving professional advice on financial, corporate and
securities matters in the US. This one was an administrative proceeding,
dated March 2 1992, brought by the Office of Thrift Supervision against a
large, ordinary, respectable New York law firm, Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays
&amp; Handler and three of its partners.
The legal basis for the proceeding was not RICO but several new federal laws
passed in the wake of the savings and loan scandals in the 1980s. However,
these new laws adopt one of RICO's most remarkable innovations in aid of
intimidation by US government agencies: judgment and punishment first, trial
later.
As is now usual in US government blockbuster cases that allege white-collar
wrongdoing, the administrative notice of charges in this proceeding was
complicated, contained many allegations and was very long (83 pages).
The main charges were that the law firm, and the only three partners
specifically named as defendants, co-operated with Charles H Keating Jr in
violating banking and securities laws and in deceiving regulators in
connection with their investigations of the firm's client, Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association.
There were also charges that the law firm participated in breaches of
fiduciary duty with Mr Keating against Lincoln Savings and Loan Association
which Mr Keating controlled. The damages claimed were 'at least Dollars
275m'.
The most extraordinary feature of the proceeding was the temporary order to
cease and desist issued simultaneously with the notice of charges by the
Office of Thrift Supervision.
The order effectively placed Kaye, Scholer and its partners in a kind of
receivership with the Office of Thrift Supervision as receiver. The firm was
required to create an escrow account for its partners' earnings. Depending
on the identity of the partner, the firm had to contribute between 50 per
cent and 25 per cent of the earnings of each partner into the escrow
account. The firm was not permitted to enter into unusual transactions or to
dissolve or modify the partnership.
Even more startling, a partner was not allowed to leave the partnership
unless a large amount of security was provided by the firm or the partner.
In addition, the use by partners of their individual assets and earnings for
living expenses was restricted and subject to close surveillance by the
Office of Thrift Supervision. The only partners exempted from the order were
those who became partners on or after December 1 1987.
As a practical matter, it was difficult to see how the firm could continue
to operate successfully while the case was being adjudicated by the Office
of Thrift Supervision unless a court modified or set aside the order.
Not surprisingly, Kaye, Scholer reached the same conclusion. Over the
weekend it entered into a hurried settlement with the Office of Thrift
Supervision. It agreed to pay the government Dollars 41m. Two of the
partners named in the proceeding agreed to be barred from representing any
savings association or bank whose deposits were insured by the Federal
government. The third partner only had to agree not to commit in the future
the kind of violations alleged in the proceeding.
Several years ago, faced with the prospect of similar pre-trial restrictions
in a RICO case brought by the US government, Drexel Burnham capitulated,
paid a huge fine and went into bankruptcy.
In addition, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency charged
with bailing out the savings and loan industry has just filed a Dollars 150m
suit against Deloitte and Touche and a Dollars 100m suit against KPMG Peat
Marwick in connection with two different failed savings and loan
associations.
A flood of such suits against accountants, lawyers and other professional
firms who advised failed savings and loans is expected in the near future.
These cases are part of a disappointing regulatory pattern: too late and
heedlessly tough when something is finally done. The problem is not unique
to the US. One can see something similar in the UK, for example, in the
treatment of BCCI and in the Guinness and Blue Arrow prosecutions.
On the other hand, although Japanese financial regulation does not appear to
be much more efficient than anyone else's in terms of avoiding financial
scandals, the Japanese do seem to be much more cautious about limiting the
wreckage after the event.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Appointments: Building Hepworth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Carter has been appointed chief executive of Hepworth, the building
products group. He replaces Sinclair Thomson, 49, who has been forced to
resign through illness.
Thomson joined Hepworth as chief executive in 1986, the year Roland Smith
became chairman. He presided over the group's expansion into a European
building products business, with nearly half its profits coming from
overseas; before it had been heavily dependent on clay pipes and the UK
economy. He was regarded as one of the best chief executives in the sector.
Before following Thomson to Hepworth, Carter, 46, was a colleague of his at
TI Group, where his posts included marketing manager of the Glow-worm
subsidiary, now part of Hepworth, and managing director of New World gas
cookers.
Carter brought the plastics and clay pipe business together to form
Hepworth's largest division. Building products accounted for a quarter of
group turnover of Pounds 686m in 1990 and about a third of Pounds 102m
operating profit. He has been a board member since 1988.

David Shelton, formerly finance director of ARC south western region, has
been appointed financial director of Hepworth Refractories.

FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris runs into profit-taking
as Continent falls mildly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECLINES described as profit-taking in Paris, and consolidation in Frankfurt
left bourses looking mildly, but not seriously depressed yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS dealers said that there was no evidence of heavy selling pressure. The
CAC 40 index closed at 1968.02, down 25.86 or 1.3 per cent, in turnover of
FFr2.3bn.
Euro Disney slipped 70 centimes to FFr163.60 and LVMH fell FFr142 or 2.9 per
cent to FFr4,670 as investors locked in recent gains.
Two-way business was reported in Chargeurs and Perrier. Chargeurs rose FFr12
to FFr1,230 ahead of its 1991 results which were released after the close; a
provision brought net profits well below analysts' forecasts.
Perrier, the market's potboiler, rose FFr25 or 1.6 per cent to FFr1,630
after Nestle said it would decide within a week whether to raise its bid for
the mineral water company. News that Arab Banking Corp now had a 3.5 per
cent stake in Perrier added to the takeover speculation.
Saint-Gobain fell FFr8 to FFr525. Nikko's Mr Michael Woodcock said that the
company told him during a visit this week that it had no evidence of a
pick-up in the US economy and that it was too early to buy its shares on
recovery hopes.
FRANKFURT warmed, relatively speaking, to the maintained dividend and
miniscule drop in profits at Bayer, after dividend cuts and fourth quarter
setbacks for BASF and Hoechst. Bayer shares, down DM3.70 to DM291.50 ahead
of the news, closed only DM1.20 lower at DM294.
Other blue chips, too, were mainly a shade lower as German equity markets
eased in thin to moderate trading. The DAX index lost 7.12 to 1,743.42 after
a 3.29 fall to 708.23 in the FAZ at midsession. However, Deutsche Babcock,
the engineer, ended DM6.90 higher at DM181.90 as its results swung back into
the black. Turnover fell from DM5.9bn to DM5.3bn.
MILAN rose in technical trading as dealers covered short positions in core
stocks ahead of the expiry of monthly options contracts today and the close
of the March trading account on Monday. The Comit index rose 1.97 to 514.70
in turnover estimated at L90bn after L70bn.
Among industrials, Fiat rose L70 to L4,895 and the tyre and cable maker
Pirelli was up L29 to L1,149. Generali led insurers higher with a L345
rebound to L30,000 on its 1991 results. Fondiaria rose L120 to L33,510.
A 20 per cent rise in 1991 net profit and a rise in the dividend also gave a
boost to Ambroveneto which rose L130 or 3.4 per cent to L3,960.
Telecoms bucked the trend on foreign selling, with Sip losing L16 to L1,347
and Stet down L26 to L2,255.
Bonifiche Siele continued to lose ground, falling L1,900 to L27,100. But BNA
ordinary shares lost only L1 to L5,169.
ZURICH's SPI index fell 7.7 to 1,127.8 as high money market rates drove
potential buyers out of the market and triggered profit-taking by others.
However, a buy recommendation helped bearers in the armaments and
engineering group, Oerlikon-Buhrle, which rose SFr22 to SFr402 in unusually
active trading which pushed them to number two on the active stocks list.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by London and a weaker opening on Wall Street. The
CBS Tendency Index eased 0.9 to 126.9 in turnover of Fl 571.4m.
The brewer Grolsch rose Fl 3 to an all-time high of Fl 207.00 after news of
a 10.6 per cent rise in 1991 net profit. But the electronics group Getronics
lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 33.60 after the company issued a cautious statement on
the outlook for this year.
Scandinavia was mixed. STOCKHOLM ended a ten-day uptrend as the
Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.5 to 986.0. Stora B fell SKr6 to SKr268
in a weak forestry sector, as the company's net profits fell 61 per cent and
the chairman and his deputy resigned.
In COPENHAGEN, writes Hilary Barnes, the pharmaceutical group Novo Nordisk
fell DKr4 to DKr530 in spite of a 22 per cent advance in profits while
Carlsberg, the brewer, saw its B shares down DKr7 to DKr322 following the UK
monopolies referral of the Carlsberg-Allied Lyons tie-up in Britain. The CSE
index was off 0.55 at 344.76 in moderate turnover of DKr291m.
However, HELSINKI extended its recovery to a second day as the Hex index
rose 11.4 to 878.3. OSLO closed slightly higher on Wednesday, helped by a
better-than-expected 1991 result from the insurer UNI Storebrand. The
all-share index rose 2.86 to 423.42 in moderate turnover of NKr212.64m,
while UNI Storebrand saw its ordinary shares add NKr2.50 to NKr49.50.
ISTANBUL rose 2.5 per cent on late buying, the market index closing 93.29
higher at 3,813.45.

FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo weak again but
Hong Kong hits record high
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAKER yen and concern about another loss compensation scandal depressed
share prices yesterday, and the Nikkei average fell to its lowest level
since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono.
The Nikkei declined 262.45 to 20,592.14, compared with 20,221.86 on October
1, 1990. The index opened at the day's high of 20,811.30 and hit a low of
20,567.59 in the morning session. Volume rose to 250m shares from 200m on
cross-trading ahead of the March fiscal year-end. Declines led advances by
745 to 222, with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index lost 16.31 at
1,478.48, the lowest close since November 1986, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index slipped 5.04 to 1,116.16.
Traders said the Nikkei did not reflect the whole market accurately. 'The
Nikkei is only above the 20,000 level due to the illiquid stocks held in
arbitrageurs' baskets,' commented Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities.
The 20,000 level on the Nikkei is considered to be a critical point for
banks to maintain capital to asset ratios laid down by the Bank of
International Settlements. However, market participants now say that this
level is irrelevant since portfolios at most banks are broadly based and
stock holdings resemble that of components of the more representative Topix
index.
While foreigners remained neutral yesterday, domestic investors, including
investment trusts and corporations, continued to liquidate holdings ahead of
the March book closing. A total of 245 issues hit new lows since January
last year. Domestic institutions, which need to raise funds, have continued
to sell liquid stocks. Hitachi shed Y4 to Y756 and Nippon Steel Y5 to Y305.
According to think tanks at the top 12 Japanese brokers, pre-tax profits for
Japanese companies excluding financial institutions are expected to decline
sharply. For the year to end-March, pre-tax profits are expected to fall
15.5 per cent, while a 4.3 per cent drop is projected for next year.
Brokerage issues fell yesterday as a court ordered Daiwa Securities to pay
Y49bn in a settlement over a portfolio loss dispute with Tokyu Department
Store. After the close, Daiwa announced the resignation of Mr Masahiro
Dozen, the company's president. Traders said the settlement could lead to
further revelations of irregular trading practices by Japanese brokers.
Daiwa dropped Y65 to Y775 and Nomura Securities Y90 to Y1,160.
Bio-technology issues were mixed, with short-term traders active. Okamoto,
the leading prophylactic maker and the most active issue of the day,
retreated Y30 to Y1,300, and Mochida Pharmaceutical weakened Y170 to Y4,260.
However, Morinaga Milk advanced Y26 to Y736 on reports that the company is
planning clinical tests for a new drug.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 194 points to 22,054.60 in volume of 166m
shares.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim ignored Tokyo's weakness, as the Hong Kong market achieved
yet another all-time high.
HONG KONG surged in heavy trading to a new record, easily rising above the
5,000 level on stronger than expected earnings by HSBC Holdings. The Hang
Seng index climbed 87.01 or 1.8 per cent to 5,005.96, its seventh record
high in the last two weeks. Turnover nearly doubled to HKDollars 3.21bn from
HKDollars 1.69bn.
Banks showed the day's best gains, paced by HSBC Holdings, which moved ahead
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 44.00, with HKDollars 445m worth of shares
changing hands. Late on Tuesday HSBC announced that 1991 profits were up 83
per cent, better than most forecasts.
SEOUL was depressed by a decline in large manufacturing and financial
shares. The composite index finished 8.97 down at 619.05. Volume contracted
to Won218bn from Won264.8bn. The market was closed on Tuesday.
News that cash deposits with securities houses had fallen to Won1.5 trillion
(million million) on Monday weighed on the market. Subsidiaries of the giant
Hyundai Group, however, advanced on bargain hunting.
NEW ZEALAND was helped by a firmer New York market. The NZSE-40 index closed
at 1,466.66, up 5.42, as turnover fell to NZDollars 13.8m (NZDollars 20.3m).
AUSTRALIA was also lifted by Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index improved
3.8 to 1,609.1 in turnover of ADollars 173m, up from ADollars 150m.
News Corp added 54 cents at ADollars 18.24 as analysts reassessed the stock
following news that its BSkyB unit was breaking even. BTR Nylex receded 4
cents to ADollars 2.35 after reporting a 41 per cent fall in annual
operating profit.
MANILA gained ground on a partial recovery in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone overnight on the American Stock Exchange. The composite index put
on 3.32 to 1,120.03 as turnover expanded to 34m pesos from 18m pesos.
SINGAPORE rose sharply but in thin volume. The Straits Times Industrial
index ended 15.00 higher at 1,447.67 in turnover of SDollars 81.3m, after
SDollars 68.1m.
Keppel Corp finished 25 cents ahead at SDollars 7.70 on volume of 332,000
shares amid talk of a rights issue.
KUALA LUMPUR ended modestly higher in light trading. The composite index
gained 1.41 at 588.36 in turnover of MDollars 78.9m (MDollars 91.5m).
TAIWAN advanced but trading remained light due to continued political
uncertainty. The weighted index climbed 39.28 to 4,965.48 as turnover rose
moderately to TDollars 19.44bn.
BOMBAY fell sharply for the second day as state-owned investment
institutions continued to sell shares. The BSE index closed at 3,163.68,
down 152.35 or 4.6 per cent.

FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Roadshow for equities in Cyprus -
Stockbrokers have been touring the countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cypriot stockbrokers, together with chamber of commerce officials who
supervise the island's small over-the-counter market, have been touring the
countryside with what they call 'an educational roadshow', ahead of the
launch of an official trading floor in Nicosia.
These experimental trading sessions, interspersed with questions and
answers, 'generated a lot of public interest and a high volume of actual
trading', says Mr Nontas Metaxas, the chamber's co-ordinator of activity on
the bourse.
The chamber's ground floor offices are being converted into a trading floor
due to open next month. About 40 issues will be traded by open outcry for
the foreseeable future; plans for electronic trading are still at the
discussion stage.
The 18 Cypriot brokers currently hold brief public trading sessions in the
chamber's conference room three times a week, trading by telephone the rest
of the time. Volume has steadily increased at the public meetings, averaging
around CPounds 100,000 (Dollars 217,000) at each session this year. Last
year, share volume recorded at public meetings reached CPounds 7m out of
total trading estimated at around CPounds 30m. This compares favourably with
a total of about CPounds 25m in 1990, of which only CPounds 2m came from
chamber sessions.
In spite of an encouraging economic climate, the Cisco all-share index,
issued weekly, has climbed by only 1.6 per cent this year. After starting
the year at 278.7, it closed at 283.6 last Friday, March 6, by which time
the European index in FT-Actuaries World Index series was showing a 6.75 per
cent gain.
The island's political problem - the 17 years of de facto partition into
separate Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors - does not often affect the
bourse. But the collapse earlier this month of a US-backed initiative to
reunite the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities is being blamed for the
market's hesitant mood.
Economic growth this year is forecast at 7 per cent, led by an unprecedented
rise in tourist bookings which should guarantee full occupancy this summer
for almost all hotels. Mr Theodore Charalambides of Popular Investment, the
investment affiliate of Popular Bank, says: 'It is going to be a record year
for tourism. This should be reflected fairly quickly in prices of hotel and
tourism investment shares.' This sector accounts for some 17 per cent of
market capitalisation.
The Cyprus market had a mixed year in 1991, with dips caused first by the
Gulf war's effects on the tourist industry, then by profit-taking after a
short post-war rally. Most available liquidity was soaked up over the summer
by several flotations in quick succession, along with a CPounds 16m
debenture issue from the Bank of Cyprus at 8 per cent, convertible into
shares after six years. However, after a late autumn recovery, the index
marked an 11 per cent overall increase for 1991, just short of the European
gain of 12.54 per cent.
Market capitalisation expanded from CPounds 472.9m in 1990 to CPounds
566.3m, with bank, insurance and investment companies accounting for 57 per
cent of the total. Bank of Cyprus and Popular Bank, the island's two largest
commercial banks, account for 47 per cent of capitalisation between them.
Each now has more than 10m warrants in the market, exercisable until
November 1993, which are traded enthusiastically by small investors hoping
for high returns.
Although foreign interest is still very limited, there are signs that it may
increase, now that the central bank is proving more willing to lift the
strict exchange control regulations on a case-by-case basis in response to
applications from investors abroad. Such decisions may now be issued within
24 hours, making the bourse more accessible to managers of emerging market
funds.
Last year, foreign institutional investors acquired a 20 per cent stake in a
CPounds 4m closed-end mutual fund launched by the Cyprus Investment and
Securities Corporation (Cisco), the investment banking arm of Bank of
Cyprus.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Post-Budget blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL lingering hopes of a near-term base rate cut were abandoned by the UK
money market yesterday, and rates swung firmly behind a continuation of the
10 1/2 per cent rate.
The market was uninspired by Tuesday's Budget and was worried it would not
boost the Conservative party's standing in the opinion polls, making an
independent rate cut look highly unlikely.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has been careful not to rule out the
possibility of breaking with convention and making a cut during the election
campaign. Rumours that the Bank of Spain may be about to make its second
rate cut in three weeks also brought hopes that the UK authorities would not
miss their chance to follow suit this time. But few dealers hold out much
hope.
'There is uncertainty about how the opinion polls will go, how the election
will go, and how the government would finance its borrowing,' said one.
'It's a rather sad and sorry situation.'
'Chances of a rate cut have gone - that is what the market is indicating.'
Interbank rates from one week through to five months moved up to 10 5/8 -10
1/2 per cent, representing an  1/8 per cent increase for the key three-month
rate. The one-year rate firmed  1/4 per cent to 10 9/16 -10 7/16 , making
the yield curve virtually flat.
March short sterling fell to 89.44 from 89.52, while the June contract
plunged to 89.60 from 89.71.
The firmer trend in the period rates was underpinned by expensive day-to-day
funding, with the overnight rate going above 11 per cent in the afternoon.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of around Pounds 800m. It
purchased only Pounds 5m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent in the
early round, and Pounds 24m of similar bills at midday, after the shortage
was revised upwards to Pounds 900m. In the afternoon, it purchased a further
Pounds 240m of band 1 bank and treasury bills and Pounds 76m of band 2, with
late assistance of Pounds 300m taking the daily total to Pounds 737m.
German call money rates were unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent despite the
anticipated injection of DM3.1bn into the money market in this week's
securities repurchase tender. They should remain firm, as March tax payments
drain funds from the system.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile gives freer hand to
copper corporation

THE CHILEAN parliament has approved a long-awaited law that will allow
Codelco, the state-owned copper corporation, to form joint-ventures with
local or foreign mining partners or sell off surplus mining property.
The law won a clear majority at a joint session of the senate and chamber of
deputies late on Tuesday night. The session was disrupted by a group of
copper miners who threw 'Judas' coins at the law-makers and taunted them
with giving away Chile's national wealth. The powerful Copper Workers Union
has threatened to go on strike over the controversial law, but union leaders
are unlikely to find support among the rank and file.
Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, sees the law as a key plank in
its long-term development strategy. 'It will put us on the same footing as
mining multinationals by allowing us to seek partners when we do not have
resources to develop mines on our own,' says Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's
planning director.
The corporation owns one-third of the registered mining property in Chile,
but Treasury restrictions on the state company's investment budget have
limited exploration and development work.
The law states that Codelco will continue to run its four divisions:
Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Salvador and Andina, which together produced
1.12m tonnes of copper last year. In addition, Codelco will probably develop
adjacent ore bodies on its own. But there are other prime deposits which
have been targetted for joint ventures. Top of Codelco's list is the El Abra
copper deposit, 50 km north-east of Chuquicamata in the Atacama desert. El
Abra has 500m tonnes of proven reserves with an ore grade of 1 per cent.
Codelco estimates about Dollars 250m would be needed to develop the open-pit
mine, which could produce 150,000 tonnes of copper a year.
Mr Bande says Codelco has held 'informal contacts' with several potential
partners who are interested in the project. Under the new law, Codelco will
not be required to hold a majority stake in future joint-ventures. If it
decides to sell surplus mining property, it will have to do so via Enami,
the state-owned metals refinery.
Endesa, Chile's biggest electricity company, is studying plans to build a
Dollars 1.5bn aluminium smelter in the far south of Chile together with
Comalco Aluminium of Australia and Marubeni, the Japanese trading house.
Endesa said this week that the three companies had ordered a pre-feasibility
study that will be ready by November. The announcement comes four months
after Noranda Aluminium, a subsidiary of the Canadian mining and forestry
group, revealed its own plans for an aluminium smelter in southern Chile.
Noranda has completed its feasibility studies and is searching for financial
backers for the project.
Chile has no bauxite, the ore from which aluminium is made, but the fjords
and rivers of southern Chile have a vast potential for providing cheap
electricity - the biggest single cost in producing aluminium - through
hydro-electric generation.
Endesa owns crucial water rights in the region. Its plans include a 380 Mw
hydroelectric plant and an aluminium smelter which would produce 220,000
tonnes a year. The bauxite would come from Australia.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indians in a tangle over coir
yarn policy - Importers are upset over the minimum export price scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS signs are emerging of a revival in the world demand for Indian coir
yarn and products, major European importers have been upset by the operation
of the minimum export price scheme. Coir, the coarse fibre obtained from the
outer husk of the coconut, is used chiefly for carpeting material and twine.
In recent weeks the European Coir Manufacturers Association, the British
India Coir Mats Association and the German Coir Association have called on
India to dispense with the minimum price, which they say is 'now honoured
more in its breach.'
The German association has told the chairman of Indian Coir Board that
'unscrupulous exporters' are offering discounts ranging from 12 per cent to
20 per cent against the MEP, taking advantage of an improvement in margins
following the devaluation of the Indian currency. When the MEP was fixed in
US dollar terms last year, the exchange rate was arbitrarily taken as
Rs17.72 to the dollar. But the rupee value of exports has since gone up by
45 per cent.
According to Mr EB Unni, chief executive of Aspinwall &amp; Company, a major
exporter of coir products, many of the 200 registered exporters are only too
willing to part with a portion of the benefits of rupee devaluation in
exchange for increased export orders.
Discounting against the minimum price is, however, a violation of Indian law
and the established export houses will not take the risk, says Mr Unni.
According to the British association, 'the widespread violation of the floor
price regulation is putting intolerable strain on both exporters and
importers who are seeking to abide by the rules'.
It is not that the Indian government does not suspect that some exporters
are offering discounts to foreign buyers, but booking the offenders is not
going to be easy. Interestingly, in the past, the importers have been in
favour of the minimum price scheme as they were ready to pay 'remunerative
prices' for quality products. The exporters are also expected to procure
coir goods at government recommended prices for sustaining the interest of
producers in the natural fibre. Unfortunately, not many exporters pay the
recommended prices to the producers, admits Mr Unni. Neither the export
minimum nor the recommended procurement prices for export have served the
interest of producers, who are mostly in the cottage sector.
In the circumstances, the Coir Board, which is coming under increasing
pressure from the importers and the established exporters to do away with
the minimum export price and other controls on trade is expected to review
the coir export policy soon. In the meantime, the board has given an
assurance to the importers that it is not planning any 'further upward
revision of MEP.'
The British and German coir associations have assured the Coir Board that
they are not asking for the withdrawal of the minimum price to bring prices
down, although a temporary fall is not ruled out.
The importers' associations are not averse to the idea of the Indian
government imposing a levy on coir exports in the post MEP period, the
proceeds of which would be utilised for product and market development.
In spite of the MEP related problems, India, according to Mrs Minnie Mathew,
secretary of the Coir Board, will be exporting 30,000 tonnes of coir
products, valued at Rs660m (Pounds 14m) in the year ending March 1992,
compared with 28,000 tonnes worth Rs490m in 1990-91.
The Indian coir industry, which employs nearly 500,000 workers, is
concentrated in Kerala, on the south-west coast. Its products are marketed
in more than 80 countries, but Western Europe alone accounts for nearly 70
per cent of the export total. The export target for 1992-93, the first year
of the eighth plan, is Rs730m. By 1996-97, the final year of the plan, coir
exports should reach about Rs1bn. The industry's failure to make better
progress in recent years has been largely because of the negative attitude
of the successive Kerala governments and the militant opposition of trade
unions to mechanisation.
The 'back to the nature movement' in the developed countries is no doubt
helping the cause of coir, according to Mr Unni. Even so, it accounts for
only 2 per cent of the European carpet market.
However, the Coir Board's initiative to promote the fibre as a decorative
material and as a geotextile for preventing soil erosion has met with
success. In the past couple of years India is estimated to have exported
nearly 2,000 tonnes of coir geotextiles.

<TEXT>
MR RAY MacSharry, the European Community's agriculture commissioner, said
yesterday there was 'absolutely no reason' why EC agriculture ministers
should not agree on reform of the common agricultural policy in April. He
was speaking after Brussels' reform plans received the broad backing of Euro
MPs, in what he described as a 'very positive' result.
Of the 520 amendments tabled, Mr MacSharry was particularly worried about
proposed changes to the core cereals clauses of the reform package. But
amendments which would have watered down the planned price cuts for cereals
and milk were rejected and will have to be re-examined by the parliament's
agriculture committee.
The committee had suggested a more moderate cut in cereal prices than
Brussels and also wanted to maintain milk prices, whereas the commission
plans a gradual reduction. But MEPs voted against those proposals and new
amendments on cereals and milk will have to be tabled at the next full
session of Parliament in April.
Mr Reinhold Bocklet, the German Christian Democrat reporting for the
agriculture committee, said his colleagues were likely to settle for a 20-30
per cent price cut.

GOLD was fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 349 a troy ounce on the London
bullion market. This acted as a drag on sentiment in the white metals, which
are straining to push upwards, dealers said. Gold continues squeezed between
crucial technical support at Dollars 348 and producer selling in the Dollars
351-Dollars 352 area. Chartists pointed to a bullish chart pattern in
SILVER, which currently lacks a speculative trigger for a rally. Thursday's
US retail sales data may be the trigger, they said. 'I'm more optimistic on
silver at the moment. The longer gold stays where it is, the greater chance
there is of silver breaking away,' one dealer said. On the LME ZINC
momentarily dropped to three-week lows in the afternoon on continued
liquidation, with support for three-month metal around Dollars 1,180 a tonne
breached. TIN lost ground against a background of freer offers of Brazilian
metal. In Chicago WHEAT futures were well down at midday, pounded by long
liquidation and commission house selling. 'There were a lot of longs in the
market after the run-up just in case of a hard freeze,' said a trader.
Market talk that crop damage in the High Plains and the Midwest was not as
severe as previously believed contributed to losses, traders said.

Prices at wool sales in Australia this week were unchanged or a little
cheaper and it is now recognised that the strong rise in February reached an
upper limit by the beginning of March. There has been no major decline but
inevitably the general reaction in wool using markets is to wait and see
what happens before coming to further major buying decisions. The UK Budget
has useful measures designed to help small businesses but its impact on
recovery and interest rates is now seen as dependent on the General
Election. The AWC Market indicator was 638 cents on March 11th.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Leeds BS in Canadian dollar
paper programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, has become the
first to launch a Canadian dollar commercial paper programme, marking a
further step by the societies to move away from their traditional UK
investor base.
The Leeds also announced it was to launch a Ecu2bn medium-term note
programme. Together, the two will greatly expand the society's foreign
currency fund-raising, which is currently equivalent to Pounds 3bn.
The Leeds, like other large UK societies, has taken steps recently to
develop relationships with overseas investors to reduce its reliance on its
traditional sterling investors.
The move into foreign currencies has also been stimulated by a change in
regulations announced in December. These allow societies to hold liquid
assets in currencies other than sterling for the first time.
Mr Ian Stewart, capital markets manager at the Leeds, said proceeds from the
Canadian dollar programme would either be swapped into sterling or used to
invest in high-grade Canadian or US dollar paper.
'This will help to diversify both on the asset and liability sides,' said Mr
Stewart. 'Our aim is not to become overly reliant on any one sector.'
The Leeds has a funding requirement of Pounds 400m to Pounds 500m a year, he
said, around half of it due to the need to refinance existing deals.
UK building societies have only been permitted to raise money on the
wholesale markets since 1986, and have developed a real presence overseas in
the US dollar, which was first tapped in the late 1980s by the two leaders,
Halifax and Abbey National (which has since given up mutual status to become
a bank).
The Leeds' long-term debt is rated AA3 by Moody's, while its short-term
paper is rated A1/P1. Its Canadian dollar paper has a rating of R1 (Middle)
from Dominion Bond Rating Service.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Bonds: US bank in yen issue as appetite for
currency fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday came in on the tail-end of
recent demand for yen bonds as appetite for the currency among international
investors appeared to be fading fast.
The Y50bn offering of three-year bonds was generally welcomed as a
well-priced deal from a borrower with a good name in the market, although
there were grumbles in some quarters that the deal was too aggressive and
was not selling well.
Also, concern about the yen-dollar exchange rate and a weakening in the
Japanese government bond market led to some resistance. One banker said:
'The pricing is correct. The timing is not so good.' There were concerns
that issues in the days ahead could cause indigestion in the market.
The IADB's issue, with a yield of 5.25 per cent, was priced to fall between
the bid/offer spread on the nearest comparable deal, a three-year issue from
the European Investment Bank which was yielding 5.28 per cent on the bid
side and 5.18 per cent on the offered side. The tighter pricing was aimed in
part to pick up on a move to shorter-dated yen paper, bankers said.
An Ecu150m seven-year deal for BP America, aimed at retail investors, met
rather subdued demand, according to most participants, due to the lacklustre
performance of European markets. Dealers said the positive reception of
Deutsche Bank's recent seven-year deal was due to the particular popularity
of that name with retail investors; interest in the sector has since
dwindled.
Although the BP deal offered a yield pick-up of 26 basis points over the
Deutsche Bank deal, retail demand remained sluggish.
The deal was not helped by the fact that BP's debt rating of double-A3 is
under review by Moody's.
However, dealers added that there was sporadic demand for seven to 10-year
paper, rather than the short end of the market. Lead manager, UBS, reported
firm demand from Swiss retail investors. The deal was still held in
syndicate at the end of trading.
Eurofima, which finances European rolling stock, launched a L200bn offer
said to have been tightly-priced, though strong demand was reported in some
quarters. The L200bn, seven-year deal, was said to have encountered demand
among retail funds in continental Europe, though it later traded within fees
and ended the day at break-even point for the banks involved.
In a rare move, Daito Trust Construction, a Japanese construction company,
offered Dollars 300m of convertible bonds, marking a step away from the
warrant market and into convertibles.

REPAP Enterprises, one of North America's biggest lightweight coated paper
producers, plans to raise CDollars 150m through an issue of subordinate
voting shares, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The issue will bolster Repap's cash position. The shares will be offered by
Gordon Capital and Credit Suisse First Boston in Canada and Europe. The
issue is not registered in the US.
Repap has nearly 100m tons of coated paper capacity in New Brunswick and
Wisconsin, and is a large market pulp producer in western Canada.
Because of poor markets, it reported heavy losses last year and is not
expected to return to normal profitability, with the rest of the industry,
until 1993.
The Japan Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), the nation's
leading business group, has urged Japan to allow listed companies to acquire
their own shares, Keidanren said in a statement, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Currently, a listed company cannot buy its own shares, a legacy of the
post-war era aimed at preventing big conglomerates.
Jardine Fleming, the UK brokerage house, has issued 60m two-year covered
warrants on shares of Cathay Pacific Airways at HKDollars 3.10 each, Reuter
reports from Hong Kong.
The warrants carry a strike price of HKDollars 12.60. The premium, based on
the closing share price of HKDollars 12.70, is 24.6 per cent and the gearing
is 4.07 times.
The oversubscribed issue was fully placed with institutional and retail
investors in Hong Kong, Europe, Britain and the US. The expiry date is March
11 1994.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Gilts concern gives way to
hope - Dealers can see a silver lining in the PSBR cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England will have to issue a torrent of UK government bonds in
the next financial year, given the government's forecast of an unexpectedly
high Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR).
While the gilt-edged securities market was shocked by the scale of the
government's borrowing requirement, some dealers and investors are hoping
that the Bank will use the opportunity to improve the liquidity of specific
gilt issues and perhaps issue some altogether new stocks.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer's forecast of a PSBR of Pounds 28bn in
1992-93 in Tuesday's Budget means an estimated Pounds 33bn in gross gilt
sales - or an average of Pounds 2.75bn a month.
The Bank began buying back some of the small illiquid gilt issues between
1987 and 1990, and attempted to improve the liquidity of specific benchmark
stocks when the government returned to borrowing in 1991. The move has been
welcomed by gilts traders, who prefer to have fewer, bigger issues, and many
hope that this trend will continue.
'There is still considerable scope for increasing the size of existing
issues,' says Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. 'While
many of the obvious gaps in the market have been filled, there remain many
areas where new issues would be welcome.'
The main areas where dealers and investors would like the Bank to issue
stock are:
At the very long end of the yield curve.
The Bank has already approached the domestic institutional investors to
gauge their interest in a 'super-long jumbo gilt' with a maturity of 25 to
30 years. Such a maturity would appeal to insurance and pension fund
managers, who could use it to match their liabilities. Some fund managers
point out that a very long-dated gilt would be helpful for pricing
long-dated sterling corporate bonds.
The Bank has made it clear that it is waiting for yields to drop further
before it issues such a gilt. However, one economist pointed out that the
Bank will be forced to issue across a broad range of maturities and may soon
have to tap the long end of the market, adding: 'Beggars cannot be
choosers.'
Gilts in the five to 10-year area which are used by the swaps market.
The Bank has already taken steps to improve the liquidity of certain gilts
used by the swaps market, for example the 10 per cent gilt due 1996. Traders
believe there is still scope for further issuance of stocks used by the
swaps market. Mr Kendall predicts that the Bank will probably issue more of
the 10 per cent Treasury due 1996, the 10 1/2 per cent Exchequer due 1997,
or else a completely new five-year gilt, the 12 per cent Exchequer due 1998,
and the 10 per cent Treasury due 2003.
The 10-year area.
Dealers emphasise that overseas investors often like to buy 10-year issues
when they invest in foreign government bond markets. The Bank has already
boosted the liquidity of the 9 3/4 per cent Treasury gilt due 2002 to make a
liquid 10-year issue, but traders say that the size of the issue could be
increased further, from around Pounds 5bn to between Pounds 7bn and Pounds
10bn.
'The greater the liquidity, the more acceptable it is to big investors,
especially those who want to trade actively,' says one gilt dealer. Some US
investors have complained in the past about the difficulty of doing big
trades.
Mr Simon Briscoe, economist with Midland Montagu, warns: 'If sterling moves
to the narrow band (of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary
System), we could see a massive influx of foreigners to the gilt market, and
a lot of it would be in the 10-year sector.' A Conservative victory in the
election on April 9, and the prospect of falling inflation, could also
entice foreigners into this sector.
To fill gaps in the maturity profile.
Mr Kendall believes there is demand for a new gilt issue maturing between
July 1995 and November 1996, and for issues maturing after 2000,
particularly around 2010.
Low coupon issues.
Mr Chris Anthony, economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, suggests that there
could be demand from higher-rate taxpayers for a low-coupon conventional
gilt. Such stock would have the advantage of a low income stream, but the
potential for large capital gains (on which investors would pay no capital
gains tax). However, Mr Anthony points out that such an issue would probably
be 'quite small and should not be overplayed'.
Further index-linked issues.
Index-linked issues would also satisfy any private investor demand for
low-coupon stocks, and there is some speculation that the Bank may issue an
index-linked stock when the 1992 issue is redeemed later this month.
The Bank announced that it would use auctions to sell over half of the new
gilt issues, and would increase the size of its auctions to between Pounds
2bn and Pounds 3bn, or more, if market conditions allow. Given the amount of
issuance it will have to tackle, the Bank is no doubt keeping its fingers
crossed and hoping that gilts resume their upward trend.

savings law

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATIONS preventing rich Japanese from putting their savings into banks
abroad should be eliminated, the Swiss government says.
Bern has put this item, which is of considerable interest to Switzerland's
large private banking industry, at the top of its agenda for bilateral talks
with officials of Japan's Ministry of Finance later this month.
Under MoF regulations, an individual can take up to Y30m (Dollars 226,000)
out of the country without prior authorisation, and up to Y100m with
authorisation. He or she must declare the amount as an asset in an annual
income tax declaration, and any appreciation in value over Y100m must be
repatriated.
'It is difficult to understand why there are still restrictions on movements
of Y30m to Y100m. It is no longer justified,' Mr Alexis Lautenberg, head of
the financial and economic division of the Swiss federal department of
foreign affairs, said yesterday.
Mr Heinrich Looser, a director of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, said no other
developed country had the same rigid controls on outward flows of individual
savings.
However, Mr Looser thought the MoF would resist demands for liberalisation.
'The Japanese economy is not growing. They want to bring capital back home
these days,' he said.
Also, even if the controls were eased, he did not expect any sudden surge of
Japanese business. 'The Japanese have no history of placing their money
abroad,' he said. 'But I would love to see the limit pushed up to Y500m for
a start.'
Mr Lautenberg, speaking to a meeting of the Swiss-Japanese Chamber of
Commerce in Zurich, said the forthcoming round of bilateral talks provided a
unique opportunity to make progress on several issues.
He noted that the talks came as the year-end deadline under a 1989 Swiss law
requiring non-banks to convert themselves into banks approached. Reciprocity
is one of the conditions for a foreign bank to qualify for a banking
licence. More than 20 Japanese securities companies with offices in
Switzerland have still to get their banking licences.

CHINA has announced plans to open a third stock market and attract more

Beijing.
The New China News Agency (NCNA) quoted an official with the People's Bank

China. Blueprints would be drawn up this year.
Existing exchanges in Shanghai and the special economic zone of Shenzhen in
southern China would also attract more listings. It is understood the two
markets had been authorised to issue Dollars 400m this year in special 'B'
shares reserved for foreign investors.
Taiwan is to allow its companies to sell their stocks abroad and permit
issues of shares by foreign concerns on the island, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) said, Reuter reports from Taipei.

MOODY'S Investors Services, the US credit agency, has taken the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank off its 'credit watch' list and confirmed its Prime-1 rating
for short-term deposits and commercial paper, writes Simon Holberton in Hong
Kong.
Mr John Gray, the bank's deputy chairman, said: 'We're happy about' the
reinstatement. He said the bank had found it difficult to understand why it
had been placed on credit watch.
Moody's said the confirmation rested on a balance of positive and negative
factors. Although a number of Hongkong Bank's affiliates remained
problematic 'their performance appears to have . . . begun to turn around,'
the agency added.
The confirmation of ratings covers the bank's Canadian and US subsidiaries
and Concord Leasing. In aggregate, the bank's short-term debt is valued at

AUSTRALIAN National Industries (ANI), an engineering group, yesterday
announced a 31 per cent cut in net profits to ADollars 33m (USDollars 24.8m)
for the seven months to the end of January, on sales down 17 per cent at
ADollars 669m.
Mr Max Sandow, chairman, said the result reflected falling demand caused by
severe recessions being experienced in the group's main markets in Australia
and the UK.
Mr Sandow said trading conditions were not expected to improve in the
remainder of the financial year. However, increased infrastructure spending
announced by the Australian government would eventually benefit many of the
group's businesses.
He said ANI may take advantage of its strong balance sheet by expanding its
core businesses through acquisitions.
The group said its recent acquisition of Spencer Clark Metal Industries in
the UK, a specialist metal processing company, would lead to a wide range of
profit improvements for its Aurora group of companies in the UK and Germany.
The Aurora companies suffered a severe downturn during the period because of
a decline in demand from the recession-affected aerospace and defence
industries.
However, ANI said significant cost reductions and continuing capital
expenditure had increased Aurora's competitiveness and profitability.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 5.3 cents a share, fully franked,
reflecting the company's strong cashflow and low debt, which declined by
ADollars 33m to ADollars 54m during the period.

FIRST International Bank of Israel (Fibi), controlled by Brazilian brothers
Mr Joseph and Mr Maurice Safra, announced a net 1991 profit of Shk63.5m
(Dollars 27.6m), a near 50 per cent improvement over 1990 when the bank's
record as Israel's most profitable bank slumped under the weight of domestic
recession and reverses in its UK operations.
In 1991, net return on capital at Fibi, Israel's fifth largest bank, bounced
back to 8.4 per cent from just over 6 per cent the previous year when it
lost its position as best performer to Bank Hapoalim, the country's biggest
bank.
The bank's bigger rivals have yet to report, but Fibi is likely to be back
on top for 1991 as the Bank of Israel has warned that profits at the 'big
four' will be all but wiped out by a new law enforcing big write-offs of
agricultural debts.
Fibi raised its provisions by more than 23 per cent to Shk92m, but said the
new law had little effect on its results because bad farm debts had been
fully provided for previously.
Fibi, the only one of the five top banks not majority owned by the
government, said it had achieved last year's improvement by expanding
banking activities in the business and financial sectors and through greater
involvement in the capital markets.
Net operating income was up more than 24 per cent at Shk182.4m.
Total assets were up 7.2 per cent at Shk10.5 bn.
The bank announced a cash dividend - the first for three years - totalling
Shk13.7m, or three times nominal share capital.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Loral goes on the attack in
defence - The US defence electronics group's expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loral, the US defence electronics company whose crafty acquisition strategy
has turned it into one of the darlings of Wall Street, is on the prowl again
for more bargain deals.
'We still have an appetite for growth both by internal investment and
development and by acquisition,' said Mr Bernard Schwartz, the company's
chairman and architect of Loral's transformation from a struggling company
with Dollars 30m annual sales in the early 1970s into one of the leading US
defence electronics contractors with a turnover of about Dollars 3.3bn in
its current financial year ending this month.
The uncertainties facing the defence industry have depressed the value of
many companies in this sector. But while most defence companies are seeking
to rationalise their military business, Mr Schwartz sees this as offering
Loral a chance to pick up further opportunities to expand its core defence
electronics businesses.
Mr Schwartz's last big acquisition was the Dollars 750m takeover of Ford
Aerospace 18 months ago. But he has systematically acquired some of the
defence activities of leading US 'blue chip' companies which decided to
diversify into the military sector and are now refocusing their activities
on their core operations.
Over the past seven years, Loral bought the military computer operations of
IBM; the military operations of Honey-well Optics; the defence business of
Goodyear, Xerox and Fairchild/Schlumberger before buying the defence and
aerospace activities of the Ford car group.
'There are still some big companies out there which have military
operations,' he said. 'These companies sought to diversify into the military
business when diversification was the buzz-word. My focus has been the
opposite. We always concentrated on our core defence business,' he
explained.
The strategy has paid handsome dividends. Although Loral has never been a
household name, it has now become a leader in several defence electronic
sectors including aircraft protection systems, training and simulation,
command and control, weapon delivery and battle management systems.
The company has also had an uninterrupted run of earnings increases. 'We
have continued to improve our profits every year,' Mr Schwartz said. 'This
year will be the best we ever had,' he added.
For the first nine months of its current financial year, Loral reported net
income of Dollars 81.4m compared with Dollars 59.7m for the same period the
year before. Mr Schwartz expects profits for the current financial year to
be around 13-15 per cent higher than last year. 'Next year will probably be
not so much but I'm still hoping for a double-digit increase,' he said.
Although the defence industry has come under pressure because of government
cuts, Loral remains confident about its future prospects because of its
strategy of concentrating on tactical weapons rather than on the strategic
nuclear weapons of the Cold War era. 'We've always been in the retrofit
business,' explained Mr Schwartz. 'We design and manufacture improvements on
present weapon systems,' he said. In the post Cold War defence market,
emphasis on retrofitting and enhancing existing weapons systems is expected
to grow.
The company, which saw about two thirds of its product line used in the
Desert Storm operation in the Gulf conflict last year, is also looking at
future market opportunities in the Middle East.
But Loral has traditionally concentrated its defence activities on the US.
In spite of budget cuts, Mr Schwartz said the US defence market will
continue to be huge. 'It still remains a very large market despite the
precipitous decreases in defence spending: we are talking of Dollars 289bn
last year and Dollars 270bn this year. The defence budget is still larger
than the US housing market and is about the same size as the US automobile
industry,' he said.
Loral has not been spared by the cutbacks in defence. Mr Schwartz
acknowledged Loral, which today employs about 25,000 people, has also had to
adjust to the new defence environment. But the company started rationalising
several years ago. 'Our labour population has decreased by about 10 per cent
over the last few years. But we never faced a cataclysmic cutback of
resources,' he explained.
Mr Schwartz believed the defence market would eventually stabilise. 'We can
still show earnings growth in this difficult period. But there will be fewer
industrial competitors in what is still a very large business and our market
share will increase. At least, that's the target,' he said.
Although Loral's emphasis remains the defence business, Mr Schwartz has also
moved the company into the commercial satellite business following the Ford
Aerospace acquisition. 'But moving into the commercial sector is not a
primary thrust of our strategy and it's not our objective to balance our
military business with commercial activities,' he added.
The commercial space business was an opportunity which emerged from the Ford
Aerospace acquisition. 'My concept was there was an opportunity to become a
global participant in the satellite business but we needed to branch out and
forge a partnership with other international groups,' he said.
This led to the satellite partnership with a group of European companies
including Aerospatiale and Alcatel of France and Alenia of Italy. The three
European companies last year acquired for Dollars 182m a 49 per cent stake
in the US company's new commercial satellite business called Space
Systems/Loral.
The venture has got off to a good start by winning a Dollars 500m contract
for a Japanese satellite programme.

<TEXT>
TOYS 'R' Us, the large specialist toy retailer, yesterday reported an 11.1
per cent sales increase to Dollars 6.12bn for the year to February 1, and
after-tax profits for the 12 months of Dollars 339.5m.
This compares with sales of Dollars 5.51bn in the previous year, and net
profits of Dollars 326m.
Earnings per share increased only marginally, up from Dollars 1.11 in
1989/90 to Dollars 1.15 last year. That was in line with analysts'
estimates, although the shares eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34 5/8
yesterday.
Mr Terrence McEvoy, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said: 'The
company indicated in its conference call that its electronic games category
would be flat to slightly up this year.'
He said that comment was likely the factor hurting the stock because
'earnings were right on target'.
In the fourth quarter alone - the key Christmas sales period - Toys 'R' Us
made an after-tax profit of Dollars 261.6m, up by just over 10 per cent on
the previous 12 months, on sales of Dollars 2.86bn up from Dollars 2.55bn.
Part of the growth comes from the steady expansion of the chain. Some 46
stores opened in the US last year, taking the total there to 497, and 29 new
outlets were introduced internationally. The group now has 126 stores
outside the US.
Toys 'R' Us said that same-store sales, which offer a better measure of
underlying growth, rose by 7.4 per cent in the fourth quarter but only 2.4
per cent for the year overall.
Yesterday, the group said that it plans to add 40 stores internationally
this year - going into Austria for the first time - and a slightly larger
number in the US.
About six of the new stores will be in the UK, where Toys 'R' Us currently
has 33 outlets.

CITICORP, the leading US bank that is seeking to dispose of assets in order
to help strengthen its capital base, is considering the sale of its credit
card processing business.
The bank declined to comment on market rumours that a sale is being
negotiated that could raise at least Dollars 150m, but it is understood that
the division - Citicorp Establishment Services - is among the assets likely
to be sold.
The card processing unit, which employs 350 people, handles receipts and
payments among retailers and other merchants who accept credit cards.
Citicorp's deliberations on the value of the division may be influenced by
the forthcoming sale by American Express of up to 45 per cent of First Data
Corporation (FDC), a subsidiary that includes the largest third-party
processor of credit cards in the US and Britain.
American Express is expected to seek Dollars 900m to Dollars 1bn for the 45
per cent equity stake in FDC.
In a separate development, Chase Manhattan is meanwhile considering the sale
of a stake in its mortgage servicing subsidiary as part of its own programme
of asset disposals.

demand

<TEXT>
STORA, Europe's biggest pulp and paper company, yesterday reported a 61 per
cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr1.09bn (Dollars 179m) for
1991 as it announced management changes, writes John Burton.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, the head of the Stora Papyrus fine paper division,
has been appointed president of Stora. He succeeds Mr Bo Berggren, who will
be chairman of Stora once Mr Peter Wallenberg retires.
Despite the sharp earnings fall Stora will retain an unchanged dividend of
SKr13. Sales rose 8 per cent to SKr67.1bn.
Although weaker demand and competitive price-cutting were largely to blame
for the slide in profits, restructuring costs also increased by 50 per cent
to SKr504m as Stora continued a three-year programme to eliminate 6,000 jobs
by the end of this year, reducing its labour force to 39,000.
Mr Berggren warned a further 500 job cuts might be necessary. Stora said it
was difficult to predict the outlook for 1992. It believed competition would
remain tough in the product areas of printing paper and fine paper, due to
excess production capacity.

agree to merge

<TEXT>
KYODO OIL, the oil products retailer and wholesaler, and Nippon Mining, the
oil refining and mining company, yesterday agreed to merge in response to
government deregulation of the oil industry.
The deal will create Japan's second largest integrated oil company. The two
companies, which already have close links, had combined oil sales of
Y2,184.8bn (Dollars 17.3bn) in the fiscal year ending last March.
The merger is aimed at creating a stronger oil group in the expectation that
competition will intensify in the Japanese market in the years ahead,
following government moves to deregulate oil refining in the fiscal year
beginning next month.
Under the terms of the merger, Nippon Oil will take over Kyodo Oil's
distribution business, while Nippon will spin off its non-ferrous metals
division, where profits have been under pressure.
Nippon currently controls 47 per cent of Kyodo and is one of the company's
principal oil products suppliers, along with Kashima Oil.
Kyodo is Japan's fifth largest petrol distributor with an 11.5 per cent
share of the market and total sales of 5.19m kilolitres last year. It has
6,381 branded petrol stations nationwide, with about a third in the Kanto
region surrounding Tokyo.
Kyodo and its affiliated suppliers, however, have excess refining capacity
against retail distribution. This excess capacity could become a liability
following deregulation as Mitsubishi Oil, for one, is planning to expand
refining capacity to reduce dependence on outside suppliers.
'There is a very high possibility of overcapacity in the industry,' said Mr
Jason James, analyst at James Capel Pacific.
Mr James said the Nippon Mining-Kyodo Oil group was likely to try to expand
its retail network to find an outlet for refined products.
This, however, would be an expensive proposition that could lead to excess
capacity and severe competition at the retail level.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) has tightly
regulated the oil industry since the oil shocks of the 1970s. It began a
process of deregulation in 1987, but measures taken to date have had little
practical impact.
This is expected to change some time in the year ahead when Miti scraps oil
refining quotas and allows refiners to determine their level of production.

FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nimble players in a global
market - The performance of the big three Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past few years, doubts have often been expressed in international
banking circles about the ability of the big three Swiss banks to thrive in
the deregulated, borderless markets of the future.
But those doubts must be largely put to rest following the publication of
record profits by the three, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Swiss Bank
Corporation (SBC) and Credit Suisse, for 1991, a year in which big banks in
the UK, the US and Japan all sagged under the pressure of weak economic
conditions.
The performance of the banks is all the more remarkable coming only a year
after most of the conventions which had enabled them to limit competition
and keep margins high in Swiss financial markets were removed.
Swiss bank managers are seen as slow moving and unimaginative, running their
banks like they run their country's citizen army, and their initial attempts
at achieving global reach often foundered. UBS and its chief executive Mr
Richard Struder had a long struggle with its Phillips &amp; Drew acquisition in
London before receiving any return on its investment, and Credit Suisse's
problems with its First Boston subsidiary in 1990 put great strain on the
bank's resources.
But, in the past year, these problems have been dealt with and the big three
have shown themselves to be nimble and successful global players.
Credit Suisse said 30 per cent of last year's net income came from foreign
operations, while UBS drew attention to the 25 per cent contribution from
foreign operations to its bottom line last year. At SBC, overall progress in
this direction was concealed by the cost of huge write-offs on bad loans in
the US and the UK.
In their basic lending business, the three took full advantage of sound
capital bases and the retreat of US and Japanese banks from the
international corporate market, booking loans to highly rated companies all
over the world at healthy margins. UBS reported interest income up a
handsome 23.3 per cent to SFr626m (Dollars 417.3m), but its loan book grew
only 4 per cent.
The three have also reacted successfully to the liberalisation of commission
rates in the Swiss equity markets by enticing small customers into managed
investment funds. Investment funds managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, the
second largest, nearly doubled to SFr21.1bn.
All three, but SBC and Credit Suisse in particular, have made enthusiastic
use of derivative products to manage risk.
SBC revealed that its association with the derivative specialists, The
O'Conner Partnerships in Chicago, in which it invested about SFr90m a little
over a year ago, yielded net income of SFr107m last year. Profits from
trading at Credit Suisse, driven mainly by the Credit Suisse Financial
Products subsidiary in London, soared nearly sixfold to SFr1.3bn.
All three also showed big gains on foreign exchange trading and officials
made clear that these came from offices in New York, London and Tokyo, not
from Zurich.
In securities-related business as well, the big three have decided it is
more important to be competitive than to be in Switzerland. No less than 88
per cent of Credit Suisse's investment funds are now based in Luxembourg,
mainly to avoid Switzerland's stamp duty. SBC and UBS operate about 60 per
cent of their managed funds in Luxembourg.
Like other international banks, the big three felt obliged to make big
provisions for bad loans last year. SBC and Credit Suisse were among those
who loaned large sums to companies controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. Polly
Peck, Brent Walker and Macy's are among other foreign names that appear
prominently on bad loan lists.
At home, the big problem has been the slump in the property market. As Mr
Robert Jeker, chief executive of Credit Suisse, said last Friday, 'in the
past, we did not imagine that property prices in Switzerland would decline'.
All reported having to make significant numbers of repossessions for the
first time in memory - 72 properties worth SFr99.4m in the case of UBS - and
Mr Heinz Muller, a group director, said he would not be surprised to see the
figure double this year. UBS and SBC have 45 per cent and 40 per cent
respectively of their advances to customers in mortgages, Credit Suisse only
a third.
The banks have been rapidly adapting their disclosure practices to
international standards, and they now provide much more information about
their activities and financial health. The near mythical secret reserves
have been exposed, revealing that all three have capital resources well
beyond those required under the Bank of International Settlements
guidelines.
That does not mean they do not take advantage occasionally of the leeway
that exists between international standards and the more lax Swiss ones.
Last year SBC pulled SFr400m out of a general provision for sovereign risks
that it said was no longer needed and used it to reduce bad debt provisions
to SFr1.5bn.
Some analysts worried about the increasing proportion of the banks' income
coming from trading activities, especially from derivative products.
Others point out the number of banks in the world that have the skills and
the financial strength to compete in these sophisticated areas is small and
perhaps shrinking.
And that is probably one reason why the big three are all confident of
further profit growth this year, in spite of dreary economic conditions in
Switzerland and in many other countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Babcock, the hard-pressed plant and engineering group, is to float
three subsidiaries on the German stock market as part of an attempt to
retain its independence, Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chairman, said.
The company had to improve value to shareholders and persuade them not to
sell at current low prices.
These were 'an invitation' for someone to consider a bid, he said yesterday.
The group believed up to 20 per cent of its stock had changed hands
recently.
Downgrading profit forecasts for the current year, which ends September 30,
Mr Schmiedeknecht said he did not expect to be able to pay a dividend until
1993/94. The last payout, of DM4 a share, was made in 1989.
The company made net profits of DM32m (Dollars 20m) last year after a DM81m
loss in 1989/90. This year's result, earlier expected to be at least DM80m,
would now be between DM30m and DM40m, he said.
Order developments in the first five months of the year had made the company
more cautious. Power plant orders had slumped and the group was now
negotiating possible joint ventures in east European countries in the hope
of bolstering earnings from the sale of know-how.
Subsidiaries being prepared for flotation were Balcke-Durr, Babcock-BGH and
Schumag, specialists in mechanical engineering, plant and industrial
technology.
Group sales rose 26 per cent to DM7.3bn in 1990/91, but almost all the
growth came from recently purchased companies.

decline

BAYER, the last of the big three German chemicals companies to report 1991
results, yesterday announced better figures than either BASF or Hoechst, and
 -unlike the other two companies - said it would hold its dividend at the
same level as 1990.
Bayer said pre-tax profits fell by 4.8 per cent to DM3.2bn (Dollars 2bn)
last year, on sales up 1.8 per cent to DM42.4bn, and it intended to hold its
dividend at DM13 per share. On Tuesday Hoechst and BASF reported 1991
profits down by over 20 per cent and said they would cut their dividends by
DM1 to DM12 per share.
Yesterday's figures pleased analysts who were predicting comparatively good
figures for Bayer but were worried peer pressure would force the company to
cut its dividend in line with the other two.
In the event, it was the first time since 1983 the three companies' dividend
policies have in any way diverged.
Bayer gave no detailed commentary on its results, but analysts said the
better figures reflected the company's higher exposure to the non-cyclical
pharmaceutical sector. Over half the group's sales come from
pharmaceuticals, thus insulating group earnings from the full impact of the
prolonged downturn in worldwide chemicals industry.
Analysts said up to 70 per cent of current year profits could come from this
area, in particular from four products, the Adalat hypertension drug, the
Cipro antibiotic, Alka-Seltzer and Bayer Aspirin.
But group profits could be held back by dire conditions in the chemical
sector, especially the polyurethane and titanium dioxide markets. Here world
prices are weak as a result of intense competition at a time when costs are
high.
Bayer said group cash-flow rose 2.2 per cent to DM5.5bn and during the
course of last year it invested DM3.1bn on fixed assets and a further DM3bn
on research and development, compared with DM3.7bn and DM2.7bn respectively
in 1990.

UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's largest insurance group, yesterday reported an
increase in 1991 net profits, before allocations, to NKr565m (Dollars
86.9m). The dividend is rising to NKr2.60 a share from NKr2.40.
The result exceeded analysts' forecasts which were for a profit of between
NKr140m and NKr530m. 'The increase to a large extent is due to international
business improving . . . while the contribution from life assurance
increased substantially,' Uni explained.
Group operating income last year rose by NKr614m to NKr19.54bn, while
operating costs were cut by 2 per cent. Included in operating income is
investment income which fell by NKr251m to NKr5.52bn.
Uni said the decrease in operating costs was consistent with the aims of the
merger - planning to cut costs by 10 per cent over two years. Storebrand
merged with Uni Forsikring last January.
Uni said that in 1991 it lost NKr504m on its shareholdings in Den norske
Bank, Christiania Bank and the mortgage group, Realkreditt.
Uni said it had liquidated financing activities. To this end, an
extraordinary charge of NKr212m was made against the 1991 accounts.
Due to a reduction in the interest rate for housing loans to 11.5 per cent,
11,000 housing loans were granted totalling NKr3.88bn, with total loans
reaching NKr22.8bn at the end of 1991.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Current resistance trips switch out of Amps
 -A source of corporate finance that is neither debt nor equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY

<TEXT>
THE RECENT decisions by ECC Group and Tarmac to redeem some of their auction
market preferred shares begs the question of whether Amps are a suitable
source of finance for UK companies. A handful of other UK companies still
have Amps, and intend to keep them.
ECC is raising Pounds 209.2m net through a rights issue to redeem Dollars
350m (Pounds 198.8m) of its Dollars 400m outstanding Amps, while Tarmac is
redeeming Dollars 150m of its Dollars 300m issue. Both companies were
satisfied with the job the Amps had done for them so far. But ECC said they
were 'no longer a satisfactory long-term source of shareholders' funds', and
Tarmac said: 'The competitive advantage of Amps as a financial instrument
has been eroded.'
The Amps market, which is based in the US and totalled more than Dollars
20bn at the end of 1991, allows companies to issue securities which pay an
interest rate set regularly through auctions, often every 28 days. The paper
thus carries interest rates comparable to other short-term US interest
rates.
But the securities can only be redeemed at the issuer's option which means
the companies which have issued Amps have a potentially permanent source of
capital. Although they have some of the characteristics of debt, the UK
Accounting Standards Board recently said Amps should be regarded as part of
shareholders' funds, although classified as 'non-equity'.
Amps, therefore, are a kind of hybrid between debt and equity, more
expensive than the former but cheaper than the latter. Holders of preference
shares do not share in the company's future earnings growth as ordinary
share investors do through rising dividends.
Observers of the Amps market point out that the recession in the US has also
meant that corporate treasurers, frequent buyers of the paper, have less
cash than they had. Also the US yield curve is steep at present, and
investors are switching from short-dated low-yielding securities to find
higher yields from longer-term paper.
Mr Bob Carlton-Porter, finance director of ECC, says the company decided to
redeem its Amps for a combination of reasons. The issue was originally made
to help finance the acquisition of Georgia Kaolin, at a time when the UK
equity market might not have been receptive to an issue of new shares.
ECC felt it was now a good moment to switch to the more traditional form of
finance through a rights. He concedes that equity is a more expensive source
of long-term capital than Amps, but he sees it as the most stable form of
finance.
Another reason behind ECC's decision was that, although the level of
short-term interest rates in the US is currently low, the rate ECC was
paying on its Amps had risen in comparison to US commercial paper (CP).
Whereas it had been paying dividends at about 90 per cent of CP rates, this
had risen to 105 per cent.
Mr Carlton-Porter feels that there is some uneasiness in the US at the
moment about UK issuers, because of recession and political uncertainty.
Investors in Amps, mainly US corporate treasurers, can easily switch to
other instruments.
He carefully does not mention Ratners, although many say the jewellery
retailer's experience has deterred investors. In January the US credit
rating agencies cut Ratners' rating from BBB to B. The next auction of a
Dollars 50m tranche of its Dollars 200m Amps failed - there were
insufficient buyers - and the dividend rate shot up to the fall-back maximum
of 250 per cent of US CP rates.
Soon afterwards Ratners suspended payments on all its preference shares,
including the Amps. Now the Amps dividends are rolling up at the 250 per
cent of CP level, currently around 11.25 per cent.
While the case of Ratners may have put off investors, it does at least
demonstrate what many promoters of the product have always said. When a
company is in trouble, Amps behave like equity not debt.
Had Ratners' Amps been real debt, the group might now have been in the
throes of a financial reconstruction or, even worse, at the mercy of its
bankers. But because Ratners is not obliged to redeem the Amps, the finance
has stayed in place and given Ratners a chance to trade its way out of its
problems.
Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director of Redland, the building materials
company, which has Dollars 250m of Amps, says that the Ratners experience
has helped him explain to ordinary shareholders that Amps do have equity
characteristics.
He does not believe that Ratners has soured the market for other issuers. He
says the market is entirely credit-rating driven and that good credits will
continue to achieve fine rates of interest.
One US securities analyst says: 'There is no phobia in the market against UK
names, these people are sophisticated investors.' He, too, stresses the
importance of a good credit rating and says that the Ratners episode has
pushed investors towards higher quality names.
Last year Rank Organisation decided to redeem its Dollars 200m of Amps when
its credit rating was cut by the US rating agencies. That would have pushed
up the cost of its Amps, while Rank had borrowing facilities available at a
lower cost.
Tarmac's decision to redeem half its Amps appears to have been prompted when
it was put on 'credit watch' by the rating agencies, and analysts expected
the rating to be cut. At an auction since being put on credit watch, Tarmac
had to pay 120 per cent of CP rates in order to sell the full amount.
Amps typically have a maximum interest rate, set in the event of an auction
failure, according to the credit rating. For Tarmac the rate is 125 per cent
of CP rates with a single A rating and 175 per cent for a BBB rating.
But other UK groups, such as Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft
drinks group, and Elf UK, the UK subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the oil
company, are paying dividends well below CP rates because of their good
credit ratings.
Mr John Grout, director of treasury at Cadbury, says: 'The people who buy
Amps are not equity investors but buyers of debt instruments and they are
very credit-rating sensitive'. He says the Amps - more expensive than
straight debt - have improved Cadbury's senior debt credit rating without
the costs of equity.
He warns, however, that Amps are not an instrument which a cyclical company,
likely to suffer fluctuations in its credit rating, should rely on heavily
for finance. The view is echoed by Mr Corbett of Redland who says Amps form
only 10 per cent of his company's capital structure.
There have been a number of new issues by US companies recently, but it
seems likely to be a while before another UK group taps the market.

<TEXT>
WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and financial services
group, yesterday announced the finalising of its acquisition of UDT Bank in
the Irish Republic from Hill Samuel Bank for a cash consideration of IPounds
23.4m (Pounds 21.8m).
According to Woodchester, the latest audited state- ments of UDT showed its
total assets to be in excess of IPounds 300m at October 31 1991. Net assets
stood at IPounds 19.5m. Its profit before taxation was IPounds 4m.
In a statement announcing the deal's finalising Woodchester said that it
believed UDT's activities 'are complemen-tary to those of Woodchester Bank
and that the merger of the two operations will strengthen considerably the
enlarged bank's market position'.
Woodchester's acquisition will expand the banking arm of its business,
particularly in the region of Cork, Ireland's second largest city, which has
a flourishing pharma- ceuticals and electronics industry.
Woodchester's core business is in equipment and vehicle leasing in Ireland
and the UK.
In its last annual report Woodchester reported total assets of IPounds
1.1bn. It is 45 per cent owned by the Credit Lyonnais group, which increased
its stake from 29.8 per cent in January 1991.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: All-round growth boosts BWD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH IN all its sectors helped BWD Securities, the USM-quoted financial
services group, report pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 2.07m,
against Pounds 849,000 which included an exceptional charge of Pounds
201,000.
Turnover advanced 28 per cent from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds 10m. The pre-tax
figure included interest received of Pounds 652,000 (Pounds 673,000).
Mr Christopher Broadbent, the chief executive of the Huddersfield-based
company, said that privatisation brought a surge in volume of transactions,
but values and margins were low.
Because privatisation could not be relied on in future, the group was
building its recurring fee base to secure profitability. Recurring fee
income was Pounds 1.2m last year, compared with Pounds 900,000 in 1990.
'We know we still have a long way to go, but many stockbrokers have none at
all, so we are quite happy to reveal the figures,' Mr Broadbent said.
The group operates the BWD Rensburg stockbroking company and Capital for
Companies, the Leeds venture capital arm. J Douglas McDonald, which provides
personal financial planning services and administrates pension funds, was
acquired during the year and renamed BWD McDonald.
Capital for Companies launched its ninth BES fund - it has run one per year
since the scheme started - and is also sponsoring another assured tenancy
issue. Realisations for the first three funds had shown excellent returns,
BWD said.
Mr Broadbent said the planned abolition of BES at the end of next year,
announced in the Budget, would provide a surge of activity in the next 18
months. Capital for Companies was already involved in conventional venture
capital activities for the future.
BWD also owns Northern Registrars, now the tenth largest in the UK and
providing registration services for more than 70,000 shareholders. In
September it acquired Yorkshire Registrars and the business and some assets
of Crossley House Registrars. Since the year-end on November 30, Northern
has acted for one client in a Pounds 99m rights issue.
Earnings per share more than doubled from the low 1990 base of only 3p to
7.6p. A proposed final dividend of 1.7p (0.75p) will bring the total for the
year to 3p (1.75p).

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: European advertising fall behind 19% drop
at Aegis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS GROUP, Europe's biggest media-buying concern, yesterday reported a 19
per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, the first
full-year profit decline since it went public eight years ago.
Mr Peter Scott, chairman, blamed the fall in profits - from Pounds 67.8m to
Pounds 55.2m - on the 1 per cent fall in European advertising expenditure,
the worst performance for a decade. This was mainly due to the effects of
the Gulf war.
In the face of difficult trading conditions Aegis is only predicting 2 per
cent growth this year.
While the group completed the main elements of its building programme,
started in 1988, operating costs rose from Pounds 87.2m to Pounds 120.5m in
the period. Some Pounds 19m of the rise came from acquisitions, mergers and
new business start-ups.
The operating companies of Carat, the Paris-based buying group, have been
integrated into a single European network with 50 offices in 18 countries
and a new central management structure has been put in place.
Turnover rose to Pounds 2.11bn (Pounds 1.72bn), mainly on the back of
acquisitions. Earnings per share fell to 21.11p (37.35p) basic and to 18.23p
(25.62p) fully diluted.
During the year the group paid vendors of acquired companies deferred and
contingent cash payments of Pounds 25m.
The total amount outstanding to be paid to vendors of acquired companies in
cash and shares is Pounds 81m, against Pounds 118m in 1990.
A proposed final dividend of 3.1p makes an unchanged total of 5.85p.
COMMENT
Following the group's warning last December the pre-tax profits fall is in
line with expectations. Given the depressed state of the market, there is
some truth to the group's claim that it has produced 'robust results'. Yet
since the fall in European advertising expenditure was no surprise, it is
disappointing to find a Pounds 33.3m increase in operating costs. Even if
Pounds 19.3m was due to acquisitions, overhead costs are still too high.
While the group is determined to bring those costs down - it says it is
investigating the scope for redundancies - it is also committed to buying in
its minorities which could make the task harder. Aegis expects competitive
pressures to continue which will put more pressure on margins. The City
expects full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 48m, giving earnings of 13.7p.
This puts the shares, up 1p at 114p, on a prospective multiple of 8.3,
reflecting some uncertainty over this year's profits.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Scholes blames recession for fall to less
than Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLES, the electrical products group, blamed continuing recession for a
sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 916,000 in the six
months to the end of December.
But the interim dividend of 1.6p is maintained, from earnings of 1.7p
(3.9p). The company said there were early indications that the decline in
orders had halted and some business areas were witnessing small
improvements.
Scholes also announced that Mr Reg Harrington, chairman and chief executive,
had been taken seriously ill. His executive responsibilities have been
transferred to Mr Bill Riches, group finance director. Mr Richard Morgan, a
non-executive director, becomes non-executive chairman.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 33.9m). The company said the
decline in operating profit to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 3.45m) was wholly due to
reduced sales volumes.
Interest charges declined to Pounds 541,000 (Pounds 958,000) after the
company reduced borrowings by Pounds 2.3m through improved cash and stock
management.
Scholes said its joint ventures with Asea Brown Boveri were making progress.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ansbacher incurs Pounds 8.2m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENRY ANSBACHER, the small City merchant bank, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 8.23m in the year to December 31, 1991, after making heavy provisions
to offset losses on loans to small businesses.
In 1990, the group made profits of Pounds 2.46m. The loss per share was 5.1p
(0.1p earnings) and as a result of the poor performance, the dividend has
been cut from 1.5p to a nominal 0.01p. The nominal payment was made to
preserve the authorised investment status of the company's shares under the
Trustee Investments Act.
The bank said that the 1991 results were disappointing and did little
justice to the underlying strength of the group which was currently trading
profitably.
The merchant banking arm of the group turned in a loss of Pounds 9.87m,
compared with Pounds 1m profit.
Third world debt trading and offshore banking put in strong performances and
the London corporate finance operation earned record levels of fee income
and made what was described as an encouraging amount of progress.
Other arms of the bank did less well. There were losses by the mergers and
acquisitions division
Central costs fell from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 1.64m.
The loan book at the year end was Pounds 126m and has since reduced further
to Pounds 114m. The bank's total balance sheet has shrunk from Pounds
678.16m at the end of 1990 to Pounds 619.53m.

Net asset value at Grosvenor Development Capital, the independent venture
capital fund managed by Grosvenor Venture Managers, was 130.13p at November
30, an almost 9 per cent rise on the 119.41p of a year earlier.
Total income for the year to November 30 increased to Pounds 1.8m, against
Pounds 1.2m for the 50 weeks to November 30 1990. Pre-tax profits declined
to Pounds 294,000 (Pounds 302,000) after administration expenses grew to
Pounds 603,000 (Pounds 385,000) and interest payable was up at Pounds
904,000 (Pounds 508,000). The higher interest charges were due to the draw
down of loan notes.
Earnings per share rose to 2.89p (2.7p) basic and 5.3p (3.38p diluted). The
final dividend is lifted to a proposed 0.95p (0.9p, though this was
augmented by a 0.45p special payment).
The company also announced the appointment of Mr David Bucks, previously
deputy chairman of Hill Samuel, as a non-executive director. He will succeed
Mr John Oakley as chairman at the annual meeting on April 13.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trilion losses rise in uncertain climate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult trading, largely resulting from the uncertainties of the Channel 3
licence applications, was blamed by Trilion for pre-tax losses increasing to
Pounds 3.61m in the year to September 30, against Pounds 376,000.
The USM-quoted provider of television facilities and producer of television
programmes said that it had been a year of change. Following board changes
and a review of operations Stylus Television and some operating units were
closed, provisions for which have been included in the accounts.
Turnover fell from Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 14.2m and the pre-tax figure was
struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 708,000 relating to closure
costs. There was also a turndown from interest received of Pounds 144,000 to
a charge of Pounds 283,000.
Losses per share were 6.2p (0.8p) and the dividend is being passed. There
was a final payment of 0.5p last time.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 688,000 covered the costs associated with
the application for the Channel 3 licence for Wales and the west of England
and further provisions for discontinued premises costs.
Trilion will have a 10 per cent stake in Westcountry Television which won
the licence for the south west of England.

company said that, since January 1, sales for the following nine weeks were
up 10 per cent on the corresponding period. Costs and overheads were reduced
by almost 5 per cent to Pounds 65.8m with more positive results from cost
savings from closures becoming effective in the second half. Interest was
down at Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 1.75m).
Earnings declined to 1p (1.9p) per share and the interim dividend is cut to
0.75p (1.25p).

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf expands milling

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAPLE LEAF Foods, the Canadian food processing arm of Hillsdown Holdings,
plans two joint ventures with ConAgra, of the US, to position its Canadian
flour-milling business for the whole North American market.
Maple Leaf contributes its flour-milling and bakery mix assets to a Canadian
joint venture owned 50-50 with ConAgra, which contributes its flour-milling
operation in Buffalo, NY, to a US joint venture.
The move stems from Canada-US free trade and aligns the flour-milling
operations with a leading US miller, Maple Leaf said. 'This puts our
flour-milling business in a strong strategic position for the future.'
The company earlier tried to merge its flour-milling business with the
Ogilvie Mills division of John Labatt but was precented by Canadian
competition rules.
Maple Leaf, Canada's largest food processor with operations in the US and
Europe, reportednet profits of CDollars 67.2m, or 97 cents a share, for 1991
up 54 per cent from CDollars 41.1m, or 63 cents a share in 1990, on sales of
CDollars 3bn (CDollars 3.5bn).
The sales decline was due to disposals and closures, including the dairy and
beef operations in 1991. The edible oils business is being sold. Analysts
estimate it is worth about CDollars 100m.
In 1991, consumer foods improved margins. Lower flour-milling profits offset
gains by the bakery, retail franchise and international businesses.
Agribusiness was stable. Except for poultry, individual businesses did
better.
Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers, closed the year with net cash of
CDollars 151m after a CDollars 226m equity issue last November. About 54 per
cent-owned by Hillsdown, it aims at becoming a North American food group and
a US takeover is widely expected.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown profits hampered by poultry but
helped by interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR HARRY Solomon, chair-man of Hillsdown Holdings, said that in the opening
weeks of the current year the group's results were ahead of 1991.
He emphasised Hillsdown's strategy of building on its core food businesses
so that they would be able to compete on a European and North American
basis. He said the cash raised through last autumn's Pounds 280.7m rights
issue gave the group acquisition opportunities.
Last year over-capacity and low prices in the poultry market worked against
Hillsdown, with operating profits from the division down 56 per cent to
Pounds 26.3m. Mr David Newton, group chief operating officer, said that
poultry prices were the lowest seen since 1983 and there had been a flood of
imports, mainly from France.
However, poultry prices had begun to pick up recently, he said, and he
believed the acquisition of JP Wood last month would allow Hillsdown to
build a low-cost producer able to compete on a European scale.
Hillsdown's other activities broadly maintained operating profits. The
pre-tax figure was helped by a lower interest charge, although the rights
money only benefited the last 10 weeks of the year.
Group sales were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 4.66bn and operating profits
were 5.2 per cent down at Pounds 231.7m. A fall in interest charges to
Pounds 44.9m (Pounds 53.3m) curbed the pre-tax profits decline to 2.3 per
cent.
Operating profits from the food processing division rose 16 per cent to
Pounds 137.3m.
In the meat division operating profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 32m with
margins up from 2.8 per cent to 3.1 per cent. The division includes Strong &amp;
Fisher, the 70 per cent-owned leather group, which moved from loss to
profit.
The furniture division saw a fall from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 15.1m,
although the main upholstery business maintained profits.
Profits from housebuilding, property trading and other activities were
slightly lower at Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 26.1m).
There was an extraordinary cost of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 76.1m) which related
to the costs of discontinued activities, partly offset by the Pounds 16.1m
profit on selling the group's stake in Wickes, the DIY retailer.
Following the rights issue, and a placing by Maple Leaf in Canada, the
balance sheet saw a fall in net debt to Pounds 125.8m (Pounds 494.2m).
Shareholders' funds rose to Pounds 807.3m (Pounds 534.7m) and minority
interests were up to Pounds 209.3m (Pounds 155.8m).
A final dividend of 6.6p (6p) is proposed, to give a total of 8.8p (8p).
Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, was bowing out after yesterday's
annual results. Asked about his successor, Sir Harry said: 'I anticipate
being in a position to make an announcement shortly.'

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Nylex falls sharply to ADollars 287m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BTR NYLEX, the Australian manufacturing group, yesterday announced a 41 per
cent fall in net profits to ADollars 287m (Pounds 128m) after abnormal items
for the year to the end of December. Sales were up 2.2 per cent to ADollars
4.9bn.
The poor result reflects a difficult year for BTR Nylex in which margins
have been squeezed by recession in its main Australasian markets. The dip in
profits follows a 14 per cent decline to ADollars 489m for the year to
December 1990. The group, which is a quoted subsidiary of BTR of the UK,
said the second half had followed the pattern of the first six months, when
net profits were also down 41 per cent.
The directors cut the final dividend to 5 cents, 50 per cent franked, from
6.5 cents last year. The total dividend is 9.5 cents, franked to 38 per
cent, compared with 11.75 cents, franked to 39 per cent.
The group said it had applied an 'aggressive approach' to rationalising and
restructuring its operations to reflect the depressed economic conditions in
Australia and New Zealand.
The restructuring programme resulted in costs of ADollars 63m, which were
charged as an abnormal item against operating profits of ADollars 759, down
22 per cent on the previous year. Mr Graeme Pearson, managing director, said
the group's automotive, building products, commercial interiors and textile
operations showed no sign of recovery.
Economic conditions in Europe and North America also affected BTR Nylex's
markets, and had applied pressure to most of its businesses, particularly
those related to commercial construction and furnishing, he said.
Economic growth remained strong in South East Asia, with good demand for the
group's consumer, building and infrastructure related products. However,
profits in Taiwan were affected by weak world demand for polymers.
The only bright spot was the packaging division, a technological leader in
glass and plastics, which increased operating profits by 16 per cent to
ADollars 253m on sales up 52 per cent to ADollars 1.2bn.
The packaging result reflected a strong performance by Continental PET, an
Australian glass company, and part-year contributions from Smorgon Glass in
Australia and Rockware, the UK glass company. All were acquired during the
year.
BTR Nylex said the outlook remained uncertain for the economies of
Australasia, North America and Europe. However, it expected to benefit
substantially from the acquisitions and restructuring carried out in 1991.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: T&amp;N declines by 30% to Pounds 49.1m -
Dividend maintained / 1,500 more jobs expected to go this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, yesterday emerged as yet
another casualty of the recession in key world vehicle markets. Pre-tax
profits for 1991 fell 30 per cent from Pounds 70.5m to Pounds 49.1m.
Mr Colin Hope, the chairman and chief executive, could discern no signs of
market recovery and he warned of another 1,500 job losses this year on top
of 3,000 - 7 per cent of the workforce - last year and a total of 5,000
since 1990.
Despite this gloomy scenario, the group surprised many City analysts by
maintaining its final 7.25p dividend, making an unchanged total of 10.85p.
Largely as a consequence its shares last night closed up 5p at 124 1/2 p.
The decision meant that the dividend was left uncovered by earnings per
share of 4.98p (15.01p). A little more than Pounds 36m was needed from
reserves to pay for it. However, last year's Pounds 119m rights issue
strengthened the balance sheet with gearing reduced from 49 to 31 per cent.
Mr Hope said that the decision to maintain the dividend was justified by the
group's strong strategic position and potential for recovery once markets
started to improve.
It was already benefiting from cost cutting and efficiency measures, as well
as increased penetration of some key automotive markets. Capital spending
had been virtually maintained at Pounds 86m (Pounds 89m), while research and
development spending had been increased to sharpen international
competitiveness.
Turnover was up by Pounds 110m to Pounds 1.36bn, reflecting the 1990
acquisition of JPI in the US. In comparable terms, sales volume was down by
6 per cent. Operating profit fell by 16 per cent to Pounds 89.7m.
The UK continued to provide the group's main source of profitability, Pounds
33.5m (Pounds 54.1m) at the operating level. Turnover in continental Europe
and North America rose to Pounds 339m (Pounds 326m) and Pounds 318m (Pounds
195m) respectively, compared with Pounds 534m (Pounds 563m) for the UK.
Zimbabwe showed a 42 per cent increase in operating profit, helped by a
decline in its currency against the US dollar in which most of T&amp;N's sales
were made.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 9m (Pounds 3.5m) for losses on
the disposal of non-core businesses. Provisions for claims related to its
former asbestos activities amounted to Pounds 15.7m, up from Pounds 11.4m.
COMMENT
Mr Hope is making a virtue of necessity in saying that T&amp;N has been a yield
stock during its six-year transition from building materials to auto
engineering. The share price has run down from a peak of 308p in July 1987
to a third of that early this year. Meanwhile the shareholders have stumped
up for four rights issues. If a company has a really good investment story
to tell, it should not need to keep them sweet through the dividend. To be
fair to T&amp;N, the strategy was bound to be expensive and long-winded because
of the historic baggage, including the annual asbestosis drain. It now has
plenty of modernised capacity ready to take advantage of any upturn and able
to make a better profit even in flat markets. Pre-tax forecasts from Pounds
60m to Pounds 70m give a prospective p/e of 17. The big question revolves
around the dividend, uncovered for a second year. Doubts about its
maintenance and about the speed of recovery will probably knock the share
price down a step after the ex-dividend date on April 27.

British Gas Holdings (Canada) has reduced its stake in Consumers Gas of
Toronto to 85 per cent with the sale of 15 per cent of the shares. This is
in line with the undertakings given to the government of Ontario at the time
of the acquisition in 1990.
The 9.92m shares sold were priced at CDollars 17 each, payable in two
instalments of CDollars 9.50 now and CDollars 7.50 by April 1 1993. The
offer was over-subscribed and the closing price of the instalment receipt on
March 10 was CDollars 9.625.
British Gas bought Consumers Gas for CDollars 17.13 per share (equivalent to
CDollars 34.265 before a recent 2-for-1 share split).

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cost reductions and staff cuts offset lower
profitability at BTR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglom-erate, said the protracted recession in the UK's
construction and allied sectors had led last year to a loss of
profitability. However, the downturn had been mitigated by cost reductions.
BTR reduced its worldwide workforce of more than 100,000 by 10,700 during
1991.
In other sectors of the UK, despite intense pressure, cost savings had
ensured a performance close to or in some cases above that of 1990.
On mainland Europe, profitability was ahead, with a strong performance in
the industrial and transportation sectors offsetting weakness in consumer
markets.
The Americas had experienced difficult trading conditions and there had been
weakness in many of the group's markets. However, the businesses in sealing,
valves and baggage handling had all produced excellent results.
Results from Africa were affected by a poorer tyre market in South Africa
and generally by the weakness of local exchange rates when converted to
sterling.
BTR said: 'Overall we believe that our world spread will gain us the
benefits of any economic improvement wherever it occurs. A more general
recovery, however modest, will yield immediate and substantial gains.'
As announced at the interim stage, BTR's results now include a corporate
activities business segment, which includes profits from disposals. Last
year's gain of Pounds 103m (Pounds 29m) came mainly from the disposal of its
Pretty Polly hosiery business.
BTR said it made important acquisitions in its global packaging business
during 1991. Its purchase of the US-based Continental PET in January, with
its advanced plastic packaging technology, had opened this process for
worldwide development within the group's packaging business.
The acquisition of Smorgon glass in July had reinforced the group's position
in Australasia.
It said the purchase of Rockware, Britain's biggest manufacturer of glass
containers, for Pounds 197.2m in September had gained the group a
considerable presence in European glass packaging and would significantly
enhance the global transfer of technology in this sector.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Former Davy holders warned on payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the cons-truction and shipping conglomerate, yesterday
warned former shareholders in Davy Corporation that they were no closer to
getting their second payment, totalling Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, despite
a recent favourable ruling in the High Court, writes Roland Rudd.
The warning comes as it was revealed that the conglomerate is considering
leasing the Ocean Emerald oil rig to Midland and Scottish Resources.
Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chairman, in a letter to former Davy
shareholders, said 'it still seems unlikely' that the necessary conditions
would be in place enabling them to get their second payment.
Former shareholders in Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar took over last
June, expected to get their second payment, after the conglomerate won an
important ruling in its battle with MSR over payment for the Ocean Emerald.
The ruling stipulated that Trafalgar could keep control of the rig until it
was able to draw upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit with the project's
bankers or it was paid in full by MSR.
If Trafalgar leases the rig to the MSR, it may improve the chances of
drawing the letter of credit. However, Sir Eric has warned that the second
payment could still be a long way off since it might not be able to draw on
the letter of credit because of MSR's refinancing of the contract.
The Takeover Panel yesterday announced that the statements made by Trafalgar
relating to the second payment in its original offer document for Davy did
not create a misleading impression.
However, it added that Trafalgar had a 'continuing obligation to use all
reasonable endeavours to obtain payment' so former Davy holders could
receive their second payment.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Willis held to Pounds 96.1m by soft US
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING SOFTNESS in the US insurance market pegged back profits growth at
Willis Corroon, the international insurance broker.
Yesterday it posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 96.1m (Pounds 81.7m) for 1991,
its first full year since the merger in October 1990 of Willis Faber of the
UK and Corroon &amp; Black of the US, but earnings per share fell to 15.8p
(18.9p).
Operating revenues grew by 7 per cent in underlying terms to Pounds 653.6m,
while operating expenses rose to Pounds 525.6m, an underlying growth of 4
per cent, after taking into account the cost of a series of European
acquisitions which were funded from current revenues.
Willis was also hit by a weakening in the US dollar, based on an average
rate (after hedging) of Pounds 1 equalling Dollars 1.67 (Dollars 1.63 in
1991).
Lower interest rates helped reduce interest and investment income to Pounds
68.3m (Pounds 75.2m). Underwriting claims fell to Pounds 33m (Pounds 49.2m),
leaving operating profits of Pounds 95m (Pounds 83m). Pre-tax profits were
struck after the share of profits from associated undertakings of Pounds 5m
(Pounds 5.1m) and interest payable of Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 6.4m).
Distributable profits were reduced by an extraordinary item of Pounds 7.8m,
less than the market had feared despite the establishment of a hefty Pounds
55m, or Pounds 37.1m after tax, provision to pay for liabilities left by the
non-marine business of Sovereign, the London market underwriting subsidiary
which Willis has been unable to dispose of completely.
The provision, which is needed to pay for long-tail liability claims and
run-off spiral reinsurance business, is worse than feared but its impact has
been offset by the release of a Pounds 29.3m tax provision made after the
disposal in 1989 of its interest in Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and
proceeds from the sale of a 20 per cent stake in a Canadian subsidiary.
COMMENT
The fortunes of Willis Corroon, like those of Sedgwick, its main UK rival,
are heavily influenced by the state of the US insurance market, which
accounts for more than 50 per cent of the company's income. Outside some
specialist areas, such as energy and directors' and officers' liability,
premium rates remain depressed. Certainly no upturn is expected this year,
which, overall, Mr Roger Elliott, chairman, expects to be just as tough as
1991. Pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 100m - which would involve no rise
in real terms - would give earnings per share of about 16p, placing the
shares on a prospective multiple of 15.5 at yesterday's closing price of
247p. That might seem a touch expensive, but it is a little lower than last
year's average for the sector. And, unless the US market remains
semi-permanently depressed, Willis must be considered a good bet for the
long term.

FT  12 MAR 92 / BTR cuts staff at Hawker Siddeley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, has started to cut significantly the
workforce of Hawker Siddeley, the British engineering group which it won in
a Pounds 1.55bn takeover last November.
Hawker employed 42,000 at the time of the takeover, in 100 operating units,
and BTR said yesterday it would ultimately reduce the workforce by between
10 and 15 per cent in view of the drop in demand caused by recession.
However, BTR is bullish about the prospects for Hawker and remains confident
that the purchase will not dilute its earnings this year.
Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said: 'Hawker really does look a very good
acquisition. Some of these businesses are very good and have exceeded our
expectations.'
BTR reported a 3 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 917m in the year
to December 31 on flat sales of Pounds 6.74bn. It said the results confirmed
the group's resilience through the worst world economic conditions for
almost half a century. BTR shares closed 13p lower at 386p.
Earnings per share rose 2.3 per cent to 31.5p from 30.8p, mainly because a
41 per cent drop in net profits from BTR Nylex, its Australian subsidiary,
reduced the payment to minority interests from Pounds 154m to Pounds 100m.
The Hawker acquisition helped push up group gearing from 41 per cent to 89
per cent at the year end, with a total goodwill write-off of Pounds 1.2bn on
acquisitions. Mr Jackson said this was expected, but reducing indebtedness
would be the group's priority this year.
BTR said the gearing figure should be viewed against its strong trading cash
flow generation of Pounds 1bn last year and interest cover of 8.3 times.
Mr Jackson will make some disposals this year, but BTR is now thinking of
holding on to more than the 80 per cent of Hawker which it intended to keep
during the bid.
The group said it had responded to the second year of recession in most of
its major markets by taking vigorous action to reduce costs.
Efficiency savings had added about Pounds 70m to profits. However, these had
not been sufficient to offset the effects of real volume declines in most
markets and the costs of rationalisations and redundancies of Pounds 56m (up
from Pounds 31m), charged to trading results.
A final dividend of 9p compared with 8.75p gives a total for the year of
16.5p against 15.75p, an increase of 4.8 per cent. Dividend cover by
earnings drops from 2 to 1.9 times.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Alliance &amp; Leicester profits hurt by commercial loan losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY losses on commercial lending helped halve 1991 pre-tax profits at
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the third largest UK building society.
Its performance - pre-tax profits of Pounds 99.5m for the year to December
31 were down from Pounds 198.6m - is likely to be the worst of any leading
building society, with the possible exception of Nationwide.
Mr Peter White, the society's new chief executive, said yesterday he had
drawn up a three-year reconstruction plan following the results, which he
said were disappointing.
'We have made realistic provisions and we are now emphasising the quality of
our lending and building up balance sheet strength and containing our costs,
and look forward to renewed profit growth in 1992,' Mr White said.
Prospects of Alliance &amp; Leicester following Abbey National to the market
with a flotation have had to be deferred indefinitely. Until these results,
it seemed likely the society would be floated on the stock exchange within
two years.
There was a Pounds 215m charge for bad debts. Of this, Pounds 140m came from
commercial lending to hotels, nursing homes, and house building operations.
Total provisions were Pounds 251.6m at the end of the year, up from Pounds
104.4m.
The society withdrew from new lending to this sector more than a year ago
and commercial lending now makes up only 4.5 per cent of its portfolio,
compared with 6.3 per cent a year ago.
Residential mortgage business shrank by 17 per cent from Pounds 3.3bn in
1990 to Pounds 2.74bn. The society's 95-branch estate agency operation lost
Pounds 7.8m, down from losses of Pounds 9.7m in 1990.
Girobank, the banking arm of the Post Office which the society bought two
years ago, contributed profits of Pounds 48.8m but this included exceptional
profits of Pounds 9m from reduced expenses and Pounds 4m from the sale of
its gilt portfolio.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Gillette given six months to divest Eemland interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILLETTE, the razor group, was yesterday given just over six months by the
government to dispose of its shareholding in and loan to Eemland, parent
company of Wilkinson Sword, its main rival in the UK wet shaving products
market.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said he had decided to make
an order under the Fair Trading Act forcing Gillette to divest, following
advice from Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, that he had
failed to negotiate an undertaking from the company to divest its interests
in Eemland (formerly known as Swedish Match).
Sir Gordon had been negotiating with Gillette at the request of the trade
and industry secretary after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled
last year that a financial link between the two companies could work against
the public interest.
Gillette lent Dollars 69m (Pounds 40.35m) to a buy-out of the consumer
products division of Stora, the Swedish paper and forestry group, which
formed Swedish Match and took a 22 per cent stake through non-voting shares.
Gillette has always disputed the MMC's findings maintaining that its
interest in Eemland did not give it any influence over Wilkinson Sword.
However, Gillette has the right to prevent shareholders selling stakes to
other companies, and to turn its stake into ordinary voting shares which
could give it management control.
An Eemland spokesman said the group would not be affected by the MMC's
decision. The Dollars 69m mezzanine finance arranged with Gillette did not
allow for the loan to be called in before it falls due. 'Our obligations
under that finance will be the same whoever holds it,' he said.
The disposal of Gillette's 22 per cent non-voting stake would also have
little effect on Wilkinson. 'Gillette has been a passive, sleeping . . .
shareholder,' he said.
Gillette has spent the past two years trying to convince competition
authorities that its involvement in the deal did not damage competition.
The transaction has been investigated by authorities in the US, Canada,
France and Germany as well as by the European Commission in Brussels.
If Gillette refuses to divest at the end of the six-month period the trade
and industry secretary would have to seek a High Court injunction enforcing
the order.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Standard Chartered advances 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the inter- national bank headquartered in the UK,
yesterday announced a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
205m, bucking the trend of poor results which have been announced by most UK
banks.
'It is good to be able to build the business, rather than fighting to stem
the decline, as we were a year ago,' commented Mr Malcolm Williamson,
managing director.
The core of Standard's operations is in the Asia Pacific region and its Hong
Kong bank is particularly important. Trading profits from this region were
Pounds 184m, 20 per cent higher than in the previous year.
However, Mr Williamson said the trend to interest rates in Hong Kong was
particularly favourable and he did not expect the exceptionally wide spread
between the local borrowing and lending rates to be sustained over the
longer term.
There was also a sharp rise, from Pounds 24m to Pounds 38m, in profits
earned in the Middle East and South Asia.
However, operations in Australia and the US were lossmaking. A sharp rise in
the charge for possible losses on UK loans, from Pounds 107.8m to Pounds
130.2m, meant that UK and European businesses made a trading loss of Pounds
46.5m, compared with a profit of Pounds 19.3m in 1990.
Most of the UK bad debt charge - between Pounds 70m and Pounds 80m - relates
to Standard's exposure to Brent Walker, the leisure company undergoing a
financial reconstruction.
Analysts were generally impressed by the banks' performance. 'Compared to
the directors of many other UK banks, Standard's management is able to
project a remarkably credible business strategy,' said a leading broker.
Standard maintained its full-year dividend of 20p, which is covered more
than twice by per share earnings of 44.3p, up from 13p in the previous year.
This ratio of Standard's earnings to dividends is far higher than most other
UK banks'.
On this measure, Standard had scope to increase its dividend. However, Mr
Rodney Galpin, chairman, said it was more important for Standard to build up
its equity base by retaining profits rather than distributing in the form of
dividends.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Hillsdown edges down after poultry and egg division slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HALVING of profits from its poultry and egg division caused a slight fall
in annual profits at Hillsdown Holdings, the food-processing group. Pre-tax
profits for 1991 were 2.3 per cent lower at Pounds 186.8m.
However, the result was slightly above expectations and a 10 per cent
increase in the dividend helped the shares to rise 3p to 172p in spite of
the weak stockmarket. The group's share price has been under a cloud since a
Pounds 280.7m rights issue at 210p flopped last autumn.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell 13.5 per cent to 21.1p compared with
24.4p adjusted for the rights issue.
Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said that aside from poultry, where operating
profits fell from Pounds 59.4m to Pounds 26.3m, all the group's food
businesses 'met or exceeded our expectations in 1991'. He said 84 per cent
of operating profits now came from food.
Mr David Newton, group chief operating officer, said the company was working
on the integration of Hillsdown's poultry business and that of JP Wood,
acquired in February from Unigate for Pounds 36.7m.
Sir Harry said that the JP Wood deal was an example of the group's strategy
of using bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen the core businesses.
Meanwhile, Hillsdown was selling its peripheral activities, such as ice
cream and petfoods, in food, and it planned a flotation of Fairview, the
housebuilding subsidiary, when market conditions allowed.
The non-food activities, which include furniture, housebuilding and
property, had 'maintained profitability' in 1991 he said.
The results of Maple Leaf Foods, Hillsdown's 56 per cent owned Canadian
subsidiary, were also announced. Net earnings for 1991 were CDollars 67.2m,
(Pounds 32m) up from CDollars 41.1m. Maple Leaf said it was planning a joint
venture with ConAgra, the large US food group, in flour milling.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: Purcell enters political arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Labour party spokesman who recently described John Major's new
signature tune as suitable only 'for wine bars' writes off the music of
Britain's greatest composer in one remarkably ill-judged phrase.
After 10 intensive years recording and performing Purcell's music, I find it
gratifying finally to find his name on everybody's lips and making headline
news for the first time since the composer's early demise in 1695.
The Labour spokesman may be a Philistine (or just a closet Haydn buff?) but
might now ruefully consider Purcell's verse anthem 'Be merciful unto me' or
even the song of 1678 'Sweet Tyranness, I now resign'.
A smarting Purcell would probably look to the anthem written two years later
and entitled 'Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes', whilst an internal Labour
party enquiry could examine the Ode of 1682 - 'What shall be done in behalf
of the man?'

FT  12 MAR 92 / Banking on mistrust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have to shake your head in disbelief. Britain's 14th general election
since 1945 is being called at a most inauspicious time for his party by a
prime minister whose personal future depends on the outcome. The omens are
not so bad as to characterise yesterday's decision by Mr John Major as
political suicide, but the ineluctable choice of April 9 does fall between
bravado and foolhardiness.
There must be an explanation somewhere - beyond desperation, that is. Over
the past few months I have asked various members of the cabinet two
questions: 'why should the Conservatives be given a fourth term, something
the British electorate is accustomed to denying any party that asks for it?'
and, when that is answered (never quite satisfactorily), 'why should anyone
think you will win?'
The replies to the first question are unsurprising. Under Mrs Margaret
Thatcher the Tories put the trade unions in their place, privatised
previously unsound publicly owned enterprises, and instilled the concept of
prudent financial management into the national psyche. Under Mr John Major
they have secured our position in the European Community and, most
forcefully, brought inflation down to near-German levels. So they surely
deserve another term.
The natural riposte is that in the process they have plunged the country
into a long recession with no known end in sight, raised public borrowing to
a potentially frightening level, and failed to develop the public
infrastructure. That is, however, to carp. Let us be kind enough to address
ourselves solely to the ministers' basic case. Even if we swallow it whole,
it refers to past performance. A past, good or bad, is something that has
come to an end, after which the rascals are thrown out.
As to the future, the manifesto to be approved by the cabinet this afternoon
will have much to say about choice, freedom, caring Conservatism, the
citizens' charter, and other familiar abstractions. This will be interlaced
with a possibly surprising fistful of specific promises, from a national
lottery to an undertaking to be more liberal in the dispersal of government
information. The supplementary to the first question will therefore be:
'does the answer add up to very much?'
We must wait a few days. So try, then, the second question - 'why should
anyone think you will win?' The polls suggest that there will be a hung
parliament, which in most combinations means that the Tories have lost. Not
so, says the cabinet collective. There will be no hung parliament. The party
chairman, Mr Christopher Patten, has convinced himself and apparently the
prime minister that if the parties are neck and neck on April 9 the
Conservatives will Nobody stood up
to shout: 'You're
crazy - it'll be
the end of us all'
survive to celebrate an outright victory. They affect to believe that they
are ahead on the technicalities. These are: regional swings that favour the
government, strong support for the Tories in key marginal constituencies,
and the propensity of voters to support incumbent MPs, most of whom are by
definition Conservatives.
At yesterday's meeting of the cabinet one minister said that all the media
would be interested in during the campaign would be the state of the polls
and the likely behaviour of the prime minister if he lost his majority. So
they agreed that they would decline to discuss either of these matters. But
everyone knows what they think. The party with the largest number of seats
will form the government. It will survive. That, they say with all the
confidence of lambs en route to the slaughterhouse, will surely be the
Conservative party. Anyhow, said another after yesterday's announcement, the
Tories would do what the prime minister said they would do about Scotland
after the election - consider the situation then and take stock.
These thoughts must have been in ministers' minds as Mr Major suggested that
April 9 would be a fine day for an election and asked if everyone agreed.
Nobody stood up to shout: 'You're crazy - it'll be the end of us all.'
Someone did remark that to hang on for a later date would attract greater
opprobrium than hopes of recovery would be worth. So, crossing their fingers
and placing their faith in Mr Patten and his psephological witchdoctors,
they blessed their chief's brave endeavour.
If my tone suggests that I believe it to be foredoomed, it is a shade too
sceptical. Dangerous, yes. Certain to fail - not quite. For I have not yet
accounted for what, in their heart of hearts, the Conservatives believe to
be their strongest card - mistrust of the Labour party. The Tories will
emphasise the contrast between the past pronouncements of Mr Neil Kinnock
and his present professed beliefs, always treading a delicate line between
legitimate reminders of what their opponent-in-chief once said and the
appearance of running a smear campaign.
This is reasonable enough. The Labour party has undergone a remarkable and,
in historic terms, exceedingly rapid, conversion. The voters would have to
take the huge risk of putting it into power before its sincerity could be
tested. We may therefore put to Labour the reverse of the question asked of
the Tories - that is: 'why should the electorate trust you?'
If we are to entrust Mr Kinnock and his colleagues with better management of
the market economy than the Conservatives we will want to see a manifesto
that is wholly convincing. It must be less regulatory, less interlaced with
goodies for the public sector unions, less anti-wealth than any previous
statement of Labour intent. As to the party's programme for constitutional
reform, it is hard not to be cynical. Are they saying these things for love
of freedom, or fear of the Scottish nationalists? For the sake of democracy,
or merely to seduce votes away from the Liberal Democrats?
In short, the April 9 question will be: who do you disbelieve the most?

<TEXT>
Sir, Whilst I congratulate your paper for compiling the FT Schools 500
tables (March 7/8), parents should draw conclusions from them with care.
My eldest daughter failed to get into two schools in your top 20, so we sent
her to Stowe, number 271. She graduated from Warwick University last year
with a 2:1.
My youngest daughter failed her 11-plus so she wouldn't have qualified for
entrance to any of the high-flying schools you list.
From Stowe, having gained entrance to Exeter University in the face of acute
competition, she is now well on her way to gaining combined honours in Drama
and English.
Academic success is relatively easy to come by if you manage to cream off
the brightest children and many of the best performing schools in your lists
do just that.
However, the real test of a school is to develop character and to encourage
average children to perform well. That cannot be measured in your guide.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: There is no 'half-way house' for eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Eastern Europe's reforms have not been too harsh. Your article 'The
drawbacks of shock therapy' (March 2) gives the impression that better
options were not chosen. Few of the reforms could have been applied
moderately.
Price liberalisation. There is no 'half-way house'. Partial reform fails to
stabilise markets.
Budget reform. Uncontrolled budget deficits cause inflation, risk
hyperinflation, and have to be addressed. Contrary to the impression your
article creates, there has been a great industrial recession in Hungary, for
the same reasons as elsewhere.
Industrial restructuring. Politicians in eastern Europe would be very
interested in western-financed modernisation and investment to help
industry. There is no alternative in eastern Europe because governments have
no money to pay for gentler forms of industrial policy, not because
political leaders there chose austerity from a range of other policy
options.
Trade liberalisation. There are costs from surging imports, but also many
benefits, including: demonstration effects - better local enterprises are
learning to compete against the standards set by imports; modernisation -
because imports are freely available, institutions can buy world-class
technology at reasonable prices; and psychological - being able to buy
things without queueing removes the atmosphere of a defective economy as
well as the inefficiency of having to go to Berlin or Vienna simply to shop.
The lesson of Europe's post-war experience is not clearly against rapid
economic liberalisation.
Ludwig Erhard's 'bonfire of controls' in Germany in 1948 was a principal
reason for their subsequent success.
The centrally planned economies were in appalling condition - even East
Germany collapsed, despite West German resources and by the far the best
prospects for future growth. Everyone knew that the going would be tough.
It is mendacious for economists and commentators who failed to understand
the awfulness of the old system to place the responsibility for economic
catastrophe on market reformers.
Mr Gorbachev messed around with half-hearted reform for five wasted years,
and his successors now have to embark on the same road as the others.

Sir, Observer's report (March 2) of a petition to wind up the Pru makes me
wonder why this action is not more often taken against big companies. It is
invariably effective if money is owing, the company has the means to pay,
and does not wish to be wound up.
I present seminars on effective credit control and it is depressing to hear
complaints from small companies about the payment standards of some large
companies. Time and again the same names are mentioned (though Prudential is
not one of those, and, as far as I know, has a good record).
The chances of future business may be next to zero, but it is often worth
considering.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: Britain's accountants display unique range of
background disciplines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN R MCNEIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter McGregor ('Britain's narrowly educated accountants trail the
international field', Letters, March 9) claims that accountants in Britain
are less well educated than elsewhere. His claim is based not on their
professional training, but on their secondary and higher education being too
little or too narrow. However, statistics for chartered accountants suggest
otherwise.
Since 1984, 90 per cent of our student entrants have been graduates, and in
the most recent intakes, 55 per cent of those graduates had upper second or
first-class honours degrees. Their degrees cover a wide range of
disciplines. Far from giving up science subjects at about 14, as Mr McGregor
maintains, more than 30 per cent have degrees in sciences, mathematics and
engineering. Slightly less than 50 per cent have business degrees.
Many of our firms' recruiters deliberately seek broadly educated students,
whereas for accountants overseas, for example in Germany, Australia and the
US, the rigid pattern is for accountants first to take an accountancy degree
and only then to go on to professional training.
Perhaps as a consequence of the more broadly based British system,
accountancy is one of the few sectors of our economy in which we are
world-beaters.
I certainly believe that other sectors have much to learn from the
commitment of British accountancy firms to investing heavily in the
professional training of their people.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Leading Article: An election that matters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS the most important British election since Mrs Thatcher won power in
1979; it is the least important. Both cases can be powerfully put.
The strongest argument for the second point of view is that since elections
are largely about economic wellbeing and there is a consensus upon the
largest macroeconomic questions, there is little to choose between the main
parties, other than personalities.
This scramble for the commanding centre ground of British politics was
reinforced this week by a clothes-stealing budget and is underpinned by
other, stronger forces: Britain's diminishing independent role in world
affairs and a continuing erosion of class identities, to name the two most
obvious.
To conclude from this, however, that the contest is only about nuances would
be wrong. The fact that the mainstream political debate in Britain no longer
encompasses unilateral nuclear disarmers, EC quitters or unreconstructed
Keynesian or monetarist economists makes the election harder to read and
closer to call than any since 1974, but it does not make it unimportant.
Anyone who cares about Britain's future should be glad that the political
debate is being conducted within sensible parameters; the justification for
political extremism was extreme problems. Thanks to Margaret Thatcher,
Britain is a more competitive, realistic place. No party proposes to cast
aside her main achievements of a reduced state and a contained trade union
movement, although there are grounds for asking how Labour's instincts on
these matters would develop once its ministers had settled into the seat of
power.
Interesting terrain
But the most interesting terrain in this election is that which neither
Thatcherism nor old-style Labour socialism has been able to cultivate
successfully, namely those public services upon which a modern economy is
heavily dependent. These include a disastrous secondary education system;
local government, which has lost its independent fiscal base and its sense
of purpose; and a labour market, battered by legal change and economic boom
and bust, still failing to train enough skilled workers.
The common theme here and in other areas, from health to the regulation of
utilities, is broadly that of governance. To whom are teachers responsible
for their performance? Boards of governors, local education authorities or
directly to the education secretary? What do we think local government is
for: an agency for delivering central government programmes or an expression
of democratically accountable civic will? Can training be left safely to
quangos, whose membership is settled in Whitehall and whose overall
accountability is vague, but in effect directly to the employment secretary?
On all sides there is an urgent need for stable, efficient policy delivery
mechanisms, locally accountable and unbeholden to producer interests.
Neither citizen's charters, nor direct labour organisations will do the
trick.
Difficult issues
These are deeply difficult issues for a society divided for so long along
the socialist-conservative faultline. For all the turmoil of recent years,
Britain still lacks a lively, imaginative politics of the centre, capable of
resolving such matters in a way that commands the widespread confidence that
leads to institutional stability.
Happily, pressures are at work in British politics which should assist this
process of change. The re-shaping of Westminster in the light of EC
developments is one force; Celtic devolutionists are another. Both these
pressures are reflected in a constitutional debate certain to be prominent
in a campaign everyone knows could lead to a coalition government.
It is not that regional devolution and proportional representation can
themselves solve Britain's problems; more that the processes involved offer
the best hope of the sort of true consensus-building needed for Britain to
re-discover stable and accountable institutions. An elective dictatorship in
London is incapable of imagining what is needed, let alone delivering.
The governance question, of course, is not confined to these matters in this
election. It must also be asked: if the Conservatives win, will Labour
self-destruct in a way which yields semi-permanent Tory government enlivened
only by factionalism, as in Japan? If Labour wins, will it seek allies in
Europe for a centralising, interventionist pan-European state?
This may not be so much fun as the old Punch and Judy show. It is less clear
when to hiss and when to cheer. But they are issues the parties must address
in their manifestos and on the hustings. Then the people can decide.

with no humps is called Humphrey. That's the name for a camel with three
humps, snorts reader Peter Tray, the no-humped variety being obviously a
horse designed by a committee.
R S Bristowe of Sheffield disagrees. In his book, the name for a
three-humped camel is Triumph.

Things are looking up for Richard Stein, finance director of Standard
Chartered Bank. Yesterday he was able to announce financial results which in
most respects were superior to those of the English clearers - it is some
time since that has been the case.
But an even greater boost to his esteem is that, for the first time in his
career, someone has considered his signature worthy of forgery - though not
very well by all accounts. The Dollars 500m fraud attempt had no chance of
success. Anyone with any knowledge of the bank would have known that as
finance director he never signs loan documents.
However, this is by no means the most audacious attempt at fraud ever faced
by the bank. A while ago in the Middle East, the bank had an illiterate
customer who signed with a thumb print. A criminal, now in gaol, tried to
forge the signature - but used a big-toe print instead.
Caught on the hop?

'Grubby, filthy and downright dirty' runs the teaser advertising campaign
for Lever Brothers' latest liquid detergent which will be launched on 'Blue
Nose Day' in less than a fortnight's time. Rarely have truer words been
spoken.
The campaign, which appears on the sides of thousands of buses, bears a
remarkable similarity to the Comic Relief charity's 'Red Nose' day which is
normally held at this time of year. The only difference is that Comic Relief
is taking a rest this year. No doubt a court of law can tell the difference
between a 'red' and 'blue' nose day. But the idea seems to be piggy-backing
on the general enthusiasm for a worthwhile charity and Comic Relief says it
has been deluged with calls from eager young volunteers.
It's not the sort of behaviour one would expect from a company which likes
to think of itself as one of the country's most squeaky clean corporate
citizens.

Meanwhile, don't expect any help from UK government departments on even the
smallest detail of policy for the next few weeks. Observer twice contacted
the Lord Chancellor's office yesterday for information on planned changes in
the small claims court procedures announced in the Budget.
Help was readily given in the morning. But after lunch, and John Major's
election announcement, the office declared it could henceforth make no
comment on government policy.
The Inland Revenue, perhaps understandably, was still faster to start
pushing the chancellor of the exchequer's proposals back into the purdah
whence they came. Warnings of the likely cancellation of its post-Budget
briefing, scheduled for this morning, were emanating from it on Tuesday even
before Lamont spoke.

Judging by yesterday's movement, the stock market seems to have made up its
mind that the government has muffed the Budget and lost the next election
already.
However, the reaction could be premature if Kleinwort Benson's historical
election statistics are any guide. In the 13 elections since 1945, the FT's
All Share index has risen on average by 1.4 per cent between the
announcement of the general election and polling day. On the six occasions
that Labour has won, it has fallen by an average of 0.1 per cent.
Admittedly, the average fall the day after a Labour victory is 2.6 per cent.
But don't despair. Twelve months after a Labour victory the stock market has
risen by an average 14.4 per cent, or nearly four times more than after a
Tory win.

Oh dear] While Prime Minister Major and Chancellor Kohl may be the best of
pals at present, there are already omens that Anglo-German accord may not
survive Britain's election campaign.
Norman Lamont's statement in his budget speech that Germany's economy was in
'recession', provoked the German embassy in London into sending a swift and
critical report back to Bonn. The use of that word, the message said, was
calculated to give British voters the impression that the UK's economic
troubles are somehow all Germany's fault.
By the Anglo-Saxon definition, 'recession' is justified since Germany has
had two successive quarters of negative growth. But the R-word is too strong
for the German government, which points out that its economy is still
expanding on a year-on-year basis, albeit at a slower rate.
The Kiel economics institute, for instance, has just forecast that this
year's growth will be 1 per cent. Moreover Bundesbank council-member Karl
Thomas pointedly declared in London yesterday that he prefers the word
'stagnation'.
What Lamont might do well to consider is that, the more he irritates the
Germans, the less sympathy he is likely to win for Britain's bid to have the
European central bank housed in London, or more importantly for a cut in
interest rates.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Overkill in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER financial scandal in Japan is not, at first glance, the kind of
thing to set the gaijin pulse racing. It looks suspiciously like the modern
equivalent of the old newspaper headline about a small earthquake in Chile.
At second glance, the news that the president of Daiwa Securities, Japan's
second largest securities house, has been forced to resign looks more
disturbing - and not simply because the losses that precipitated the
resignation, equivalent to more than half a billion dollars, look
vertiginous.
When a stock market falls by more than 40 per cent after a period of
monetary excess, it is inevitable that the misdemeanours of the easy money
period will be exposed. In a country where corrupt money politics has long
been endemic it is also likely that senior politicians will be touched by
the resulting scandals. But the cumulative impact of all these murky
revelations from Japan makes it harder and harder to contain the fall-out.
The unique feature of the Japanese political and economic structure is the
role that consensus has traditionally played in the decision-making process.
The scandal at Daiwa is just the latest manifestation of the way in which
the pricking of the 1980s asset price bubble has undermined many of the
subtle trade-offs and unwritten checks and balances that constituted the
mechanics of the consensual process.
Somebody in the system has to take the losses that stem from the collapse of
the stock market; nobody wants to honour the guarantees, unwritten or
otherwise, that securities firms offered to their clients against falling
share prices during the boom, because the sums are too large. So executives
at Daiwa, and no doubt elsewhere, shunted the losses between client accounts
with different book closing dates, in the hope that share prices would
recover before the innocent victims discovered that they had been saddled
with other people's losses.
When the music stopped, the victims chose to sue and the verdict proved
expensive for Daiwa.
Similar problems now infect the wider political and economic fabric. In
monetary policy the Bank of Japan theoretically enjoys independence. Yet its
freedom of manoeuvre was constrained, in the past, by the mutual
understandings that have governed the workings of the bureaucratic and
political establishment.
Not so today. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa is a lame duck prime minister, having
suffered from both the Recruit Cosmos scandal and the Kyowa bribery affair,
and he is surrounded by tainted acolytes. The squeaky-clean head of the Bank
of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno, has seized the opportunity to strengthen his
fiefdom. He has ignored recent calls from politicians for lower interest
rates.
The result is monetary overkill at a time when there is a huge debt
overhang, the banking system is weak and the great locomotive of Japanese
growth in the late 1980s, industrial investment, has ground to a halt. While
the establishment consensus remains modestly optimistic about growth, both
the official statistics and the quarterly Tankan business survey suggest
that Japan could well be heading for the worst recession since 1974. For the
rest of the world such stringency on the part of the world's biggest
creditor country implies downward pressure on asset prices, whether of US
Treasury bonds, diamonds or Impressionist paintings, and mounting trade
friction as the Japanese current account surplus soars.
It is time for Mr Mieno to declare victory in his bureaucratic battle and to
address the real problem. What price autonomy, if the economy sinks?

the pilot, a one-off comedy from a seven-part Barker showcase. Fletch is on
his way to gaol, accompanied by martinet Mackay and softie Barrowclough. One
of the best things about Porridge was that it was not a domestic sitcom.
Nor is Red Dwarf V (9.00 BBC2) which is, of course, set in a spacecraft

those addicted to Falklands War programmes who feel in need of a fix BBC2
starts yet another series: War Stories (9.30) which begins with the views of
Nick Barker, who was captain of HMS Endurance.
The bonk rate in The Camomile Lawn goes up considerably and there is even an

Businesses that produce reports in different languages are obvious
candidates for machine translation. But so far, real cost savings have been
elusive, partly because the available systems only do part of the job.
Considerable work is still needed to finalise the text in a specific
language.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Swiss subsidiary produces financial and market reports in
English, French, German and Italian. It used to pay out large sums to human
translators.
Of 75,000 reports sent to customers each year, 17.2 per cent required
translation. This cost the subsidiary SFr 230,000 (Pounds 88,000) a year.
Now the company has computerised the translation. Apart from eliminating the
cost, it means all reports are delivered quickly whether or not they've been
translated.
Some organisations, including the European Commission, use machine-assisted
translation in which computers produce a draft of the document in the target
language. This is cleaned up to produce the final document.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet Switzerland has managed to avoid the cleaning-up process.
Rather than translating grammar, the company constructed tables of stock
phrases and words that are required in finished reports.
By using only these expressions it is possible to make translations that are
entirely accurate.
This approach at first drew criticism from the company's competitors, who
claimed it would make the reports too standardised with no freedom of
self-expression for the writers. More important, it was resisted from within
the company. 'We lost the people who wouldn't work with it,' admits Adrian
Ashurst, managing director.
But customers reacted favourably because they were receiving the same
product more quickly and cheaply. Some even preferred the new type of
document because it was more consistent. The whole system cost the company
SFr250,000.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Technology: Multilinguals on the open road - As Europe's
single market approaches, Della Bradshaw examines systems that translate
documents into several languages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In less than 10 months' time there will be a single European market: but
there will not be a single European language. As a result manufacturers
wanting to sell their wares across boundaries will be forced to translate
their product information.
Ahead of the pack, Xerox, the US electronics company, has long translated
its technical documentation for use in Europe. Although translation services
have traditionally been a cottage industry, Rank Xerox turned to computer
technology for assistance.
Machines at Rank Xerox in the UK now translate 10,000 pages a year from
English into 10 European languages. Mike Scott, of Rank Xerox's Language
Technology Centre, believes the machines can at least halve the time it
takes to complete the task.
As pressure on manufacturers to reduce product lead times increases,
computers are proving ever more valuable, says Alan Portela, vice president
of marketing for Systran, of La Jolla, California. 'Today large corporations
that have to translate huge manuals in a short time have only one option -
machine translation.'
Manufacturers emphasise that time savings can only be achieved if the text
follows a narrowly-defined format. 'The system can only translate what has
been stated in a sentence, not what could possibly have been meant,' says
Thomas Schneider, manager in charge of linguistics and terminology at
Siemens-Nixdorf, in Munich.
This means the systems are best suited to the translation of instruction and
maintenance manuals, where the documentation is bulky but where clarity of
expression rather than elegance of phrase is required. 'They are designed to
work on logical English - not poetry,' says Phil Wrenn, senior applications
engineer at Intergraph, the US computer group.
Nevertheless, different types of translation machines are suited to
different types of text. Machines fall into three types:
Batch systems, where a document is fed into the computer in one language and
emerges in a second language. The Systran and Siemens-Nixdorf machines fall
into this category.
Computer-assisted, or interactive, systems where the text is translated a
sentence at a time, and constantly checked by a human translator. If the
computer cannot find a word in the dictionary, then it will stop and prompt
the translator to help.
Computerised dictionaries, which are used as an aid by translators. Although
not as sophisticated as the first two, these dictionaries ensure that
several translators working on a single text use consistent terminology.
Batch systems are most effective for technical literature and need three
types of dictionary, says Jane Mason, language technology consultant at the
Rank Xerox Language Technology Centre. These are a general dictionary -
English to French, for example; an industry dictionary for, say, the
pharmaceuticals industry; and one developed for the specific company.
Working on short, terse sentences - Mason recommends training the authors to
write text with translation in mind - the results can be extremely
effective. A human translator using a batch system could translate between
5,000 and 10,000 words a day. Most of the manual work would be at the
'post-editing' phase, once the machine had completed its task. A human
translator working alone could manage only 1,500 words a day.
However, if inadequate preparation is done, the results can be of little
use, says Scott. 'It's a one-shot system. If it has the wrong terminology it
would repeat the error over and over again. When it is below the 70 to 80
per cent correct level, you might as well translate it sentence by
sentence.'
By comparison, interactive systems enable a translator to handle between
2,000 and 4,000 words a day, but the advantage is that they can be used for
translating more general text - sales and marketing information, for
example.
Many large US companies, such as Eastman Kodak, General Motors and General
Dynamics already use machine translation systems. In Europe, companies have
been more hesitant, although the German software house Sap and the German
subsidiary of Philips are among several large companies that have taken the
plunge.
The European Commission, too, uses computer translation systems. It has also
begun a programme to develop its own system, Eurotra, which will handle nine
European languages. A small-scale prototype has been developed, says Sergei
Perschke, programme manager, which can handle scientific and technical
documentation. However, he reckons it will be a further 10 years before an
operational system can be produced.
'As far as the technology is concerned, the computers are quite
appropriate,' Perschke points out. 'The main problems are linguistic.'
Each language presents its own problems, says Schneider. English has a lot
of words such as 'back', which can be a noun, adjective or participle. In
German, on the other hand, words can have an almost free word order - with
the object at the beginning of the sentence or the subject at the end.
Recent years have seen a great improvement in the software. Whereas systems
used to translate a word at a time, they now work on phrases or whole
sentences, and relate one sentence back to another. So if the sentences 'The
cat sat on the mat. It drank a saucer of milk,' were translated, the
software would recognise that the 'It' of the second sentence referred to
the cat, not the mat.
Today's machines also incorporate artificial intelligence techniques. So the
Intergraph system teaches itself to recognise the words within the context
of the article it is reading, says Wrenn. The first time it translates a
document for a particular company or industry it will get only about 45 per
cent of the words correct. But learning from the corrections it will achieve
up to 95 per cent accuracy by the time the fourth or fifth document, on a
related topic, is translated.
On the document production side Systran, Siemens-Nixdorf and Intergraph have
all combined translation software with publishing software, so that a
document can be produced that incorporates both text and diagrams or
photographs.
Developments in computer hardware, particularly of smaller and more powerful
machines, have also benefited machine translation customers.
Intergraph, for example, has transferred its software from a Digital
Equipment Vax machine to workstations running under the Unix operating
system and Siemens-Nixdorf plans a similar move.
However, the fall in the price of hardware is unlikely to have a striking
impact on the price of the overall system, says Schneider, as the software
has proven so expensive to develop - in the case of Siemens-Nixdorf some
DM60m (Pounds 21m).
'If you look at the development costs, the software is dirt cheap to buy,'
says Schneider. A typical system with five workstations would cost DM
250,000.
This overhead means that only large users - those translating more than
2,000 pages a year - would benefit from buying their own equipment. But both
the larger translation agencies, and some of the manufacturers, offer
services for smaller companies.
Rank Xerox, for example, sells translation services through its Language
Translation Centre. Anyone with a 200-page document for translation would
find the service economical, says Scott.
In the US, Systran offers a range of services. Companies can even have
on-line access to the Systran database, to send their documentation over the
phone line for translation. This costs about Dollars 13 (Pounds 7.50) a page
and, says Portela, is suitable for companies that need between 50 and 100
pages a month translated.
Systran can also carry out the machine translation of a text and then send
it to a traditional translation agency to apply the post-editing polish. The
documents are then returned to the originating company in a camera-ready
form - photos and diagrams included - for printing. Portela estimates the
cost of this is about Dollars 25 a page. A traditional translator would
charge Dollars 50 a page.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Technology: Revolution at eastern banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EUGENE DAINOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western countries took 300 years to move through agricultural and industrial
revolutions to the information age of the 20th century. The east European
economies are having to do it in the space of a few years.
Nowhere does this apply more than to the banks. The potential for huge
turnover has not escaped the notice of the two credit and debit card
companies, Visa and Eurocard.
Electronic payments through point of sale (Pos) swipe card machines should
encourage foreign and local consumer spending through ease of payment, while
simplifying shops' accounting and reducing bank costs. Automated teller
machines (ATMs) will enable private banks to compete with the traditional
savings banks' large but inefficient branch networks.
The dilemma is how to automate, and there are two possibilities. Bankers can
invest now in systems designed to handle the expected explosion of growth in
card usage. This is the route favoured by Eurocard and the main large
software supplier, Base 24. Or they can start more modestly and invest in
smaller but possibly more flexible systems, as endorsed by Visa and the new
lower-cost technology suppliers, such as IFS International.
So far the banks have been divided on which route to take. In
Czechoslovakia, Muzo, the joint clearing and settlement company, has based
its ATM and Pos network on a Tandem computer and Base 24 software. Muzo's
first ATMs began operating last month and accept Eurocard/Mastercard and
local cards. It also plans to take Visa cards. The company says 500 ATMs
should be working by 1996.
Ceska Sporitelna AS (CSAS), the Czech savings bank, will be using a
Unix-based IFS system. The bank will have 10 ATMs linked through Unix to
Visanet, Visa's authorisation, clearing and settlement system.
Toby Mitchell, Visa's area manager for eastern Europe, thinks Eurocard and
its followers are over-optimistic about the short-term market for cards.
Among the issues are:
Low incomes, which will limit fee scales on cards.
Inadequate telecommunications - CSAS is having difficulty obtaining just 20
lines to run 10 ATMs.
Retailer resistance to Pos machines.
Starting costs are also a concern. Mitchell asserts that the combination of
Base 24 and a Tandem computer brings the price of hardware and software to
Dollars 1m (Pounds 500,000), compared with a Unix-based package starting at
Dollars 130,000.
John Bycroft, European area manager of Base 24, disputes this, saying that
the price for running five ATMs starts at around Dollars 200,000 and
expansion to 100 ATMs means spending just Dollars 40,000 more.
But cost is not the only factor. Charles Caserta, founder of IFS, says
Tandem's closed architecture ties banks to the original hardware and
software vendor. 'If Base 24 has 1m lines of code, mine has 30,000,' he
says. 'This is immeasurably easier to understand, modify and enhance'.
Base 24 argues that Unix users face exactly the same problem, because of the
variety of systems available.
Fault-tolerance capabilities - which provide an automatic back-up to every
part of the system, including telecommunications - form another contentious
topic, one which concerns the Giro Card Company, Hungary's equivalent to
Czechoslovakia's Muzo. It is considering Tandem equipment because it
believes the system's fault-tolerance capabilities are suitable for
international payment networks.
But Giro Card Company's projections of 200 ATMs in operation this year have
been delayed and there are difficulties in persuading retailers to accept
Pos. Moreover, a Tandem/Base 24 system can typically process around 20
transactions per second, but peak hour ATM transactions are expected to
reach only 0.36 per second in 1994, making its power largely redundant.
The Giro Card Company may have to invest in a cheaper package, says Edward
Collier, of management consultants Ernst &amp; Young. 'If you want to automate,
you need money,' he explains.

This would seem an odd moment for a company to double its expenditure on
advertising, with the industry in deep recession. Yet you would have to run
fast to keep up with what Reebok International is spending on marketing.
John Duerden, president and chief executive of the sports shoe company, has
set an advertising budget of Dollars 220m this year, almost twice as much as
last year.
Reebok has 26 per cent of the world market, worth some Dollars 24bn (Pounds
13.6bn), against Nike's 30 per cent. With its decision to increase its
advertising spending, a battle royal with Nike, rather like that between
Coke and Pepsi, is about to be joined.
The Reebok group first hit sales of Dollars 1bn in 1986 but in that year
spent only Dollars 11m on advertising. Last year, to support sales of
Dollars 2.7bn the company was spending 10 times as much on marketing.
Duerden is convinced that Reebok must think in global terms, and is
launching a worldwide campaign in August. The new slogan, 'The World's
Greatest Athletes Wear Reeboks', will be backed by two American Olympic
decathletes.
Though not an official Barcelona Olympics' sponsor, Reebok will be sole
sponsor of the NBC network coverage of the games. US Olympic medal-winners
will be seen wearing Reebok apparel.
Other techniques will include direct marketing through a quarterly
newsletter, expansion of Reebok's fitness clubs, an extension of its
'Sisters' Network' - running clubs for women organised in conjunction with
Running Magazine.
Duerden is also supervising product development to push Reebok to the
forefront of top athletes' minds with a new running shoe some 3 ounces
lighter than anything else on the market. The 'Instapump' eschews
conventional laces, using instead a CO gas cylinder to pump it up so that it
fits like a glove on the foot.
The shoe will not be sold before March 1993 - and will cost a staggering
Pounds 100 or more - but the technology will eventually filter down into the
type of running shoes bought by ordinary consumers.

Asking big advertisers for favours is one option open to party tacticians as
they plan their campaign poster blitzes for the period to April 9 on
extremely short notice.
'Accessing' as it is known in the trade provides a means of supplementing
the billboard space the parties will already have snapped up on the open
market, sometimes under the guise of a corporate alias.
It is a technique that has yielded significant dividends - particularly for
the Conservatives - in past elections. In 1987, the party was given the free
use of several hundred Imperial Tobacco poster sites.
In that campaign, Allied-Lyons decided to hand over about 600 six-sheet and
large 48-sheet sites to the Tories for the all-important period. The
agreement was struck on a strict commercial basis, with the Conservatives
picking up the bill for the space.
Such agreements are described by Palmer as 'very last minute' arrangements.
A typical 48-sheet site would today command about Pounds 300 a month.
For good measure, the Shepton Mallet-based group - whose brands include
Teacher's whisky and Courvoisier brandy and which was the second-largest
corporate donor to the Conservatives in 1990 - also relinquished one
specific site to Labour.
This time, the election campaign is breaking with almost 30 per cent of
Britain's 2,200 giant 96-sheet sites carrying advertisements for Castlemaine
XXXX, Allied's Aussie lager brand. That campaign is scheduled to run until
the end of March - or some nine days before polling day.
'If by chance they were going for 96-sheets, then I guess they would have to
talk to us,' Palmer says.
In fact, those buying billboard space for the political parties may find
themselves more spoilt for choice than in 1987.
Then the advertising industry was buoyant; now it is in the doldrums.
'If you are trying to get poster sites at three weeks' notice you have quite
a good chance,' says John Klue, director of the Outdoor Advertising
Association, a trade body.
Prices have accordingly softened - although the election is widely expected
to trigger a recovery to the tune of 15-20 per cent.
An all-embracing 4,000-5,000 site campaign would now cost about Pounds
900,000-Pounds 1m a month, according to poster specialists.
Political buyers may shortly be further advantaged by the return to the
market of an estimated 2,700 48-sheet sites (more than 7 per cent of the
national total) that were previously booked by the Central Office of
Information (COI) and Benetton, the fashion company.
The COI's planned 1,450-site car crime prevention campaign - due to hit the
streets on March 15 for two weeks - is now almost certain to be scrapped
following the announcement of the election.
Poster specialists estimate, meanwhile, that about half of the 2,500 sites
originally booked by Benetton may ultimately be available for reselling, as
a result of the controversy the proposed campaign has provoked.
But the buyers' market has not left those working directly for the parties
with time on their hands.
As the phoney election war rumbled on, Poster Publicity - Labour's main
poster specialist - was in daily contact with the 20-25 leading UK poster
contractors in a bid to 'get a detailed idea of what has been sold'.
According to Labour officials, the party has already booked just over 100
London sites for the duration of the campaign. This includes its favourite
Vauxhall Bridge location in south London.
The majority of these sites have been earmarked for a self-contained poster
offensive in the capital.
The Vauxhall location, which is convenient for press photographers and TV
cameras, is expected to continue to be used as a prime launching-pad for the
party's nationwide campaigns.

The agenda for the conference, published yesterday, shows that many of the

FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: TV networks urge US-style debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S broadcasters have asked the leaders of the three main political
parties to take part in an American-style eve-of-poll debate.
As they launched their plans for election coverage yesterday, both
Independent Television News and the BBC said they had independently invited
the party leaders to debate the issues.
Mr Tony Hall, director of BBC news and current affairs said yesterday that
no one had formally declined yet. If the debate went ahead, it would be so
important that it should not go exclusively to one broadcasting
organisation, he said.
The Hansard Society had agreed to host it, he added.
Mr Stewart Purvis, ITN's editor-in-chief, promised that ITN's Pounds 1m-plus
coverage would be better than the BBC's 'because it will be sharper, it will
not be ponderous, and will address the issues directly'.
Mr Purvis said the BBC had in the past confused public service broadcasting
and comprehensive broadcasting with 'simply being boring'.
ITN will use three mobile satellite dishes to bring coverage from all over
the country, run profiles filmed at the homes of the three main party
leaders, and use 'focus groups' of uncommitted voters to predict trends.
The BBC said it would use a 200-strong combined team of broadcasters to be
'the nation's debating chamber during the general election campaign'.
Innovations include The Vote Race, a BBC1 series interpreting what the party
managers and manipulators are up to with a studio audience deciding whether
they believe them or not.
The BBC also said yesterday that it would consider broadcasting some of the
material from the Panorama programme on Thatcherism and the recession that
was replaced on Monday by a studio discussion.
Mr Hall emphatically denied that there had been any political interference
in the decision to pull the programme.
Mr Samir Shah, editor of weekly news and current affairs programmes, had
asked for changes that could not be made in time. He said it had been an
editorial decision to shelve the programme. Ms Glenwyn Benson, editor of On
The Record, was yesterday appointed editor of Panorama. She is believed to
be the first woman to edit the flagship BBC current affairs programme.

FT  12 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): BT wins test case on strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT, the telecommunications group, won a test-case ruling yesterday that it
was within its rights to send home two managers without pay after they
returned from strike action during a continuing wages dispute. That was
because the two refused to sign a pledge when they returned not to take part
in further industrial action.
The Court of Appeal allowed BT's appeal against county-court compensation to
the two managers for wages lost as a result of not being allowed to work
during the 1989-1990 dispute. The ruling will be applicable to more than 100
other people who took similar action.
Three judges unanimously ruled yesterday that BT acted lawfully in refusing
to let Mrs Alison Ticehurst and Mr Michael Thompson return to work after
strike action unless they signed undertakings to work normally under their
employment contracts and not to take part in further action during the
dispute.
The court accepted BT's argument that Mr Thompson and Mrs Ticehurst had
failed to show they were willing to perform their contract obligations in
full.
They had plainly shown the intention to continue the industrial action in
accordance with union instructions - by working to rule and withdrawing
goodwill - which amounted to a breach of the implied term of their contracts
to serve their employers faithfully.
Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused, al-though the law lords
can be petitioned directly for leave. Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain,
is freezing pay for a year for all of its 65,000 employees, it said
yesterday.
The move reflects the decline in Asda's profitability and efforts by a new
senior management team to restructure the business and tighten costs. The
company is thought to be alone among big food retailers in freezing pay.
A small number of the lowest-paid employees covered by the Food Wages
Council will receive a 4.2 per cent rise from April. Other pay awards will
be reviewed in June next year.
The GMB general union, which has sole negotiating rights at Asda, said it
would seek to reopen negotiations with the aim of 'limiting the effects of a
pay standstill'.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Lloyd's rejects S&amp;P allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday rejected claims by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
credit-rating agency, that the insurance market faces a liquidity crisis.
S&amp;P, which began analysing Lloyd's syndicates last year, said that it had
identified a 'negative balance' of liabilities against assets of Pounds
1.2bn last autumn.
The combination of new legal actions and the apparent reluctance of
commercial banks to lend to either Names or agents was leading to a possible
liquidity crunch, S&amp;P said.
More than 700 Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at
Lloyd's - are seeking to prevent their deposits held by the market being
drawn on.
S&amp;P said commercial banks were reluctant to extend credit. Its figures,
which were based on reports to the Department of Trade and Industry, show
that bank guarantees represented 50 per cent of all personal deposits at
Lloyd's compared with 11 per cent in 1977.
It is concerned over Lloyd's 'near-term capital adequacy and liquidity'. Mr
Alan Levin of S&amp;P in New York said: 'We are quite worried.'
In a prompt rebuttal, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, deplored the S&amp;P
assertions as 'misleading and potentially damaging'.
Lloyd's said that on December 31 1990 the market's total declared resources
amounted to more than Pounds 18bn. This was more than Pounds 6.5bn in excess
of all estimated future liabilities.
It added that S&amp;P was only taking into account 'readily realisable' assets
held in premium trust funds. These are ongoing funds made up of insurance
premiums earned by Lloyd's syndicates.
The agency's figures for liabilities included substantial amounts 'which
will not fall due for payment until the end of this century and, in many
cases, into the next century'.
Lloyd's also argued that over the past year the size of its American Trust
Fund had increased by Dollars 1bn and that its central fund now stood at
Pounds 500m.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Halle trumpets Pounds 27m cash boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to put nearly Pounds 27m towards a new Pounds 46m concert
hall for Manchester's Halle orchestra, nearly doubling its previous
commitment. The decision comes two weeks after Manchester was given Pounds
55m towards its bid for the Olympics in the year 2000.
The announcement was greeted yesterday by four French horns, three trumpets,
three trombones and a tuba from the Halle's brass section, 'conducted' by Mr
Michael Heseltine, environment secretary.
Plans for the music itself to be the Fanfare for the Common Man were changed
when Mr Heseltine and Mr Graham Stringer, Labour leader of Manchester City
Council, realised this was the theme tune of the Social Democratic Party
during the 1980s.
La Peri, by Dukas ' composer of The Sorcerer's Apprentice ' was substituted,
but the complexities of keeping time soon defeated Mr Heseltine, who retired
to his seat after a dozen bars.
The new concert hall will replace Manchester's Free Trade Hall, home of the
Halle for most of the century. However great the hall's fame as a symbol of
the city's past glories, it suffers from poor acoustics and design.
The new hall will be a flagship for city-centre regeneration, opening up a
derelict tract of land now used as a car park. This has provided the
rationale for government backing. Central Manchester Development
Corporation, an agency of Mr Heseltine's department, had already asked for
clearance to put in Pounds 15m. Mr Heseltine confirmed that and approved a
further Pounds 7m yesterday.
A further Pounds 5m will come from the government's urban programme and
about Pounds 9m is likely from the European Community, with Manchester City
Council and the private sector providing the rest.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Treasury and Civil Service Committee Report: Regulation
attracts strongest criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strongest criticism of the committee's report into the collapse of BCCI
is aimed at the system for regulating international banks.
The committee made six main recommendations:
The Bank of England should lobby its fellow central banks for an amendment
to the 1983 Basle Concordat - an agreement between bank regulators on the
supervision of international banks - to ensure that every international bank
is subject to proper supervision by a single regulator. This regulator would
monitor all of a bank's operations.
An international body should set and monitor the supervisory standards
imposed by bank regulators. The committee suggested that the Basle Committee
on Banking Regulations, which consists of regulators from the group of 10
leading industrial countries and Switzerland, should play this role.
The Bank of England should receive annual reports on the accounting
practices and management controls employed in the UK-based branches of an
international bank whose domicile is overseas. These reports would be
prepared by the branches' reporting accountants.
A bank's accountants should be obliged to report to the Bank of England if
it uncovers anything unusual at the bank. Under the 1987 Banking Act,
accountants are permitted to ignore duties of client confidentiality and
share their concerns with the Bank - but they have no duty to do so.
The Bank of England should use its own inspectors more frequently to carry
out 'on site' investigations of a bank, rather than relying exclusively on
information from the bank's accountants.
The Bank should also launch a study into whether it is sensible for
international banks to operate through branches in the UK, rather than
through incorporated subsidiaries.

A NATIONAL GRID to pump water to regions affected by drought from those with
surpluses would be too expensive, the National Rivers Authority, the
environmental watchdog, said yesterday, John Hunt writes. Mr Jerry Sherriff,
the authority's head of water resources, said that a grid would cost
billions of pounds to construct and that extensive pumping equipment would
be needed for it.
An authority discussion paper issued yesterday covers options for obtaining
a more even water supply throughout the UK. The authority is examining the
long-term possibility of transferring water between river catchment areas as
a means of solving water shortages. It says water might be transferred from
wetter areas in the west and north to parts of the south-east where there
has been low rainfall in recent years.
The authority describes as 'fantasy' suggestions that icebergs could be
towed from the Arctic and melted for use in the water supply.

AEG, the subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, and Siemens, the German electronics
company, are to compete in the Czechoslovak domestic market, following a
joint venture set up between AEG and the country's biggest transport and
engineering company.
AEG is poised to acquire a majority ownership of the transport division of
the local company CKD for an undisclosed sum, following approval recently
granted by the Czech government. AEG intends to diversify CKD's production
of tramcars and diesel electric locomotives, and make subway cars, suburban
trains and trolley buses. Earlier this year Siemens acquired a 51 per cent
stake in the transport division of Skoda, the Plzen-based engineering group.
The joint venture also intends to focus on mass transit contracts.
Mr Bernhard Weiss, a Siemens manager responsible for the joint venture, said
Siemens and Skoda won in December a contract to supply the Prague metro with
22 new trains. The business should compensate for losses made by Skoda's
transport division because of problems in selling its locomotives on the
Soviet market. CKD is the largest producer of public transport vehicles in
Czechoslovakia, with 1991 sales of Korunas 14.9bn (Pounds 296m).

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA yesterday seized the opportunity of a debate on US trade policy in
Gatt to pursue simmering trade grievances against its powerful neighbour.
Mr Gerald Shannon, Canada's ambassador to Gatt, said the US, once the
leading champion of international trade liberalisation, appeared
increasingly to be drifting towards managed trade and greater protectionism.
He singled out US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, which had
become the 'instruments of choice for US industries seeking protection',
citing, among other criticisms, 'arbitrary and capricious' findings of
injury, dumping and subsidy.
Mr Shannon's remarks were made against the background of rising trade
friction between Ottawa and Washington. The Canadian government was
yesterday considering retaliatory action against the US for its imposition
last week of countervailing duties against allegedly subsidised softwood
lumber exports from Canada. The US move came despite a decision last
December by Gatt's subsidies committee to set up an independent panel to
rule on the dispute.
Ottawa is also fuming over a recent US customs decision that Honda cars
assembled in Canada do not qualify for tariff concessions under the
US/Canada free trade agreement, and is at odds with Washington over
cross-border beer sales.
Mr Shannon said the US was increasingly resorting to managed trade deals
such as 'voluntary' export restraint arrangements for machine tools,
electronics, meat and cars, as well as the car parts pact President Bush
brought back from Japan in January.
The EC expressed concern yesterday over US pursuit of trade aims through
unilateral and bilateral actions that could discriminate against other
trading nations. Mr Roderick Abbott, for the EC, said Brussels was worried
by moves in Congress to curb foreign investment in the US. The report by the
Gatt secretariat on US trade policies will be published today.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government is to open a new Federal exports office, increase
customs and inspection staff, and toughen legal penalties in an attempt to
block exports of goods which could be used for weapons manufacture.
In future, products which could be used to make or transport weapons will
require export licences from the new office, to open on April 1, the cabinet
agreed yesterday. The list of controlled goods includes machine tools,
components which could be used in rockets or uranium enrichment, low-loaders
and civilian plant which might be 'misused' to make chemical or biological
weapons. Licences will not be issued for such shipments to 'sensitive'
countries.
The cabinet also agreed that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would press for adoption
of a uniform international arms control policy during his chairmanship of
the forthcoming western economic summit in Munich. Breaches of the new
German controls or official UN embargoes will be punished by up to 15 years'
jail. German technicians working overseas will also be covered by the
legislation, according to an economics ministry paper presented to the
cabinet.
The paper said Germany must quickly introduce new rules to stop the country
being used as a staging post for suspect or illegal shipments from other
countries. It cited the example of parts for Iraq's 'supergun' sent via
Frankfurt airport. Several German companies have been involved in exports of
machinery and parts to Iraq.
Other measures include 100 extra people at the the customs crime bureau,
raising the workforce there to 370. The new department examining exports and
issuing licences will have a staff of over 400. About 18m export shipments
leave Germany a year, of which 0.3 per cent are officially described as
armaments.
Peru has introduced a system whereby all imports will be inspected before
shipment by an independent company. Four companies have been nominated:
Cotecna Group and SGS of Switzerland, Bureau Veritas of France, and SSI,
part of Britain's Inchcape group. Such inspections, now used by 29
developing countries, were originally meant to ensure an importing country
received value for foreign exchange in imports. Recently, the systems have
been used to help assess and collect import duties.

<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE has made a breakthrough in the Chinese market for its Tay
engine, with an agreement to supply engines worth around Pounds 20m to China
Eastern Airlines, Paul Betts writes.
The Shanghai-based airline is buying seven Fokker 100 twin-engine regional
jets, to be powered by Rolls-Royce Tay 650 engines. The carrier is acquiring
its fleet of Rolls-Royce-powered Fokker 100s from a leasing company. The
first three Fokker 100s will be delivered in September and the remaining
four next year.
The aircraft and engines have already been been sold by the makers to the
leasing company, but Rolls-Royce said yesterday the agreement was important
because it was the first order for the Tay 650 and the Fokker 100 in China.
China Eastern operated Trident three-engine jets during the past 15 years
powered with Rolls-Royce Spey engines.
Western makers are interested in expanding their presence in the Chinese
market, where the potential has hardly been tapped. In the first six months
of last year China's airlines carried 8.8m international and domestic
passengers, a 33.5 per cent increase over the same period the previous year.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has named an anti-corruption
campaigner as interior minister as part of a new cabinet of national unity
that includes two figures from the main opposition party.
The appointment of Mr Luis Pinerua Ordaz to one of the most powerful jobs
after the presidency is intended to satisfy popular demands for a serious
government attack on corruption and violent crime.
Although Mr Pinerua has long been prominent in the ruling Democratic Action
(AD) party, his appointment represents a blow to many other senior figures
in the party. Most of AD's leadership see the new minister as a maverick
figure who may try to put some of their party brethren behind bars.
Mr Perez also named six other new cabinet ministers, but kept the
government's free-market reformers in place in other key ministries and in
the presidency of the central bank. The president thus refused to cave in to
demands that he roll back unpopular economic reforms initiated three years
ago.
Mr Perez appointed some new cabinet members at the end of February, but he
was forced to make broader changes this week in the face of a political
crisis following last month's abortive coup and calls for his resignation.
This week's changes are the third cabinet shake-up this year.
Six of the seven new cabinet officers were sworn in Tuesday as police and
National Guardsmen used water cannon, tear gas and firearms to confront
protesters, some of them armed, in several parts of the capital.
The six other cabinet changes were: Mr Pedro Valenilla, a prominent
businessman, minister of economic development; Mr Humberto Calderon Berti, a
member of the Christian Democrat (Copei) party, foreign minister; Mr Jose
Ignacio Moreno, a member of Copei's leadership, to the presidency of the
Venezuelan Investment Fund, which oversees Venezuela's privatisation
programme; Mr Jose Mendoza Angulo, a senator for the ruling Democratic
Action (AD) party, justice minister; Mr Jose Andres Octavio, a political
independent, minister of state reform; and Ms Teresa Albanez, a member of
AD, minister of family welfare.
Copei was quick to point out that while two of its members are, with the
permission of party leaders, holding posts in the AD administration, this
does not mean that the party is forming a coalition government. Copei
leaders say they will continue to work as the country's main opposition
party.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Japanese see February trade surplus double

JAPAN'S trade surplus for February doubled from a year earlier to Dollars
10.2bn (Pounds 5.7bn), a record total for a single month and a sign that the
country is likely to face a sharp increase in trade friction this year.
Ministry of Finance customs-cleared figures showed a 12.4 per cent increase
in exports to Dollars 28.1bn and a 10.3 per cent fall in imports to Dollars
17.9bn, reflecting the effects of slowing domestic demand, which has
encouraged Japanese companies to increase their exports.
The Japanese government has been nervous in recent days that the yen's
weakness will also encourage exports, while the declining demand for imports
has prompted politicians to intensify their calls for an economic package to
stimulate domestic growth.
Seasonally adjusted, the surplus rose from Dollars 8.4bn in January to
Dollars 10.4bn, with exports rising 1.1 per cent, but imports falling by an
unexpectedly large 8.4 per cent.
A Finance Ministry official said the record figure was a 'headache', and
admitted that the shift to higher-valued added exports, such as luxury cars,
would have a long-term influence on the trade balance.
Exports to most of Japan's leading trade partners rose sharply, with a 7 per
cent increase to the US, 8.1 per cent to the EC, 16.8 per cent to the UK,
and a massive 59.8 per cent to China, reflecting the rapid expansion of that
country's economy in recent months. Japanese trade officials expect that
China will also be the final destination for a large share of the 36.1 per
cent increase in exports to Hong Kong.
However, imports from the US fell 6.8 per cent and Japan recorded a
bilateral surplus of Dollars 3.7bn, while imports from the EC fell 13.4 per
cent, and Japan had surplus of Dollars 3.4bn. Imports from the UK fell 22
per cent, from France 31.5 per cent, and from Italy 15.1 per cent,
indicating that demand for luxury European goods remains sluggish.
Japanese electronics companies, which will report sharply lower profits in
the year to end March and have been particularly hit by weak demand on the
home market, increased their exports of semiconductors (up 23.4 per cent)
and televisions (up 21.6 per cent). And the car makers, whose profits are
also under pressure, increased their exports by 18.7 per cent, including a
25.4 per cent lift in truck and bus exports.
A Japanese foreign exchange dealer said that the record surplus would
probably prompt Tokyo to intensify its efforts to drive down the dollar,
although Japanese sales of the dollar yesterday had little impact. The
Finance Ministry said that the yen's current weakness 'cannot continue for
long', and hinted that other leading industrial nations could intervene in
the market in coming days.

FT  12 MAR 92 / White is right in this land without servants: Patti Waldmeir
visits a latter-day Boer republic set up as an alternative to a multiracial
South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE not here out of hate. We are not racists. It's a matter of
self-preservation,' explains Nico van den Bergh, 35, as he proudly conducts
a tour of South Africa's only all-white 'homeland', Orania.
Mr Van den Bergh and 360 other Afrikaners have already fulfilled the
ultra-right dream of white hegemony in a pure white state - a prototype of
the white homeland which the right is demanding as an alternative to the
reform process the white electorate is being asked to endorse in a
referendum next week.
They live in racial isolation on the banks of the Orange River in the
forbidding northern Cape, where the bush is stunted by heat and a drought
which never really breaks and where the roads are straight and flat and
shimmer on, apparently forever.
'It might look racist,' Mr Van den Bergh concedes; and at first glance it
does. No blacks are allowed to live or work in Orania, where even the most
menial tasks are performed by whites. Residents made a rare exception
recently when the Post Office insisted on sending a 'coloured' (mixed race)
engineer to install phone lines. The rest of the time, they keep to
themselves in their fenced, 280-hectare town.
Orania was set up a year ago, the kernel of an Afrikaner Volkstaat which
residents hope will eventually cover a huge area of this inhospitable
region. They have already purchased 2,300 further hectares for sheep
farming.
They see themselves, without irony, as modern-day Voortrekkers, pioneers
like their forefathers who set out from the Cape in the 1830s to settle what
later became the independent Boer republics.
Professor Carel Boshoff, the Afrikaner theologian who set up Orania, says a
white homeland is essential for the survival of the Afrikaner.
'For an individual to survive when he is not in his own cultural
circumstances, that is possible,' says Prof Boshoff, in the soft and
measured voice of the clergyman, referring to the prospect of black rule in
South Africa. 'But for a nation to survive, for what we call a volk, to
survive, it is necessary to have a geographical as well as political
circumstance in which . . . the institutions, the values, the way of living,
the world view of the nation are established.'
Prof Boshoff (who is the son-in-law of the late Hendrik Verwoerd, architect
of apartheid) draws a parallel with Israel, arguing that the existence of a
Jewish state is crucial to the security of Jews in the diaspora.
'I feel it is possible for Afrikaners to survive in the new South Africa on
condition that we've got a stronghold, a state where Afrikaners are in
charge of the political and different structures. The condition is that
there is a motherland.'
Orania is a harsh, Calvinist motherland, far from the swimming pools and
verdant gardens which most residents have left behind in white suburbia.
Built to house workers who constructed a nearby dam, the homes are flimsy
and dilapidated, the roads cracked and buckled. And there are no servants.
There are labourers, yes: white municipal workers maintain the town, which
was purchased as private property by a group of Orania residents for R1.6m
(Pounds 320,000) last January; some of their wives char for other residents.
But shortage of labour is a problem: some paid labourers have refused to do
what they consider kaffir work, and they resent living in the town's old
servants' quarters.
Prof Boshoff concedes that Orania cannot be self-sufficient without black
labour. (The ultra-right Conservative Party, which demands a much larger
white state, envisages a homeland where blacks would be admitted as
'foreign' labourers). He proposes that Orania would be part of a
constellation of regional states, a 'good neighbour' to bordering black
states, trading high-tech goods and services for the necessities of life.
In the short term, Orania will aim to provide high quality education and
health care for whites from 'across the border' (South Africa). It will earn
its keep by educating Afrikaner children in the Calvinist values of the volk
(saving them from segregated schools), and treating sick Afrikaners after
hospital integration leads to an inevitable decline in government spending
on whites-only health care.
Prof Boshoff does not fool himself that hundreds of thousands will flock to
his homeland - at least not yet. He acknowledges that mortgages and car
loans will keep most Afrikaners in urban areas.
But Nico van den Bergh sees no future in the new South Africa. 'Blacks need
the vote and they must have their human rights. It's only fair,' he argues.
'So the only solution is to come and establish our culture here.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEAMS OF US and inter-national experts are being sent to southern Africa to
assess the impact on food supplies of what in some areas is the worst
drought of the century. Officials said millions of people will be affected,
AP reports from Washington.
Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and
South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import
substantial quantities of grain. As the drought persists, estimates of the
grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously.
The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the
continent's overall food crisis. The north-east is the most deprived area in
Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The lives of 15m
people are thought to be at risk.
Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation
during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come
soon.
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that
the drought could lead to widespread famine. About 98m people live in the
affected regions in southern Africa.
'Considerable donor assistance will be needed to avert a major humanitarian
crisis in the region,' the US State Department said last week.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Politics holds sway over ecology at wildlife talks:
Dispassionate debate is on the endangered list at the Cites conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most photographed foreigners in Japan this week have been the Swedish
delegation to a conference on trade in endangered wildlife. Pursued by
journalists, the Swedes prompted Japanese to contemplate the demise of the
bluefin tuna, an important ingredient of their beloved sushi.
The Swedes have proposed limiting trade in bluefin tuna to the 114 member
nations of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(Cites).
There has been no suggestion at the two-week conference, which ends
tomorrow, that western Atlantic bluefin tuna are in danger of elimination,
but the Swedes were in favour of regulating catches.
A similar argument was raised by the Netherlands over two species of
tropical timber, enraging the Malaysian government, which insisted that the
International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) is the responsible
authority.
Malaysia's response also reflected the anger of developing countries at the
influence of the developed world's conservation movement, which they see as
imposing restrictions which perpetuate poverty. lt is an anger particularly
felt by former colonies, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, whose governments
argue that they have been 'exploited' in the past by foreigners and are now
under pressure to limit their own use of the same resources.
However, delegates from countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands denied
they were imposing their values on the Third World, and said they were
passing on knowledge gleaned from their own environmental mistakes. The
conservation groups in Kyoto argue that what Malaysia calls 'national
resources' are really international resources.
It was clear from the way delegates voted that political considerations
often outweighed scientific assessments of various species. For instance,
Australia, which is wary of offending Malaysia, did not publicly support the
Cites protection of tropical timber even though Canberra has serious
concerns about the rate of logging in south-east Asia.
And forthcoming elections in the US and UK encouraged their delegates to
express enthusiasm for politically-popular elephants, and in Washington's
case, to ensure that the views of trophy hunters and tuna fishermen were
well represented. The delegation from Botswana, having been heavily lobbied
over elephants, complained to the conference that 'not everyone makes points
to score points'.
Most controversy was caused by proposals to move species between Appendix 1,
which imposes a total ban on trade, and Appendix 2, requiring member
countries to issue permits and monitor trade in the species or its products.
Five southern African countries had wanted their elephants downlisted from 1
to 2, enabling them to trade in the animal's hide and meat.
Cites applies only to international trade in flora and fauna, and several
proposals rejected at the conference were designed to protect species not
traded but endangered by the destruction of natural habitat.
A separate problem was in assessing the accuracy of wildly differing
statistics presented by governments, industry groups and conservationists.
The collection of data is made more difficult in the case of
highly-publicised animals such as the elephant and rhinoceros, as their
ivory and horns are popular in Asian countries that are either not members
of Cites or have a poor record in monitoring trade in wildlife.
Of the two so-called 'charismatic megafauna', the elephant attracted far
more attention than the rhino. But Dr Simon Lyster, international treaties
officer for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said the latter was in more
immediate danger and that pressure should be put on Taiwan, which is not a
Cites member but is thought to be the world's largest consumer of rhino
horn.
Japan, as host nation, has survived the conference without having its
international reputation tarnished, partly because the government was not
forced to vote on the tropical timber issue and had the US, Canada and
Morocco offering support on tuna. But the ambiguity of Japan's policies
suggest that work needs to be done before the government can take the high
moral ground on environmental issues.
A ministry of international trade and industry (Miti) official explained
that Japan would support the protection of tropical timbers if their
depletion could be 'scientifically verified' and, adding a political
qualification, if Malaysia agreed. Obviously that exporting nation did not
agree.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Sikh extremists massacre factory managers: Fifteen
non-Punjabis lined up and shot at textiles plant

<TEXT>
SIKH militants murdered 15 senior executives and technicians of a textiles
factory in the north Indian state of Punjab late on Tuesday night.
Four militants entered the residential area of the Indian Acrylics plant and
forced all residents to gather at one spot. They then separated the
non-Punjabis from the Punjabis and opened fire on the non-Punjabis, killing
15 and wounding two. According to one report, an American executive was held
briefly and then released.
The attack was the most serious strike by militants - who are fighting a
decade-old campaign for an independent Sikh homeland - since elections in
Punjab last month.
The Rs2.2bn (Pounds 47m) synthetic fibre factory in Gadhwan Kothe village,
near Patiala, was set up recently in collaboration with Du Pont. The US
company supplied the machinery for the plant's second phase, due to come on
stream next month, making it the largest acrylics plant in Punjab.
The first phase of the plant opened last September and employed 600 people.
Du Pont's office in New Delhi said yesterday that the US company's
involvement involved a one-off sale of technology. The massacre would not
affect its investment plans in India.
However, the incident is bound to have some effect on investment in the
country, which recently liberalised its foreign investment policies. Mr P V
Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, recently estimated that Rs10bn of
foreign investment had taken place since the liberalisation and he expressed
hope that this would double in a few months.
Many workers of Indian Acrylics have run away in fear and the incident has
caused alarm in factories throughout the state, in spite of an appeal by Mr
Beant Singh, Punjab's newly-elected chief minister, to non-Punjabis not to
leave their posts.
Militants have adopted this tactic to force non-Punjabis to leave the state
and to deter others from seeking jobs there. This factor, coupled with the
fear of repeated random attacks, is likely to retard industrialisation in
Punjab.
Following elections in the state last month, Congress formed a government
which ended nearly five years of direct administration from New Delhi.
President's rule, as this is called, had failed to check militancy in
Punjab.

<TEXT>
THE head of a United Nations operation to bring peace to Cambodia yesterday
asked Japan to shoulder a third of the costs of his mission, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)
and a Japanese, made the request in a meeting with Mr Michio Watanabe,
Japan's foreign minister, officials said.
They said Mr Akashi told Mr Watanabe: 'It seems the international community
including the United States wants Japan to shoulder about one-third of the
budget.'
Mr Watanabe replied: 'We cannot give a concrete figure at present but would
like to study various factors.'
Mr Akashi later made the same request to a Lower House committee on
international co-operation, according to press reports.
The officials were unable to say how much Tokyo's proposed share would be.
But media reports put it at between Dollars 900m and Dollars 1bn out of an
unofficial estimated total of Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.59bn).
The total is made up of Dollars 1.9bn for UNTAC operations, Dollars 100m to
repatriate refugees and Dollars 800m to rehabilitate Cambodia, the reports
said.
Mr Watanabe told Mr Akashi that Japan was prepared to provide 12.45 per cent
of the Dollars 200m start-up cost for UNTAC, the same proportion as Tokyo's
contribution to the overall UN budget.
Mr Akashi is on his way to Cambodia to take up the UNTAC post in mid-March.
He also told Watanabe Japan should build a storage depot on its soil for
supplies for UN peace-keeping operations and establish a training centre for
peace-keepers, ministry officials said.
In a meeting with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, on Tuesday, Mr
Akashi said UNTAC planned to finish deploying its troops in Cambodia by May
and to disarm 470,000 regular and militia troops of Cambodia's four factions
and repatriate 370,000 refugees from Thailand by October, ministry officials
said.

POLICE crush barriers were still at the ready outside the South African
embassy in London's Trafalgar Square, scene of countless anti-apartheid
demonstrations and a long-running picket. But yesterday all voices spoke in
unanimity as tourists and expatriates from that country streamed in to vote
in next Tuesday's referendum on political reform.
It is one of 215 South African missions around the world where voting has
been taking place yesterday and today in the whites-only poll called by
President F W de Klerk. Completed ballot papers will go by diplomatic bag to
Pretoria for counting along with the rest next week.
According to Mr Kent Durr, the country's ambassador to Britain, at least one
voter had flown in from a North Sea oil platform. 'A majority of one is
sufficient in this referendum, so any vote could be decisive,' Mr Durr
insisted.
Although Mr de Klerk will be looking for a rather clearer endorsement to
proceed to a non-racial government, the views of voters in London yesterday
will not displease him.
From student-scruffy to the besuited, the message was the same. A
businessman, who stepped from a Rolls-Royce, did not want to be identified
but had come 'to make sure Mr de Klerk gets his mandate'.
Mrs Glynda Jacobs, another of Britain's 40,000 or so South Africans of all
races, is planning to return at the end of the year when her diamond trader
husband's contract term expires. But she 'wouldn't like to go back if the
'Nos' get in'.
Strict eligibility rules stumped most of the South African cricket team,
currently wowing Australia in the World Cup, as they realised they had left
at home the voluminous identity document needed, along with a passport, to
cast a vote. Others were undeterred. In London Mr Sean Wheller, 25, said he
would arrange with his parents to courier the so-called 'book of life' to
him overnight.
Those without passports were being issued them instantly by Mr Durr's
consular team. And there were others, disenfranchised for more traditional
South African reasons, who came none the less. One black woman dallying
briefly at the entrance said: 'I just came to hear that wonderful South
African accent.'

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA yesterday welcomed the retreat of a Portuguese 'peace boat' which
returned to Darwin after being ordered out of Indonesian waters by a naval
patrol.
The 120 activists on board were protesting against Indonesia's treatment of
East Timor. They claimed success for their voyage which had focused the eyes
of the world on the former Portuguese colony.
Australia had feared the ship would provoke a confrontation with Indonesia.
Portugal said the naval interception was illegal, and urged international
condemnation of Indonesia.
Passengers said the ship, the Lusitania Expresso, came within two miles of
Indo-nesian territorial waters before being ordered to turn back by the
commander of a task force of three warships. It left Darwin on Monday for
Dili, capital of East Timor.
Indonesian troops killed at least 50 pro-independence demonstrators in Dili
late last year. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portuguese colonial officials and troops. The region was annexed by
Indonesia the following year. This has never been recognised by the United
Nations, but has been accepted by Australia, which last year signed a treaty
with Indonesia dividing oil exploration rights in the Timor Sea.
Mr John Kerin, Australia's acting foreign minister, said Indonesia had acted
'sensibly and responsibly,' and denied that the ship's voyage had
embarrassed Canberra. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said
he would visit Indonesia later this year on his first overseas trip since
his appointment in December.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Germans expect 2.5% inflation by end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN inflation will be down to 2.5 per cent by the end of this year,
but an upturn in economic growth is not now expected before next year,
according to a report published today by Kiel University's IfW world
economic institute.
Even then, gross national product in western Germany will grow by only 2 per
cent and unemployment is expected to peak at 2m in the middle of 1993.
Inflation is likely to be held at around 2.5 per cent.
While the inflation forecasts will reinforce expectations that the
Bundesbank will reduce interest rates later this year, giving other central
banks more room for manoeuvre, the institute's prognosis for short-term
economic developments in Germany will add to the mounting gloom.
Real growth this year will be only about 1 per cent, it says. Most recent
forecasts from government and other economists, which have steadily
downgraded expectations over the past few months, suggest 1.5 per cent. They
have also predicted an export-led upturn, starting in the second half.
While interest rates are still likely to fall, there will be little other
relief from the Bundesbank in the short term. Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
president of the Bundesbank, made plain in Bonn yesterday that he had no
intention of easing rigorous monetary controls.
He demanded an immediate clamp on credit expansion, and insisted that from
now on 'everything' must be financed out of the DM260bn (Pounds 90.2bn) of
savings within the overall economy.
'It would be wholly counter-productive to turn on the money taps and arouse
expectations that with interest rate reductions everything will become
easier,' he told a bankers' meeting. Mr Schlesinger added that too much bank
lending to the private sector was largely responsible for the recent surge
in money supply.
The IfW report says the German economy has been stagnating since the end of
the first quarter of last year. This year's expected minimal growth is
mainly attributable to the calendar - there will be 1.4 per cent more
working days than in 1991, thanks to the leap year and the fact several
national holidays fall on weekends. Some impetus will also be given by the
ending on June 30 of a special 7.5 per cent income tax levy and the
consequent increase in purchasing power.
East Germany, by contrast, is showing strong signs of climbing out of the
economic trough. The 10 per cent real growth in GNP expected this year and
next will boost overall German growth to 1.5 per cent in 1992 and 2.5 per
cent in 1993.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Baltic shipyards count cost of Treuhand deal: The economic
and political aspects of the rescue of an ailing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST Germany's crisis-racked shipbuilding industry was granted a new lease
of life this week but on a greatly reduced scale.
Six thousand east German shipbuilding workers who occupied the shipyards for
two weeks converged yesterday on the state parliament of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Schwerin to vent their anger over the sale by the
Treuhand agency of the industry's core to two European shipbuilders.
Shipbuilding is the sole industry in the east German state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the Baltic Sea, a rural region whose agriculture
is in equally serious trouble. The fate of the east German shipbuilding
industry raised a political storm between two of the partners within the
Bonn coalition government, the Christian Democrats and the liberal Free
Democrats, over the issue of state aid to ailing industries. It also
threatened to break up the ruling coalition in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which
mirrors that in Bonn.
East Germany's shipbuilding industry was largely created after 1945 to build
ships for Moscow as part of war reparations. It was the largest exporter of
ships to the former Soviet Union, which accounted for 80 per cent of the
industry's orders. The industry employed nearly 45,000 workers in 1989.
Fewer than 20,000 workers remain and roughly half of these jobs are expected
to be axed in the next two years.
Fifteen gleaming new ships ordered by Moscow, which is unable to pay for
them, lie moored at the Warnow and MTW shipyards in Warnemunde and Wismar on
the Baltic coast.
The undelivered vessels, symbols of a debt-ridden industry, are costing the
German taxpayer DM300,000 (Pounds 104,000) a day in maintenance and
insurance charges. Built to the buyer's specifications, they are virtually
unsaleable in the west.
The shipyards, grouped in the Treuhand-owned Deutsche Maschinen- und
Schiffbau (DMS) holding company in Rostock, managed to land western orders
for 60 new ships in 1990. But productivity in east German shipbuilding is
still low by western and far eastern standards and the orders will not stem
the losses.
The Treuhand was determined to sell as much of the industry as it could to
private buyers. Mrs Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president, says she believes
only private investors can successfully restructure the former state
companies.
Any agreement on the sale of the shipyards would include state subsidies and
will have to be examined by the European Commission. The Commission has said
a restructuring plan will have to aim to make the industry competitive by
the end of 1993, when all Community subsidies are due to end.
The deal announced this week is a compromise solution after the failure of
an earlier plan in which the Treuhand would have retained a large stake. It
follows feverish negotiations involving the Treuhand, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and key federal ministries, the state government in Schwerin and the IG
Metall union.
Vulkan of west Germany is buying 100 per cent of the MTW shipyard and the
Rostock engine company, while Kvaerner of Norway is to get the Neptun-Warnow
shipyards. The Treuhand says it is in talks with western companies for the
sale of the industry's other two shipyards.
Mrs Breuel, who believes the deal will win Commission approval, said it was
the best possible solution under difficult political circumstances and
suggested she believed the EC would approve the deal.
A week ago, the Treuhand was still considering a rival package. Vulkan
originally offered to buy a 51 per cent share in the MTW yard along with the
Rostock diesel engine company and the Neptun-Warnow shipyards. This was
backed by all sides in Germany - the CDU-led coalitions in Bonn and in
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state, as well as the shipyard workers. However,
Brussels signalled doubts because of Treuhand's involvement.
Yet even the revised formula, sharing the core of the industry between the
two buyers, means the Treuhand will be paying several billion D-Marks in
subsidies. The agency will assume more than DM1bn in debts, several hundred
million D-Marks to pay for environmental restructuring to meet west German
standards, and it will take on losses from current sales amounting to about
DM1.6bn. The Treuhand will also spend DM900m modernising the shipyards
before the sale.

GERMAN industry yesterday turned up the heat in this year's wage debate,
with the engineering and automobile sectors both calling strongly for unions
to show moderation.
The main blast came from the VDMA, the mechanical engineering association,
which painted a bleak picture of falling orders, job losses and high
short-time working, greater competition from imports, and low profits.
Mr Berthold Leibinger, the VDMA's president, said: 'In view of the present
situation in the German mechanical engineering sector, a wage settlement
like that recently agreed by the steel industry would be wholly
unacceptable.'
'It would lead to an extra cost burden of around DM5bn. (Pounds 1.7bn). That
would be more than half of the latest pre-tax profits of DM8bn.' The
industry's total profit after tax was DM4bn, a return of less than 2 per
cent on its turnover last year of DM225bn. This compared with more than 4
per cent in the 1960s and nearly 3 per cent in the mid-1980s.
Mr Leibinger said the causes of the lower returns were high German costs,
the strength of the D-Mark, and the weaker world economy which led to unused
capacity. 'The profits explosion which the unions talk of has not occurred
in German mechanical engineering.'
The IG Metall union has recommended regional negotiators to claim up to 9.5
per cent. The steel industry settlement was 6.4 per cent, comprising a
one-off payment and 5.9 per cent on the basic wage.
Mr Achim Diekmann, managing director of the motor industry association (VDA)
said: 'There must be much more moderation than last year.' Last year's wage
rises in the engineering sector, including automobiles, amounted to 6.7 per
cent.
The VDA has forecast automobile job losses as a result of high costs and
stronger competition. In mechanical engineering, employment fell by around
20,000 people last year to 1.1m.
Mr Leibinger expected, however, that engineering business would improve from
the middle of this year based on indications from European markets. Thus
production, 0.6 per cent lower in 1991, should ease by 2 or 3 per cent in
the first half and then improve to leave the industry flat or marginally
lower on the year.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) are in danger of
losing their absolute majority in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany's richest
federal state, and of allowing right-wing extremists to gain a foothold in
the state parliament.
The latest opinion poll, published less than four weeks before the state
election, shows support for the CDU, which has ruled Baden-Wurttemberg
unchallenged since 1972, slipping to 44 per cent. At the same time, the
extreme right Republican Party is backed by 4.9 per cent, only a fraction
short of the 5 per cent mark needed to gain seats in the regional
parliament.
Total support for the extreme right stands at 8 per cent, including the
National Democrats (NPD) and the German League, according to the poll
carried out by the respected Allensbach Institute for the Frankfurter
Allgemeine and SAT-1 TV.
The figures suggest a continuing drift by voters away from the mainstream
parties - the CDU, Social Democrats (SPD) and Free Democrats (FDP), and
towards protest movements like the Greens and the far right. Although the
move is marginal, it is enough to worry the main parties.
All the party leaders in Baden-Wurttemberg fear a low turn-out on April 5,
giving the extremists an extra chance to gain the crucial 5 per cent.
The same poll shows the SPD holding on to its own absolute majority in the
northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, against the trend of weakening
national support, largely thanks to the personal popularity of Mr Bjorn
Engholm, the state and national party leader. The poll figures show why Mr
Kohl and his CDU colleagues have raised the issue of controlling the influx
of asylum-seekers as their main campaign theme, mainly to prevent erosion of
their vote to the far right.
Baden-Wurttemberg, home to such German industrial giants as Daimler-Benz and
Robert Bosch, is the last state in west Germany still ruled by the CDU and
Mr Kohl is desperately anxious to retain control. His party is still tainted
by the resignation of the former prime minister, Mr Lothar Spath, just one
year ago - although not so much because of the hint of corruption for which
he was forced to resign, but rather because he remains more popular than his
successor, Mr Erwin Teufel.
Mr Kohl is throwing his own considerable political weight into the campaign
in support of Mr Teufel, so his own reputation is riding on the outcome.

The Irish government is asking its EC partners to approve an amendment to a

unrestricted travel of Irish women abroad who wish to have an abortion, Tim
Coone reports from Dublin.
Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said after talks in Brussels
'there had been 'a positive response to our situation'. The proposal will be
presented to the next EC foreign ministers' meeting on April 6.
The recent Supreme Court ruling on a case involving a 14 year-old rape
victim established the right of a pregnant woman who was threatening suicide
to seek an abortion abroad, but does not confer that right on pregnant women
who do not face an imminent threat to their lives.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Shevardnadze starts old job a new man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PURSUING one of the most extraordinary career paths in the former Soviet
Union, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, former communist party boss of Georgia, has
settled into his old office in Tbilisi as the unelected leader of the
post-Communist republic.
On the surface, Mr Shevardnadze's abrupt return to power may lend credence
to the claims by Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the ex-Georgian president, that his
removal in January was masterminded by the former Soviet foreign minister.
But more likely, Mr Shevardnadze's nomination as chairman of a newly created
state council to run the country until elections in June, is a sign of the
desperation gripping a nation reduced to civil strife, poverty, and
international isolation.
Mr Georgy Volsky, deputy chief of the Georgian mission in Moscow, said the
Military Council which has disbanded to make way for the State Council, had
consulted various parties and public opinion before picking Mr Shevardnadze.
He also claimed that the latest opinion polls showed 70 per cent support for
the charismatic 64-year-old leader, up from 30 per cent before his return.
Mr Volsky said the council included 35 members plucked from various
political groups, as well as Georgia's national minorities, including the
South Ossetians who had been under siege by Mr Gamsakhurdia's nationalist
guerrillas.
As Mr Gamsakhurdia yesterday desperately tried to convene some kind of rump
parliament in the city of Grozny, capital of Russia's rebellious autonomous
republic of Chechnya, Mr Shevardnadze was getting to grips with his new job
in the offices from which he ruled Georgia until 1986.
In a front page article headlined 'Shevardnadze's last mountain-top',
Izvestia newspaper summed up what is expected of him: 'Under Shevardnadze,
Georgia will quickly receive international recognition . . . economic
contracts and credit, acceptance by the Commonwealth of Independent States
 .UN membership. Under Shevardnadze, it goes without saying that there will
be no restrictions on the press, on creativity, political activity, entry
and exit (from the republic) and all other freedoms.'
If anybody can achieve all that, it is Mr Shevardnadze, who enjoys
unrivalled prestige abroad, possesses unquestioned political skills, and has
recouped his past as a Communist party faithful with his outspoken support
for fledgling democracy in the former Soviet Union.
Two years ago, when Mr Gamsakhurdia was running for office on a ticket
promising total independence from Moscow, Mr Shevardnadze was best
remembered in Georgia as a satrap of Moscow's Communist power. He was
personally responsible for jailing Mr Gamsakhurdia for dissident activities,
before leaving his native Georgia to become President Mikhail Gorbachev's
foreign minister.
Instead of total independence, Mr Gamsakhurdia's rule brought authoritarian
rule, ended only after weeks of fighting ruined the historic heart of the
Georgian capital. And although it was one of the first former Soviet
republics to try to restore independence lost in the early years of
Communist rule, Georgia today is the only former Soviet republic not to have
a seat at the United Nations.
'Now people believe that Shevardnadze is the man who will save Georgia.
History will show which of them will have been able to do what for the
people.' said Mr Volsky.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Hopes high for big nuclear arms cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Russia yesterday expressed cautious optimism that they could
reach agreement on further sweeping cuts in their nuclear arsenals in time
for their next summit in June in Washington.
After nearly five hours of talks on US-Russian bilateral problems with Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, Mr James Baker, the US
secretary of state, said they had not been able to reach a 'definitive
agreement' on arms control.
However, he hoped progress could be made at further meetings before the
summit. It was important that the new era of partnership and co-operation
between the US and Russia should be reflected in 'further significant
movement' in the reduction of nuclear weapons.
Hopes of progress in the new negotiations, launched by Mr Baker and Mr
Kozyrev in Moscow three weeks ago, were raised by the Russian minister's
statement on Tuesday that Moscow was ready to move towards the US position.
Mr Kozyrev publicly indicated for the first time that Russia was prepared to
negotiate a ban on land-based multiple independently-targeted warhead
missiles (MIRVs), of which Russia has a far greater number than the US.
But Mr Baker yesterday stressed that, while both sides wanted to move beyond
the reductions already agreed on in last year's Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (Start), differences still remained over the timetable of the new
cuts and the weapons to be covered.
One of the main areas of disagreement is the number of warheads on
submarine-launched missiles which the US would be allowed to retain. The US
strategic arsenal concentrates on submarine-based missiles, while Russia
relies on land-based ones.
In January, President George Bush proposed the elimination of all land-based
multiple warhead missiles. But his plan to reduce the overall ceiling for US
warheads to 4,700 would still allow Washington to keep 2,300 warheads on
submarine-based missiles.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin subsequently suggested the number of
warheads of each side be reduced to 2,500, which would entail a substantial
reduction of Washington's submarine-launched missiles. Under Start the US
has been allowed to keep 9,000 warheads and Russia 7,000.
Iran, vying with Turkey for influence in the former Soviet Moslem republics,
yesterday suggested a multinational observer force to monitor a truce
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister,
who is trying to broker a ceasefire in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh,
said Azerbaijan had agreed to the idea.

President Patricio Aylwin of Chile said yesterday, write Leslie Crawford in
Santiago and John Lloyd in Moscow.
Chilean officials would negotiate Mr Honecker's situation with German and
Russian officials in Moscow, Mr Aylwin said. Mr Clodomiro Almeyda, Chile's
ambassador to Moscow and an old friend of Mr Honecker's, was recalled to
Santiago over the weekend. The case has been effectively removed from his

Mr Aylwin said it was not his government's intention to shield Mr Honecker
from German justice.
Mr Honecker is to be allowed to leave the embassy to be treated in a Moscow
hospital, according to German diplomats in Moscow.
Mr Honecker, who is 79, has been in the embassy for two-and-a-half months
following a demand from the German government that he be sent back to face
charges of ordering the shooting of East Germans fleeing to the west. His
wife, Margot, says Mr Honecker has cancer and kidney problems.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Italy's 'red belt' is barometer for PCI's successor:
Election will test whether Bologna's 'cultured, fat and rich' citizens are
none the less still red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CULTURED, fat and rich are the epithets Italians like to apply to the
citizens of Bologna. And with good reason.
Bologna was Italy's and Europe's first university town. Still today one in
five of the 405,000 inhabitants is a student.
Eat in any one of the city's restaurants or wander through the food shops
stacked with hams, pasta and cheeses and it is easy to see why Bologna
claims to be the nation's gastronomic capital and its citizens look so well
fed. The wealth, meanwhile, comes from the rich farmland of surrounding
Emiglia Romagna and the dynamic small specialised industries that have grown
up in the postwar period.
This intellectual environment, combined with farmers turned
agro-industrialists and peasants transformed into skilled industrial
workers, has also created a unique political culture. Bologna and Emiglia
Romagna have been the heart of Italy's 'red belt' - the central part of the
country which has been solidly communist since 1945. The city itself has
been the good government showcase of the Italian Communist Party (PCI).
'We have only had four mayors since 1945, all communist,' says Mr Renzo
Imbeni, the current mayor who has held office since 1983 and joined the
party aged 20 in 1964. No other large city has enjoyed such continuity in
its administration or seen ideology march hand in glove with solid
pragmatism during a time when Italy has lived through 50 governments.
Since the burial of the PCI last year and its rebirth as the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) in February 1991, the politics of Bologna and Emiglia
Romagna now provides the benchmark for support for the new party.
If the PDS fails to attract the former communist vote here in the general
elections on April 5, its credibility as a party refashioning the left in
Italy will be damaged. In the 1987 general elections the communists polled
42 per cent of the vote in Bologna (47 per cent in Emiglia Romagna) compared
with a national average of 26 per cent. The governing Christian Democrats
won 21 per cent in Bologna with a national average of 34 per cent.
'We may get some nasty surprises in the general elections; but I think the
old communist vote will generally hold,' says Mr Antonio La Foggia,
secretary of the PDS in Bologna. Old loyalties, he believes, will be
transferred to the PDS on the basis of sentiment and the communists' record
in Bologna of coping well with the kind of issues which have alienated
voters elsewhere. These include municipal corruption, the failure of
inner-city transport, poor education and collapsing health services.
But Mr La Foggia is aware of the forces likely to erode the PDS vote
nationwide which could reduce its chances of inheriting the PCI's long-held
position as the second-largest political grouping in Italy after the
Christian Democrats. He concedes some votes in Bologna will be lost to the
populous Lombard League of Mr Umberto Bossi.
'They are the only new phenomenon in the elections and some of the things
they are saying, like the rich north should not go on supporting the south,
have an echo here.'
He reckons a sixth of the former communist vote could go to the hard-line
rump of the old PCI which has broken ranks with the PDS and formed
Reconstructed Communism (RC).
'The ones who have gone to RC are mainly the older generation who found it
just too hard to give up their ideals.' Among the professional classes some
votes could also be lost to the small Republican Party of Mr Georgio La
Malfa.
The PDS in Bologna has 77,000 members signed up for three years, against the
89,000 of the PCI in 1990. The PDS has acquired all the old PCI structures
in Bologna, including its headquarters, a magnificent 17th century fresco
palace in the heart bought after the war with subscriptions from party
militants. Staff have been cut but there are still 40 full time.
'If you want a business analogy,' says the mayor, 'I think most former
communists have switched to the PDS because they did not wish to waste the
return of their investment.'
For such members the collapse of communism and the long internal debate
through two congresses over two years on the fate of the PCI has been
traumatic. 'Politically it was easy for me when the PDS was born on February
3 last year: sentimentally it was very hard,' says Mr La Foggia, who joined
the party aged 18 in 1962.
'I wanted the party to be called simply the Democratic Party in the style of
the US Democrats - that is the direction in which I think we should move.'
The Bologna communists were among the first to denounce the 1968 Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia and long kept their distance from Moscow. The
communist municipal administration demonstrated its independence by calling
itself the Two Towers Group (after the two medieval towers in the city
centre) and currently runs the council in coalition with the Socialists and
the Social Democrats.
In essence the PDS in Bologna is no real break with the past, representing
in the last resort honest government with a social conscience. For instance,
to meet increasing costs and total financial dependence upon central
government, Mr Imbeni has begun to hive off non-essential activities to
joint ventures with private business.
According to members of the business community, such as Mr Gianandrea Rocco
di Torrepadula, head of the Bologna Industrialists Association, the Bologna
'model' has been over-glorified.
'The communists have kept the city tightly controlled, even isolated. . . .
The fact that the city works owes as much to the Bolognese themselves.'

FT  12 MAR 92 / FT European Water Conference: East Europeans warned of
privatisation dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE development of privately financed and managed water industries
throughout central and eastern Europe could be jeopardised by 'dubious'
contracts offered by western companies, a London conference was warned
yesterday.
International bankers told a Financial Times conference on the European
water industry there was a chronic need for western involvement in the
region to bring derelict industries up to standard.
But such involvement could bring problems. Mr Anthony Pellegrini of the
World Bank said: 'Local governments in eastern Europe have little experience
in dealing with sophisticated western companies ...they are not familiar
with typical lengths of concessions or management contracts, with tariff
adjustment clauses and most importantly, they are not familiar with
competitive bid methods.
'As a result, some contracts are being offered with dubious terms. If this
continues, it may in the end jeopardise the development of the private water
sector in central and eastern Europe. Unless proper standards for contracts
are implemented, a backlash against the private sector may develop that ..
could harm both the private companies and the best interests of the local
governments.'
Mr Pellegrini, chief of the World Bank's infrastructure division in Europe,
the Middle east and north Africa, said private western funding offered the
potential for more innovative and efficient management, maintenance and
operation, but he advised local governments to seek independent advice
before signing anything.
The scale and range of the work that needed to be done was considerable, he
said. The central planning system had left the water and sewerage utilities
with insufficient operating budgets, lack of management expertise, lack of
chemicals and supplies, and plant and equipment that was often only
partially functioning due to lack of maintenance.
The former eastern bloc countries are now considering new forms of ownership
and management and are tending towards the French system, where assets are
retained in the public sector and the operations run by the private sector,
rather than the complete privatisation undertaken in England and Wales.
Mr Francis Carpenter of the European Investment Bank, owned and financed by
EC member states, said bringing the east European water industry up to
scratch would be a major task, and a necessary one, because several of the
main river basins were shared with western Europe.

FT  12 MAR 92 / West takes steps to plug Soviet brain drain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING industrialised nations yesterday agreed to boost scientific
co-operation with central and eastern European countries to reduce the risk
of top civil scientists leaving eastern Europe for better conditions in the
west.
The accord, reached at a meeting in Paris of the 24 technology ministers of
the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), was
welcomed by Mr Boris Saltykov, the Russian minister for science and
technology.
At the same time, a conference in Brussels agreed to launch a centre for
former Soviet nuclear experts, with pledges of money from the US, the EC,
Japan and Canada, and with an offer of facilities from Russia.
Mr Saltykov, the first Russian minister to attend an OECD meeting at this
level, said yesterday it was impossible to measure the full extent of the
brain drain but that 600 members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone had
already signed contracts with mainly US research institutions.
The OECD agreed to encourage more joint projects between western and eastern
European researchers and to promote research opportunities in the east.
Dr Allan Bromley, science assistant to the US president said strong science
and technology enterprises would contribute to economic and political
stability.
Mr Saltykov argued that the possible brain drain of nuclear military
scientists was 'not a big deal' compared with the potential loss of civilian
skills. One Russian civilian project in urgent need of investment was an 80
per cent completed particle accelerator near Moscow, which could in return
be made available to foreign researchers, he said.
OECD members also agreed on the need for a fund to back up the centre for
former Soviet nuclear experts.
The Brussels conference yesterday was attended by ministers from the US,
Canada Japan, the EC and some other members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS). It was called to discuss the centre's
organisation. A joint team is to visit Russia later this month, with a view
to opening the centre, near Moscow, by early summer.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, stressed the need for speed.
Listening to scientists at the Chelyabinsk-70 nuclear weapons laboratory in
the Urals last month, he said he had 'heard concern that economic and
political conditions (in Russia) could deteriorate to the point where even
highly patriotic and responsible specialists might be tempted to market
their skills to unscrupulous regimes'.
By plugging a possible leak of nuclear weapons technology through promotion
of civil nuclear co-operation, a potential brain drain could be converted
into a 'brain gain', Mr Baker said.
The idea of the centre was first mooted by Germany in January, and the EC
yesterday confirmed it will match the US contribution of Dollars 25m (Pounds
14.2m). Mr Koichiro Matsura, deputy Japanese foreign minister, said his
country would make 'substantial contributions' and urged all CIS states to
sign the non-proliferation treaty.
In addition, the EC plans to hire Russian nuclear experts to improve safety
in Russian-designed power reactors in eastern Europe, Mr Frans Andriessen,
the EC external affairs commissioner, said yesterday.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Hussein seeks aid and solace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN, Jordan's ruler, is expected to use today's meeting with
President George Bush, the first between the two men since the Gulf war
strained relations between Jordan and the US, to call for measures to
alleviate the effects of sanctions on the Iraqi people.
The King's visit coincides with that of Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, to the United Nations in New York on a mission to persuade the
Security Council to lift the embargo against Iraq.
The timing is accidental, but Mr Aziz, who left for New York from Amman,
took the opportunity while in Jordan to seek the King's support in Iraq's
campaign to have the 20-month old sanctions lifted.
The King, whose speeches reflected strong pro-Iraqi sympathy among
Jordanians during the Gulf war, is likely to plead for an easing of the
pressure on Iraq for humanitarian reasons.
Before leaving Amman, senior Jordanian officials said they would argue in
Washington for measures to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people. 'It
is no longer a question of who is in power in Baghdad, but of the agony of
people trying to feed and clothe themselves,' said, Mr Mutasem Bilbeisi, the
Foreign Ministry under-secretary.
The King will also discuss the Bush administration's role in furthering the
Arab-Israeli peace talks during talks this afternoon in the White House.
Washington is the second stop on the King's North American tour after
Canada, where yesterday he received promises of increased economic aid to
help Jordan cope with the influx of post-war refugees.
Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, said they discussed regional
security in the region and UN sanctions against Iraq. 'King Hussein is a key
voice for stability and moderation in the Middle East,' Mr Mulroney said
after the talks. 'We recognise his dedication to bringing peace to the
region.'
Although the US and Jordan kept channels open during the Gulf crisis, the
King's mixture of formal neutrality and often impassioned support for the
Iraqi people angered the US administration, which responded by suspending
military assistance and economic aid to Amman.
However, President Bush restored this assistance in September last year, on
the grounds that it was both in US interests and 'would be beneficial to the
peace process in the Middle East'.
In a further sign of the thaw in relations, Mr Baker last week urged the
House of Representatives to increase aid for Jordan to an annual Dollars 77m
from Dollars 55m.

FT  12 MAR 92 / Kenya claims opposition parties have military wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kenyan government, in its strongest attack yet on its recently legalised
rivals, said yesterday that opposition parties had set up military wings for
a campaign of violence, sabotage and political intimidation, Reuter reports
from Nairobi.
A government statement said the main opposition party, the Forum for the
Restoration of Democracy (FORD), had 300 men under arms, including a
'Libyan-trained terrorist squad', and was expecting 500 to join them after
guerrilla training abroad.
FORD General-Secretary Martin Shikuku dismissed the accusations as nonsense
and challenged the government of President Daniel arap Moi to arrest members
of the alleged squad.
'Failure to do so must lead us to conclude that it is a total fabrication,'
Mr Shikuku said. 'The ball is in the government's court.'
The government statement said FORD's military wing planned to sabotage power
and telephone lines, shoot demonstrators and disrupt water and transport
systems. FORD would then blame the violence on the government.
It said another unnamed opposition party also had a military wing but gave
no details.
The government had told the security forces to take swift action, it added,
but it did not mention any specific measures.
The statement is the latest in a recent spate of mutual accusations by
government and opposition ahead of multi-party elections expected later this
year.
The government statement, which is certain to increase the political
temperature after riots in the capital last week, also accused FORD of
fanning tribal clashes in which at least 20 people have died in the last six
weeks.
Earlier yesterday, riot police and gangs of youths clashed in a rundown part
of Nairobi, witnesses said. A few shops were broken in to and at least one
car was overturned and set ablaze, but police quickly gained control of the
situation, they said.

If the US Presidential election does boil down to a Bush/Clinton contest,
then it will have strange echoes of the contest of 1884.
The Republican candidate's surname then began with B - James Blaine. He came
from Maine (one of Bush's many home states) and doubts were expressed about
his veracity, rather like Pat Buchanan's forceful denunciation of Bush for
reneging on his 'Read my lips. No new taxes.' statement. The jingle of the
time was 'Blaine, Blaine, We gave him a pain, The continental liar from the
state of Maine.'
The Democratic candidate also coincided; his surname started with the
letters Cl - Grover Cleveland - and he was dogged by sexual scandal. After
admitting to fathering an illegitimate child, the opposition jingle was 'Ma]
Ma], Where's my Pa?, Gone to the White House, Ha] Ha] Ha].'
Those who believe in omens will want to know that Cleveland won.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who's afraid of the pollsters? Answer: Michael Howard, Britain's Employment
Secretary.
Although his press office has spent some days denying the fact, it turns out
that Howard took time off from brawling with Labour's Jack Cunningham on the
radio last week to try to scupper an FT poll on attitudes to training.
To be precise, the FT has been asking directors of the Training and
Enterprise Councils, which Howard set up, how they think they are doing and
whether Labour would be good or bad for the training system.
Howard's response was to telephone business executives on G10, the group
which liaises between Whitehall and the Tecs.
According to a memorandum sent by Tom Booth, G10 representative for the
north west to the 14 Tecs he represents, Howard said some questions were
political in nature and offered a crude reminder of the Tecs' 'non-political
status'. No mention was made of the much touted independence of the Tecs.
Booth's response was to warn his fellow Tec directors to consider carefully
whether they should answer any questions (or the whole questionnaire) which
could be deemed to be 'politically sensitive'.
Unfortunately for Howard, over a third of all Tec directors canvassed,
including Booth, have already returned their forms.
We'll be glad to pass on their views to Howard on the Tecs' structure,
purpose and funding in due course. 'Frankly, I don't like being told what to
do by the Secretary of State,' says one aggrieved Tec director. 'If I'd had
any reservations about filling in the form before, which I did not, this
instruction would have driven me to fill it in straight away.'

Beset by criticism from all quarters, Lloyd's of London can ill-afford to
score own goals. Yet this appears to be what has happened with the
precipitate release of figures showing the the proportion of working and
outside Names on all syndicates in the insurance market.
The figures were released by the chairman, David Coleridge, last week with
the intention of casting light on to allegations that market insiders have
benefited to the detriment of outside Names.
Now, though, it appears they are incomplete.
Produced by the solvency and reporting department at Lloyd's Corporation,
the statistics effectively ignore 771 Names who resigned during 1986 and
1987 and more than 1,280 Names who have died over the six-year period
covered.
Lloyd's is moving quickly to rectify the error - its membership department
yesterday prepared a set of more accurate statistics - but is anxious to
stress that the mistake was 'a cock-up rather than a cover-up'.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: Lamont the lugubrious
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the result of the general election, Norman Lamont will go down as
the man who abolished the budget. It seems unlikely, however, that he will
continue as chancellor even if the Conservatives win. Something has happened
to this normally engaging man that suggests he has become bogged down in
Treasury detail.
Perhaps precisely because it was the last traditional budget but one that he
read the greater part of his speech in such a lugubrious tone. In the
sections on tax on company cars and monthly Vat returns, he seemed visibly
bored. It was 54 minutes before he made his first joke, and even that was a
rather feeble one about Benjamin Franklin saying that nothing was certain
except death and taxes.
He referred to the married couple's allowance as the mca or 'male chauvinist
allowance' and made one ringing statement: 'I will not accept any deal in
Brussels that would ride roughshod over the interests of the British cider
industry.' For the rest, however, he seemed prepared to accept the Treasury
prose as it came. The official text actually bears the word 'peroration'
before the final few paragraphs, and always has: it was not a peroration
written by a politician.
The next Tory chancellor needs to look less gloomy, which rules out quite a
lot of the men sitting alongside Lamont yesterday. The Labour front bench,
with its liberal sprinkling of women, looked much more attractive.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Best news reserved for the elderly -
Personal Savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savers were never likely to be the focus of a Budget in the middle of a
recession, a time when the government wants voters to spend, not save.
The Labour party's plans to re-introduce the investment income surcharge may
have already forced many savers into the Conservative camp. Labour's
proposed 9 per cent surcharge would apply to savings income of more than
Pounds 3,000 per year of those below state retirement age.
So it is unsurprising, economically and electorally, that yesterday's
changes were fairly small. Easily the best news was for those elderly people
who depend on a small amount of company pension and savings, on top of their
state retirement benefit. Such people will particularly gain from the 20 per
cent tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable earnings.
The inflation-linked increases in income tax and capital gains tax
allowances and the slightly larger rise in the inheritance tax thresholds
will be welcome, but not unexpected news.
The cheeriest faces in the savings industry will belong to unit and
investment trust managers. They had long campaigned for the Personal Equity
Plan rules to be altered to allow them to compete on a level playing field;
now both types of investment schemes can qualify for the full Pounds 6,000
limit.
Previous Conservative chancellors had restricted the amount invested in unit
and investment trusts compared with direct investment in equities, on the
ground that the latter gave the saver a taste of 'real' capitalism.
The snag was that small investors were unlikely to achieve a good spread of
risk through direct investment in equities. Unit and investment trusts give
built-in diversification, and are likely to be the most sensible route for
most small investors to approach equity investment.
The change will also eliminate the loophole by which new issue investment
trusts had received the full Pounds 6,000 allowance. This had provoked a
flurry of investment trust launches towards the end of the 1991-1992 tax
year, and had biased the PEP industry towards investment, rather than unit,
trusts which did not qualify under the new issue rules.
Schroders ought to win a prize for quickest Budget reaction, announcing
plans for a full Pounds 6,000 unit trust PEP shortly after 6pm last night.
There will be few tears for the Business Expansion Scheme which went through
a number of rule changes before its most recent incarnation - a landlord's
tax shelter. The structures devised by the sponsors grew ever more ingenious
 -and the benefits to the British economy of this tax break ever more
dubious.
The tax incentives of the BES are so generous - relief at the highest
marginal rate - that there will inevitably be a stampede into schemes before
abolition at the end of 1993. An investor could invest Pounds 120,000 by
that date - and the great danger to savers could be that they rush into some
badly-managed schemes in their enthusiasm.
The new National Savings scheme which Mr Lamont announced is a hybrid, the
success of which will probably depend on the rates on offer when the first
bond is launched in July. Previously, National Savings products gave either
income and instant access, at a rate which was not guaranteed, or guaranteed
growth on products which required a five-year investment.
The new product, offering guaranteed income over a one-year period, might
capture a different market. But it will probably have to be highly
competitive with building society rates to persuade the cautious basic rate
taxpayer to switch.
The greatest danger to savers is inflation, and they will have to wait to
see whether the chancellor's hopes for a low-inflation 1990s are borne out.
Some economists believe that a PSBR of Pounds 28bn will be storing up
inflation for the future.
And it has yet to be seen whether the Budget will achieve another of the
chancellor's hopes - lower interest rates. Cuts in rates may be good news
for many but not for savers.
At least there were very few new gimmicks to entice savers to switch their
portfolios into untried products. And they now have to wait until the
election to see if any of Mr Lamont's modest reforms will be implemented.

economic data
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES followed overseas markets higher yesterday, but investors
remained somewhat hesitant ahead of the US economic data slated for release
later this week, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 15.87 up at 3,230.99, while rises led
declines by 1,069 to 625 after turnover of 203m shares. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 gained 1.68 to 406.89.
The equity rally came in spite of a dull treasury market, where the
benchmark 30-year bond fell  7/32 to 101 3/16 , yielding 7.89 per cent.
The transportation sector was particularly strong in the morning, with the
Dow Jones Transportation Average climbing 11.02 to 1,415.92 by 1pm before
receding to close only 3.17 ahead at 1,408.07. Delta Air Lines lost Dollars
 3/8 at Dollars 68 1/4 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, climbed Dollars 1
to Dollars 76 3/8 and CSX, the big US railroad company, shed Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 56 1/2 .
RJR Nabisco led trading for a second day on the NYSE, adding Dollars 1/4 at
Dollars 10 after analysts reiterated 'buy' recommendations on the issue. The
improvement came in spite of concern voiced by the American Medical
Association and the US Surgeon General over the company's Camel cigarette
advertising. Nabisco's critics believe that a cartoon character used in the
ads is more appealing to children than to adults.
AT&amp;T appreciated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 following an upgraded rating
from Brown Brothers Harriman.
Growth stocks such as Coca-Cola and Philip Morris gained momentum, rising
Dollars 1 to Dollars 81 1/8 and Dollars 1 to Dollars 77 respectively.
Travelers, one of the largest US composite insurers, firmed Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 20 after stating that it had added Dollars 300m to its capital base
through newly issued senior notes placed privately by Merrill Lynch. The
group, which has been hit by real estate investment problems, said the
proceeds will be added to the capital base of its principal life insurance
subsidiary.
In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite index registered a rise of
7.64 to 623.46.
Strong fourth-quarter profits growth from Dell Computer, the fast growing US
personal computer manufacturer, helped the stock climb Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 39 1/4 . The company turned in net income of 62 cents a share in the
latest quarter compared with 42 cents a year earlier. Dell also declared a
three-for-two stock split.
High-tech stocks continued to lead trading in the secondary market. Lotus
Development rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO blue chips followed the upturn in New York, but the broad market
remained weak. A decline in the Canadian dollar raised short-term interest
rates and made the market nervous.
The composite index gained 11.3 at 3,529.9, but declining issues were ahead
of advances by 310 to 257. Volume came to 26.4m shares.
Shares of thinly traded Ford Motor of Canada fell CDollars 3 to CDollars
147. The Argentine Economy Ministry and Argentina's automakers denied a
report that negotiations are under way to import 65,000 cars from a Ford
plant in Canada.
International Corona ended at CDollars 3.65, off 10 cents. The company
announced several financing plans, including swapping preferred 'B' shares
for convertible debentures; a CDollars 50m common share offering; a new
USDollars 50m gold loan; and the possible sale of some non-core US gold
assets.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rate hopes dashed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES EASED slightly during the day on the UK money markets but firmed at
the close as lingering hopes of a Budget day base rate cut were dashed.
Those hopes had been encouraged by a strengthening of sterling early in the
afternoon amid rumours that Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, would make
a commitment to taking the pound into the narrow ERM band.
This was reflected in a softening of money market rates - generally by  1/32
or  1/16 per cent - across the spectrum, until a rather mixed reaction from
the markets caused sterling to lose its earlier gains, making the
possibility of a rate cut even more remote.
The key three months interbank rate began at 10 7/16 -10 5/16 per cent and
then slipped as far as 10 5/16 -10 1/4 per cent. It firmed to 10 1/2 -10 3/8
per cent after the Budget.
The 12 months rate declined to 10 1/4 -10 1/8 per cent, from 10 5/16 -10
3/16 per cent, but later bounced back to 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent.
The Liffe March sterling contract went as high as 89.70 from 89.64, before
heading down to 89.55, while the June contract followed a similar pattern,
to end at 89.75.
Otherwise, there were few problems with liquidity, and the overnight rate,
which stood at around 10 per cent early in the day on expectations of a
fairly moderate shortage, fell quickly to 8-7 1/2 per cent after midday,
when the Bank of England moved to cover all of its revised shortfall by
purchasing Pounds 400m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
The Bank had initially forecast a shortage of around Pounds 350m, the main
factors draining liquidity from the system being treasury bills and maturing
assistance of Pounds 348m, and exchequer transactions of Pounds 150m. These
were partly compensated for by a fall in note circulation and above-target
bankers' balances.
German call money rates remained unchanged at around 9.60/65 per cent.
Dealers said the market was quiet, but call money rates were seen remaining
high as banks geared up for a heavy outflow of funds through tax payments
later this week.
The market was looking ahead to today's securities repurchase transaction,
hoping the Bundesbank would add between DM2bn and DM4bn. They predicted that
otherwise tight liquidity could mean call money rates reaching the Lombard
level of 9.75 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling retreats after Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING lost most of its earlier gains when the UK Budget met mixed
reactions in the market, and failed to deliver the hoped-for boost, writes
Neil Buckley.
The UK currency was the centre of attention for much of the day, although
the dollar climbed a little in late European trading on speculative buying
in a thin market.
Mr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank, said sterling fell back on
market worries about chancellor Mr Norman Lamont's prediction of a Pounds
28bn public sector borrowing requirement, and disappointment that he had
made no firm commitment to moving the UK currency into the narrow 2.25 per
cent band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Lamont said only that the move
would be made 'in due course'.
Rumours that a firm commitment would be made had taken sterling higher
against the D-Mark after a dull morning, reaching DM2.8725/50 shortly before
Mr Lamont's speech began. Afterwards, however, it dropped around half a
pfennig to DM2.8673/08, although this was still above its starting level of
DM2.8654/89. Against the top-placed peseta, it was once again at its ERM
floor.
Mr Austin added: 'The opinion polls in a few days will be the deciding
factor for sterling, but I do not think its fortunes will be much changed by
this Budget. There was a lot of fiddling around at the edges but nothing
headline-grabbing.'
The dollar, meanwhile, reached DM1.6705/15 from a DM1.6620 start, and gained
strongly on the yen to Y132.80/90 from Y132.30/40. In New York the US unit
finished at DM1.6710 and Y132.90.
Dealers said a major south-east Asian player and some New York funds had
been buying dollars.
The yen continued to be undermined by speculation that the Bank of Japan
would soon cut interest rates, possibly shortly after Mr Yasushi Mieno, bank
governor, returns from a visit to Europe today.
The US currency had crept higher against both the yen and the D-Mark in thin
Asian trading, hovering close to its Y132.20 resistance level.
Dealers said trading interest was limited ahead of the 'Super Tuesday' US
presidential primaries, although an expected victory by Mr George Bush over
challenger Mr Pat Buchanan would have little effect unless his share of the
vote was lower than 60 to 70 per cent.
In Europe, the D-Mark was little changed against most EMS currencies, but
rose against the yen to Y79.43 from Monday's Y79.34.
It was a touch firmer against the Belgian franc a day after Belgium
announced it was considering letting short-term interest rates drop below
equivalent German rates.
The D-Mark declined slightly against the Swiss franc, although dealers said
the Swiss National Bank's intervention last Friday seemed to have ended the
franc's slide for the moment.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: PSBR forecast rekindles fears over gilts
issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds dropped sharply on Mr Norman Lamont's Budget statement,
which forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn. The
forecast was well above market expectations, and rekindled worries about the
level of new issuance in the gilts market next year.
Gilts started the day on a strong note, helped by the firm US Treasury bond
market overnight. The market's strength allowed the Bank of England to sell
over Pounds 300m of the tap issues which it announced on Monday.
Three tranches were sold out: Pounds 100m of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock
due 1994; Pounds 100m of 9 3/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1998; and Pounds
100m of 9 1/2 per cent Conversion stock due 2005. The Bank also sold some of
the Pounds 200m tranche of 9 per cent Conversion stock due 2000.
However, the gilt market's gains were overturned by the Budget announcement
in the afternoon. Mr Lamont's forecast of a PSBR of Pounds 14bn for the
current financial year was higher than the expected figure of Pounds 12bn,
and his forecast of a PSBR of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93 was between Pounds 2bn
and Pounds 4bn higher than many City of London economists had predicted.
Traders warned that a PSBR of Pounds 28bn would mean gross gilts issuance of
about Pounds 35bn, or just under Pounds 3bn in gilts issuance a month in
1992-93, compared with an average of Pounds 1.3bn in the current tax year.
The Bank of England announced yesterday that in future it would increase the
size of its regular gilt auctions to Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn every other
month. In the past, it has issued between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn at
auction.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003-07 opened at 114 25/32 and
traded down to 114 1/8 by late afternoon. Among shorter-dated issues, the 10
per cent gilt due 1994 slipped from 100 3/4 to 100 as traders said prospects
for an early cut in interest rates had evaporated due to sterling's
weakness.
US TREASURY bonds drifted lower yesterday afternoon in exceptionally light
trading as the market continued to wait for the economic data scheduled for
release at the end of the week.
Although bargain-hunting helped bonds move sharply higher late on Monday,
the momentum failed to carry through to morning trading. The Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond edged  3/32 higher at mid-session but by late trading
had fallen  7/32 to 101 3/16 to yield 7.89 per cent. Shorter-dated
maturities posted slimmer losses.
The Federal Reserve refrained from entering the open market yesterday. Fed
Funds were changing hands at 3 7/8 per cent during the Fed's usual
intervention period.
Investors are expected to remain on the sidelines for a few more days ahead
of the release of a number of economic reports including retail sales, car
sales and chain store sales on Thursday and Friday.
On Friday, the US producer price index for February will be released.
Players expect the index to rise by 0.2 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds generally ended on a firmer note in the cash and
futures markets yesterday. However, traders said the benchmark No 129
underperformed the market as bondholders switched out of the issue to buy
the World Bank's new global yen bond.
The yield on the No 129 traded in a range of 5.40 per cent to 5.445 per cent
in Tokyo, and ended at 5.41 per cent, little changed on its opening level of
5.415 per cent.
Meanwhile, the June futures contract rose from its opening level of 102.32
to close at 102.40, the high of the day.
Dealers said the market was waiting for a cut in the Official Discount Rate
towards the end of this week or next.
THE GERMAN government bond market drifted back to close slightly lower in
light trading.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.55 and reached a high of 88.64
before closing at 88.49.
Only about 24,000 contracts were traded, well below average. Dealers said
the market was waiting for further developments on the wage front to give it
a clear direction.
Kokusai Securities, a mid-sized Japanese securities house, announced Tuesday
that it will close one branch and three sales offices to reduce costs.
The branch and one of the sales offices are located in Kobe, while the two
other sales offices are in Tokyo and Hokkaido.
Operations in Kobe will cease Friday, those in Tokyo end on March 23 and in
Hokkaido on April 19.

FT  11 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan to bring in financial
reform bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) yesterday approved financial
reform bills ahead of financial liberalisation to be implemented next year.
The changes include an easing of the controversial Article 65 of the
Securities and Exchange Law, the Japanese version of the US Glass Steagall
Act, which separates banking and securities industries.
Following the LDP's endorsement, the bills will be submitted to the current
Diet - parliament - session.
Under liberalised regulations, banks and brokerages, which currently can
only hold up to a 5 per cent stake in a company, will be able to enter each
other's businesses by acquiring more than a 50 per cent stake in a
securities house or banking affiliate.
Banks, however, will not be able to enter the lucrative stockbroking
business, and operations of affiliates will be limited to stock trading and
investment trust management.
Last year's spate of stock scandals has forced the Ministry of Finance to
include rules to limit irregular trading practices in the stock market in
the reform bills. Legislative changes will be made to allow the
establishment of a financial markets watchdog, and the tightening of
penalties imposed on violators of the Securities and Exchange Law.
Other changes include widening the definition of what a securities
instrument is to include, securitised housing loans and leasing mortgages
and commercial paper.
Barriers within the banking industry separating long-term credit banks,
commercial banks and credit unions will also be abolished, increasing
chances for mergers between various financial institutions.

FT  11 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Norway introduces Y50bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market was spread across a broad range of sectors
yesterday.
Following the success of the World Bank's first global offering in the
Euroyen market, lead manager IBJ brought a five-year deal for the Kingdom of
Norway. The Y50bn deal, fungible with an outstanding Y100bn deal, met some
pent up demand for the 10-year World Bank deal, but was mainly sold to a
different base, due to the difference in maturity.
The World Bank deal, which met strong demand particularly from European
investors, was priced yesterday at the tighter end of the indicated range,
at a spread of 19 basis points below the yield on the No 129 Japanese
government bond. The deal was already largely placed and tightened a little
further yesterday to around 20 basis points below the JGB yield.
In the French franc sector, the Republic of Finland issued a large FFr5bn
deal, via Banque Nationale de Paris. Finland is spreading its fund raising
activities across a broad range of markets in an effort to meet its heavy
borrowing schedule without deterring investors, given that the borrower is
considered a declining credit and faces serious economic problems. However,
the deal was considered quite generously priced at 35 basis points above the
comparable French government bond yield. Finland completed a successful deal
in the sterling market last week, which has somewhat blunted the memory of a
difficult Ecu transaction.
In the dollar sector, Credit Suisse First Boston launched a Dollars 300m
five-year deal for General Electric, the triple-A rated US company, which
was considered reasonably priced at 30 basis points above the five-year US
Treasury. Last week, CSFB launched several corporate deals in the dollar
sector which were considered very aggressively priced and suffered when the
market fell on data suggesting the economy was pulling out of recession.
Although prices have since rallied, the dollar market remains rather
difficult, with some uncertainty over the direction of interest rates.
However, there is still a broadly positive view on the dollar, which is
helping to support European demand.
The GE deal was bid at 99.85 at the end of trading, a little below its fixed
reoffer level of 99.91.
Elsewhere, the French government took the unusual step of adding to an
outstanding Ecu OAT issue through a block trade. An Ecu125m tranche was
added to the 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 1997, bringing the deal to a total close
to Ecu1bn. The deal had become rather illiquid and the French government was
keen to improve trading in the paper. However, the add-on was too small to
justify an auction, the usual method used by the French government to sell
OATs.
The block trade, arranged by Caisse des Depots, Societe Generale, Union Bank
of Switzerland and Warburg, was priced to yield 8.24 per cent, the level at
which the outstanding OAT was trading.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Communication, the publishing and entertainment group, produced a
modest first-quarter net profit of Dollars 18.4m, helped by earnings from
its Hollywood studio and from television and theatrical operations.
The profit for the three months to January 31 translates into 16 cents a
share and compares with a Dollars 7.3m loss for the same period a year ago.
In the 12 months to last October Paramount suffered a more than 50 per cent
drop in net income, to Dollars 122.2m or Dollars 1.03 a share.
Revenues for the first quarter of 1992 improved 19 per cent to Dollars
1.1bn.
At the operating level, Paramount's publishing business lost Dollars 29.7m
in the first fiscal quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 40.8m
in the same quarter a year ago.
The publishing loss was reduced thanks to gains in textbook and
international book sales.
The entertainment division earned Dollars 73.2m in operating profit in the
first quarter, up from Dollars 28.2m a year ago. The earnings were helped by
the box office success of two Paramount films: The Addams Family and Start
Trek VI, which together took in Dollars 180m.
Earnings were also lifted by home video, pay cable television and some
television stations. Television programming earned less than a year ago. The
renovated Madison Square Garden began contributing to profits in the first
fully operational period since its relaunch.
Mr Martin Davis, Paramount chairman, said the results were encouraging. But
Mr Davis is said by many in the entertainment industry to be casting about
for a new acquisition that would offer a lift to Paramount, which is
changing the strategy of its Hollywood studio under the new leadership of Mr
Brandon Tartikoff, a former NBC executive who joined last year.
On Wall Street, Paramount's share price declined by Dollars  1/8 to Dollars
47 1/8 at close of trading.

AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, has sold the remnants of its domestic

in last year to advise the German engineering company on how to get rid of
the loss-making business.
Mr Sievers will take over at the end of this year when the planned run-down
of manufacturing at Wilhelmshaven in north Germany is completed. The
company, currently AEG-Olympia, will be re-named Olympia Office.
The handover ensures the survival of one of the oldest brands in office
equipment although most of the jobs that Olympia provides will go.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for control of MGM, the Hollywood studio, took yet another turn
yesterday when a Delaware court confirmed in a ruling that Credit Lyonnais,
the French state bank, had acted properly to remove Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
the Italian financier, from the board of the financially-crippled MGM.
Credit Lyonnais also dismissed as irrelevant a claim by Mr Parretti last
weekend that a Rome judge had ordered the sequester of a controlling
shareholding of MGM.
Mr Parretti fell out with Credit Lyonnais last year after it emerged that
the French bank had secretly provided about Dollars 1bn of loans to back his
MGM takeover in 1990.
Last weekend, he claimed that a Rome judge had named the brother of Mr
Gianni De Michelis, Italy's Socialist foreign minister, as the new chairman
of MGM. Mr Parretti argued that the Rome court had jurisdiction over MGM,
but Credit Lyonnais yesterday said the actions taken in Italy 'should have
no effect on the direction, management or operation' of MGM, which is
incorporated in Delaware, not Italy.
'Mr Parretti's actions in Italy are a blatant effort to mislead the Italian
courts. His attempt to find a forum which will decide in his favour
constitutes no more than an unfortunate international public relations
game,' the bank said.
Credit Lyonnais in New York claimed Mr Parretti had consented to the entry
of the final Delaware court judgment against him, thereby conceding that he
had been properly removed from the MGM board.

CONTINENTAL Airlines is to add 71 daily departures between now and mid-June,

Continental added that it will begin service to four new destinations in
Latin America and Europe and add capacity on many of its best-performing
domestic and international routes.
Its system-wide daily departures will rise to 1,385 by mid-June from the
current 1,314.
Continental said that it has started hiring several hundred employees in
support of the new schedule. While the airline has traditionally increased
service for the busy summer season, it said most of this current expansion
would be permanent.

The Office of Thrift Supervision director Mr Timothy Ryan called it a

accounted for much of the improvement in fourth-quarter profits.
The fourth-quarter earnings compared with a revised third-quarter profit of

FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: De Beers disappoints with 20%
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African mining group which dominates the world's rough
(uncut) diamond market, announced yesterday a 20 per cent fall in 1991 net
attributable earnings, a result that slightly disappointed most analysts.
However, as expected, De Beers proposed a marginal increase in total
dividends, from 111.3 US cents per linked unit, to 112.1 cents.
Excluding the share of retained profits of associates, net attributable
profits were Dollars 763m or 201 cents per linked unit against Dollars 950m
or 250 cents.
Since March 1990 the group has split its operations into De Beers
Consolidated in South Africa and De Beers Centenary in Switzerland and
shareholders hold linked units.
Including the share of retained profits of associates, combined earnings
fell from Dollars 1.317bn or 347 cents to Dollars 1.078bn or 283 cents.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said it was encouraging that De Beers
sales of rough diamonds were down by only 6 per cent from the 1990 level and
'that the combined profits of De Beers/Centenary have held up as well as
they have'.
He would give no forecast for 1992 but said world diamond cutting centres
were in a sound financial position and retail diamond stocks were not
believed not to be high.
The combined diamond account at Dollars 803m, against the previous year's
figure of Dollars 911m, showed a 12 per cent decrease.
Analysts said diamond margins were squeezed from 21.9 per cent to 20.4 per
cent last year, indicating the tough conditions.
As part of its self-imposed role of stabilising the market, De Beers built
up its diamond stocks by Dollars 350m to Dollars 3.034bn.
Combined income from investments outside the diamond industry was lower at
Dollars 212m, against Dollars 227m, and interest income was Dollars 209m,
compared with Dollars 282m, reflecting lower cash balances. Prospecting and
research expenditure came to Dollars 116m, against a figure of Dollars 114m
and interest paid was higher at Dollars 67m compared with Dollars 36m.
Taxation absorbed an unchanged Dollars 254m, leaving a combined profit after
tax of Dollars 779m (Dollars 983m).
The combined share of retained profits of associates was Dollars 315m
against Dollars 367m, while the combined share of extraordinary losses of
associated companies - mainly De Beers' share of write-offs by Minorco was
amounted to Dollars 106m, against a profit of Dollars 112m.

JOHN Labatt, the Canadian brewing and consumer products group, said brewing

Third-quarter earnings before non-recurring charges and taxes were CDollars

nine-month period in 1991, the sector reported earnings of CDollars 140m
against CDollars 106m in 1990.
Brewing sales rose 7 per cent in the quarter and 8 per cent in the nine
months.
Canadian brewing operations had an average market share of 42.3 per cent for
the nine months, up 0.5 per cent from a year ago.
Molson, the diversified Canadian brewer, said it appointed Mr John Carroll
as executive chairman of Molson Breweries, the North American brewing
partnership with Foster's Brewing Group, Reuter reports.
Mr Carroll, currently president and CEO of Molson Breweries (Canada)
succeeds Mr Ted Kunkel, who is returning to Australia to become chief

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Richard Lines resigns from MTM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD LINES, the chairman and founder of MTM resigned yesterday
following a tumultuous week in which the speciality chemical manufacturer's
market value fell by more than two thirds as a result of two profits
warnings.
Mr Tom Baxter, the finance director, will also step down following
completion of the audit of the 1991 results, the publication of which has
been delayed by protracted discussions with the auditors.
The resignations end a stormy relationship between Mr Lines and his City
backers who have questioned some of MTM's less-than-conservative accounting
policies. Many institutions also objected to Mr Lines' autocratic management
style.
'He did not have a very high opinion of people in the City,' said one
analyst. 'He was an example of the kind of people running public companies
who would rather be running a private company.'
The company gave no explanation as to why Mr Lines had resigned. The
resignations leave shareholders with no clearer idea of the value of their
company's assets or the 1991 profits which MTM will now release on March 31.
The share price closed at the end of the day down 14p at 105p.
Mr Donald Mackay will become non-executive chairman. He has been a
non-executive director since 1986 and a former director of finance at ICI
Chemicals and Polymers.
The board is otherwise unchanged from February 2 when MTM told the markets,
institutions and apparently Robert Fleming, its merchant bankers, that the
only disagreement with its auditors was over application of accounting
policy.
The disagreement, MTM said, had no impact on trading profits or on the
company's cash position. Last Monday MTM followed this statement with an
apparently contradictory second announcement that said trading profits would
be significantly below City expectations.

RANDSWORTH Acquisition, a property company with a Pounds 350m portfolio of
West End offices and shops, has gone into administrative receivership.
Randsworth was bought by JMB Realty Corporation, a Chicago-based fund, for
Pounds 258m at the peak of the property market in July 1989. Its move into
the UK, which reflected the relatively high returns available, was highly
unusual for a US investor.
Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick who have been
appointed administrative receivers, said they intended to avoid any fire
sales.
'It is our present intention to permit the operating subsidiaries to
continue through their existing management with a view to enhancing their
long term value,' said Mr Hayward.
The main operating sub-sidiary is London and Provincial Shop Centres Group.
Its accounts for the year to June 30 were 'qualified by the auditors as to
whether preparation on a going-concern basis is appropriate because the
company and certain other group companies have failed to make capital and
interest payments to their bankers'.
The appointment of administrative receivers comes at the end of several
months of discussions between the shareholders and its bankers, chiefly
Citibank.
Mr Hayward said the portfolio had been acquired on a highly leveraged basis.
He estimated that the debts were between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lead actor leaves stage of hidden drama -
The background to MTM's recent profit warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE could hardly have been a worse way for MTM to break bad news to the
market.
Within one week the speciality chemicals manufacturer has twice had to issue
a profits warning. Mr Richard Lines, the chairman, chose to describe the
first as the result of a difference of opinion between MTM and its auditors
over asset valuation that would not affect trading profits.
By Monday, however, MTM announced that trading profits would indeed be lower
than the City expected.
MTM's shares fell to a third of their value a fortnight earlier, and
shareholders were not in the least surprised yesterday when Mr Lines
resigned.
About the only clear picture to emerge from the uncertainty surrounding the
past week is of Mr Lines, the MTM board and its merchant bank, Robert
Fleming, with varying quantities of egg on their faces.
Certainly shareholders have no clear view about the underlying health of
MTM, which Mr Lines founded in 1979 and built into one of the fastest
growing stocks of the 1980s.
And despite assurances from Mr Chris Swinson, national managing partner of
Binder Hamlyn, MTM's auditors, that 'the problems have not changed' between
announcements, analysts remained convinced that something dramatic had
happened last week to change the company's view on 1991 trading profits.
The auditors are concerned about MTM's valuation of its assets.
Specifically, MTM capitalises development expenditures and process
development costs as well as the interest on construction projects.
While this is fairly common practice among large companies MTM is a
relatively small company growing quickly, and this treatment had a material
impact on the reported profits.
The 1989 pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.3m could have been cut to Pounds 5.8m,
had process development costs and capitalised interest been taken through
the profit and loss account as an expense and not capitalised.
Likewise, in 1990, profits of Pounds 13.6m would have been only Pounds 11.3m
had the company applied a more conservative accounting policy.
But the City already knew about this accounting treatment and had warned
shareholders. MTM's shares tended to trade at a discount to the sector
reflecting this waryness about the accounting.
What is more, these two items were only expected to have boosted profits by
about Pounds 2.3m in 1991 out of profits forecast at Pounds 23m.
One possible explanation for what has been a dreadful case of bad
communication is that trading profits in their purest sense were not
affected in 1991. The auditors might this year, however, have chosen to
treat some capitalised costs as operating costs. By the auditors' reckoning,
therefore, trading profit would be lower.
This would not, however, explain why the company's second announcement
talked of trading profits being 'significantly' below City expectations of
Pounds 23m.
Another possible explanation put forward by analysts was that MTM has faced
a problem commissioning a plant and the auditors want the extra cost to be
treated as an operating cost and not capitalised.
Mr Lines set up MTM - then called Marlborough Technical Management - in 1979
as a consultancy to the chemicals industry. The foundations for growth were
two fine chemicals manufacturing projects which he set up from scratch and
sold very quickly making a Pounds 1m profit from each.
Marlborough's rapid growth caught the attention of ICI, where Mr Lines had
spent 11 years, and the UK's largest quoted company set up a joint venture
in which MTM had a 51 per cent stake.
It quickly developed a substantial business supplying the fine chemical
ingredients to large pharmaceuticals companies and came to the market with a
bang in 1986 with a market capitalisation of Pounds 40m.
Growth sprang from a substantial capital expenditure programme and Mr Lines'
undoubted ability to 'do a deal', analysts say. Between flotation and 1990,
the group spent Pounds 120m on acquisitions and Pounds 71m on fixed assets,
issuing in the process Pounds 93m of its paper. At its peak in mid-February
MTM's market capitalisation had risen to Pounds 256m.
Following his resignation yesterday, Mr Lines insisted that the application
of accounting policies was a technical matter, and in any event had a 'one
off' impact. MTM was profitable, demand in 1992 remained strong and the
market's reaction was overdone.
His plea for the City to support what he called 'one of the few successful
manufacturing companies in Britain in the last two decades' came, however,
too late.

FT  11 MAR 92 / HSBC earnings rise 83% as subsidiaries improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings, the London holding company of the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank's worldwide assets, yesterday reported an 83 per cent growth in
earnings - after tax and transfers to secret inner reserves - to a record
HKDollars 5.66bn (Pounds 424.2m).
The result compares with earnings of HKDollars 3.1bn in 1990, and a previous
record profit of HKDollars 4.77bn in 1989.
The bank's earnings were at the upper end of analysts' expectations and Mr
William Purves, chairman, quashed rumours of a rights issue saying he did
not think the bank would go to shareholders this year.
But he would not preclude 'spinning off' the bank's main subsidiary,
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, which consists of the bank's Asian and Pacific
assets. 'But this is not on the agenda and has not been put before the
board,' he said.
Mr Purves also scotched rumours of a European acquisition. He said the bank
was interested in forging an alliance with a European bank along the lines
of its successful relationship with Wells Fargo in the US.
He said the bank was having discussions with a number of continental
European banks, but he did not hold out hope of any imminent agreement.
Hongkong Bank remained a long-term holder of its near 15 per cent stake in
Midland Bank, the UK clearer, he said.
Mr Purves thought the outlook in 1992 was uncertain, particularly for the
main industrial nations. However, he expected Hong Kong and east Asia to
maintain their momentum and grow faster than the rest of the world.
He predicted dividend growth of at least 8 per cent this year. Directors
declared a final HKDollars 1.31 a share dividend which, with the interim of
54 cents, makes HKDollars 1.85 for the year - up 19.7 per cent on 1990's
payout.
Hong Kong banking law allows banks to maintain hidden reserves and they
therefore do not report their true profits. However, Mr Purves denied that
the bank manipulated its profits and said it had attempted to give a picture
of the trend in profits growth. The bank faces full disclosure by 1994 at
the latest, as required by European banking law.
The source of growth in the bank's reported profits seems to have come
mainly from the effect of lower losses in its US and Australian
subsidiaries. The difference between these losses in 1991 compared with 1990
added more than HKDollars 2.2bn to the bank's 1991 profit.
Mr Purves said Hongkong Bank's Asian operations - mainly Hong Kong -
reported improved results. He said the bank's profits derived from the
colony were in line with what other Hong Kong banks had reported -
indicating a 30 per cent profit improvement at least.
The bank's main subsidiary in the Middle East, the British Bank of the
Middle East, lifted profits 20 per cent to Pounds 37.4m from Pounds 31.1m.

FT  11 MAR 92 / A model of UK's industrial pattern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is that Glynwed International has withstood the worst of the
recession. The bad news is that it cannot tell exactly when better times
will come.
To monitor Glynwed is to monitor the movement of the British economy, so
diverse are its interests. To watch Glynwed is to see in microcosm a
shifting in the pattern of national manufacturing industry: the move towards
more exports and the move away from cyclical markets to those perceived to
offer prospects for growth.
In 1987, 16.7 per cent of Glynwed's turnover was generated overseas. This
climbed to 32.7 per cent in the record year of 1990 and slipped last year to
31.8 per cent - still worth around Pounds 300m.
Glynwed was the archetypal metal basher. Even now it is part of the metals
and metal-forming sector of the stock exchange. But it sees its brightest
prospects in the growth of an international plastics business. The only
problem is that the funds for new investment have to come from selling off
traditional businesses and it is difficult to fatten up companies for
disposal in a recession.
The attraction of plastics is clear. The sector was the last into the
recession. Healthy demand from the water industry and steady buying from the
gas industry, as infrastructure projects went ahead, meant that the plastics
share of Glynwed's 1991 pre-tax profits - Pounds 20.5m against Pounds 24.5m
in 1990 - held up better than any division except property.
In fact, Glynwed has been feeling the effects of recession, first in a mild
form and then more acutely, since August 1988 when the demand for consumer
products, especially domestic cookers - Glynwed makes the Flavel, Aga and
Rayburn brands - began to turn down. Then, in May 1989, it was the turn of
building materials, such as copper tubing.
By spring 1990, the steel business was beginning to feel the strain. By the
end of the year, iron products used in the commercial, non-housing,
construction industry were caught in the recessionary trap. Steel tube
demand fell off at the same time.
Throughout 1990, Glynwed saw the slide in demand for products used in
capital equipment. Then last year, plastics became a cause for concern while
there was also a reduction in the demand for steel used in the motor
industry, the full implications of which are not yet clear.
But as these sectors moved down the economic cycle, others began to move up.
In the second half of last year, there were signs of improvement in the
consumer products section of Glynwed's business. The return on capital
employed for 1991 was 22 per cent compared with 35 per cent for plastics and
a meagre 12.4 per cent for the group as a whole.
It was tempting to think that the first sectors into recession would be the
first out, and that there would be as even a movement back to prosperity as
there had been out of it. But the reality will probably be more complex.
Overall, the market is not improving, Mr Gareth Davies, chairman, made clear
yesterday.
But Glynwed's health probably will be improving. Like other UK engineering
companies struggling for a position in increasingly harsh international
markets, it has been cutting costs. It has also been seeking to enhance its
competitive position. It has been making provisions in its 1991 accounts for
losses it expects to occur in 1992. It has been bringing in new capacity and
rationalising its copper tube operations. It has been selling off businesses
where it cannot hope to be market leader - metals distribution in Canada,
for example. It has been cutting wages and salaries bills.
The immediate effect was that last year Glynwed had a net cash inflow of
Pounds 9.7m compared with a net outflow in 1990 of Pounds 8.3m. That in turn
led to a reduction in the group's debt burden to Pounds 82.6m from Pounds
92.3m at the end of 1990. The amount of debt, as a proportion of the group's
equity, is expected to be stable in 1992 at just under 40 per cent.
The hope is that the combined effect of Glynwed's financial and industrial
measures will provoke a much faster response, in terms of profits, to any
upturn on the market.
'I do believe that when it (the upturn) starts to happen, it will not need
much movement, especially on the consumer products side, to see profits come
through,' said Mr Davies.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Glynwed holds payout as profits decline: UK engineering
group's shares rise as market sees signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED International, the UK engineering group, is holding its 1991
dividend at 1990 levels in spite of its worst trading figures since the
recession of the early 1980s.
The immediate response to a fall in Glynwed's 1991 pre-tax profits to Pounds
25.5m from Pounds 70.3m earned in 1990 was to push the shares up by 14p to
239p, giving a value to the group approaching Pounds 500m.
Glynwed is scooping Pounds 15.3m out of its reserves to pay a final dividend
of 7.5p, bringing total payments to shareholders for 1991 of 11.65p, and to
cover the costs of lopping off sections of its recession-hit business.
But the market took that as a sign of confidence that manufacturing industry
in general is readying itself for more prosperous times.
The profit figures were no worse than analysts had predicted. The range of
Glynwed's interests, from up-market Aga stoves through copper tubing to
plastic micro-irrigation systems, mean the group is exposed to a wide range
of economic sectors, especially in the UK which accounts for nearly 70 per
cent of turnover.
Glynwed's trading in the second half of 1991 was better than in the first
half: pre-tax profits were 45 per cent higher. The management has been
assaulting costs which could mean savings of up to Pounds 20m this year.
Although the shake-out in manufacturing industry has not been on the scale
of the early 1980s, the assault has been painful. Over the past year, the
number of Glynwed's employees has fallen to about 12,000 people from 13,715.
More than 1,400 of the jobs lost have been in the UK.
'I believe that the beneficial effects of the actions already taken should
ensure that profitability of 1992, particularly in the second half of the
year, will be appreciably better than in 1991,' said Mr Gareth Davies,
chairman.
Yet the qualification in Mr Davies's statement to the stock exchange made it
clear Glynwed at least is not basing its future plans on hopes of an
immediate economic revival.
'The group's prospects for 1992 depend less on expectations of any
improvement in market conditions than on the consequences of the
considerable work done - mainly during the past year but with more to come -
to cut costs and improve the efficiency of operations,' he said.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Late payers of invoices
targeted - Debt Recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PACKAGE of measures were announced to help tackle the problem of late
payment experienced by many small companies and to encourage businesses to
adopt the good practice of government departments in making prompt payment
to suppliers.
The government will require large companies to state in their annual report
and accounts how quickly they pay their bills.
Simpler procedures will be introduced for small claims and debt recovery
cases.
Prime contractors of government departments must include a clause in their
sub-contracts committing themselves to pay subcontractors promptly -
ordinarily within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice.
In addition the Department of Employment will provide up to Pounds 90,000
for three trade associations to run one-year pilot schemes to provide 'late
payment hotlines' for their members.
The chancellor said the government had every sympathy with small companies
which found that their larger debtors were deliberately delaying payment to
boost their own cash flow.
Government departments had a good record in paying their own bills on time
and the government hoped the example it had set would be followed by large
companies throughout the private sector.
Company accounts. The government proposes to amend the Companies Act 1985 to
require large companies to state in their annual reports and accounts how
quickly they pay their bills.
Court procedures. Small traders who either sue, or are sued, for debts of
Pounds 1,000 or less will benefit from continuing improvements to the quick,
informal, 'do-it-yourself' small-claims arbitration procedure under which
the loser does not risk being required to pay the winner's legal costs.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Monthly returns rule to
be changed - Large Traders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced that large traders would not be required to submit
monthly VAT returns from autumn 1992. Instead, they will be required to make
monthly VAT payments on account from October 1992; they will continue to be
required to render VAT returns quarterly.
Provision for monthly payments on account will be made in the Finance Bill
and present legislation will not be used.
From January 1 1993, for most Single Market goods, there will no longer be a
requirement for businesses to submit official documents at the time of
importation or to pay (or defer) the VAT due on goods before they are
released from Customs' charge.
VAT due on purchases from another member state will be accounted for under
the Postponed Accounting System (PAS) on the businesses' usual VAT return.
The PAS arrangement will mean that businesses no longer have to fund the tax
payment for imports before they are able to reclaim the tax as an input tax
deduction under the normal rules. This will give an advantage to businesses
engaged in intra-Community trade.
The postponed accounting arrangement means, however, that in the fiscal year
1992-93 there will be a considerable shortfall to the Exchequer. This is
because businesses will not be paying import VAT at the time of importation
(or up to six weeks later under the present system of deferring payment). To
offset this cost, very large VAT payers will be required to make payments on
account for each of the first two months of every quarter.
Very large traders are those who currently make quarterly VAT returns and
payments and whose total VAT liability exceeded Pounds 2m over the period
covered by their last four quarterly returns up to and including March 31
1991.
The chancellor has agreed that monthly VAT payments on account will be
required, instead of monthly returns and payments, with the first payments
on account due in the month of November, December or January depending on
the timing of the VAT returns cycle for each trader.
The chancellor also proposes to raise by Pounds 50 a month the level below
which deductions under Pay As You Earn and National Insurance contributions
can be paid quarterly rather than monthly. For deductions made in periods
beginning after April 5 1992 employers will be able to pay quarterly if
their average monthly payments are less than Pounds 450.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Reforms will help small
family companies - Inheritance Tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Budget proposals for inheritance tax are for an increase in the higher
rate of business and agricultural relief from 50 per cent to 100 per cent,
an increase in the lower rate of business and agricultural relief from 30
per cent to 50 per cent, and treating companies on the Unlisted Securities
Market (USM) like unquoted companies.
The proposed measures will benefit about 2,000 businesses and farms a year,
many of them small family concerns, enabling many of them to be inherited
free of any inheritance tax charge.
Business and agricultural relief reduces the value of business assets and
farmland for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes. The current rates of relief are
30 per cent or 50 per cent, depending on the type of asset or the beneficial
interest.
Under the chancellor's proposals the new 100 per cent rate will apply to
interests in unincorporated businesses, holdings above 25 per cent in
unquoted companies, holdings above 25 per cent in USM companies,
owner-occupied farmlands and farm tenancies.
The new 50 per cent rate will apply to controlling holdings in fully quoted
companies, holdings of 25 per cent or less without control in unquoted
companies, holdings of 25 per cent or less without control in USM companies,
certain assets owned by partners and used in their partnership or owned by
controlling shareholders and used in their company, and interests of
landlords in let farmland.
At present controlling holdings in USM companies qualify for 50 per cent
relief and other holdings get no relief. Under the Chancellor's proposals
USM holdings of more than 25 per cent will be eligible for relief at 100 per
cent and smaller holdings will qualify for relief at 50 per cent.
Controlling holdings in fully quoted companies at present qualify for 50 per
cent relief. This will remain unchanged.
The changes to business and agricultural relief will apply to tax charges
arising on or after March 10 1992.
The changes will apply both to transfers of value made on or after March 10
1992 and to charges or further charges arising on a death on or after March
10 1992 in respect of a transfer of value made before that date.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Traders will face
reduced penalties - VAT Fines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER substantial reductions in VAT penalties were announced by the
chancellor. He also announced the publication of a consultation paper on
possible further, longer term reform of Serious Misdeclaration Penalty.
From March 11 1992 he proposes to reduce the rate of Serious Misdeclaration
Penalty, the penalty affecting traders who make errors in their VAT returns,
from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.
Also from March 11, when liability to a penalty is established, Customs will
not normally impose one unless the net tax underdeclared or overclaimed
exceeds Pounds 2,000 in a prescribed accounting period.
The cost of the changes to Serious Misdeclaration Penalty is estimated at
Pounds 25m in 1992-93. About 75 per cent of penalties currently assessed are
for misdeclarations below Pounds 2,000.
The chancellor also proposes to reduce the maximum rate of Default Surcharge
to 20 per cent. Default Surcharge applies to businesses which are late in
rendering returns and paying tax due, thus incurring a default. The new
maximum rate will apply to defaults incurred on or after April 1 1992.
Tax appeals
The chancellor proposes to give the Special Commissioners powers to award
costs where either party has acted wholly unreasonably in pursuing a tax
appeal. The Special Commissioners will also be given powers to publish their
decisions. Procedural rules for the hearing of tax appeals by the General
and the Special Commissioners will also be introduced. These changes are
planned to come into effect in April 1993.
The rules will aim to preserve the present informality of appeal hearings
before the General Commissioners, who hear the majority of tax appeals.
Hearings before the Special Commissioners, who normally hear only larger and
more complex appeals, are generally more formal and this will be reflected
in the rules.
The rules will give the Special Commissioners powers to award costs where
either party has acted wholly unreasonably in making, pursuing or resisting
an appeal. But as before, costs will not be awarded in hearings before the
General Commissioners. This will allow taxpayers to have their appeal heard
by the General Commissioners with no risk that costs may be awarded against
them.
Taxpayers will be able to choose to have their appeal heard by the Special
Commissioners, and to apply for costs if they win. The Special Commissioners
could also award costs against a taxpayer.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Businesses facing higher
bills set to gain - Uniform Business Rate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS ratepayers who face higher rate bills as a result of the 1990
business rate reforms will be the main beneficiaries next year of important
changes to the rating system transitional arrangements announced by the
chancellor in the Budget.
Businesses whose bills fell but who are still in transition to their lower
rates bill will benefit from receiving their gains more quickly.
The Uniform Business Rate was introduced in 1990. This reform meant that the
rate poundage cannot rise by more than inflation, and local authorities
cannot determine rate bills.
The introduction of the UBR was accompanied by the first general revaluation
since 1973. This revaluation meant sizeable changes in the rates bills
attached to individual premises and the transitional arrangements were
designed to phase these changes in. They were self-financing, so that both
losses were postponed and gains delayed.
The measures announced in the Budget change these transitional arrangements
to cancel the real increases in rate bills in 1992-93 faced by those moving
towards higher bills and to accelerate the gains for those who are moving
towards lower bills.
Existing transitional arrangements
The existing transitional arrangements mean that businesses which face much
higher rate bills, as a result of the 1990 non-domestic revaluation and the
introduction of the uniform business rate, have their year-on-year increases
limited to 20 per cent in real terms for larger premises, 15 per cent for
other small premises and 10 per cent for small premises with living
accommodation attached. At present this transitional protection is lost if
the occupier of the property changes.
Under the existing arrangements the cost of this protection is met by
limiting the gains of those whose rate bills are lower under the new system.
For 1992-93, this would have meant that large premises in downward
transition would have seen reductions in their bills limited to 19 per cent
in real terms and small premises would have seen their reductions limited to
24 per cent. The transitional arrangements remain in force until the next
non-domestic revaluation which will take effect on April 1 1995.
The Budget changes
The effects of the changes to these transitional arrangements announced in
the chancellor's statement are:
businesses in transition towards higher bills will face no increase in real
terms in 1992-93. The existing limits on real annual increases will apply
again for 1993-94;
transitional protection will continue to apply to business premises even if
the occupier or owner subsequently changes;
the maximum reduction for businesses in transition towards lower bills will
be 3 percentage points higher than previously announced. These businesses
will receive all their remaining gains in 1993-94.
The government will bring forward legislation to make these changes as soon
as practicable. Non-domestic rate bills issued by local authorities will
stand until the legislation comes into force. The changes will, when they
take effect, be backdated to March 11 (in the case of the change of occupier
rule) or April 1 (in the case of the change in transitional limits).
The arrangements described above apply also to Wales, which has a similar
non-domestic rate system to England. In Scotland and in Northern Ireland,
which each have their different systems, rate bills in 1992-93 will be
reduced on average broadly in proportion to the reduction in England, ie by
3 1/4 per cent. The revenue cost on a UK basis of the business rate measures
announced in the Budget is Pounds 480m in 1992-93, Pounds 590m in 1993-94,
and Pounds 390m in 1994-95. About 900,000 premises will benefit.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Easing in rules for
using cash accounting - VAT Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced a relaxation of the conditions for using cash
accounting from April 1 1992. Under this scheme companies with a turnover of
not more than Pounds 300,000 can account for VAT on the basis of cash paid
and received, rather than invoices.
In future, businesses will be able to use the scheme if their total amount
of outstanding VAT is Pounds 5,000 or less; currently the limit is Pounds
1,000. Businesses which have been unable to pay their VAT because of bad
debts or because they are obliged to give their customers extended periods
of credit will therefore benefit from this increase.
Cash accounting was introduced in 1987. At present, small businesses cannot
take part in the scheme if their total amount of outstanding VAT is more
than Pounds 1,000.
Arrangements should be made with Customs to clear the debt; if these have
not been agreed proposals should be included with applications to join the
scheme.
A total of 135,000 businesses already use cash accounting out of around
400,000 which would be likely to benefit from doing so.
Registration move
The limits for VAT registration and cancellation of registration are
proposed to be increased in line with inflation. The annual registration
limit is being increased in line with inflation from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds
36,600.
The limit for those considering cancellation of their registration will be
increased in line with inflation from Pounds 33,600 to Pounds 35,100 from
May 1 1992.
Help for charities
A package of further VAT reliefs, worth up to Pounds 3m in a full year, was
proposed for charities and handicapped persons. From April 1 1992, these
changes will take effect:
zero-rating will be allowed for the repair and maintenance of equipment used
by the 'Talking Books for the Blind' service;
zero-rating will be extended to the provision of toilet facilities in any
charity-run building used for charitable purposes;
zero-rating will be extended to boats built or substantially adapted for use
by the handicapped;
zero-rating will be extended to spare parts and accessories supplied to sea
rescue charities.
Gift rules changed
VAT registered traders who wish to make donations of goods or assets to
educational establishments should in future have to account for VAT only on
the current value of such items.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Relief to be made easier
prior to abolition - Business Expansion Scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS proposed:
that the termination of Business Expansion Scheme tax relief for private
rented housing at the end of December 1993 should be confirmed;
that the remainder of the scheme for trading companies should come to an end
at the same time;
that the BES rules should be amended to make it easier for companies to use
the BES for mortgage rescue schemes;
that a further minor amendment should be made to make it easier for
companies to use the BES while having a property management subsidiary;
that the mortgage rescue change should take effect from yesterday; while
that for property management companies should be backdated to the beginning
of the scheme.
Tax relief is available under the BES for investment in unquoted trading
companies and companies providing private rented housing.
The relief for private rented housing runs only until the end of December
1993. The chancellor proposes that the relief for unquoted trading companies
should also end then, thus terminating the whole BES relief at the end of
1993.
Mortgage rescue schemes
A property is currently excluded from the BES where the BES company entered
into arrangements for letting it before acquisition, where it is let at any
time on the day the company acquires it, or other than on a qualifying
tenancy after the company acquires it.
These conditions make it difficult to arrange mortgage rescues which qualify
for BES relief since owner-occupiers generally want to know they can stay on
as tenants before agreeing to sell their homes.
The conditions will be relaxed in cases where a BES company acquires a
property from an owner-occupier and grants a qualifying tenancy of that
property to the former owner (in all such cases, and not just those
involving mortgage rescue schemes) This will make it easier to operate
mortgage rescue schemes without jeopardising BES tax relief.
Property management companies
A minor amendment to the BES rules will be made so that, subject to certain
conditions, the existence of a property management subsidiary will not
prevent a BES company from coming within the scope of the relief.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Tax and spending
proposals to be presented together - White Paper on Budgetary Reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced that the government has decided to change the
annual budget timetable so that tax and spending proposals can in future be
presented to Parliament at the same time. This will enable all concerned -
Parliament, the public, and government - to consider spending proposals
alongside the tax proposals needed to pay for them.
From December I993, the chancellor proposes to make one Budget Statement to
Parliament a year, covering both the government's tax plans for the coming
tax year and the government's spending plans for the next three years. This
will replace the March Budget and the Autumn Statement. The Finance Bill
will be published in January and the rest of the timetable will be brought
forward.
The current practice is for the chancellor to announce the government's
public spending plans in the November Autumn Statement, and to present his
full Budget proposals in March, just before the start of the financial year.
Revenue and expenditure are brought together in the various projections
shown in the Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR), notably in the
medium term financial strategy. In the case of expenditure, however, these
projections are based on departmental spending plans which have been in the
public domain for several months. Attention therefore tends to focus on the
tax proposals, and their link with previously announced spending proposals
is easily overlooked.
This two-stage budgetary process is a relatively recent development, with
few parallels in other developed countries. Until the 1960s, the Budget was
the occasion for presenting both tax and spending proposals to Parliament,
though the detailed Estimates and the financial secretary's memorandum on
public spending were normally laid before the House somewhat earlier.
In the late 1960s, however, governments began to publish an annual public
expenditure White Paper a few months before the Budget, usually in December
or January. This reflected reforms to the system of planning public
expenditure, after the 1961 Plowden report, and, in particular, the need to
make allocations to individual spending authorities well before the start of
the financial year. One consequence was to open up a significant gap between
the announcement of spending and tax proposals, since governments continued
to present their main tax proposals close to the beginning of the tax year
to which they related.
The separation of tax and spending announcements was criticised in the early
I980s by the Armstrong Committee on Budgetary Reform (1980) and by the
Treasury and Civil Service Committee (TCSC; 1982). In its reply to the TCSC,
the government said it accepted 'the desirability of bringing together
decisions on public expenditure, tax and borrowing, in such a way as to
facilitate Parliamentary and public debate and to assist that debate by
bringing out clearly the issues involved'.
The government was, however, concerned that tax changes announced several
months before the start of the tax year might be overtaken by events.
Nevertheless the introduction of the Autumn Statement in 1982 went part of
the way to meet the committee's recommendations. This was followed, over a
period of years, by substantial revisions to the form, timing and content of
the government's financial reports to Parliament.
During the 1980s these changes led to the earlier publication of
progressively more detailed information about public expenditure plans. This
was welcomed by the TCSC and the public accounts committee (PAC). But it had
the effect of accentuating the two stage nature of the budgetary timetable.
In recent years, important announcements about public expenditure and
taxation have usually been separated by four months, compared with two
months or less in the 1960s and 1970s.
The case for change
There are a number of obvious disadvantages in splitting the timetable for
public spending and taxation announcements in this way. Spending plans are
not presented alongside the tax proposals needed to pay for them. And it
means that, at the time of the Budget, the public spending proposals from
the previous Autumn are taken as given, with attention focusing solely on
tax measures, or sometimes on any additions to the plans already announced.
The government continues to think it right to announce its public spending
plans for the year ahead well before the start of the financial year. This
is essential for the wide range of public bodies who manage their own
budgets and need time to draw up their own plans. These include local
authorities. nationalised industries, health authorities, funding councils
and many others, as well as government departments, such as the Scottish and
Welsh Offices and the Northern Ireland departments, who operate block
budgets and have substantial freedom to decide their own allocation of
resources.
Bringing forward the announcement of tax proposals would mean taking
decisions on the basis of less complete information about the current year's
outturn, and against the background of short term economic forecasts which
may need to be updated before the beginning of the financial year. However,
even estimates and forecasts published in March are inevitably subject to a
wide margin of uncertainty.
Having reviewed the evidence, the government has concluded that, while there
may be a small cost in taking decisions on less up-to-date information, this
is likely to be substantially outweighed by the advantages of bringing tax
and spending announcements together.
The government sees four main advantages in moving to a unified Budget:
Ministers will be better able to judge the merits of public spending
proposals in the light of the overall fiscal position and the implications
for taxation.
Bringing together decisions on revenue and expenditure will make it easier
to present the government's fiscal proposals in a coherent and consistent
way.
Improved presentation should contribute to a more informed and focused
debate in Parliament and among the general public on the choices and
trade-offs between public expenditure, taxation and borrowing.
Earlier announcement of the government tax proposals and introduction of the
Finance Bill should help taxpayers in planning their own affairs and will
reduce the administrative burden on employers in implementing tax and
National Insurance contributions (NICs) changes.
In the government's view these substantial advantages are likely to outweigh
the potential disadvantages of delaying slightly the publication of the main
departmental spending plans and of making tax proposals some way ahead of
the start of the new financial year.
Implications of December Budget
Starting in December 1993, the chancellor's Budget Statement to Parliament
will cover tax proposals for the year ahead, and spending proposals for the
next three years. It will be accompanied by the detailed material now
contained in the Autumn Statement and the Financial Statement and Budget
Report:
a summary of the main Budget tax and spending changes;
an analysis of departmental spending plans for the next three years;
a description of the main tax and NICs measures and their revenue
consequences;
a statement of the government's medium term financial strategy;
the short term economic forecast;
detailed material on the likely outturn for the public finances in the
current year, and the revenue forecasts for the year ahead;
information on the cost of tax reliefs.
A December Budget will be followed by a Finance Bill published soon after
the House returns from the Christmas recess. Parliamentary consideration is
likely to begin in late January.
The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act (PCTA), which allows the Revenue
authorities to collect taxes before the Royal Assent, is currently geared to
a spring Budget. A PCTA Resolution passed in March or April can have
statutory effect until August 5. But different rules apply if a resolution
is passed in any other month. The government proposes to amend the PCTA to
replicate the current provisions, but for a December Budget. Royal Assent
would thus be required in May, for a Budget in December.
The government will be able to decide, as now, whether measures should have
immediate effect, or take effect from some other date. Income tax rates and
allowances, which are set for the whole year, would take effect as now from
the start of the tax year, April 6. In other cases, changes might take
immediate effect, for example, where there is a substantial risk of
forestalling. This would be for the government to decide each year, in the
light of circumstances at the time.
Legislation will be needed to change the basis of statutory indexation. At
present, the personal income tax allowances, the basic rate limit, the
capital gains tax annual exempt amount and the inheritance tax threshold are
statutorily linked to the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) in the
year to the December preceding the Budget. That figure is published too late
to form the basis of a December Budget. The government therefore intends to
amend the indexation provisions to base statutory indexation on an earlier
RPI figure. These changed provisions would apply for the first time for the
1994-95 tax year.
At the moment, decisions on NICs are announced in the Autumn Statement so
that the Contributions Agency in the Department of Social Security can make
arrangements to implement them the following April. This means that
decisions about national insurance contributions are made separately and
ahead of the Budget decisions on personal taxation. If the chancellor
decides to change NICs in a spring Budget, those changes cannot then be
implemented until the following October.
From 1993, decisions on income tax and NICs will be brought together, so
income tax and NICs changes will be implemented at the same time in April.
This will make it easier for employers to plan ahead. They will be able to
make a single set of changes in their employees' deduction arrangements.
This will apply from the tax year 1994-95.
An advantage of earlier publication of the Finance Bill will be that, in
most cases, taxpayers and their advisers will be aware of the precise form
of tax changes well before the date at which they take effect. On the
present timetable, legislative provisions are not normally published until
after the beginning of the tax year to which they refer.
Earlier announcement will make it possible to streamline the process of
implementing Budget tax changes through PAYE. On the present timetable,
there are two separate coding exercises. In mid-January notices of coding
are sent out to taxpayers whose code for the new tax year has to be changed.
This gives them an opportunity to check the new code before the tax year
starts. But, because notices have to be sent out before Budget decisions are
made, they are based on the income tax rates and allowances for the current
year. By the end of March employers are in a position to start operating
PAYE in the new tax year, but only on the basis of the pre-Budget figures.
After the chancellor's Budget Statement in mid-March, the Inland Revenue
starts a second exercise to reflect the Budget changes. Employers amend
straightforward codes using information sent to them in April. Revised codes
for individuals where the change is not straightforward are sent separately
to employers in early May. This means that the whole package of Budget
changes cannot be applied until the first pay packet after May 17 (backdated
to April 6).
With a Budget announced in early December, it should be possible to
implement most of the changes from the start of the following tax year on
April 6. In effect, the annual and Budget coding exercises can be merged
into one. This will require changes both to Inland Revenue and businesses'
computer systems. With just under two years' notice, it should be possible
to implement the changes announced in the December 1993 Budget from the
beginning of the tax year in 1994.
For the last few years social security benefits have been uprated annually
in April. The increases take account of inflation and may make other
adjustments. The changes for all benefits are announced together in the
preceding autumn. Sometimes there are also mid-year adjustments, announced
in the Budget, such as the increase in child benefit announced in the 1991
Budget, which took effect in October 1991. With tax and expenditure
announcements brought together these mid-year adjustments, reflecting Budget
decisions made after the end of the public expenditure survey should no
longer be needed.
With a December Budget, the government will need to consider the
arrangements for implementing upratings. In particular, it may be necessary
to adjust those for the issue of order books by the Benefits Agency in the
Department of Social Security.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Choice over allocation -
Married Couple's Allowance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor proposes to give married couples a new option, from April 6
1993, to choose how to allocate the married couple's allowance between them.
The proposal is that: a couple will be able to choose to allocate the whole
allowance to the wife or to split it equally between them; the wife will
have the right to claim half the allowance; if the couple express no
preference, the allowance will go to the husband, as now.
The married couple's allowance is currently given to a married man, and can
be transferred to his wife only if his income is less than his total
allowances (in which case the excess allowance can be transferred to her).
They are not allowed to transfer the allowance in any other circumstances,
even if it would make them better off as a couple - for example, where the
wife is a higher-rate taxpayer and the husband a basic-rate payer.
The chancellor's proposal will allow couples to decide, before the start of
a tax year, to allocate the whole allowance to the wife or to split it
equally between them, regardless of the size of their income. Wives will be
able to claim half the allowance by right.
Whatever arrangement is chosen will apply for the following tax year and all
future tax years, until they change the allocation. Changes will normally
take effect only from the start of the following tax year.
Where the allocation of the allowance is changed, both partners' tax codes
will change and they will both be notified by their tax offices.
There are higher rates of married couple's allowance which can be given if
either partner is over the age of 65. In the case of such couples, only the
basic allowance (Pounds 1,720) will be transferable.
Couples who want the married couple's allowance to continue to be set
against the husband's income need take no action - the allowance will still
be given to the husband, unless they ask for a different allocation.
The arrangements for the widow's bereavement allowance, which goes to a
widow in the tax year of her husband's death and the following tax year, and
for the transitional allowances given to some couples following the
introduction of independent taxation of husband and wife in 1990-91, will
not be affected.
Couples who wish to opt to allocate all of the married couple's allowance to
the wife, and wives who wish to receive half the allowance, will be able to
claim by notifying their tax offices before the starting date of April 6
1993.
Child support
The chancellor proposes in his Budget that: maintenance assessed by the new
Child Support Agency will qualify for tax relief in the same way as
maintenance paid under a court order; and maintenance collected by the
agency on behalf of a divorced or separated spouse of the payer will qualify
for tax relief in the same way as if payment were made direct to the spouse.
Inheritance tax
The chancellor proposes to raise the threshold for inheritance tax from
Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000. The new threshold will apply to transfers
made on or after March 10 1992.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): New tax-paid bond
proposed - Savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Budget refers to the increased contribution that National Savings are
expected to make towards meeting the government's funding requirement in
1992-93. Among the measures to achieve this will be a new tax-paid savings
bond offering guaranteed growth and an increase in the holding limit for
Income Bonds. Other developments in the existing product range, including
issues of National Savings Certificates, will also play an important part.
Guaranteed growth bond. National Savings will introduce its new guaranteed
growth bond in the summer. Designed to appeal particularly to the basic-rate
taxpayer, the bond will offer fixed rates of interest guaranteed for a year
at a time.
Interest will be added to the bond annually after tax has been deducted at
the basic rate. The minimum purchase will be Pounds 1,000 and the maximum
holding Pounds 250,000. There will be no set limit for the life of a bond
and customers will be able to cash them in at any anniversary date without
penalty.
Income Bonds. The present maximum holding limit of Pounds 25,000 will be
increased to Pounds 50,000 next month.
Capital Gains. The chancellor proposes to increase the annual exemption to
Pounds 5,800 in line with statutory indexation. For 1992/93 each individual
will be exempt from capital gains tax on the first Pounds 5,800 of gains.
Most trusts will be exempt on the first Pounds 2,900 of gains.
Gains above the annual exemption are charged at income tax rates. So the new
20 per cent income tax rate will also apply to those who have capital gains
but have not made full use of the lower-rate band.
Pension scheme earnings cap. Treasury regulations increase from Pounds
71,400 to Pounds 75,000 the maximum level of earnings for which pension
provision may be made with tax relief.
Dividends. The Chancellor proposes to allow companies to send dividend
vouchers direct to shareholders whose dividends are paid separately into a
bank or building society account; require companies to provide vouchers for
electronic payments; and require nominee shareholders to provide vouchers
for payments to underlying shareholders.
Certificates of deposit. The chancellor proposes to change the tax treatment
of certificates of deposit, so that people who want to issue and hold them
in paperless form are not discouraged from doing so.
Bank and building society interest. The Chancellor proposes to remove the
need for a person who is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom to
make two separate declarations in order for banks and building societies
both to pay interest without deduction of tax and to exclude the interest
from returns made to the Inland Revenue. In future only one declaration will
be needed.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Increase announced in
Income Support - Pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE million less well off pensioners stand to benefit from the increase in
Income Support and related benefits announced by the chancellor. The
increase will cost Pounds 305m in a full year. The increases are Pounds 2 a
week for single pensioners on Income Support and Pounds 3 for pensioner
couples on Income Support. Half of those gaining will do so because of
increased entitlement to Housing Benefit and Community Charge Benefit.
Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, said: 'This is excellent
news, benefiting nearly half of all people over pension age. This increase
in all the pensioner premiums in Income Support comes on top of the April
increase in the premium for those over 80, above the rate of inflation, of
Pounds 1 a week for single people, and Pounds 1.50 for couples, which I
announced in October. By October, Income Support rates for pensioners will
be at least Pounds 5.75 higher than now. For those above 80, they will be up
to Pounds 10.70 a week higher.
'The increase announced today will take to nearly Pounds 700m a year the
total value (after allowing for inflation) of improvements in the rates of
Income Support and other income related benefits for pensioners since 1989.'
The cost of Pounds 145m this year and Pounds 305m in 1993-94 will be met
from the reserve.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Personal allowances to
rise in line with statutory indexation - Income Tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR proposes in his Budget to:
reduce the rate of income tax to 20 per cent on the first Pounds 2,000 of
taxable income;
increase the personal allowances for all age groups in line with the
statutory indexation provisions;
increase the age-related married couple's allowances in line with the
statutory indexation provisions;
keep the married couple's allowances for those aged under 65, the additional
personal allowance and the widow's bereavement allowance at their 1991-92
level of Pounds 1,720;
make no change to the basic rate limit;
make no change in the basic and higher rates of income tax.
New lower rate band. New tax tables incorporating the lower rate band will
be used by employers on the first pay day after May 17.
Changes in income tax allowances and car scale benefits. Tax offices will be
sending employers instructions to increase codes ending in L, H, P or V.
Revised coding notices are not sent to employees when codes are increased
automatically in this way.
The codes of the following employees will be reviewed individually by tax
offices who will notify both the employee and the employer of the revised
code where a change is due: employees whose codes begin with F or end in T;
employees whose codes include adjustments for car benefits.
Taxpayers aged 65 and over. It is proposed to raise the income limit for
age-related allowances for those aged 65 and over from Pounds 13,500 to
Pounds 14,200.
If a taxpayer's total income is below this limit the age-related allowances
are due in full; if it is above this limit they are reduced (by Pounds 1 for
every Pounds 2 of income above the limit) to the level of the basic personal
and married couple's allowance.
Tax offices will amend codes that at present include a reduced amount of
age-related allowances to take account of the increase in the income limit.
Where the size of a taxpayer's income means that only the basic allowance
was given for 1991-92 but an age-related allowance is now due, the tax
office will revise the code where necessary in examining 1992-93 tax returns
from April onwards.
Any taxpayer aged 65 and over whose 1992-93 code does not include an
age-related allowance at present but who expects to be entitled to an
age-related allowance following the proposed increase in the income limit
and has not been asked by the end of April to complete a 1992-93 tax return
should write to his or her tax office giving National Insurance number, date
of birth and details of income.
Maintenance payments. The limit on maintenance payments qualifying for tax
relief is equal to the married couple's allowance. The limit for 1992-93
will be Pounds 1,720, the same as for 1991-92.
New 20 per cent rate of income tax. The chancellor proposes to reduce the
rate of income tax to 20 per cent on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable
income (after allowances and reliefs).
The new rate will apply for the tax year 1992-93, starting on 6 April. This
release explains what it will mean for relief at source schemes and tax
deduction schemes. There is generally no change for people making payments,
but some people receiving income taxed at source will be able to claim a
repayment. The new rate will also apply for the purposes of capital gains
tax for those whose marginal income tax rate is 20 per cent.
Interest, annuities and annual payments. Tax should continue to be deducted
at the basic rate of 25 per cent by banks and building societies from
deposit interest not eligible for payment without deduction of tax and other
payers of interest, annuities and other annual payments who are entitled or
obliged to deduct tax.
People who suffered deduction of tax at 25 per cent, but are liable to tax
only at the lower rate of 20 per cent, will be able to claim a repayment of
the difference.
Advance Corporation Tax and Tax Credit on Dividends. The rate of advance
corporation tax remains at 25/75ths. Tax credit will continue to be given at
the same rate, and will satisfy shareholders' basic rate liability.
People who receive dividends and tax credits but who are liable to tax only
at the lower rate, will be able to claim payment of part of the tax credit
from the Inland Revenue.
Relief at Source Schemes. The relief given at source on mortgage interest
under the Miras scheme remains at 25 per cent. This will apply even where
the borrower is only liable to tax at 20 per cent.
The same applies to the other relief at source schemes: personal pension
contributions and free-standing additional voluntary contributions made by
employees; private medical insurance premiums covering people aged 60 and
over; and expenditure on vocational training (the new scheme starts on April
6 1992).
Deeds of Covenant and Gift Aid. People should continue to deduct tax at 25
per cent from payments to charities made under deed of covenant. The amount
to be paid to the charity by the covenantor will not be affected by the
introduction of the lower rate of tax. Payments under the Gift Aid Scheme
will continue to be treated as gifts made net of basic-rate tax.
As now, charities will be able to reclaim basic-rate tax from the Inland
Revenue on payments which they receive under covenant or the Gift Aid
scheme. There will be no effect on the amount charities can reclaim.
Capital Gains Tax. Where appropriate, the new lower rate will apply to
capital gains. Net gains are treated as the top slice of income, and charged
to capital gains tax at income tax rates. If someone whose taxable income is
less than Pounds 2,000 has chargeable gains above the threshold (Pounds
5,800 in 1992-93), then the first taxable slice of their gain will be taxed
at the lower rate.
Trusts. The new lower rate does not apply to trusts. Trusts will continue to
be taxed at the basic rate of 25 per cent plus, where appropriate, the
additional rate of 10 per cent.
Construction Industry Tax Deduction Scheme. The rate of deduction from
payments to uncertified subcontractors remains at 25 per cent. This is
credited in full against the subcontractor's eventual liability. If it
exceeds that liability, the subcontractor will be entitled to a repayment.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Rise in limit for
qualifying trusts - Personal Equity Plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor proposes to make some changes to Personal Equity Plans
(Peps).
The main points are:
from April 6 1992 it will be possible to invest up to Pounds 6,000 a year in
qualifying unit or investment trusts through a general Pep. The present
limit is Pounds 3,000;
from the same date the annual subscription limit for both new and
established non-qualifying investment trusts will be Pounds 1,500.
Qualifying unit and investment trusts. At present an individual can invest
up to Pounds 6,000 a year in a general Pep, of which up to Pounds 3,000 can
be invested in qualifying unit or investment trusts. A qualifying trust is
one which holds at least half its funds in UK ordinary shares, or comparable
shares in companies incorporated in another EC member state. Where the trust
does not meet that requirement (a non-qualifying trust) only Pounds 1,500
may be invested.
The chancellor proposes to remove the Pounds 3,000 limit from April 6 1992.
An individual will then be able to invest up to Pounds 6,000 a year in a
general Pep in any combination of ordinary shares, qualifying unit or
investment trusts.
New issue non-qualifying investment trusts. A number of new issue investment
trusts have recently been promoted on the basis that they qualified for the
full subscription of Pounds 6,000, in contrast with the lower ceiling for
established investment trusts.
The chancellor proposes that from April 6 1992 the Pep regulations should be
changed to make clear that: the subscription limits are the same for both
new and established investment trusts; and the annual limit on investment
for all non-qualifying trusts is Pounds 1,500.
Other changes. The chancellor also proposes some simplifications to the
administration of Peps. In particular the requirement for plan managers to
obtain fresh application forms on each subscription will be abolished.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Car write-down increased
50% - Capital Allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR proposes to remove the restriction on capital allowances
which can be claimed for expenditure on business cars costing between Pounds
8,000 and Pounds 12,000. The maximum writing-down allowance available for a
business car in any one year will be increased from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds
3,000.
In addition, rental payments for cars with a retail price when new of up to
Pounds 12,000 will in future be fully allowable for tax purposes, subject to
normal business tax rules.
Increased relief will also be available for rental payments in respect of
cars with a retail price of more than this amount.
These measures will benefit businesses either purchasing or leasing cars
costing more than Pounds 8,000. Some 80 per cent of business cars bought in
1992-93 are expected to fall below the new Pounds 12,000 limit.
The changes will apply to writing-down allowances for cars bought after
yesterday.
Tax relief available to businesses which buy or lease cars has been limited
since 1961. At present, relief is restricted for most cars costing over
Pounds 8,000. This figure, which was last increased in 1979, is being raised
to Pounds 12,000.
As a result, there will be no restriction on the relief available to cars
which cost, or, in the case of leased cars, have a retail price when new of
between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds 12,000.
Maximum writing-down allowances each year for cars costing more than Pounds
12,000 will be increased by a half, and a larger proportion of rental
payments for cars priced above this amount will be allowable for tax
purposes.
Computer software
The chancellor proposes to extend machinery and plant capital allowances to
cover capital expenditure by businesses on computer software licences and
software distributed by electronic means.
At present, capital allowances are available for capital expenditure
incurred on the outright acquisition of computer software. But in some cases
where capital sums are paid for software licences or the provision of
software by electronic means, there is no entitlement to allowances.
Under the proposals, capital expenditure on licensed software or
electronically transmitted software will be treated as if it were
expenditure on machinery or plant. This means that capital expenditure on
software will receive the same treatment for tax purposes regardless of
whether it is for a licence, access to electronic transmission or outright
purchase.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Diesel vehicles win tax
concessions - Company Cars and Fuel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes in his Budget:
to introduce a separate scale with lower tax charges for diesel fuel
provided for private motoring in company cars;
to increase the existing fuel scale charges for taxing petrol broadly in
line with inflation;
to increase the scale charges for taxing employees on the value of the
private use of company cars broadly in line with inflation.
The changes will take effect from April 6 1992.
The chancellor also proposes to introduce price-based scale charges for
company cars as soon as practicable. The Inland Revenue will be publishing a
consultative document on this change in the summer.
Implementation
The new scale charges will take effect from April 6 1992. PAYE codes
containing an adjustment for car and car fuel benefits will be reviewed and
amended individually to reflect the proposed scale charges. Employers and
employees will be notified of the revised codes, which will generally take
effect on the first pay day after May 17, 1992 at the same time as the
increases in personal allowances are implemented.
A company car driver, paying basic rate tax, and driving a 1600cc car less
than four years old travelling between 2,501 and 17,999 business miles a
year will pay about Pounds 13.32 a week in tax for the car, compared with
Pounds 12.74 in 1991-92.
If petrol is provided for private motoring in that car, there will be a
further Pounds 3.03 a week in tax compared with Pounds 2.88 in 1991-92. But
if diesel fuel is provided the weekly tax will be reduced to Pounds 2.21. In
all these cases the increased tax payable will be offset by other reductions
in income tax.
The Inland Revenue cannot identify cars using diesel fuel from their current
data. Those employees whose codes contain an adjustment for car fuel
benefits will have their code changed to reflect the increase for non-diesel
fuel.
Those who think they qualify for the lower charge for diesel fuel should
contact their tax office.
Future structural change
The chancellor proposes that the current car scale structure which is based
for most cars on their engine size, but for some on their original market
value, should be replaced by a structure based wholly on the price of cars.
This will remove some of the distortions in the current structure and allow
a fairer measure of the value of the benefit of private use of a company
car. VAT changes
The chancellor proposes two changes in the VAT treatment of cars.
From April 1, 1992, VAT will no longer be charged where a deduction is made
from an employee's salary in return for the provision of a company car. This
will meet the complaint that charging VAT discriminates against companies
wishing to offer their employees a choice between a company car and salary.
However, where payment is actually made by the employee for his or her own
use of a company car, VAT will still be due on that payment.
From August 1, 1992, private taxi and self-drive hire firms and driving
schools will be able to recover the VAT they pay on cars purchased for their
businesses.
While this will enable such firms to recover their input tax, subject to the
normal rules, they will have to account for output tax on any actual private
use, and on the eventual sale of the car by the business.
Motor mileage allowances
The Inland Revenue has announced the 'tax-free' mileage rates they will use
in the Fixed Profit Car Scheme (FPCS) for 1992-93, the tax year starting on
April 6, 1992.
The FPCS is an administrative arrangement for taxing motor mileage
allowances paid by employers to employees who use their own cars for work.
National Insurance
contributions
The changes to the income tax on company car and car fuel charges for the
tax year 1992-93, proposed by the chancellor, will be used to calculate
employers' Class 1A National Insurance contributions for that year. These
contributions will be payable in June 1993.
Since April 6, 1991, employers have been required to pay Class 1A National
Insurance contributions on the benefit of cars and car fuel they provide for
the private use of employees. Liability is assessed on an annual basis using
income tax company car and car fuel scale charges.
Fuel scales
The chancellor proposes to change the scales applied for income tax purposes
to business fuel used for private purposes. In line with these proposals,
the fuel scales used for charging VAT will be amended via the Value Added
Tax (increase of consideration for fuel) Order 1992.
The new scales will take effect from April 6, 1992. Businesses will become
liable to use the new scales from the start of their next accounting period
beginning on or after that date.
The provisions covering fuel scale charges are set out in Section 9 and
Tables A and B of Schedule 6 of the 1986 Finance Act and came into force on
April 6 1987.
Under these provisions a fixed charge - related to three bands of engine
size - is payable in respect of VAT due on fuel used for private motoring.
This enables the business to recover the whole amount of VAT charged on the
purchase of the fuel and avoids the need for detailed mileage records to be
kept by the business.
This simplified procedure was introduced following an extensive consultation
exercise with businesses. Many representations suggested that the Inland
Revenue income tax scales should be adopted for VAT purposes.
The VAT fuel scales are a simplified procedure authorised by EC derogation
from the provisions of the Sixth VAT Directive, which provides a uniform VAT
structure for all Member States.
The proposed changes will yield Pounds 5 million in 1992-93 and Pounds 5
million in 1993-94.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Import system to be
revised - Single Market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR proposes changes in VAT necessary for the introduction of the
Single Market from January 1, 1993.
Import procedures will be abolished for intra-Community movements of goods
from January 1 1993. They will be replaced with the concept of
'acquisition'.
Supplies of goods between persons registered for VAT purposes in different
member states will continue to be zero-rated by the seller in the member
state of departure.
However, under the new system, the acquirer of the goods will have to
account for VAT in the member state to which the goods are transported.
VAT control of intra-EC trade will be carried out using a system of
administrative co-operation between the fiscal authorities of EC member
states.
Auditing will be based on lists, produced by businesses, of their aggregate
sales to taxable persons in other member states. There are special
arrangements for:
mail order to private individuals;
private purchases of new motor vehicles, motor cycles, boats and aircraft;
and supplies to non-VAT registered businesses and non-taxable institutions.
Under these arrangements VAT will have to be accounted for in the member
state of the purchaser at the rate applicable there. All other purchases by
private individuals will bear VAT, at the appropriate rate, in the member
state of the supplier.
Baggage regulation
THE chancellor intends to legislate to enable Customs to exercise their
powers in relation to transfer and transit passengers travelling by air when
they reach their eventual UK airport of destination.
This is a technical provision to implement a European Community measure  -
the Baggage Regulation - which sets out the procedures to be followed post
1992 on Customs control of baggage for both intra-EC traffic and traffic
from outside the EC.
Limitation of Customs' powers at EC frontier
THE chancellor intends to limit certain HM Customs &amp; Excise powers,
exercisable at the frontier in relation to EC traffic, to the purposes of
protection of the EC external frontier and the enforcement of prohibitions
and restrictions such as the illicit traffic in drugs.
As the law currently stands, Customs' powers are too widely cast to be
compatible with the abolition of fiscal frontiers and the resulting free
movement of goods and persons which the Single Market will herald on January
1 1993.
Customs are making very considerable changes in controls for the Single
Market. Formalities, forms and fiscal frontiers will all go on intra-EC
traffic.
What will remain in the Single Market are targeted spot checks - which will
affect only a very small proportion of travellers and foreign freight - to
identify illicit traffic in drugs, terrorist weapons, pornography and other
threats to society.
The chancellor intends to legislate to give legal effect to these changes.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): ERM membership to remain
central discipline for policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Successful economic performance requires permanently low inflation and a
healthy supply side. The defeat of inflation on a lasting basis is the
central objective of the Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS). This
macroeconomic framework is complemented by microeconomic policies designed
to improve the flexibility and efficiency of markets, with a view to
increasing the sustainable growth rate of the economy over the medium term.
The government is committed to membership of the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) of the European Monetary System, and this provides the framework for
monetary policy. Sterling is currently operating within broad (6 per cent)
bands, but will in due course move to narrow (2 1/4 per cent) bands at the
current central parity of DM2.95.
Fiscal policy is set in a medium term framework. The government's policy is
to maintain a firm fiscal stance by balancing the budget over the medium
term. This approach ensures that fiscal policy supports monetary policy in
achieving low inflation.
The UK signed the Maastricht Treaty on European Union on February 7 1992.
That treaty, which has not yet been ratified by Parliament, sets out the
conditions for establishing economic and monetary union (EMU) in the
European Community, including the adoption of a single monetary policy and
in due course a single currency. The UK has reserved the right to choose
whether or not to participate in the final stage of EMU, and in particular
whether to move to the single monetary policy and single currency. But
whatever choice is made, the government's policies are designed to ensure
that the UK meets the convergence criteria laid down in the treaty.
ERM membership will remain the central discipline underpinning UK
macroeconomic policy in the medium term. In principle, policy requirements
are not fundamentally altered by ERM membership: they would be much the same
even if the UK had chosen to pursue the objective of defeating inflation
outside the ERM. But ERM membership now provides the medium term nominal
framework within which the UK economy must operate.
The UK is an open economy, with few constraints on international trade in
goods and services; and the completion of the single market will further
reduce the remaining tariff and non-tariff barriers between the UK and our
European Community partners. This freedom of trade, combined with the
commitment to the ERM, means that the price of traded goods and services
produced in the UK will largely be set in competitive international, and
especially European, markets. UK costs and prices will not be able to move
independently of those of our competitors for any length of time.
Maintaining sterling within its ERM bands means that over the next few years
UK inflation will move progressively into line with the best inflation
performance in other ERM countries. All countries in the European Community
are firmly committed to the objective of price stability, and the government
will set monetary and fiscal policy to achieve this outcome. The more
rapidly markets, and in particular labour costs, adjust to the new
discipline of the ERM, the sooner the UK will be able to achieve a
satisfactory growth of output and bring down unemployment.
Fiscal projections
The sections below set out the government's approach to monetary and fiscal
policy in more detail, and provide fiscal projections over the medium term
based on illustrative paths for output and inflation.
The UK has been a member of the ERM for almost a year and a half. During
that time the government has demonstrated its commitment to the ERM by
setting interest rates to maintain sterling within its ERM bands. The
authorities will continue to give overriding priority to the ERM commitment
in setting interest rates.
Sterling will move to narrow bands within the ERM in due course, maintaining
its central rate at DM2.95.
The authorities continue to assess monetary conditions on the basis of the
behaviour of the monetary aggregates and a range of other indicators. Over
the past year the position of sterling within its ERM bands has generally
allowed the authorities to reduce UK interest rates as warranted by domestic
conditions, and particularly by the fall in inflation. Since joining
the ERM in early October 1990 the differentials between UK and German
interest rates have narrowed markedly. This is a sign of enhanced confidence
in the policy for achieving low inflation and the ability of the economy to
adapt to the discipline of the ERM.
Narrow money (M0) rose fairly steadily, at an annual rate of a little over 2
per cent, through 1991, having been more or less flat during the steep fall
in output in the second half of 1990. For 1991-92 as a whole M0 is forecast
to have increased by about 2 1/4 per cent, just above the middle of the 0 to
4 per cent target range set a year ago. The government proposes to set a
target range for M0 growth for the financial year 1992-93 of 0 to 4 per
cent, unchanged from 1991-92.
The annual growth of M4 slowed down through 1991 and has flattened out at
around 6 per cent in recent months. M4 has thus probably grown only a little
faster than money GDP over the past year, following more than a decade of
steeply declining M4 velocity. It is unclear how durable this change in the
trend of M4 velocity will prove, and the future growth rate of M4 remains
very uncertain. As for the past five years, the government does not intend
to set a target for broad money, but will continue to pay careful attention
to the growth of broad money and credit.
The government continues to follow the 'full fund' policy, discussed in
detail in the 1990 MTFS. In 1991-92 the public sector borrowing requirement
(PSBR), together with maturing debt, has been funded by increased sales of
national savings and gilts. During the year long term yields have fallen
significantly as progress has been made in reducing inflation. In 1992-93
gilt sales will again be complemented by an increased contribution from
national savings to the total funding programme.
In 1991-92 the public finances moved into deficit, after being in surplus
for three years from 1987-88 and close to balance in 1990-91. The PSBR for
1991-92 is now expected to be Pounds 13 3/4 bn, equivalent to about 2 1/4
per cent of GDP.
The government's objective is to balance the budget over the medium term,
while permitting the 'automatic stabilisers' to operate. This approach means
that the PSBR varies with the cyclical position of the economy. The budget
surpluses in the late 1980s reflected the strength of domestic demand and
activity, while the swing into deficit in 1991-92 reflects the subsequent
recession.
Cyclical developments will continue to determine the evolution of the public
finances over the medium term. The budget will return towards balance as
activity recovers. But the process of adjustment will take time, and in the
short term the level of borrowing will rise because of the lagged impact of
the recession on both revenue and expenditure.
The government's policy will ensure that the UK meets the requirement set
out in the Maastricht Treaty that Member States should endeavour to avoid
'excessive budget deficits'. The decision on whether an excessive deficit
exists rests with the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, and that
judgment must be made in the light of all the circumstances, including the
medium term economic and budgetary position.
Budget deficits
The treaty recognises that deficits can be affected by temporary and
exceptional factors: the intention is to prevent 'gross errors' of budgetary
policy, and not to constrain deficits which arise for purely cyclical
reasons.
In the economic forecast, non-North Sea GDP in financial year 1992-93 is up
1 3/4 per cent on the previous year, below the sustainable growth rate of
the economy. And the recession will still be affecting the public finances:
in particular, social security expenditure and corporation tax receipts both
lag behind the output cycle. For both these reasons the PSBR will rise in
1992-93: it has been set at Pounds 28bn, equivalent to about 4 1/2 per cent
of GDP.
Assumptions about the path of the economy are required in order to
illustrate the possible evolution of the public finances over the medium
term. The economic assumptions which form the basis for the fiscal
projections are shown in the accompanying table.
The level of real GDP is now below trend, following the contraction of
demand over the past two years. But in the medium term output is determined
primarily by supply factors, and over the next few years there should be
scope for more rapid growth accompanied by low inflation.
The projections assume that non-North Sea GDP grows by 3 1/2 per cent per
annum from 1994-95, above the likely trend rate of growth; and that
inflation comes down to 2 per cent by 1996-97, close to the best performance
in other ERM countries. The output path implies that between 1990-91 and
1996-97 non-North Sea GDP grows on average by around 2 per cent a year, well
within the potential growth rate of the economy.
These assumptions underlie the PSBR path shown in the accompanying table.
The PSBR rises further as a share of GDP in 1993-94, to 4 3/4 per cent,
because of lower privatisation proceeds and the lagged effects of below
trend growth in 1992-93. But thereafter it declines steadily towards balance
in the medium term.
The projected PSBR path implies some increase in the level of net public
sector debt over the next few years.
Public sector debt
As the PSBR declines in response to faster output growth the ratio of net
public sector debt to GDP will in due course resume a downward trend. The
ratio is projected to peak at about 35 per cent of GDP in the mid-1990s,
compared with an average of well over 45 per cent in the first half of the
1980s. Thus the prospective increase in the ratio only partially reverses
the sharp fall in the late 1980s which was associated with the cyclical
upturn and debt repayments.
Within this broad medium term fiscal framework the government's policy is to
cut taxes as and when this can be done on a sustainable basis and without
prejudice to the government's objectives on inflation. The projections
include fiscal adjustments of Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 and 1996-97. But the
precise size and timing of future tax reductions will depend on developments
in the economy.
The revenue projections in the accompanying table are based on the
conventional assumption of constant tax and national insurance rates from
1992-93, except where future changes have already been announced (for
example, on contracted out rebates for national insurance contributions).
Allowances, thresholds and specific duties are assumed to be indexed from
their proposed 1992-93 levels. All proposed Budget changes are taken into
account. The ratio of general government receipts to GDP falls further in
1992-93, largely reflecting the delayed impact on tax receipts of the fall
in output in 1991-92. But as output recovers towards trend and delays in the
payment of taxes work out, the ratio picks up over the medium term.
Projections for the tax burden and the components of general government
receipts are given in the accompanying tables.
The government's objective for public spending is that, over time, it should
take a declining share of national income, while value for money is
constantly improved. This is consistent with policy on the overall level of
taxation within the framework of maintaining a balanced budget over the
medium term. The public spending objective is expressed in terms of the
ratio of general government expenditure (GGE), excluding privatisation
proceeds, to GDP. An underlying downward trend in this ratio was established
in the early 1980s. Strong economic growth in the later 1980s led to sharp
falls in the ratio. Cyclical influences are now exerting upward pressure on
public spending, notably on social security, leading to some rise in the
ratio. It should resume its downward trend as the economy recovers. In
1991-92 the ratio is expected to be 42 per cent of GDP, 2 1/2 percentage
points above its 1988-89 level, but still 5 1/2 percentage points below the
level seen in 1982-83 following the early 1980s recession.
The projections of general government expenditure in the accompanying tables
include the cash planning totals published in the 1991 Autumn Statement for
the period to 1994-95. The projections for local authorities' self-financed
expenditure take account of latest information on local authorities'
spending in 1991-92 and budgets for 1992-93; and the projections of gross
debt interest payments and accounting adjustments are consistent with the
economic assumptions in the accompanying table.
Expenditure plans
For 1995-96 and 1996-97 it is provisionally assumed that the growth of real
GGE will slow as cyclical effects continue to unwind: expenditure plans will
be settled in future Surveys.
The MTFS reaffirms the government's commitment to bringing inflation down on
a sustainable basis within the ERM, and achieving convergence within the
European Community. The government continues to operate fiscal policy
consistently with the objective of medium term budget balance. This will
provide full support for the government's commitment to the ERM.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Departmental Government Statements: Measures to
help charities - Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor proposes in his Budget to introduce a package of measures to
help charities and to give further encouragement to charitable giving. The
measures include:
A reduction from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 in the minimum limit for Gift Aid
payments.
A relaxation in the rules for some deeds of covenant.
Simpler procedures for charities making tax repayment claims.
These changes will apply from July 1 1992. The minimum limit for gifts by
individuals and close companies qualifying for relief under the Gift Aid
scheme will be reduced from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 (net of basic rate
income tax). There is no minimum limit for gifts by non-close companies. The
new limit will apply to gifts made on or after July 1 1992.
Under present rules, charitable covenants which are written to last for four
years or until some later event (for example, the donor giving up membership
of the charity) cease to be effective for tax purposes after four years. If
charities want to continue to receive tax relief, they have to get donors to
sign new covenants every four years.
The chancellor's proposal will allow tax relief for covenants of this type
to run on without covenants having to be renewed or replaced, provided the
donor's power to stop making payments cannot be exercised within the
four-year period. This will simplify the present rules and reduce
administration for charities, particularly those which operate membership
covenants.
The Inland Revenue proposes to make improvements in its current procedures
for dealing with tax repayment claims by charities. These are designed to
reduce the routine paperwork which charities now have to send in with their
claims, and to make better use of Revenue resources.
In order to check claims, the Revenue will continue the visits it already
makes to look at charities' records. These visits will help charities to get
their tax claims right first time. The existing power to inspect charities'
records of Gift Aid donations will be extended to cover covenants and other
income on which charities claim tax repayments.
New, fuller guidance for charities on making covenants and running covenant
schemes will be available from Claims Branch in time for the start of the
new procedures, which will apply to claims made on or after July 1 1992.
New telephone helplines will also be available. Charities will be able to
telephone if they have questions about their tax repayment claims or about
the rules for tax relief. The numbers will be included in the new guidance.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Departmental Government Statements): Mixed
approach to sales of gilts will continue - Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS NOTICE sets out the framework within which the Bank intends to conduct
sales of gilt-edged stock in the year ahead, in accordance with the full
fund objective.
The Budget indicated that there will be an increased contribution to funding
in 1992-93 from the various instruments of National Savings, which will
complement the gilt-edged sales programme.
In parallel, in its operations in the gilt-edged market, the Bank will
continue to utilise the diverse range of instruments and selling techniques
which have enabled funding in that market to be carried forward successfully
in the past year.
As last year, the Bank envisages combining a programme of gilt-edged
auctions with continuing official sales of stock 'on tap' on the secondary
market. The main features of this mixed approach to gilt-edged funding are
described below.
In the past year gilt-edged auctions were held at roughly two-month
intervals through the year.
Experience with these auctions indicates that the auction process is
effective in providing the backbone of funding without creating market
disturbance.
Accordingly, the Bank proposes to continue in the coming year with a similar
programme of auctions.
Each auction may be for an amount of Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn (or somewhat
larger if market conditions warrant), and the programme of auctions is
likely to account in total for rather more than half of the total
gilt-funding requirement.
The auctions will be conducted on the same basis as those in the past year
ie stock will be auctioned on a bid-price basis, open to all comers, with
provision for non-competitive bids of up to Pounds 500,000. The stock
offered may be a new stock or an additional tranche of an existing stock and
may be in either fully or partly-paid form. Auctions will extend over the
full maturity range.
This programme of auctions will be combined, as last year, with continuing
sales of stock by the Bank 'on tap' on the secondary market through its
day-to-day operations with the gilt-edged marketmakers.
'Tap' sales may take the form of stock from holdings in the Issue
Department, or of packages of tranchettes (or a single, larger tranche) of
stock created and placed in the Issue Department.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): Chancellor's measures laid
out in detail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section explains the general approach used in the table to estimate the
effects on receipts of Budget measures. It also provides more detail on
specific measures. The accompanying table shows the effects of tax changes
announced before the Budget.
The table gives the direct effects on receipts of changes in taxation and
national insurance. Estimates are rounded to the nearest Pounds 5m.
'Negligible' means less than Pounds 3m. Measures are costed in the order in
which they appear in the table.
The direct effect of a tax change is the difference between the yield of tax
which would arise on the basis of the rates of tax, allowances, etc.
prevailing before the Budget (the pre-Budget regime) and the yield after the
changes proposed in the Budget (the post-Budget regime).
The difference in yield is generally calculated by applying the pre-and
post-Budget regimes to the same tax base. This base is the post-Budget base
 -that is, the levels of income, consumption, profits, etc. forecast for
future years on the assumption that all the measures proposed in the Budget
take effect.
Thus the direct effects are estimated subject to the constraint that, in
general, total incomes and total expenditure are fixed at their post-Budget
levels. In other words the estimates in the table do not include income
effects - that is, effects arising solely from the impact of changes in
taxes on disposable income.
Nor do they include the effects of changes in the tax base arising from
changes in pre-tax incomes, the general level of prices or other
macro-economic variables which may result from the proposed tax changes.
Other behavioural effects are taken into account where it is thought that
they will have a significant effect on the yield, for example tax changes
which alter the allocation of savings between different financial
instruments or affect the composition of expenditure. Some change between
the pre- and post-Budget tax bases is thus implicitly allowed for in these
cases, subject to the overall constraint on total incomes and expenditure
outlined above.
For Customs and Excise taxes and duties, all the estimates of yield
incorporate the effects of the tax changes on relative prices and associated
changes in the pattern of consumers' expenditure. Aggregate income and
consumers' expenditure at factor cost are assumed not to change. Behavioural
effects are taken into account for Inland Revenue taxes for changes
involving the take-up of a new or modified relief.
Most of the figures for direct effects shown in the table represent the
change in the yield of the tax in question. Where appropriate, however, the
effects on the yield of other taxes are also incorporated. For example, the
direct effect of a change in the excise duties on tobacco incorporates, in
addition to the change in the yield from tobacco duties, the change in the
yield of VAT and other excise duties resulting from changes in the
composition of consumers' expenditure.
As a general rule, only repercussions on the yield of other taxes of the
same type are allowed for, such as other taxes on expenditure in the case of
tobacco duties but not taxes on income or profits.
The post-Budget forecast of each tax given in the table takes account of all
the effects of the measures announced in the Budget, and not just the direct
effects included in the table.
The figures in the first column of the table show the direct effect of the
Budget proposals on receipts in 1992-93. Budget proposals are compared with
a non-indexed base - that is, with the pre-Budget regime of allowances,
thresholds and rates of duty at 1991-92 levels.
The figures in second column show the direct effect of the Budget proposals
on receipts in 1992-93 measured against an indexed base. The indexed base
for 1992-93 is obtained by increasing allowances, thresholds and rates of
duty in line with the increase in the RPI over the year to December 1991
(4.5 per cent).
The figures in the third column show the direct effect on receipts in
1993-94, also measured against an indexed base. For this comparison, both
the Budget proposals and the indexed base for 1992-93 have been further
indexed by the forecast movement in the RPI between the fourth quarters of
1991 and 1992.
The following notes refer by number to individual line entries in the table.
Income tax 6 The cost in 1993-94 includes the effects of statutory
indexation of the lower rate limit for 1993-94. There is also a public
expenditure cost of Pounds 30m in 1992-93 and Pounds 35m in 1993-94 in
respect of mortgage interest relief at 25 per cent for those liable to tax
only at the new lower rate. This will be charged to the Reserve.
8 From April 1993 married couples will, by agreement, be able to choose to
set all of the married couple's allowance against the wife's instead of the
husband's income, or to share it equally.
Alternatively, married women will be able to choose to set half of the
married couple's allowance against their own income instead of their
husband's. If none of these options is taken, the allowance will be given to
the husband, as now. The cost of Pounds 10m is based on the assumption that
couples will choose to set the allowance against the wife's income where she
is a higher rate taxpayer and he is not, thus reducing the couple's total
tax liability.
9-11 The effect of the changes in car and fuel benefit scales on employers'
national insurance contributions is shown in the table. The effect of the
similar change to VAT fuel scales is also shown in the table.
12 The rules for tax relief on maintenance payments will be changed to take
account of the establishment of the Child Support Agency in 1993.
13 The tax rules governing certificates of deposit will be amended to enable
paperless, or 'dematerialised', certificates of deposit to be treated in the
same way as paper certificates.
14 The current rules which require payers of dividends to forward vouchers
to the payee along with the payment itself will be updated to take account
of changes in the handling of dividend payments and in particular electronic
transfer.
15 The provisions governing the making of returns on interest paid to
non-residents will be brought into line with those on the deduction of tax
from this interest.
16 The abolition of the statutory remuneration to paying and collecting
agents will give a public expenditure saving of some Pounds 1.5m a year.
17 This shows the effect on income tax receipts. The effect on receipts of
national insurance contributions is shown in the table.
Income and corporation tax 18 The cost of relaxing the restrictions on
capital allowances for most business cars is expected to rise to a maximum
of Pounds 220m in later years.
19 Capital expenditure on computer software acquired under licence will
qualify for 25 per cent plant and machinery capital allowances from 10 March
1992, bringing it into line with computer software acquired outright.
21 With effect from 10 March 1992 where rent for a chargeable period is
payable in arrear between connected persons, and the rent is an allowable
expense of the payer, the recipient of the rent will be chargeable to tax on
the rent which accrued in that period. The yield arises from the change in
the basis of liability to tax on rent payable under existing arrangements; a
further yield of Pounds 100m is expected in 1994-95. Without this measure
there could be a significant loss of tax in the future.
22 Insolvent former deposit takers which have ceased trading and are in
compulsory liquidation will be allowed relief, against income arising from
their former trade, for losses carried forward and for certain expenses.
Relief will apply for chargeable periods ending after 10 March 1991.
24 The rules for tax relief for charitable covenants will be amended so that
a power to terminate a covenant will be ignored until it is exercised,
provided that it cannot be exercised within the minimum period.
25 The power to inspect charities' records of donations under the Gift Aid
scheme will be extended to cover other income on which charities claim tax
repayments.
26 The 1992 Friendly Societies Bill, when enacted, will enable registered
friendly societies to incorporate, form subsidiaries and generally extend
the scope of the financial services they can provide. The Budget measures
will eliminate the tax charges which would otherwise arise on incorporation,
and which would act as a disincentive to incorporation. They will also
extend to incorporated societies the limited tax exemptions which apply to
registered societies.
Income tax and capital gains tax 27 With effect from 6 April 1992 it will be
possible to subscribe up to Pounds 6,000 a year to a general PEP in
investment or unit trusts with at least half of their holdings in EC
equities. The cost of this measure is expected to rise in later years.
28 Some technical changes concerning property management subsidiaries will
also be made.
29 The relief on private rented housing was already due to expire at the end
of 1993. The saving in later years from also abolishing relief for trading
companies is Pounds 15m. In 1994-95 there will be some extra cost as a
result of acceleration of investment to 1993-94. The total saving from the
abolition of all reliefs under the Business Expansion Scheme will be Pounds
130m in later years.
30 The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made
with tax relief under the Finance Act 1989 will be increased. It will rise
to Pounds 75,000 in line with the statutory indexation provisions (based on
the increase of 4.5 per cent in the Retail Prices Index in the year to
December 1991).
Capital gains tax 31 The estimated full year cost of indexation of the
capital gains tax annual exempt amount in respect of 1992-93 liabilities is
Pounds 5m.
Inheritance tax 32 The estimated full year cost of the increase in the
inheritance tax threshold attributable to taxable estates in 1992-93 is
Pounds 25m, measured against an indexed base.
33 The new 100 per cent rate of business and agricultural relief will apply
to business assets and farmlands that currently qualify for 50 per cent
relief with two changes. It will be extended to holdings of more than 25 per
cent without control in Unlisted Securities Market (USM) companies. But
controlling holdings in fully quoted companies will continue to receive 50
per cent relief. 50 per cent relief will also apply to business assets and
farmland that currently qualify for 30 per cent relief and to holdings of 25
per cent or less without control in USM companies. These changes to business
and agricultural relief will take effect from 10 March 1992. The estimated
full year cost of these changes attributable to transfers in 1992-93 is
Pounds 55m.
Tax appeals 34 Procedural rules for hearing tax appeals, including powers
for the Special Commissioners to award costs where either party has acted
wholly unreasonably in pursuing an appeal, will be introduced. The new rules
will not come into effect before 1 April 1993.
Value added tax 35 The turnover threshold for VAT registration will be
raised from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 36,600 from 11 March 1992, and the
deregistration threshold from Pounds 33,600 to Pounds 35,100 from 1 May
1992.
36 There is a cost to this measure because the once-off cashflow gain from
the system of monthly payments on account will be less than that from the
system of monthly returns which had been announced. The main reason is that
the size of payments on account will be determined by past, not present, VAT
payments.
41 From 1 April 1992 VAT relief for charities and the disabled will be
extended to boats built or substantially adapted for use by handicapped
people; the provision of special toilet facilities for handicapped people in
charity-run buildings used for charitable purposes; repairs and maintenance
of equipment used for talking books for blind people; and replacement
engines, spare parts and accessories for lifeboats.
43 The wording of the VAT law regarding supplies made for a non-monetary
consideration will be revised to bring the provision into line with the
relevant European Community directive. No change in practice is involved.
44 Certain supplies made for no consideration (such as obsolete computer
equipment donated to educational establishments) will be valued for VAT
purposes at their current value rather than their original cost, after Royal
Assent to the Finance Bill.
Excise duties 46 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 1p on
a pint of beer.
47 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 5p on a 75cl bottle
of still wine, about 8p on a 75cl bottle of sparkling wine, about 8p on a
70cl bottle of sherry and about 10p on a 75cl bottle of port.
48 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 28p on a 70cl bottle
of spirits.
49 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 1p on a pint of
cider or perry.
50 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 1.2p on a litre of
unleaded petrol. The tax differential in favour of unleaded petrol will thus
rise from 4.0p to 5.1p a litre.
51 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 1.2p on a litre of derv.
52 The duty on gas oil and fuel oil will rise by 4.5 per cent, equivalent to
about 0.06p and 0.04p respectively a litre. (Gas oil and fuel oil supplied
to domestic users are zero-rated for VAT.)
53 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 2.3p on a litre of leaded
petrol.
54 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to 13p on a packet of 20
cigarettes.
55 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 6p on a packet of
five small cigars and about 38p on a 50 gram packet of hand-rolling tobacco.
56 The increase in duty plus VAT is equivalent to about 8p on a 50-gram
packet of pipe tobacco.
Vehicle excise duty 60 The duty on vehicles registered in the private and
light goods class, and the duty on taxis, will increase to Pounds 110, from
11 March 1992.
61 Three new VED classes for lorries will be introduced from 1 January 1993,
to deal with vehicles that will be able to operate in the UK from that date.
The rate for the heaviest lorry will be Pounds 5,000.
62 A new VED rate of Pounds 15 will be introduced for small motorised
tricycles with an engine capacity of under 150cc, from 11 March 1992.
63 All other VED rates will remain unchanged.
64 The arrangements for charging fees for special vehicle registration marks
will be reformed, to enable a charge to be made when a mark is not
transferred to a vehicle within 12 months of it having been reserved.
National insurance contributions 66 This shows the consequential effects on
national insurance receipts. The effects on income tax receipts are shown in
the table.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): Summary of main proposals for
tax and benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section summarises the main tax proposals in the Budget. A full list of
changes is given in the accompanying table.
Income tax: The rate of income tax will be reduced to 20 per cent for the
first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
The personal allowance will be increased in line with the statutory
indexation provisions (based on the increase of 4.5 per cent in the Retail
Prices Index in the year to December 1991). So will the personal and married
couple's allowances for those aged 65 and over. Other allowances, and the
basic rate limit, will be unchanged.
For 1992-93 the levels will be:
personal allowance Pounds 3,445 (up Pounds 150);
married couple's allowance, additional personal allowance and widow's
bereavement allowance Pounds 1,720 (no change);
for those aged 65 to 74: personal allowance Pounds 4,200 (up Pounds 180) and
married couple's allowance Pounds 2,465 (up Pounds 110);
for those aged 75 and over: personal allowance Pounds 4,370 (up Pounds 190)
and married couple's allowance Pounds 2,505 (up Pounds 110);
income limit for age-related allowances Pounds 14,200 (up Pounds 700);
basic rate limit Pounds 23,700 (no change).
Married couples will be able to choose by agreement to give the married
couple's allowance to the wife instead of the husband, or to share it
equally between them, as from 1993-94. As an alternative, married women will
be able to claim half the allowance at their own request.
Benefits-in-kind: The car benefit scale charges, used both for income tax
and employers' national insurance contributions, will be increased by 4.5
per cent from 6 April 1992.
There will be a new, lower car fuel benefit scale for diesel cars. This will
be used both for income tax and employers' national insurance contributions.
The existing scales for assessing the benefit of employer-provided petrol
will be increased by 4.5 per cent. The fuel scale charges for VAT will be
similarly amended.
Charitable giving: The minimum limit for the Gift Aid scheme (tax relief on
single charitable donations from close companies or individuals) will be
reduced from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 from 1 July 1992.
Savings: Savings of up to Pounds 6,000 a year, instead of Pounds 3,000 as at
present, will be allowed in qualifying unit or investment trusts through a
general Personal Equity Plan from 6 April 1992.
The capital gains tax annual exempt amount for 1992-93 will be increased in
line with the statutory indexation provisions from Pounds 5,500 to Pounds
5,800 in the case of individuals and from Pounds 2,750 to Pounds 2,900 in
the case of most trusts.
Business taxation: The limit of Pounds 8,000 on the cost of cars, above
which capital allowances and tax relief for lease rental payments are
restricted, will be raised to Pounds 12,000 from 11 March 1992.
The limit below which employers may pay PAYE/NIC quarterly rather than
monthly will be raised from an average monthly bill of Pounds 400 to Pounds
450, for deductions made after 6 April 1992.
The Business Expansion Scheme will be abolished from the end of 1993, when
relief for private rented housing expires. In the meantime the scheme will
be amended to make it easier for companies to use the relief for mortgage
rescue schemes.
Banks, brokers and other agents who deduct tax from payments of foreign
dividends and interest will have to account for the tax which they deduct on
a monthly basis from October 1992; the statutory remuneration to agents will
be abolished.
Provisions will be introduced with effect from 10 March 1992 to prevent loss
of tax through arrangements involving the payment of rent between connected
persons.
Film expenditure: The tax treatment of film production costs will be amended
for films completed after 10 March 1992. Production costs may be written off
at a flat rate of 33 1/3 per cent starting on completion of the film.
Pre-production costs incurred after 10 March 1992 will be written off as
they are incurred.
Inheritance tax: Most business assets which currently qualify for 50 per
cent relief from inheritance tax will be granted 100 per cent relief from 10
March 1992. Assets which currently qualify for 30 per cent relief will be
granted 50 per cent relief.
The threshold for inheritance tax will be raised from Pounds 140,000 to
Pounds 150,000 from 10 March 1992.
Tax appeals: Procedural rules will be introduced for appeal hearings. There
will be powers to award costs where either party has acted wholly
unreasonably, from 1 April 1993.
Customs and Excise
Car tax: Car tax will be halved from 10 per cent to 5 per cent of the
wholesale price of new cars from 11 March 1992.
Excise duties: Most excise duties will rise from 6 pm on 10 March 1992.
The duties on alcoholic drinks will rise by 4.5 per cent, in line with the
increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to December 1991.
The duty on unleaded petrol and derv will rise by 4.5 per cent, in line with
the increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to December 1991.
The duty on leaded petrol will rise by 7.5 per cent.
The duty on cigarettes will rise by about 10 per cent, putting 13p on the
price of a packet of 20 cigarettes. The duty on pipe tobacco will rise by
4.5 per cent and on other tobacco products by 10 per cent.
The rate of general betting duty will be cut from 8 per cent to 7.75 per
cent from 1 April 1992.
Duties on matches and mechanical lighters will be abolished from 1 January
1993.
Members' clubs will be exempt from bingo duty from 3 August 1992.
Vehicle excise duties: Duty on cars, light vans and taxis will rise from
Pounds 100 to Pounds 110 from 11 March 1992. Duty on lorries and most other
vehicles will not change.
Value added tax: The registration threshold will rise from turnover of
Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 36,600 from 11 March 1992, in line with the increase
in the Retail Prices Index in the year to December 1991.
Traders who meet the other conditions for cash accounting (including annual
turnover of Pounds 300,000 or less) will be able to join the scheme from 1
April 1992 even if they owe Customs and Excise up to Pounds 5,000, rather
than a maximum of Pounds 1,000 as at present.
Large VAT payers will be required to make monthly payments on account from
autumn 1992. They will not be required to make monthly returns and may
continue to submit quarterly returns.
The rate of serious misdeclaration penalty will be cut from 20 per cent to
15 per cent on assessments calculated from 11 March 1992.
Penalties will not normally be levied on under-declarations of Pounds 2,000
or less. The maximum rate of default surcharge will be cut from 30 per cent
to 20 per cent from 1 April 1992.
Private taxi firms, self-drive hire firms and driving schools will be able
to reclaim VAT paid on cars purchased for their businesses from 1 August
1992. They will be required to account for VAT on any private use of these
cars and on their resale under the normal VAT rules.
VAT will no longer be charged on the salary forgone when employees are
offered a choice between the private use of a company car or additional
salary, from 1 April 1992.
Business rates
England and Wales: There will be amendments to the transitional arrangements
for properties in England and Wales which face large changes in national
non-domestic rate bills as a result of the 1990 reforms. These changes will
reduce the total rates bill in England and Wales for 1992-93 by 3 1/4 per
cent.
For 1992-93 only, rate bills for properties in transition to higher bills
will not increase in real terms. Instead bills will increase by only 4.1 per
cent, in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to
September 1991 used in setting the uprating of business poundages already
announced in November 1991.
New occupiers will be able to inherit the transitional relief due to the
previous occupier, from 11 March 1992.
For properties in transition to lower rate bills, the maximum reduction in
rate bills in real terms for 1992-93 will be 22 per cent for large
properties and 27 per cent for smaller properties.
This is 9 percentage points higher in each case than in 1991-92. All
properties gaining from the 1990 reforms will benefit from fully reduced
bills from 1993-94.
Scotland and Northern Ireland: Scotland and Northern Ireland have different
arrangements for business rates but their total rates bills for 1992-93 will
also be reduced by 3 1/4 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): Underlying inflation likely
to continue its steady fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains articles from the Financial Statement and Budget
Report for 1992-93, which was issued by the government after the
chancellor's speech. The report, known as the 'Red Book', gives the
government's economic forecasts to mid-1993, outlines the proposed tax
changes in the Budget and sets out the latest version of the Medium Term
Financial Strategy.
Inflation has fallen sharply over the past year. RPI inflation was 4 per
cent in January compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. Producer output
price inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) fell to 2 3/4 per cent
in February. RPI inflation may rise slightly in the next few months, as the
effects of last year's Budget and mortgage rate cuts drop out. But it is
forecast to fall back to 3 3/4 per cent by the fourth quarter, and to 3 1/4
per cent by the second quarter of 1993. Underlying inflation should continue
to fall steadily with producer price inflation expected to fall to 1 1/2 per
cent by mid-1993.
The level of GDP stabilised in the second half of 1991, but signs of
recovery evident in the summer and early autumn were not sustained. GDP fell
by nearly 2 1/2 per cent in 1991 as a whole. Activity is expected to recover
through 1992 as consumers' expenditure and exports pick up and destocking
comes to an end. GDP is forecast to rise by 1 per cent in 1992, but by 2 per
cent in the year to the second half.
The rate of increase of unemployment fell sharply through 1991, though
progress has slowed in recent months. Unemployment may continue rising for a
while yet, though at a slower rate.
The current account deficit is forecast to rise from Pounds 4 1/2 bn in 1991
to Pounds 6 1/2 bn in 1992, as domestic demand recovers and invisibles lose
the benefit of Gulf contributions and unusually low net EC contributions in
1991.
Since sterling joined the ERM, UK interest rates have fallen, narrowing
sharply the differential with rates in the low inflation ERM countries. M0
was within its target range for the whole of the last year and in the upper
half of its range since September.
The PSBR is forecast to be Pounds 13 3/4 bn in 1991-92 and Pounds 28bn in
1992-93.
World economy
Signs of recovery in the world economy faded towards the end of last year
and growth in the major seven economies in 1991 is now estimated at 1 per
cent, the lowest since 1982. GDP in the G7 is expected to rise by 1 1/2 per
cent in 1992, with growth picking up through the year. Inflation is forecast
to be 3 per cent by the end of the year.
Growth in the G7 economies remained very subdued in the closing months of
1991, with few signs of the recovery expected at the time of the Autumn
Statement. The US economy started to recover in the spring, but by the end
of the year growth had again slowed. In the second half of last year western
Germany registered a fall in output, and growth in Japan slowed sharply. For
the G7 as a whole, GDP is estimated to have grown by around 1 per cent in
1991, the weakest performance since 1982.
Industrial production in the G7 countries rose in the summer but stalled in
the autumn. There were renewed signs of weakness in most G7 countries around
the turn of the year. Business and consumer confidence indicators have
fallen sharply in recent months in Japan and Germany. In the US, business
confidence improved significantly in February, but consumer confidence was
at its lowest since 1974.
The very slow growth and increasing levels of spare capacity in almost all
G7 countries have placed continued downward pressure on inflation. In the
fourth quarter of 1991 consumer price inflation averaged 3 1/2 per cent in
G7 countries, compared with 5 1/2 per cent a year earlier. There were
particularly large reductions in the US and Canada, as well as the UK.
Against the trend, German inflation rose to a little over 4 per cent in the
latest three months, compared with 3 per cent a year earlier. The generally
good inflation performance has been helped by continuing weakness of
commodity prices, in particular of metals, which have been affected by
increased exports to the west from the former Soviet Union.
Outside Europe the easing of inflationary pressures has allowed short term
interest rates to fall further, by over 1 percentage point since October in
the US and Japan. In the US the discount rate is now at its lowest since
1964. In Europe interest rates remain high. Official rates rose in December
in all ERM countries except the UK, following the rise in German rates.
Government deficits widened in most G7 countries in 1991. Outside Germany
this mainly reflected the effects of automatic stabilisers.
The US current account moved back into small deficit in the second half of
1991, following the exceptional surplus in the first half, which was
entirely accounted for by Gulf war burden-sharing contributions. The
Japanese surplus in 1991 was Dollars 73bn, 2 1/4 per cent of GNP and the
highest since 1988. The German current account remained in small deficit
throughout the year.
Against a background of falling inflation, lower interest rates outside
Europe and widening fiscal deficits, a recovery in output is forecast this
year. GDP growth in the G7 is forecast to be 1 1/2 per cent in 1992. It is
expected to be stronger in the second half than the first, especially in the
US and Germany. In the first half of 1993 G7 GDP growth is forecast to be 2
3/4 per cent, about the same as the average between 1979 and 1989, the last
two cyclical peaks.
This forecast represents a muted recovery by past standards. This partly
reflects the comparatively slow recovery forecast for the US, where high
levels of personal and corporate indebtedness and an historically low saving
ratio make it unlikely that the rapid growth rates typical of previous
recoveries will be repeat ed. US growth is forecast to be about 2 per cent
by the end of this year, after a slow first half. A recovery in real
incomes, especially in the second half of the year, is the main factor lying
behind this pick-up. US exports are forecast to continue to perform well,
benefiting from the lagged effects of a weak dollar.
Only sluggish growth is forecast in the three main continental European
economies this year, averaging about 1 1/4 per cent. Growth in Germany will
be rather less than this, but will be helped by the removal of the temporary
income tax surcharge in July 1992. However, 1993 looks like being a better
year for these countries, particularly Germany.
Non-oil commodity prices are forecast to remain around present levels in
real terms. Oil prices have fallen since the autumn, reflecting weak demand
and changing views about the prospects for supplies from Kuwait, Iraq and
the former Soviet Union. The recent OPEC agreement is unlikely to lead to a
significant change in prices. Brent is assumed to average Dollars 18 a
barrel, close to recent levels.
Downward pressure to continue
With activity forecast to remain below trend, and a favourable outlook for
commodity prices, downward pressure on inflation is expected to continue. G7
consumer price inflation is forecast to be about 3 per cent by the end of
the year, remaining little changed in the first half of 1993. After reaching
a peak in the spring, German inflation is forecast to fall back, dropping
sharply in July as last year's oil tax rise drops out of the year-on-year
calculation. However, it will pick up again at the beginning of 1993 if the
proposed 1 point rise in the VAT rate is introduced.
Subdued growth in all the G7 countries makes it unlikely that there will be
large changes in current accounts. The US deficit is forecast to widen, but
this largely reflects the one-off nature of the Gulf war burden-sharing
contributions in 1991. For Japan much of the rise in the current account
surplus last year can be attributed to improvements in the terms of trade.
No repeat of this is forecast, and the current account surplus is therefore
expected to remain around 2 per cent of GNP.
Latest information suggests that the growth of total world trade in 1991 was
1 1/4 per cent. The collapse of trade both to and from the economies of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union contributed to the slow recorded
growth in 1991. Growth of total world trade is forecast to pick up to 3 3/4
per cent in 1992. It is not until 1993 that growth again approaches the
average for the second half of the 1980s. World trade in manufactures
follows a similar pattern.
GDP levelled out in the second half of 1991; in the fourth quarter it was
much the same as in the second quarter. But signs of recovery last summer
and early autumn were not sustained. GDP fell by nearly 2 1/2 per cent in
1991 as a whole. Non-oil GDP continued to decline through last year, though
at a moderating pace. By the fourth quarter it was 3 3/4 per cent below its
peak in the second quarter of 1990.
The failure of the recovery to take hold in the second half of 1991 was part
of a pattern of weakening activity in most of the major countries. Similar
factors may have been at work in a number of countries, and may have been
mutually reinforcing, resulting in a general deterioration in confidence. In
the UK this partly reversed the large improvement in business and consumer
confidence seen earlier in the year. Weaker activity in the rest of the
world meant that exports were lower than they would otherwise have been. And
domestic demand remained subdued, as consumers and businesses sought further
improvements in their financial position. Despite signs of a pick-up in
retail sales around the middle of the year, the expected recovery in
consumers' expenditure did not materialise. And although manufacturing
investment levelled out, total business investment continued to fall.
Domestic demand fell by  1/4 per cent between the first and second halves,
and by 3 per cent in 1991 as a whole.
Within GDP, the output of the service sector continued to fall in the second
half of 1991, though at a slower rate. Energy output rose in the third and
fourth quarters, as oil output recovered from the effects of safety-related
maintenance work which depressed output earlier in the year. However,
manufacturing output, after levelling out in mid-year, fell by a further 1
1/4 per cent in the fourth quarter, and by 5 1/4 per cent in 1991 as a
whole. This is consistent with CBI survey evidence which showed a steady
improvement in manufacturers' output expectations until the autumn, but some
deterioration since then, once it became clear that the recovery had not
become established.
Nevertheless the forces making for recovery are still in place, including
the continuing effects of lower interest rates, falling inflation and the
automatic fiscal stabilisers. And consumer and business confidence, though
lower than in the autumn, remain well above the levels of a year ago.
Although growth may be slow at first it should gather pace through the year,
as consumer spending picks up, recovery in the world economy boosts exports,
and destocking comes to an end. GDP is forecast to rise by 1 per cent in
1992, but by nearly 2 per cent in the year to the second half, and by 3 per
cent in the year to the first half of 1993. The pace of the recovery is
expected to be about the same as that following the previous two recessions.
Manufacturing output may rise by only  1/2 per cent in 1992, but is forecast
to rise more rapidly than GDP from mid-1992 onwards.
Consumers' expenditure flattened off in the second half of 1991, having
fallen by 2 3/4 per cent in the year to the second quarter. The saving ratio
rose sharply through 1990 and levelled off in 1991 at around 10 per cent,
historically high for a period of low inflation. Housing investment has also
been cut back sharply. The personal sector has therefore moved from
substantial financial deficit in 1988 to an estimated surplus of Pounds 17
1/2 bn, over 4 per cent of income, in 1991.
Personal income likely to rise
A number of factors should help to increase consumer spending. Real personal
disposable income, down  3/4 per cent in 1991, is forecast to rise by a
similar amount in 1992. The 4 1/2 point reduction in interest rates since
October 1990, and the halving of the inflation rate last year, have yet to
have their full effect. And although personal wealth has fallen, largely
because of lower house prices, it remains high by all but the standards of
the late 1980s. There is scope for the saving ratio to fall back from its
current high level without damaging personal sector balance sheets, but the
forecast assumes only a modest fall, to 9 1/2 per cent by the first half of
1993.
These positive influences may be offset to some extent by the effects of
continuing weakness in the housing market - any recovery here during 1992 is
likely to be slow - and by high levels of debt. The rise in the debt-income
ratio in the late 1980s was unprecedented, and past relationships provide
little guide to how far consumers might now want to retrench. However, a
sharp deceleration of personal borrowing stabilised the debt-income ratio in
1991, and some fall is possible during 1992. Lower interest rates mean that
the costs of servicing debt have already fallen sharply. As a result, real
disposable income for a typical family with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage has
risen by over 15 per cent since October 1990.
Consumers' expenditure is forecast to rise by 1 per cent in 1992, though the
initial pick-up could be slow and the precise timing is uncertain. It is
forecast to rise by 1 3/4 per cent in the year to the second half of 1992
and by 3 per cent in the year to the first half of 1993. Housing investment
is likely to remain weak for a while before picking up later this year. The
personal sector is expected to remain in substantial financial surplus.
Business investment peaked at record levels in early 1990 but has since
fallen as companies have sought to improve their financial position against
a backdrop of falling incomes. Business investment fell by 11 3/4 per cent
in 1991.
If investment bears its usual relation to the cycle, it may continue to
decline for a short time after output has begun to rise, though the fall
forecast for 1992 is much less than that seen in 1991. This is consistent
with the message from recent business surveys. The CBI balances for optimism
and investment intentions have weakened since the Autumn Statement but
remain well above their troughs of a year ago.
Even at its trough in 1992, the ratio of business investment to GDP is
forecast to be higher than in any year during the 1970s and the first half
of the 1980s, a consequence of the record growth rates seen in the late
1980s. With profitability increasing and the recovery becoming well
established, business investment is forecast to rise by 3 per cent in the
year to the first half of 1993. And the conditions should be in place for
stronger growth thereafter.
General government investment fell by 9 1/4 per cent in 1991, but is
forecast to rise by 10 3/4 per cent in 1992. The year-on-year growth rates
have been distorted by fluctuations in the quarterly pattern of local
authority investment, and by the surge in local authority investment at the
beginning of 1990 as authorities forestalled the new capital control regime
introduced in April of that year. The forecast level of general government
investment in 1992 is 24 per cent higher than that in 1988 and 50 per cent
higher than in 1979.
Preliminary indications for 1991 suggest that companies continued to cut
their stock levels in response to their difficult financial position. But
the rate of destocking has eased, and this trend is forecast to continue in
1992. As a result, while stock levels may continue to fall through much of
1992, stockbuilding is forecast to make a positive contribution to growth.
Companies may begin to build up stocks from late 1992 to keep pace with
rising sales and output. The change in stockbuilding could add 1 per cent to
GDP growth in the year to the first half of 1993.
Industrial and commercial companies' profits (net of stock appreciation) are
estimated to have fallen by 1 3/4 per cent in 1991. But with a sharp fall in
outlays, company saving rose a little. Together with the decline in capital
expenditure this led to a halving of the financial deficit in 1991.
Adjustment is forecast to continue in 1992, aided by a recovery in profits.
By the first half of 1993 industrial and commercial companies could be close
to financial balance.
Employment and unemployment
Companies have reduced employment more quickly relative to output in this
recession than in previous downturns. This no doubt reflects their
determination to keep costs under control to maintain com petitiveness, now
that sterling is in the ERM. As a result, productivity has held up better
this time than in previous post-war recessions. In the manufacturing sector,
productivity rose by 2 3/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of
1991. It is now close to its all time high, even though output is 8 per cent
below its peak in the second quarter of 1990. Productivity growth is
expected to gather pace in 1992.
Latest data indicate that employment has fallen by 1m from its record level
in June 1990. It is likely to continue to fall for a while yet, though at a
moderating pace. The upward trend in unemployment abated sharply in the
course of 1991, much as expected. The trend monthly increase in unemployment
levelled off around the turn of the year but is likely to moderate further
in the months ahead as activity picks up.
The current account deficit in 1991 is estimated to have been Pounds 4 1/2
bn, sharply down from the Pounds 15 1/2 bn deficit recorded for 1990.
The visible deficit nearly halved from Pounds 18 1/2 bn in 1990 to Pounds
10bn in 1991. Exports reached record levels during the year, and low
domestic demand held imports down. The surplus on invisibles rose sharply to
Pounds 5 1/2 bn in 1991 from Pounds 3bn in 1990, thanks to Gulf receipts and
unusually low net EC contributions.
Unit labour costs grew much faster in the UK than elsewhere during 1990, and
cost competitiveness continued to weaken in early 1991. Since then it has
been improving. Price competitiveness deteriorated less than cost competiti
veness in 1990 and had already started to improve by the end of the year as
UK exporters cut their margins sharply.
Over the forecast period UK competitiveness is expected to improve, with
manufacturing unit labour costs growing less quickly here than in the other
main manufacturing countries. UK manufacturing unit labour cost growth has
already fallen to under 4 1/2 per cent from a peak of around 11 per cent. It
is expected to slow further in 1992 and to fall in the first half of 1993,
reflecting both the slowdown in earnings growth and the pick-up in
productivity.
Bigger share of world trade
The volume of exports of manufactures increased by 3 1/4 per cent in 1991.
While this was only around half as fast as in 1990, it nevertheless
represents a strong performance when set against estimated world trade
growth of manufactures of 1 3/4 per cent. The UK's share of world trade in
manufactures is estimated to have risen in 1991 for the third year running.
It may be that firms switched into exports in the face of weak domestic
demand. But there also appears to have been an improvement in underlying
performance. The favourable trend in competitiveness should keep the share
rising in the medium term, though it may be broadly unchanged in 1992 before
picking up again in the first half of 1993. Manufactured exports could be 6
3/4 per cent higher at the end of 1992 than a year earlier, and 4 per cent
higher in 1992 as a whole.
Imports of non-oil goods fell by 3 per cent in volume terms in 1991
following a near standstill in 1990. Nevertheless imports were on a rising
trend during the year. The low figure for 1991 as a whole was the
consequence of low domestic demand; the upward trend during the year, which
was mainly accounted for by imports of basic materials and capital goods,
was perhaps a sign that firms were preparing for the recovery.
Non-oil import volumes could rise by 4 3/4 per cent overall in 1992. The
growth is likely to be uneven - slow in the first half, faster in the second
 -in line with the projected pattern of demand. Import penetration is likely
to continue to rise, but modestly by past standards thanks to the favourable
trend in UK competitiveness. The trend in import penetration has been upward
for many years in the UK as elsewhere because of the effect on trade
patterns of increasing specialisation of world production.
The current account in 1991 benefited from an improvement in the non-oil
terms of trade. While export prices were hardly changed, import prices fell
by 2 3/4 per cent. Export and import prices are expected to change little in
1992.
North Sea oil production recovered sharply in the second half of 1991,
following the extended shutdowns for safety work which depressed output in
1990 and the first half of 1991. It is expected to remain around this higher
level in 1992, with oil production about 6 per cent up on 1991 and close to
the centre of the Department of Energy's Brown Book range.
In 1992 oil prices are assumed to be close to recent levels, nearly 10 per
cent lower than last year. But because production is forecast to be higher
than last year, the surplus on trade in oil is expected to rise to around
Pounds 1 1/2 bn.
The surplus on invisibles in 1991 turned out a good deal higher than
expected at the time of the Autumn Statement, largely because of significant
upward revisions to the balance of interest, profits and dividends (IPD).
But even after the revisions, the balance of IPD was only Pounds 1 1/2 bn in
1991, down from Pounds 3bn in 1990. The low figure was in part accounted for
by oil companies' stock losses as oil prices fell from their peak during the
Gulf crisis. But unusually low net government transfers offset the effect of
this on the invisibles balance. The low transfers were due to lower than
usual net payments to the EC and large one-off receipts from overseas
governments related to the Gulf war. As a result, the invisibles surplus
rose sharply in 1991, masking the weak IPD performance.
Because the special factors boosting the balance of transfers in 1991 will
not be repeated, the invisibles balance is projected to fall back to around
Pounds 4 1/2 bn in 1992, from Pounds 5 1/2 bn in 1991. But the underlying
trend is improving. The balance of services is forecast to rise in 1992. IPD
should recover from the low 1991 level as the oil price falls of 1991 are
assumed not to recur.
Net overseas assets are estimated to have risen to around Pounds 37bn at the
end of 1991 from around Pounds 20bn at the end of 1990. As the current
account was in deficit, this rise is more than accounted for by
revaluations, mainly reflecting movements in world stock markets. But some
capital flows are difficult to measure, and the outstanding stock of assets
is difficult to value, which means that estimates of net overseas assets
must be interpreted with considerable caution.
The current account deficit is expected to widen to Pounds 6 1/2 bn in 1992
from Pounds 4 1/2 bn in 1991. The fall in the invisibles surplus accounts
for half the increase as the special factors in 1991 unwind. Although the
deficit on manufactures rises by Pounds 1 1/2 bn, the trade performance of
the manufacturing sector is nevertheless expected to be strong. This
deterioration is relatively gentle given expected world trade and domestic
demand growth, because of the improved competitive position of UK industry.
Over the period 1988-1990, the private sector's financial position
deteriorated sharply as spending outstripped income. The deficits were
without precedent in the last 70 years. The position was unsustainable and a
correction was inevitable; the private sector reduced its deficit in 1990
and moved into surplus in 1991.
The surplus is forecast to increase in 1992 and the first half of 1993 to
levels which, as a percent of GDP, would be comparable with those of the
first half of the 1980s. Both companies and persons contributed to the
improvement in the private sector's financial position in 1991, and the
pattern in 1992 is expected to be much the same. The large current account
deficits of 1988-1990 were the counterpart of the unprecedentedly large
private sector financial deficits. The move of the private sector back into
surplus is reflected in lower current account deficits.
Producer output price inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) has
continued to fall in recent months, to 2 3/4 per cent in February - the
lowest rate since 1969 - compared with 6 1/2 per cent early last year. The
annualised rate in the latest three months on the previous three months is
now down to 2 1/4 per cent. Although unit labour cost growth is well down on
a year earlier, profit margins remain under pressure.
Retail price inflation has also fallen substantially, to 4 per cent in
January compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. The all-items rate has
fluctuated over the last few months as the effects of changes in mortgage
rates and oil prices in late 1990 have dropped out of the calculation.
Excluding these, the underlying rate has continued to fall in response to
weak consumer demand and smaller rises in food prices. But retail price
inflation excluding mortgage interest payments remains at around 5 1/2 per
cent, somewhat above producer price inflation. This partly reflect s the
stubbornness of inflation in some services prices.
Underlying earnings growth below 7 1/2 %
Pay settlements have fallen in response to falling inflation, weak labour
market conditions and pressure on companies to maintain competitiveness.
Provisional CBI data show settlements in manufacturing in the last quarter
of 1991 averaging 4 per cent compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. Whole
economy underlying earnings growth stood at 7 1/4 per cent in December,
compared with a peak of 10 1/4 per cent in July 1990. This is the first time
since 1967 that underlying earnings growth has been below 7 1/2 per cent.
Earnings growth should continue to fall over the coming year as lower
settlements feed through, although there may be some pick-up in wage drift
as activity increases. A cyclical recovery in productivity should also help
to restrain manufacturers' unit labour costs, which are forecast to fall as
the recovery gathers pace. This underpins the forecast of further falls in
producer price inflation, to 2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 1
1/2 per cent by the middle of 1993. There should still be scope for
companies to rebuild profit margins as demand rises.
Underlying retail price inflation is also expected to fall through 1992 as
producer price inflation continues to fall, and services prices increasingly
respond to disinflationary pressures. Headline inflation may pick up in the
coming months as the effects of last year's mortgage rate cuts and the 1991
Budget switch from the community charge to VAT drop out of the calculation.
But RPI inflation is forecast to be down to 3 3/4 per cent by the fourth
quarter of 1992 and 3 1/4 per cent by the second quarter of 1993.
The expected progress on underlying inflation is also reflected in the
forecast for the GDP deflator, which measures the price of domestic value
added (principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output). The
GDP deflator is expected to rise by 7 per cent in 1991-92, of which the 1991
Budget VAT increase contributes about 1 per cent, but by only 4 1/2 per cent
in 1992-93.
Since the UK joined the ERM, the gap between UK interest rates and those in
the low inflation ERM countries has narrowed sharply as UK base rates have
been cut to 10 1/2 per cent from 15 per cent. The gap between base rates and
official interest rates in Europe fell further in mid-December last year
when all other ERM countries increased their official interest rates, and UK
rates were unchanged.
Following the December rise in other European interest rates, sterling fell,
reaching its lowest value against the Deutschemark since ERM entry. But the
Government's firm public commitment to the existing ERM parities and the
growing awareness in the foreign exchange markets of the improved prospects
for UK inflation helped to ensure that the pressure was short-lived.
Long term interest rates over the last year have been on a downward trend,
consistent with market expectations of falling short term rates and
inflation. The yield on 20-year gilts has fallen from 10 1/4 per cent at the
beginning of last year to little over 9 per cent on average in recent weeks.
Equity prices recovered sharply in early 1991, but showed little further
growth in the remainder of the year. Equity prices have risen over the last
couple of months, perhaps indicating improving expectations of economic
growth.
The annual growth rate of M0 has remained comfortably within its 0-4 per
cent target range for the first 10 months of 1991-92. In the first half of
the financial year M0 growth was a little below the mid-point of the range;
in the second half it has been a little above the mid-point. M0 velocity
growth has been consistent with its long term trend. The annual growth rate
of M4 has continued the fall which started in early 1990. Then it was about
18 per cent; in January this year it was about 6 per cent. Bank and building
society lending growth peaked at around 25 per cent at the end of 1988;
since then it too has fallen to about 6 per cent. Recent figures suggest
that the sharp declines in the growth rates of M4 and bank and building
society lending may have come to an end. M4 velocity, which has been on a
steep downward trend since the early 1980s, appears to have fallen only
marginally over the last year.
Decline in home loans
Lower borrowing for house purchase has played a significant part in the
slowdown of lending growth. But persons' other borrowing has remained
subdued. The personal sector debt-income ratio, which rose steeply in the
1980s, partly reflecting financial liberalisation, seems now to have
stabilised and may even be falling back a little.
Firms have also been cutting back on bank borrowing. Market conditions in
1991 have led them to prefer capital issues as a source of finance. Although
M4 and M4 lending growth rates are at low levels as a result of the slowdown
in activity, there is little evidence that the economic recovery in prospect
will be inhibited by a shortage of bank or building society credit.
The accompanying table compares the main elements of the forecast publi shed
in the 1991 FSBR with the outturns for 1991 or the latest estimates for
1991-92.
Inflation in 1991 was much as forecast. Errors on the forecasts of demand,
activity and the current account were within the average errors from past
forecasts. GDP in 1991 fell by a little more than forecast. Partly as a
result the current account deficit was smaller than forecast. And the public
sector borrowing requirement is likely to be well above last year's Budget
forecast, though the error was no larger than the past average.
All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forecasts
published at the time of the last Budget and Autumn Statement both
emphasised that these are most acute when the economy is at a turning point.
This remains true on this occasion. The forecasts presented here are central
forecasts, a balance of upside and downside risks. Average errors from
previous forecasts are given in the accompanying table.
DATA to end-1991 used throughout the Financial Statement and Budget Report
is for GDP and its components, sectoral saving and financial balances are
based on preliminary indications from the CSO of the outturn to the fourth
quarter to 1991, including revision to earlier quarters. The CSO will
publish a full and revised of national accounts to end-1991 on 19 March.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Pessimistic funding forecast offers
only gilts traders joy - Barry Riley on Budget implications for a stagnant
market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It was not, in the event, quite the generous Budget that the whispers had
indicated. Tax concessions amounted in aggregate to about Pounds 1.5bn
against anything up to Pounds 4bn which had been mooted in the City
scribblers' circulars.
But this brought no relief to the gilt-edged market last night because the
Chancellor's starting point appears to have been worse than all but the most
pessimistic had been anticipating. It was not so much a giveaway as a
spendaway Budget.
A big funding job now beckons for the Bank of England. The PSBR of Pounds
28bn for 1992-93, with a possibly optimistically calculated Pounds 32bn or
so slated for the following year, caused gilt prices to fall back in late
trading.
A press notice from the Bank of England set the scene with an indication
that about six gilt-edged auctions are likely over the next year, each
raising Pounds 2-3bn or even more if conditions are favourable. Those should
account for between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 20bn. Last year's auctions were
for more modest sums.
Net gilt-edged borrowing may be some Pounds 25bn next year, allowing for
redemptions. But gross issuance of gilts should be about Pounds 33bn,
although the exact total will depend on the success of the revived sales
drive at National Savings, and also on the flows of revenues from
privatisation sales which are estimated at Pounds 8bn. If you exclude
privatisation receipts, which to varying degrees you may have to if any
government other than a majority Tory administration is returned at the
election, the PSBR would be Pounds 36bn next year. In any case,
privatisation revenues are expected to tail off sharply after next year.
The gilts market does not really know whether to laugh or cry at all this.
On the one hand, the market makers are delighted at the prospective
expansion of business. Their territory has already stopped shrinking, and
will soon be growing at a spanking pace. But will the supply of paper be so
great as to demoralise purchasers? Not if you believe the traditionally
self-correcting projections in the medium term financial strategy, which
shows the PSBR dwindling back to a modest  3/4 per cent of GDP in 1996-97
(Pounds 6bn or so).
This depends, however, on economic growth hitting 3 1/2 per cent for years
at a stretch in the mid-1990s. If the depression were to persist the numbers
would look awful, however. After all, in the financial year starting next
month government receipts in money terms are projected to rise by only 3 1/2
per cent while expenditure jumps by 9 1/2 per cent.
Taking the official view at face value, however, the financing problem is
not enormous, although efforts may need to be made to jolt some of the
domestic investment institutions into changing their investment strategy.
Recently much of the running has been made by foreigners. The important
point to bear in mind here is that the gilt-edged market no longer stands
proudly, or sometimes forlornly, alone as it did in the 1970s. Since the UK
became a full member of the European Monetary System in October 1990 the
gilt-edged market has become a rather unimportant corner of the broader
European government bond market.
Because there are doubts about whether the UK will really be able to sustain
a central exchange rate of DM2.95, and because there is in any case the
extra currency risk of a 6 per cent fluctuation band for the time being,
British government debt pays a premium over that of other leading EC member
states. Ten-year gilts pay about 150 basis points (1.5 per centage points)
over German bunds, while the French government gets away with a
corresponding premium of say 90 basis points.
Still, at these kinds of rates there is potentially a very large
international demand. This already came into play in 1991, when foreigners
had the same net uptake, Pounds 5.3bn, as domestic non-bank investors. Many
overseas investment institutions, after all, are keen and regular bond
buyers. The problem is that many British institutions have lost the habit.
Now the Bank of England must stimulate it again.
During the first three quarters of 1991 the long-term institutions - mainly
life insurance companies and pension funds - actually continued to be net
sellers of gilts to the tune of almost Pounds 2bn, although by the end of
that period they had begun to buy.
During the 1980s the institutions turned away from gilts, especially the
pension funds. At the beginning of that decade pension funds had around 25
per cent of their portfolios in gilts (and life funds a lot more). But the
latest figures for end-1991 show that the typical pension fund had 3 per
cent or less in fixed interest gilts, although possibly 1 to 2 per cent in
index-linked gilts as well. Exposure to overseas bonds is about 5 per cent,
as large as the whole investment in British government securities.
Viewed positively there is a big opportunity here for the authorities to
engineer a portfolio shift. The investment institutions have an annual cash
flow of some Pounds 40bn, so if a substantial proportion of this could be
directed into gilts the problem would be solved. As recently as the early
1980s about a third of pension fund cash flow was going into gilts of one
sort or another (though since 1986 the funds have been consistent net
sellers).
The task may be more difficult than it looks, however. Fund managers will
need to be convinced that the outlook for equities - to which pension funds
have an 80 per cent exposure - has become poor. Moreover they will want a
secure real return on gilts. This can no doubt be made credible by the UK's
ever-closer attachment to the EMS, with entry to the narrow fluctuation
bands promised 'in due course' by Norman Lamont in his speech yesterday.
However, the market has tended to hope that the EMS would be the basis for
long-term financial prudence, not a borrower's charter.
Meanwhile, taxpayers may worry that the borrowing could become very
expensive for the government. Public borrowing is deferred taxation, so long
as you stick to sound money.
It was not quite like this in the past. The last wave of massive UK
government borrowing was in the 1970s. But the burden was eroded by
inflation which totalled 270 per cent in the ten years starting 1973. That
was 14 per cent a year on average, so the 12-15 per cent interest paid out
was a complete illusion. Since 1982 inflation has averaged only 5.7 per cent
a year. Now there is the prospect that it might fall to the 2 to 3 per cent
range. So a government going on a protracted borrowing binge at 9.5 per cent
could soon find itself in the plight of a yuppie house buyer of 1988
vintage.
Ahead of a closely-fought general election, however, a Chancellor of the
Exchequer has little option. Ironically the gilt-edged traders might have
responded better if Norman Lamont had produced a few more bribes. At least
that would have made a Tory election victory seem more likely.
As it is, Mr Lamont has turned on the taps which his successors may be happy
to keep gushing at full capacity. Within three years the government's
financial position has turned around from substantial surplus to heavy
deficit. The recession has something to do with it, but there is more
besides. If the Conservatives behave like this, what can the gilt-edged
market expect under John Smith?
Last night the investors were just a shade nervous. The gilt-edged market
makers, however, can expect to be busy and prosperous for a long time to
come.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Buying votes for peanuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clever Budget, but just possibly not clever enough. It looks prudent - or
shall we say less imprudent than anticipated - and therefore it does not
unduly frighten the horses. It will make most voters some Pounds 130-plus a
year better off, or rather less than that if increased excise duties are
taken into account. The payoff will be dribbled out in weekly allocations
over the year beginning April 5 1992, which means that the voting will
precede the backhanders. It is not absolutely clear to me that British votes
can be bought for peanuts these days.
If they can, all the election speculation is over. The Tories will be back,
and they will stay there for another 10 years, cutting taxes whenever they
can. But it is not certain that the game is over, not yet.
Let us follow the prime minister's habit and draw a line down the centre of
a sheet of paper. Take the right-hand side. Mark it 'good for the Tories'.
Tick off the items. The peanuts are intelligently targeted. Something for
the poorest pensioners. A little for the low paid. These show the
Conservatives under Mr John Major to be all heart. We must not, however,
forget the wallet. The fisc is in such an alarming state of growing
imbalance that not much could be offered, but something was found - that
very Pounds 130-plus on account. Raising thresholds would have been more
generously aimed at the poor than yesterday's surprise introduction of a new
20p rate for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income, but this was the
Budget of a Conservative administration in a state of desperation. An
unqualified focus on poverty was perhaps too much to expect.
There are other target areas. Small business will feast on a banquet of
small measures. Inheritance tax is to be reduced. The beneficiaries are
likely to be concentrated in the south-east, where Labour must make gains if
it is to win an overall majority. The motor industry is to be rescued; Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's 'great car economy' is not forgotten. The industry is
manned by those very skilled workers who helped to put her in power. The
Conservatives have not managed to restrict their handouts to the few hundred
thousand voters in marginal constituencies who must be bought off if they
are to win a fourth term, but they have come as close to it as our fiscal
system allows.
It might sound a little mixed up, but then so is the government. It will
fight the election on the proposition that it is prudent (tick it off),
understands business (another tick) and cares about the unfortunate in
society (half a tick). None of this would be good enough, but for the dream.
Yesterday's 20p rate gives verisimilitude to the Conservative claim that it
is the tax-cutting party. It underlines the charge that Labour is the party
of higher taxes. Dream or nightmare, this juxtaposition is intended to work
on the voters' minds.
The phantasmagoria is cheaply bought. It is based on small change, which is
all that will clink in our pockets if the Tories come back. For
large-denomination notes we must wait. If we want to pay more - nightmare -
we vote Labour. It has the merit of cunning. As I listened to Mr Lamont
drone on with bloodless implacability in the Commons yesterday I had a dream
of my own. The cadence-free voice was that of the chancellor, but, looking
at Mr Major sitting behind him you could not help being reminded of Joel
Gray, the emcee in the musical Cabaret.
He had that secret look on his face. You must remember the verse: money
money money money . . . money makes the world go round, ending with a
raspberry . . . sqppps . . . on being poor. Mr Major has excluded the
raspberry. He would. He is not stony-hearted. He has demonstrated that. Yet
the essence of his budget is a mark, a yen, a buck or a pound . . . that
clinking, clanking sound.
End of dream. Move to the other side of the line drawn down the centre of
the pad. Head it 'good for Labour'. We cannot fill this in quite yet, except
with guesses. The clinking, clanking sound will be tested on a date expected
to be announced by the prime minister today or tomorrow. The Labour party
has given itself a week in which to come up with an alternative. Yesterday
Mr Lamont must have taken some pleasure from the obvious discomfort of the
opposition when he produced his surprise 20p band. This destroyed the best
part of the speech prepared by Mr Neil Kinnock denouncing the Tories for
knocking a penny or two off the standard rate. No knock-off; no possibility
of denunciation. We must give our much-criticised chancellor credit when it
is due.
We cannot yet put the opposition's obvious discomfiture safely in the Tory
column, or tick it off. For the Labour response will be reshaped. Mr Kinnock
is as desperate for victory as any Tory. His entire political future depends
upon it. Before yesterday's Budget the plan was to accept whatever figure Mr
Lamont gave for the public sector borrowing requirement. Labour's putative
chancellor, Mr John Smith, would then redo the sums to come up with the same
figure. That gives Mr Smith Pounds 28bn to play with. He will have to match
Mr Lamont's ingenuity if he is to devise a more attractive-looking deal.
Mr Kinnock told us just before Christmas that Tory tax cuts would be
restored. Some of his colleagues were yesterday wishing that he had not said
that, but Mr Smith seemed determined to proceed with the original plan. If
his determination survives what is likely to be a week of earnest internal
debate, he will have to allow that the 20p band will not be introduced by
Labour this year. Mr Smith's rationale is that it constitutes a generalised
tax reduction for all people, not just the lower paid. On the assumption
that the rate stays at 25p under Labour, that gives the shadow chancellor
Pounds 1.8bn - the cost of the 20p band next year - to spend on meeting the
opposition's various promises. Tick Labour.
This is not all. Mr Lamont has more than matched Labour's offering to
pensioners, but restricted his largesse to the worst off. He is right to do
so. Labour would have to cost the enlargement to a universal benefit, minus
the extra tax income received from wealthier pensioners in receipt of the
party's proposed increase. The Conservatives said nothing new about child
benefit, which they are indexing. Labour is pledged to increase it yet
further. Mr Smith has also indicated that Labour will increase higher rate
taxes to 59 per cent, and tax investment income by 9 per cent. He may choose
to phase some or all of that in. During the coming week there will be an
assiduous use of calculators to see how much can be promised to meet
Labour's proposals to spend yet more on health and education, without giving
the appearance of profligacy.
For if Mr Major is appealing principally to the wallet, while remembering
the heart, Mr Kinnock will seek to re-awaken visions of the providing state.
Every restoration of tax, every tax increase, every reshuffle in the Smith
shadow Budget next week will convey the message that greater expenditure by
government is good for us.
Britain will then go to the polls to choose between two Budgets, each
entailing the same amount of total borrowing, but the one emphasising tax
reduction, the other public spending. The two Budgets will be very similar
when viewed by accountants and economists. They may adopt an identical
fiscal stance. But the philosophies will be widely divergent. There will be
a clear choice. This may be the first time such a public verdict on a Budget
has been so explicitly sought.
The political race is now so very close that the smallest spurt of speed by
one party or the other could make all the difference to the outcome.
Yesterday the Conservatives undoubtedly put on speed. For all I know they
may yet risk an interest rate cut to give themselves a further edge. This
will be followed by a hard-fought campaign. Absent the Smith and Kinnock
responses, nobody can safely put their money on the Tories this morning.
