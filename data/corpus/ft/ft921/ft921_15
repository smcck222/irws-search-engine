GASPROM, the former Soviet Union's gas monopoly, is being allowed by Moscow
to use part of its export profits to raise Dollars 550m (Pounds 312.5m) for
building a polyethylene plant in western Siberia, Leyla Boulton reports from
Moscow.
John Brown of the UK and Linde of Germany have completed a Dollars 6m
(Pounds 3.4m) feasibility study. But Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell,
involved in the project for two years, have failed to raise capital for it,
mainly because the only repayment offered by Moscow for loans was from the
plant's future profits. It will produce polyethylene for the plastics
industry from ethane burned off from the Urengoi gas field. Financiers will
have the chance to be repaid from gas exports starting in 1993.
Robert Graham reports from Rome: Moscow has given the go-ahead for a Dollars
130m oil terminal at Vostochny near Vladivostok. The contract has been
awarded on a key-in-hand basis by the Russian shipping consortium Far East
Shipping Company and Rosneftproduct, the republic's main oil exporter, to an
international consortium led by Italy's Ansaldo Industria, part of the
state-controlled company IRI.

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: G7 seen as key to Uruguay Round deal

<TEXT>
ONLY a crisis summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations, or EC
heads of government, can get a Gatt Uruguay Round agreement this year.
Brussels officials concluded this after Monday's sterile meeting here of EC
trade and farm ministers. It reflects a growing conviction that the chance
of a trade deal is slipping away, because of EC and US inability to agree
farm trade subsidy cuts.
In Germany, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) stepped up calls for a
summit to end the Gatt deadlock. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, SPD parliamentary
leader, urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl to contact President Francois
Mitterrand to win a compromise. A Gatt round failure could cost Germany 1m
jobs, he said.
Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, SPD finance spokesman, said it was
'incomprehensible' of Mr Kohl not to make Gatt his priority. She urged him
to call for an emergency EC summit. The ruling coalition is split on the
issue, with Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, urging a G7 summit.
Failure would be a 'catastrophe'.
The suggestions were dismissed by Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman. A
special summit could hinder negotiating necessary changes in policies, he
said. He rejected suggestions that German-French links were the critical
factor in the current Gatt talks. 'It is not just a question of
German-French relations, nor just of agriculture. It is a European-US
theme.'
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, who last autumn took a lead inside G7 in
urging a successful outcome, phoned Mr Kohl yesterday to discuss the
standstill. Mr Mollemann had promised Mr Kohl would phone President
Mitterrand and President Bush to mediate, but Mr Vogel said no such calls
had occurred.
Brussels yesterday sent, to Gatt in Geneva, schedules listing the amount of
food subsidies from which cuts would be made. In doing so, it overrode
ministerial objections that this implied a pledge to cut the volume of
subsidised exports, and the amount of subsidy. The EC is thus formally
adhering to Gatt's timetable to end the Round before April 19, and is trying
to arrange more talks with the US later this week. But France, backed by the
UK, Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium, was 'unyielding' in opposing
restraints on exports, as opposed to subsidy, Commission officials said.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Two clear frontrunners in Democratic race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democratic presidential campaign has entered a frenetic two-week 18
state election marathon with two runners now clearly in the lead: Mr Paul
Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator and Arkansas Governor Bill
Clinton.
Mr Tsongas, having won both Maryland and, unexpectedly, Utah dispelled the
conventional notion he was simply a 'regional candidate'. Mr Clinton, by
winning big in Georgia, proved he could overcome the charges of womanising
and draft-dodging.
Mr Jerry Brown, the former California Governor who managed a close win in
Colorado, can no longer be simply a figure of fun for the political
cognoscenti. However, he is still a long way from being a serious contender.
The prime victims of the anti-Washington mood abroad in the electorate were
the two Democratic senators - Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa.
After scoring only 12 per cent in Colorado and worse everywhere else, Mr
Kerrey yesterday cancelled campaign appearances in Florida and flew back to
Washington to 'reassess' his campaign.
Mr Kerrey has called a press conference for this morning and seems likely to
announce his withdrawal. Mr Harkin, who appears to have eked out a victory
in the Minnesota caucus, may hang in on the strength of his labour support.
Mr Clinton's supporters are hoping Mr Harkin will quit before the race moves
on to Illinois and Michigan on March 17. There the nation's economic woes
are worse, and the governor stands to gain among the blue collar, urban and
minority voters.
In Tuesday's primaries the dour Mr Tsongas struck a chord among the more
highly educated voters which enabled him to capture 41 per cent of the vote
to 33 per cent for Mr Clinton with the others far behind.
Mr Clinton's victory indicated that he is likely to hold on to his southern
base in next week's Super Tuesday primaries. He is attracting both white
working class and black votes with a proposal for 'a new covenant' to
embrace all levels of society and heal the racial divisions.
Mr Brown, the former governor of California, fed into the worry about the
environment and a contempt for corruption of the political process. It was a
narrow victory - 30 per cent compared to 28 per cent for Mr Clinton and 26
per cent for Mr Tsongas.
Mr Tsongas will pick up a good share of votes next week in primaries in
Massachusetts and Rhode Island and among the northern-born pensioners who
have retired to live in Florida.
His health could become a more prominent issue because his doctors cannot
say he is completely cured of cancer. However he is doing his utmost to
contradict impressions that he lacks the energy needed for months of
campaigning ahead.
Mr Tsongas will face a re-energised Mr Clinton, probably fresh from huge
wins in the South, renewing his attack on the former senator for advocating
'a refined version of 1980 style trickle-down economics.'
Mr Clinton will have to defend his record as governor of one of the poorest
states in the country. His environmental record in particular will come
under attack. He will also have to contend with the ever-present fear of
more damaging disclosures about his past.

FT  05 MAR 92 / King George's victory is spoilt: Bush ponders how to crush
rival's challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER another Pyrrhic victory in the latest primaries, President George
Bush's campaign managers are wondering what they can do to crush the
right-wing challenge to his re-election prospects and stop the damage it is
inflicting on him.
Once again Mr Bush won every state primary and caucus he contested on
Tuesday, beating Mr Pat Buchanan, the conservative television commentator,
by margins ranging from 28 to 40 percentage points. But once again he proved
unable to defeat his ebullient and acerbic critic soundly enough to stem the
impression that he, and not Mr Buchanan, was the real loser.
In Georgia, where Mr Buchanan had concentrated his campaign, the right-wing
challenger got 36 per cent of the vote to Mr Bush's 64 per cent, almost
matching his 37 per cent tally a fortnight ago in New Hampshire that
launched his rebellion against the president and the Republican party
leadership.
But in Maryland and Colorado, where he hardly campaigned, he still won 30
per cent of the votes. Exit polls showed that 40 per cent of Mr Buchanan's
voters would vote for a Democratic candidate against Mr Bush in the November
3 presidential election.
Mr Buchanan's insurgency has so far inflicted only flesh wounds on the
president. Mr Bush is still well on course to win the Republican primaries
or caucuses in every single state, so assuring himself of his party's
nomination by an overwhelming margin.
To suppose Mr Bush would be shamed by the consistent 30 per cent vote
against him into pulling out of the race is almost certainly to
under-estimate his tenacity in clinging to office.
Mr Buchanan acknowledges that he needs a real win, somewhere, to sustain his
campaign. 'We've got to start moving those levels of support up. But I think
one breakthrough and that big hollow army of King George, as we call it,
could crumble and virtually disappear,' he said yesterday.
But the repeated embarrassment will not only open up Mr Bush's flank to the
eventual Democratic candidate in November but also strain the unhappy
coalition of social conservatives, ideological free marketeers and
mainstream moderates who make up the Republican party.
Mr Bush's leadership of this coalition has been called into question by his
apparent lack of commitment to any of the ideals that inspire the Republican
rank and file. The lack of commitment that rankles most is his failure to
live up to his 1988 campaign pledge: 'Read my lips - no new taxes.'
The president has for the first time admitted that breaking this pledge, in
his 1990 budget agreement with the Democratic-dominated Congress, was a
mistake.
Until now, he had defended the budget agreement as a necessary compromise,
in which he was forced to accept higher taxes in return for tight caps on
government spending.
'Frankly, the president tore himself apart by signing the tax bill in 1990.
I'm glad to see that he's slowly, grudgingly beginning to accept the fact
that maybe it was not a good idea,' said Congressman Newt Gingrich, one of
the leaders of the right wing of the Republican party.
Mr Gingrich remains committed to Mr Bush's re-election, but shows no signs
of enthusiasm for the prospect. Like many Reagan Republicans, he longs for
someone to carry on the revolution led by President Ronald Reagan. 'While he
was a great cultural visionary leader, he didn't complete the job. And then
Bush, frankly, has not been able to figure out how to execute it,' he
complained yesterday.
Mr Bush's confession of error on the tax bill could, his advisers hope, open
the way for a fresh start, enabling him once again to position himself
against a Democratic challenger as the best defence against more tax
increases. In the process, it could win back the right-wingers who are now
deserting him.
But neither the administration nor the Bush campaign organisation give the
impression of a team rejuvenated; instead, there is a palpable air of
fatigue that Mr Buchanan's sustained sniping can only aggravate.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Insurgent Brown confounds pundits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CANDIDATE who restricts campaign contributions to Dollars 100 or less
would seem likely to wilt in the intense heat of a US presidential race.
So far, however, former Governor Jerry Brown of California is confounding
the pundits. He won his first primary victory in Colorado on Tuesday, having
come a close second to former Senator Paul Tsongas in Maine.
Mr Brown is running what he calls an 'insurgency campaign'. He will not
accept big cheques because he wants to 'give government back to the people'.
He says the US is incapable of solving its domestic problems, not for lack
of ideas but because special interest groups and an elite political ruling
class block reform.
To prove his credentials as an opponent of the system, Mr Brown strikes a
casual pose while campaigning. Polo-necked sweaters replace the white shirts
and ties of the other candidates. He also sports a red ribbon - a sign of
solidarity with Aids victims.
Part of his appeal lies in his strong environmental record while governor of
California in the 1970s. He was one of the first political leaders to impose
environmental restraints on US companies. The green movement is powerful in
both Maine and Colorado, where Mr Brown scored heavily among Democrats
rating the environment an important issue.
On taxation, Mr Brown leans towards conservative 'supply-side' policies,
favouring a 13 per cent flat rate income tax with virtually no exemptions.
Yet on health care he supports a Canadian-style universal plan that wins
support mainly among left-wing Democrats.
By gaining 30 per cent of the vote in Colorado, Mr Brown has staved off the
withdrawal of federal matching funds.
Initially written off as a crank, he is now running a clear third behind Mr
Tsongas and Governor Bill Clinton.
Few analysts believe he can improve on this position, unless he makes more
of his record as a former chief executive of America's richest and most
populous state. His insurgency campaign, however, will plough ahead, tapping
voter discontent with cash-driven conventional politics.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Brady makes strong plea on IMF quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration yesterday renewed its efforts to win approval from
Congress for its Dollars 12bn share of the International Monetary Fund's
capital increase.
Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, made a strong appeal for Congress to
pass 'this all-important legislation'.
He warned that failure to do so would block the entire Dollars 60bn quota
increase and 'seriously impede the west's entire response to the new states
of the former Soviet Union'.
Mr Brady said the IMF aid programme for the Russian republic alone would
cost roughly Dollars 4bn.
'We simply shouldn't take a chance at this particular point in time with
abandoning the democratic changes that are taking place in the republics
which formerly constituted the Soviet Union,' he said.

FT  05 MAR 92 / US 'needs new vision' to hone competitive edge: A federal
advisory council, is calling for a radical reappraisal for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIGHT THE the next US president, Republican or Democrat, be tempted to
experiment with some form of 'industrial policy?'
If the first report* from the bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council is
any guide, future administrations will certainly face increased pressure to
develop explicit policies for different industrial sectors.
As part of a comprehensive 'competitiveness strategy,' involving a shift
from budget deficit to surplus, the council argues that the federal
government should set out 'visions' of 'industry paths that would be
compatible with a prosperous and competitive American economy.' The council
bemoans that the country's two top economic officials (Treasury Secretary
and the Federal Reserve chairman) focus mainly on financial matters; the US
needs to expand the role of the Department of Commerce or Intenational Trade
Commission.
In addition to assessing US business strength, an expanded agency could
monitor the activities of foreign governments and companies to provide
'early warning of competitiveness problems.' The US intelligence community,
having lost its Cold War responsibilities, could also be mobilised to gather
such information.
The council is a federal advisory committee chaired by Mr Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington
think-tank. It was formed last year under the aegis of the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act of 1988; 12 members appointed by the administration and
both houses of Congress are drawn equally from business, labour, government
and public.
Mr Bergsten, a former economic official in the Carter administration, is
well aware that sector-specific industrial policies are likely to be the
most controversial aspect of the group's competitiveness strategy. 'I am not
trying to imitate Japan Inc,' he said, but rather 'to improve the federal
government's analytical capabilities so that it can respond intelligently to
proposals for assistance from specific industries.'
But, why should government develop sector-specific expertise, when the US
has relied successfully on the free-market for decades? The council regards
this as a misreading of history and says that the US has 'carried out
strategies towards certain sectors of the economy and key industries from
the birth of the republic under different rubrics - including agricultural
policy, defence policy and aerospace policy.'
Both Republican and Democrat administrations, the council points out, have
frequently employed import quotas, tax incentives, government procurement
and numerous other devices to support individual sectors and even individual
companies such as Chrysler and Lockheed. The trouble, it says, is that such
support is typically 'episodic and ad hoc.'
The report argues that the country's eroding competitiveness reflects three
main problems:
A proclivity to think and act short-term while competitors, mainly Japan and
Germany, adopt longer-time horizons. Short-termism is endemic in the main
sectors of households, companies and government.
Perverse incentives throughout US society. Examples include tax laws that
penalise saving, a political process that rewards spending and tax-cutting,
and an education system that offers few rewards for hard work.
A failure to think globally. The council says that business and government
policymakers remain insular in spite of the doubling of trade relative to
gross national product (GNP) that has left the US as reliant on external
markets as either Japan or the European Community. The council's advocacy of
industrial policies forms part of a tripartite approach to competitiveness
problems.
The second key element is more stable and effective macroeconomic policies
designed principally to boost US savings and investment. The council notes
that the US has been living off a huge stock of capital, much of which was
accumulated in the century between the Civil War and the Second World War.
Prior to 1940, the US savings rate was among the highest in the world, and
considerably higher than Japan's. But, while other country's savings rates
rose, that of the US remained static.
The council says that the conversion of federal budget deficits into
surpluses is essential if the savings rate is to be raised. It advocates tax
reform to reduce consumption and boost private saving.
The third element consists of fundamental reforms, including an overhaul of
education and training, health-care provision, corporate governance and
financial markets, technology policy and trade policy. It plans to make
specific recommendations in these areas in a report timed to influence the
winner of this November's presidential election.
Mr Bergsten concedes that many of the council's proposals stand a better
chance of being implemented if a Democrat were elected president, but he
stresses that Republicans on the council, from both private business and
state government, are strong supporters of initiatives such as
sector-specific industrial policies.
After three years' stagnation, the centre of economic gravity in the US
seems shifting rapidly. Policies that seemed unthinkable in the Reagan era
may yet form central planks in the policies of future administrations.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Hong Kong to leave China higher reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is planning to leave to China an accumulated budget surplus nearly
two and a half times the level promised by Britain last September in an
accord between the two countries.
Mr Hamish MacLeod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said in his maiden
budget yesterday that by March 1997 the government planned to have
accumulated fiscal reserves of HKDollars 71.6bn (Pounds 5.26bn). Hong Kong
reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997.
Last September Mr John Major, the British prime minister, undertook to leave
the new Hong Kong government with reserves of HKDollars 25bn, including
outstanding debt no greater than HkDollars 5bn. This pledge came amid
agreement with Beijing that the colony could build a HKDollars 100bn airport
and related infrastructure projects.
Mr MacLeod said that at the end of March 1997 the colony's reserves would
amount to HKDollars 62.8bn and outstanding debt, which is included in
reserves, would be HkDollars 4.8bn.
To achieve this outcome he raised the corporate tax rate to 17.5 per cent
from 16.5 per cent, despite having a large budget surplus.
It is understood that the Hong Kong government wanted a sizeable fiscal
cushion up until 1997 to ensure that unforeseeable events, such as a
worsening in the world economy, troubles in China, or a loss of investor
confidence in the colony did not leave it unable to meet its spending plans.
Mr MacLeod said in his budget speech that the projected level of reserves
would also have the additional advantage of demonstrating the colony's
financial strength and prudence. 'This should do much to reassure potential
lenders at a time when we shall be financing our infrastructural
development,' he said.
His forecast for the level of reserves are based on 5 per cent real growth
in the Hong Kong economy over the next five years and inflation, as measured
by the gross domestic product deflator, rising at an annual rate of 8.5 per
cent during that period. Consumer price inflation is expected to rise at a
faster rate.
The forecasts appear to be based on no significant changes to the cost of
the airport and related developments. Many of these projects are close to
the limits of technology, and are planned on an extremely tight time scale.
Some time slippage has already occurred.
The government's capital spending and related equity commitments connected
with the airport development are set to balloon from the 1993-94 fiscal year
on. This increase in capital spending will push the colony's public finances
into deficit - the first time in years that the government will run a
deficit not brought about by a downturn in the economic cycle.
On the capital side, the government is planning to spend HKDollars 176.5bn
of which HKDollars 44bn is attributable to the airport.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, yesterday intervened in the
Middle East peace process by asking each of the five delegation leaders to
review with him what had been achieved at the conclusion of the fourth round
of bilateral negotiations.
The Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon will hold their own
co-ordinating session in Washington before returning home.
One of the proposals they may put to their governments is for an Arab League
meeting to be called this month to seek endorsement for continued
participation in the peace process.
Members of the Palestinian and Syrian delegations say they are increasingly
convinced Israel has no intention of negotiating on the basis of UN
resolutions 242 and 338 which call for an exchange of occupied territory in
return for peace.
With Israel continuing to expropriate more land in the West Bank and Gaza
and pressing ahead with settlement building, they say it is difficult to
justify participation in the peace process.
However they accept that withdrawing would hand a propaganda victory to
Israel and would alienate the US.
With Israel's hopes of securing Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loan
guarantees from the US having all but evaporated, the choices to be posed in
the June 23 general election there have become more apparent. Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, leader of the opposition Labour Party, has pledged to stop building
new settlements in the occupied territories, which would release the US loan
guarantees, and has said he would give Palestinians the choice of being
federated with Jordan or with Israel.
The delegations have not set a time or venue for the next round of
negotiations. Israel is demanding that they should move closer to the Middle
East while the Arabs want to return to Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR Arab Israeli citizens have been arrested in connection with the killing
of three Israeli soldiers at an army camp last month. It is the most serious
act of political violence of which Israeli Arabs have been accused in more
than four years of revolt against Israeli rule in the neighbouring occupied
territories.
Mr Ya'acov Terner, Israel's chief of police, said that four men, two of them
brothers and one a Tel Aviv university electronics graduate, had confessed
to the killings.
Mr Terner said they were an isolated cell of the Islamic Jihad
fundamentalist organisation and he called on the public not to harm Arab
citizens in revenge. 'We must not make generalisations about Israeli Arabs,'
he said.
Arabs living within Israel, who have full Israeli citizenship and make up
more than 15 per cent of the population, have demonstrated in sympathy with
the uprising.
The killings exposed a breach in army security and shocked the Israeli
public. The soldiers were hacked to death with axes and knives.
Reuter adds from Geneva: The United Nations Human Rights Commission censured
Israel yesterday for human rights violations in occupied southern Lebanon.
The UN's principal rights watchdog overwhelmingly adopted a resolution
condemning Israel for its actions in the area, including abritrary detention
of civilians and the bombardment of villages.

FT  05 MAR 92 / HK increases rate of corporate tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the corporate tax rate and the closing of some tax loopholes were
the key features of the Hong Kong government's budget presented yesterday by
the colony's new financial secretary, Mr Hamish MacLeod.
The colony's corporate tax rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 17.5 per
cent - a measure that had been well leaked and discounted by the stock
market.
The budget was billed by the government as one for the man-in-the-street, a
departure for an administration seen as avowedly pro-business and a sign
that Hong Kong's experiment with limited elective democracy is having an
effect on at least the government's presentation of policy.
Mr MacLeod said his budget measures were framed against an economic
background which would see the economy expand by 5 per cent in real terms
this year after 4 per cent growth last year. Trade, the backbone of the
colony's economy, was expected to be buoyant with exports growing by 14 per
cent.
Although he was accused of not doing enough for the less well off while
penalising business, his measures are likely to pass through the Legislative
Council without serious amendment.
Mr MacLeod said stamp duty on share transactions would be lowered to 0.4 per
cent from 0.5 per cent although duty would be extended to covered warrants.

An Algerian court yesterday ordered the dissolution of the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS), two months after the fundamentalist party was denied almost
certain victory by the cancelling of parliamentary elections, Reuter reports
from Algiers.
The decision, which takes effect in one week but is subject to appeal,
closed off any other legal outlet for FIS militants who wanted to make
Algeria an Islamic state.
Mr Larbi Belkheir, the interior minister, had asked the court on February 9
to order the dissolution or suspension of the FIS, accusing the party of
multiple violations of the law. The same day, the authorities ordered a
12-month state of emergency, opening internment camps to hold detainees.
Algeria yesterday reached agreement with a group of international banks on a
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 850m) loan to refinance its principal commerical bank
debt, writers Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.

The Indian government is cutting financial support to the public sector  -
once the keystone of Indian socialism - more rapidly than official policy
pronouncements suggest, David Housego reports from New Delhi.
The administration of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is seeking,
however, to minimise job losses that could lead to a confrontation with
labour. He told parliament yesterday that as of now 'not a single worker has
been thrown out of employment.' His statement came as the Janata Dal and
left-wing parties called for a national strike to protest against what they
call 'an anti-poor' budget.
Senior officials disclosed yesterday that the government's net contribution
towards capital spending by the public sector - steel, railways, fertilisers
and other state-owned industries will drop next year by 16 per cent to
Rs35.3bn (Pounds 768m). As a result the government's net share of capital
spending by the public sector will have fallen to 9.6 per cent from 18.5 per
cent only four years ago.

THE Philippine government and Westinghouse Electric, the US conglomerate,
yesterday reached an out-of-court settlement of a long-running suit alleging
that the company bribed the late President Ferdinand Marcos to build a power
station.
The settlement, which also includes Burns &amp; Roe, a US consultant to
Westinghouse, came the day before the case was due to be heard by a jury in
a federal court in the state of New Jersey. A month ago Westinghouse failed
in a federal court appeal to get the bribery and corruption charges against
it dropped.
Both sides yesterday claimed to be satisfied with the complex settlement to
the deal, which involves Westinghouse giving Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.8m) in
concessions to the Philippines government and the government giving
Westinghouse Dollars 400m to upgrade the plant at the centre of the dispute.
The case involves a contract to build a 620MW power station on the
Philippines' Bataan peninsula, which was completed in 1986 but never used.
The government and its National Power Corporation filed suit in the US in
1988 claiming the contract was won as a result of Dollars 17m in bribes paid
to former President Marcos.
Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, the Philippines has hired
Westinghouse to rehabilitate the plant and operate it for 30 years. The
company will get an annual fee of Dollars 40m and the Philippines government
will provide Dollars 400m for the upgrade, to be borrowed from the US
Export-Import bank.
Westinghouse will net some Dollars 300m after providing the Philippines with
around Dollars 100m in cash and discounts. Mr David Boies, lead counsel for
Westinghouse, said it was a 'win win situation. The Philippines is getting a
good plant and electricity and Westinghouse is getting the opportunity to
see it operate'.
Some technical parts of the case were also being heard by the International
Chamber of Commerce in Geneva which issued a preliminary finding in December
that there was no evidence bribes were paid to win the contract.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Much of Libya's money has long been on the move: It should
be no surprise, that the country has done what it can to protect its assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS INTERNATIONAL pressure has grown for sanctions against Libya, so has
Libyan concern risen about the safety of both its deposits in overseas
banks, along with its substantial downstream investments in Europe.
It should be no surprise, therefore, given the precedent of the US freeze of
Libyan assets in January 1986 in reprisal against its alleged involvement in
terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, that Libya has done what it can to
protect its assets.
Libya holds around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in liquid assets in reporting
countries of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, and,
according to Arab and European bankers, it has shifted between Dollars 2bn
and Dollars 3bn of this towards banks in the Middle East, particularly those
in Bahrain and other Gulf centres, from London and other European centres
deemed in Tripoli to be vulnerable.
So far, however, there is no sign that Libya has been seeking either to
liquidate its substantial European investments, or to change ownership
structures to afford these investments greater protection from possible
predators. Libya's most substantial European interest is its Tamoil
petroleum distribution network in Italy and Switzerland, where Tamoil Italia
and Tamoil Suisse have 5 per cent and 8 per cent of the refined-product
market respectively.
Tamoil, purchased by the Libyans in 1986 from Lebanese investor Roger
Tamraz, is continuing its aggressive expansion in its core Italian market
and also spearheading a Libyan drive into Eastern Europe. The Italian press
is reporting that Tamoil Italia is seeking to purchase 150 petrol stations
from the Genoa-based Cameli Company for Dollars 48m to add to its more than
1,000 service stations.
Libya may well feel that there is not much more that it can do to shield its
European oil sector investments, channelled through its Netherlands
Antilles-registered investment vehicle, Oil Investments International
Company (OIIC). Oilinvest is, in turn, jointly-owned by Libyan state
institutions: the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (LAFB), the Libyan Arab Foreign
Investment Company (Lafico), and the Libyan National Oil Company (LNOC).
Oilinvest, established in 1988 to provide an umbrella for Libya's European
investments, has subsidiaries in Amsterdam and Zurich.
Libya may also have reckoned that if economic sanctions were imposed, they
would be relatively short-term and therefore would not affect its long-term
strategic investments.
But these calculations have not prevented the Libyans from battening down
the hatches. According to reports from Tripoli and from European bankers,
the government has stockpiled foods and medicines, frozen as far as possible
all non-essential imports and halted some projects altogether.
Libya is also concerned that Britain, the US and France might seek to impose
an embargo on its oil exports, albeit reluctantly, since the decision would
harm European consumers, for whom Libya is a leading supplier. Italy,
Germany and Spain are the largest purchasers of Libyan crude, together
accounting for about 75 per cent of oil exports, and the Italian state
company ENI has about 45 per cent of its reserves in Libya.
The US, meanwhile, is quietly pressing ahead with its own programme of
isolating Libya economically. The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control, the body charged with enforcing the 1986 trade embargo and
asset freeze instituted by the Reagan administration, is preparing an
enlarged list of Libyan companies and individuals with whom US business may
not deal.
OFAC officials say that not only will more institutions be added to the 60
already on the list, but additional enforcement measures will be adopted.
OFAC has been looking particularly closely at Libya's European investments.
Last August, when the latest OFAC listing was released, Mr Richard Newcomb,
its director, warned that the 'recent Libyan economic expansion into western
Europe increases Col Muammer Gadaffi's ability to promote and finance
terrorist activity'.
However, the ability of the US to interfere with Libyan activities in Europe
is constrained because they fall outside US jurisdiction and do not, as a
rule, involve US companies.
US companies and individuals engaging in business with Libya, or with those
described as 'specially designated nationals'(SDNs), are liable to maximum
criminal penalties of Dollars 500,000 per violation for corporations, and
Dollars 250,000 for individuals, plus prison sentences of up to 12 years for
individuals and senior corporate officers. Among the SDNs are such prominent
Libyan businessmen as Mr Abdullah Saudi, president of the Bahrain-based and
highly regarded Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), an attractive-looking
destination for some of the Libyan funds moving out of Europe, although Mr
Saudi yesterday denied this. 'We've seen no change in our position, even as
client,' he said.
Libya, together with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, is co-owner of
ABC. Its share is between 25 and 30 per cent. Libya also has a controlling
interest in Al-Ubaf, the Bahrain offshore banking unit which is part of the
increasingly loosely associated Union de Banques Arabes and Francaises
(Ubaf) group.
OFAC officials would not be drawn on what additional measures against Libya
are being contemplated, but a weakness of the US embargo has long been the
ability of US companies to circumvent the ban on dealings with Libya by
channelling their Libya business through European subsidiaries.
Meanwhile, the latest international row over Libya's alleged terrorist
activities is also bad news for five US oil companies - Conoco, Amerada
Hess, Marathon, WR Grace and Occidental - who are waiting for the US to lift
its 1986 ban on their doing business there. According to the US General
Accounting Office in these companies are losing between Dollars 2m and
Dollars 25m per day through their absence from Libya.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Gadaffi considers handover of bomb suspects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLONEL Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, has raised the possibility of
handing over to the US the agents accused in the Lockerbie aircraft disaster
on condition there is an 'improvement of bilateral relations.'
A report to the UN Security Council last night said this was one of the
ideas that emerged from discussions last month in Tripoli between the Libyan
authorities and Mr Vasiliy Safronchuk, a senior Russian official in the UN
secretariat.
However, diplomatic sources said that while the Libyan position appeared to
be an improvement on earlier intransigence, it still was insufficient for
the US, Britain and France to consider droppping the threat of further
measures, including sanctions.
The Security Council is expected to take up the question again after it
completes considerations of the Iraqi problem next week.
In two meetings with Mr Safronchuk, a special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general, Col Gadaffi again argued that
'constitutional obstructions' prevented handing over for trial abroad those
accused in the 1988 disaster involving Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in
Scotland.
But if those problems were solved, Libya 'could be inclined to consider
France as the possible venue for a trial,' the UN report said.
It added, however, that France had not requested that any suspects -
including those responsible for blowing up a UTA airliner over Niger nine
months after Lockerbie - be extradited.
Referring to the possibility of handing over the suspects to third
countries, Col Gaddafi mentioned Malta 'or any Arab country.'
'Improvements of bilateral relations would make it possible to hand over'
the suspects in the Pan Am disaster to US authorities, he said. Washington's
relations with Tripoli have been effectively, though not formally, broken
off.
A Libyan letter annexed to the report included other proposals. Among these
was the possibility that the suspects be questioned at the UN office in
Tripoli and that Mr Boutros Ghali appoint an impartial judicial committee to
'ascertain the facts and seriousness of the charges,' as well as conduct a
full investigation.
If the secretary-general were satisfied the charges were serious, Libya
would 'not object to extradite the suspects under his personal supervision
to a third party with the assurance that they will not be re-extradited.'

FT  05 MAR 92 / Nigeria ponders devaluation in bid to renew IMF links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government was last night considering a devaluation of
the naira as part of efforts to put the country's economic reform programme
back on course and renew a lapsed agreement with the International Monetary
Fund.
The IMF agreement is a condition to further rescheduling of the country's
Dollars 34bn (Pounds 19.3bn) external debt, of which Dollars 17bn to Dollars
18bn is owed to Paris Club creditors.
Nigeria hopes to hold talks with the club later this year.
The ground for the devaluation was prepared earlier this week. Bankers in
Lagos said they expected the central bank to announce today that the
official rate of the naira had fallen from 10.56 to between 13 and 14 to the
US dollar.
The new rate will have been determined at yesterday's weekly auction of
foreign currency by the central bank. A bank official said he expected
today's announcement to disclose a devaluation of around 30 per cent.
Such a substantial drop would not take place without the endorsement of
President Ibrahim Babangida, thought to be consulting senior advisers before
giving the final go-ahead.
Although the weekly opportunity for banks to bid for foreign exchange is
called an auction, the rate is in effect decided in advance by informal
discussions within the banking sector.
Discussions earlier this week paved the way for higher bids. Lagos bankers
say there may be further falls in the coming weeks in an attempt to close
the gap between the auction rate and local currency bureaux.
The gap has been widening over the past few months, and before yesterday's
measure the bureaux were offering between 18 and 19 naira to the dollar. The
rate was unchanged as dealers awaited an announcement.
The proposed devaluation, likely to be accompanied by a liquidity squeeze on
the banks, was welcomed by some western creditors as an essential, but
belated, effort to revive a faltering structural adjustment programme.
Government officials have said that a devaluation would show creditors that
Gen Babangida has not lost the political will to pursue the reform programme
he launched in mid-1986.
Critics, however, point out that the president has presided over a surge in
public spending over the past 18 months, much of it on uneconomic projects,
and often by-passing normal budgetary procedures. There is concern that a
drift in economic management could leave the civilian administration, due
next January, with an unmanageable economic inheritance.
Yesterday's move coincides with the visit to Lagos by a team from the IMF.
In a mid-term review last year, the Fund criticised government's failure to
fulfil the terms of a SDR319m 18-month standby agreement which expires on
April 8.
One of the main conditions to a new standby agreement is that the government
reforms Nigeria's complex exchange rate system which allows scores of
recently formed small banks to benefit from the wide margin between the
official rate and market demand.
The World Bank has calculated that in 1990, when the spread between official
and parallel rates averaged 20 per cent, the effective subsidy was some
Dollars 500m.
The World Bank has argued that genuine foreign exchange auction would remove
much of the spread and increase government revenue. But many of the 80 or
more banks that have entered the market since 1986 would not survive the
squeeze. Hence this group of banks, many of which have close links with
government, has a vested interest in the status quo.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies plan to reduce capital spending by 4 per cent during the
financial year beginning next month, suggesting that the weakness in the
economy will continue, according to a survey by the Industrial Bank of
Japan.
The planned fall in investment follows an expected 5.4 per cent increase in
the current year and double-digit growth in the three previous years, and
highlights industry's expectation of slower domestic demand and a faint
international recovery.
Manufacturing companies told the bank that capital spending for the coming
year is likely to fall by 10.7 per cent, while non-manufacturing industry
expects a 3.1 per cent drop. Electric power companies expect a 6 per cent
rise.
The bank said the investment decline by manufacturing companies was the
largest since 1978.
Capital spending has also been slowed by turmoil on Japan's financial
markets as companies had tapped the stock market for low-cost funds in the
late 1980s to expand capacity and introduce labour-saving technology.
The predicted falls reflect a readjustment of inventory the Bank of Japan
argues is to be expected.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S President Richard von Weizsacker warned last night that the cost
and duration of support for east Germany had been seriously underestimated.
He warned west Germans against deceiving themselves that genuine unification
of the country could be achieved without sacrifices. It was wrong to insist
that a recovery in the east should only be financed if it meant no decline
in western living standards.
President von Weizsacker's speech, at the annual Leipzig spring fair, is his
most open criticism to date of the insistent optimism of his former
colleague, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the German coalition government.
He has leapt into the heart of the sensitive political debate on the costs
of unification, and poured cold water on Mr Kohl's repeated insistence that
recovery in the east could come within three years.
'All too many people have underestimated the severity and duration of the
transformation process, as they have the extent and duration of the
necessary financial transfers from west to east.
'It was self-deception to believe that the economic and social unification
could be paid for from the increase in economic growth, and that it would
not demand significant sacrifices from the people in the west.'

NATO yesterday expressed concern about the fierce fighting over the enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh, as the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said about
35,000 Azerbaijanis were fleeing from Armenian attacks, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
Nato officials said Mr William Taft, the US ambassador, told his colleagues
at a weekly alliance meeting that pressure was building on Azerbaijan to
'pursue a military solution' to the dispute with Armenia over the enclave.
In Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, opposition leaders demanded the
resignation of President Ayaz Mutalibov for failing to defend the
Azerbaijani population of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian fighters.
An emergency parliamentary session was called for today following an attack
by Armenian militants on Khojaly, the second most populous Azerbaijani
stronghold in the mountainous enclave. Azerbaijan says more than 1,000
people were killed in the attack on February 26 and 27. Armenia denies any
massacre and says its people in the region have been forced to defend
themselves against Azerbaijani aggression.
Medecins Sans Frontieres said Azerbaijanis were flooding towards Baku to
escape Armenian militia attacks in the city of Agdam just outside the
enclave.
In London, it was announced that Mr Douglas Hogg, British Foreign Office
minister, will visit Azerbaijan and Armenia next week for talks.

THE price of grenades has fallen from DM100 (Pounds 37) to DM20 over the
past week in Sarajevo, the capital of the Yugoslav republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The peace agreement between Serbs, Croats and Moslems is not what has
reduced the price. It is that supplies of weapons are now more abundant as
the fear of civil war permeates the city.
Sarajevo's inhabitants are on the verge of panic. All flights out of the
city are fully booked. Rumours abound - Serbs have massacred three Moslems,
the Moslems have killed a Serb baby. Last night, Moslems for the second
night in a row massed in fear amid rumours that Serbs were marching on the
capital.
The medley of minarets and church spires in Bascarsija, the old Turkish
bazaar, was once seen as a monument to peace among the republic's Slavic
Moslems, Serbs and Croats. But the image of Sarajevo as Yugoslavia's melting
pot has been destroyed.
Everyone now seems to be armed. On the streets young men jump out of VW
Golfs, toting machine guns and hunting rifles. They vow to defend their
homes. Many are wearing maroon berets and military uniforms. They are all
prepared for another cold night on the barricades. All the self-styled
protectors blame someone else for the crisis.
A Serb blames the Moslems, the Croats and the European Community. Moslems
say Serb leaders are destroying Bosnia. But all sides agree that a conflict
in Bosnia would be much bloodier and more brutal than the war in Croatia,
which claimed at least 10,000 lives.
'Croatia is a gentle mother compared to what would happen here. God forbid
it ever starts in Bosnia,' said one Serb gunman sipping Turkish coffee at a
barricade on the road to Pale, a Serb village which lies amid snow-flecked
mountains eight miles from Sarajevo. His comrades laugh, though not in an
unkindly way, when a gun goes off and I look frantically for cover.
On another road Paja, a Moslem and a towering bear of a man, warns of a
massacre if the Serb-dominated federal army tries to take over Bosnia.
'Bosnia is not like Croatia. We have got mountains, tunnels and bridges. We
can stop the army very easily. We can block them, destroying the tunnels and
bridges. Tanks can't fly,' he says, directing his men to take up positions.
Bosnian television desperately appeals for calm. The president of Bosnia
says people should outside and enjoy the sunshine. But in this climate of
deepening hysteria, the president's appeal is seen as a veiled call to arms.
Back in the safety of my hotel I ask a man for a light. By way of reply he
pulls out a revolver. His friends, gesturing with their own pistols, laugh.
Outside gunshots pierce the twilight. In Sarajevo's neighbourhoods, where
Serbs live across the street from Moslems who live next door to Croats,
people prepare for another night of uncertainty. Others head towards the
barricades or the airport.

FT  05 MAR 92 / First class travellers may avoid queues at Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST CLASS and business class passengers flying into London's Heathrow
airport could have their own express queues for immigration controls, under
a plan put forward by airlines.
They have told the Home Office they would be prepared to pay for extra
immigration staff to speed up formalities for first and business class
passengers.
The Home Office said yesterday it was examining the proposal, which is aimed
at reducing immigration queues for non-European Community nationals. The
queues are particularly long in the early morning when flights arrive from
North America and the Far East. The suggestion has received the backing of
the British Tourist Authority.
Previous attempts by airlines to reduce Heathrow immigration queues have
foundered because the Home Office has said it does not have enough money for
additional staff. British Airways, one of the airlines behind the move, said
the offer was an attempt to overcome this difficulty.
Although the airlines would bear the cost of the extra officers, they would
remain under Home Office control. BA said that the proposal was the first
step in an attempt to shorten waiting times for passengers.
The Home Office said that because airline funding would result in an
increase in staffing it did not expect any union opposition to the proposal.
The Home Office said the plan had been supported by several airlines using
Heathrow, but not all. United Airlines, the US carrier, said it was in
favour of speeding up Heathrow immigration formalities but did not see why
it should have to bear the cost.
The Home Office said it was also looking at allowing visitors to clear UK
immigration before boarding. This would involve stationing British
immigration officers at airports in New York or Tokyo.
The British Tourist Authority has also suggested having a separate queue at
UK airports for non-EC nationals who are resident in Britain.
BAA, the company which owns Heathrow, said a survey conducted at Terminal 3
last summer revealed significantly longer waiting times for non-EC nationals
arriving on early morning flights.

FT  05 MAR 92 / British Rail plans for passenger's charter criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME passengers suffering late or cancelled trains will be worse off under
new compensation arrangements announced by British Rail yesterday.
The biggest beneficiaries of the long-awaited passenger's charter will be
Network SouthEast commuters, many of whom will get discounts of up to 10 per
cent on season ticket renewals if their lines fail to meet performance
targets.
Other passengers, however, are likely to find that compensation arrangements
are either the same or less generous than those available under the
unpublicised and arbitrary system already in existence.
Refunds will only normally be considered when trains are more than an hour
late; cash refunds will be replaced by vouchers, normally worth 20 per cent
of the fare paid; and there will be no right to compensation for
overcrowding, breakdowns in train heating or other service failures.
Under the old system, local managers had discretion to hand out cash or
travel vouchers in any circumstances where a passenger took the trouble to
write in and complain about unpunctuality or poor service.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, said the charter was an important
step forward in raising standards of service for rail passengers. But the
plans unleashed a stream of criticisms from consumer organisations,
opposition parties and trade unions.
The Consumers' Association, which is backing High Court actions by seven
passengers against let-out clauses in BR's Conditions of Carriage, said the
charter was virtually worthless. 'Vouchers and petty discounts, to be used
only in certain circumstances and given grudgingly under a complex system of
exemptions and conditions, go nowhere near far enough,' said Mr John
Beishon, the association's director.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, labelled the charter a con
trick. 'It will do nothing to improve quality on the railways and will be
shown to be a damp squib for passengers,' he said.
Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, said the aim was to improve services by giving
managers achievable performance targets. 'Faced with the choice of
compensation for delays and cancellations, or a better standard of service
all the year round, there is no doubt that our passengers would opt for
better service,' he said. 'Our aim is to give them that better service.'
The charter's main innovation is a system of compensating commuters who at
present have little or no opportunity to claim for frequently recurring
shortfalls in performance.
From May, figures will be made available at all staffed stations every four
weeks showing performance over the last year. If targets are missed by more
than a certain margin, discounts for season ticket renewals will be
automatically triggered. Those wanting to claim for disruption to individual
journeys will pick up forms at stations.
It is estimated that the cost of compensation will rise from Pounds 7m for
the financial year just ending to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year under the new
scheme because of a sharp increase in the number of claims.
Mr John Welsby, BR's chief executive, said the increase was equivalent to
0.5 per cent of BR's annual fare revenue.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Libya shifts assets from Europe: Tripoli transfers up to
Dollars 3bn to Middle East banks as west considers sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER, MARK NICHOLSON and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA has shifted between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds
1.7bn) of its overseas assets from Europe to banks in the Middle East. It is
hoping to put them beyond the reach of western governments which are
pressing for retaliation against Tripoli's alleged complicity in the bombing
of US and French airliners.
The move of government assets emerged yesterday as the US, Britain and
France considered asking the United Nations Security Council to back
sanctions against Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime for failing to hand over
two agents accused of bombing a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie.
British officials said they would seek a ban on civil aviation to Libya, an
arms embargo and a downgrading of diplomatic status for Tripoli.
Bankers and officials in London and the Middle East say Libya has already
taken steps to pre-empt further economic sanctions by discreetly moving
liquid assets from vulnerable banking centres to friendly Arab countries.
This massive shift of Libyan assets over the past few months coincides with
concerted western pressure on Colonel Gadaffi, including threats of possible
military action.
Bank of England figures show that between March and September 1991 Libya
halved its deposits in British banks to Pounds 781m. Libyan cash and other
liquid assets, mainly held overseas to service the import needs of its oil
industry, have also been removed from other European centres.
Bankers in London confirm that deposits withdrawn in the past few months
from Arab institutions in the city have been placed with banks in Bahrain.
'Libya feels it has some sympathy among other Arab countries,' said a London
banker familiar with the shift. 'And the obvious place to put the money is
with banks in the Gulf region.'
Libya's overseas assets measured by the Bank for International Settlements
in Basle totalled Dollars 6.5bn at the end of September 1991. In a separate
move aimed at protecting its assets from seizure, Libya is understood to be
demanding payment for its oil exports, wherever possible, in Swiss francs,
rather than dollars, according to bankers and oil industry executives.
The aim is to minimise the number of transactions which must be cleared
through US banks, where Tripoli fears they would be vulnerable to seizure.
All international transactions in dollars, even if they take place outside
the US, must be cleared through New York. The US authorities have sought to
use this to impede dealings they regard as undesirable, such as trading in
dollars with Vietnam, with which Americans are forbidden from doing
business. 'Libya since the end of December has not transferred money through
the dollar if it can help it,' said one senior Arab banker.
Another Libyan banker, who has been monitoring the steady flow of Tripoli's
assets into havens, said the regime had learnt from its experience in 1986
when Washington froze Dollars 2bn of Libyan assets in the US in retaliation
for its alleged part in terrorist attacks.
To head off sanctions, Libya has raised the possibility of handing over the
two agents to the US, on condition that the US in turn offers an
'improvement of bilateral relations'.
The suggestions comes in a report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, compiled after the return of his special envoy from
Tripoli. This contains a series of proposals by Libya to resolve the
confrontation. But British officials said these were 'confusing' and
'inadequate'.
Diplomats in New York said the offer, revealed in the UN secretary-general's
report, was an improvement on Libya's earlier intransigence, but
insufficient to prevent the US, Britain and France from pursuing possible
sanctions.

FT  05 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous close after an erratic
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER heavyweight UK companies reported results yesterday and the London
stock market proved unwilling to respond to Wall Street's overnight advance
to new peaks. With their appetite for deals checked by the withdrawal on
Tuesday of a series of trades in banking stocks, equity traders inclined
towards caution.
The stock market was unsettled by a sharp fall in UK government bonds. UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew told clients that Britain's Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR) was now 'set on an unsustainable course' and that
taxation might have to rise in the medium term if PSBR is to be reduced to
more acceptable levels.
The FT-SE Index closed 7.0 down at 2,558.4, having turned back as Wall
Street showed a fall of 2.46 on the Dow in early trading. Earlier, the
Footsie had twice crept into plus territory, as well as falling 6.4 at
mid-morning under the sway of sharp movements in some component stocks.
The most notable was Reuters, the global business communications agency,
which fell heavily after disclosing problems with the testing of its Globex
system for trading financial futures; the fall in Reuters shares represented
a loss of 1.1 on the Footsie. The shares were strongly bought last week on
optimism ahead of the Globex tests.
The financial sector, which has provided much of the market's activity over
the past fortnight, as the banks and insurance companies have reported
results, was in a calmer mood. There was some activity in food shares, both
manufacturing and retail, after Cadbury Schweppes reported progress. Food
retailers were unsettled by reports that a large block of Sainsbury shares
was on offer.
Seaq volume edged higher to record 529.5m shares compared with 523.2m in the
previous session. However, traders believed that retail, or customer,
business in equities was lower yesterday than on Tuesday when it was worth a
total of Pounds 1.1bn, a return to favourable business levels from the point
of view of the London marketmaking firms.
A substantial boost to trading volume came in very late dealings yesterday
when a substantial non-protected programme was reported on the trading
screens.
Under the changes introduced on February 24, non-protected deals have become
significantly more visible; the changes were prompted by complaints by
traders that reporting of large deals was often held back until the end of
the day.
While many of the large investment funds have already begun to reduce
activity in the stock market ahead of next Tuesday's Budget speech,
strategists continued to assess the wider outlook.
Lazard Investors commented that while global activity in equities remains
weak, there are the first signs of revival in the US economy. It added that
falling inflation and lower bond yields favour the UK and European equity
markets, and looked for opportunities to increase exposure to the UK stock
market.
Nomura Research Institute, however, believes that the time may not yet be
ripe for a switch from the US to the UK equity markets. Constraints on
sterling and UK interest rates, together with the near term political risk,
are the reasons given for holding back on the US-UK switch.

FT  05 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP waits for news from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle between UK and US investors over BP - the US houses have been
aggressive buyers while UK firms have been equally aggressive sellers -
continued yesterday when over 16m shares changed hands in London.
The stock settled 1 1/2 up at 269 1/2 p ahead of an important presentation
last night to New York investment institutions by Mr John Browne, BP's head
of exploration and production. The presentation was hosted by Paine Webber,
the US brokerage house.
Dealers in London said the US institutions had been accumulating BP stock in
front of the speech by the BP director on hopes of good news from BP's big
Cusiana oil discovery in Colombia and elsewhere.
'The market is very finely balanced, awaiting the news from New York,' said
a London-based analyst. US investors have focused on BP's good yield but UK
institutions, dismayed by the poor results, the disappointing dividend
payment, and by worries about BP's ability to maintain future dividends,
have been reducing their exposure to the stock.
Sainsbury deal
A block of 10m shares in J Sainsbury, the food supermarket group, loomed
over the stock market yesterday, and there were suggestions that a member of
the Sainsbury family had offered the block of shares to several investment
houses.
It appeared that the successful bidder, an integrated securities house, had
paid 392p a share but was still trying unsuccessfully to pass the stock on
when the market closed. The attempts to do so probably represented about
half of yesterday's 4.8m turnover in the stock. The shares closed one lower
at 393p.
Reuters in reverse
The frantic buying and subsequent rise in Reuters shares at the start of the
week, when US investment banks were revealed as running substantial short
positions in the stock, was reversed yesterday after news that testing of
the company's Globex 2000 dealing system failed yesterday.
News that the tests, carried out in London, New York and Chicago, had gone
wrong saw Reuters shares plummet to 1,168p at one point before they
stabilised and eventually closed a net 39 lower at 1,186p. Turnover in the
stock expanded rapidly to reach 5m, the highest individual day's activity
since November 1990.
Globex 2000 is a financial futures trading system being developed as a joint
venture between Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade. Along with Dealing 2002, a foreign exchange dealing system,
it is seen as a substantial long-term profits earner for Reuters.
Worries that the system may be delayed for some time were shrugged aside by
a number of analysts. Mr John E. Clarke at Daiwa, the Japanese-owned
stockbroker, said 'any rescheduling is unlikely to mean a significant delay'
and pointed out that Reuters shares had closed above last Friday's level.
BTR upset
A setback in BTR was at first attributed to reports that it had dropped
plans to create a global electrical engineering business in the wake of its
Pounds 1.5bn takeover of Hawker Siddeley last November.
However, the fall in the shares was later ascribed to nervousness ahead of
next week's preliminary figures. The shares ended 10 down at 397p as
turnover reached 4.4m.
Electronics group GEC featured as the fourth-heaviest traded stock in the
London market, with BZW seen to be a strong supporter of the shares which
touched 221 1/2 p before settling a net 5 higher at 220 1/2 p on turnover of
10m.
BZW reiterated its positive stance and will tomorrow embark on a series of
presentations to institutions. Dealers said much of yesterday's activity in
GEC had taken place between marketmakers.
Earlier this week, GEC shares were unsettled by a downgrading by Nomura, the
Japanese-owned securities house.
Profit-taking left Cadbury Schweppes 3 lower at 460p, retreating from levels
of around 468p shortly after it was announced that 1991 profits were up 13
per cent at Pounds 316.4m, compared with analysts forecasts of about Pounds
310m. The initial strength also reflected relief that the company had not
made a rights issue.
It was generally agreed that the later retreat reflected consolidation in a
stock that has performed very well, but that the future will not be easy.
Mr Charlie Mills, at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said 'forecasts may edge up but
not very much', while Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court, remarked that
'people won't really be able to upgrade. Profits will be hard earned and
life tough'.
Lonrho, the international conglomerate, held at 117p after some
exceptionally heavy trading in the shares, including a block of 3.8m shares
traded at 116 1/2 p and another of 4m traded at 117p.
The US investment grouping of FMR Corporation and Fidelity International
announced they had increased their aggregate holdings in Lonrho to 6.27 per
cent or 41.2m shares, from the previous figures of just over 4 per cent.
BICC shares rallied from an initial 307p to end a busy session a net 12
higher at 324p on heavy turnover of 6.5m, responding to the preliminary
figures. These showed a maintained dividend and better-than-expected cash
flow. Hoare Govett said the shares had 'plenty of upside' and pointed out
the 30 per cent underperformance against the market over the past 12 months.
Shares in SmithKline Beecham were hit in late afternoon trading after
rumours on Wall Street that Mevacor, a cholesterol lowering drug, was
experiencing problems. Although SmithKline has no direct interest in
Mevacor, which is manufactured by Merck &amp; Co, it does help market a sister
product, Zocor, and it is the knock-on effect from this that damaged
SmithKline. The shares lost 18 to 908p.
Glaxo also fell back on the news, closing 3 off at 795p.
Leading property stocks fell on familiar concerns over the weakness in
central London office rental values. Wates City of London Properties, which
reports next week, led the way down after comments at the end of last week
over the group's dividend. This had undermined the shares all week,
yesterday falling a further 6 to 69p.
Strong French buying pushed Euro Disney 20 higher to 1,610p. Busy volume in
Owners Abroad included an agency cross of 650,000 shares. The stock was 2
1/2 off at 118 1/2 p.
Electronics and entertainment giant Thorn EMI continued its poor run as
worries persisted over its chances of winning a large share of Virgin's
music division. Latest news from market sources in New York suggests that
Thorn has matched Bertelsmann's bid of Dollars 750m and negotiations are
continuing. The shares slipped 3 to 797p.
Food manufacturing group Hillsdown Holdings remained firm on the expected
flotation of its housebuilding subsidiary and positive comments from
brokers, gaining 4 to 166p. Turnover was sharply reduced however at 779,000
shares.
Dalepak remained volatile following the recent disclosure of preliminary
talks with potential purchasers. Monday's rise of 71p has proved to be
overdone, according to analysts, and after falling 15 on Tuesday the shares
lost another 25 to 393p yesterday.
GKN cheered the market by reporting results at the top end of market
forecasts and a maintained dividend. The shares responded by jumping 20 to
352p. Profits fell from Pounds 172m to Pounds 95m but the dividend was
maintained at 12.5p.
British Aerospace firmed 5 to 332p after announcing it had agreed with Asda
that Asda would not serve notice to exercise a put/call option which could
have led to the ending of the Burwood House joint venture between the two
companies.
Two large blocks of Singer &amp; Friedlander, each of 7.7m shares and totalling
7 per cent of the equity, traded at 40 1/4 p. The shares closed unaltered at
41p.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Appointments: Northumbrian's year-long search over
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northumbrian Water Group, one of the smaller former regional authorities
privatised over two years ago, has appointed Michael Taylor as group finance
director after a search lasting over a year.
Taylor, 46, was group finance director of Hickson International, the
chemical and timber protection group, from 1986 to last year.
Northumbrian's search for a new finance director began in January last year
when Michael Murden resigned as managing director after an apparent policy
disagreement with Sir Michael Straker, Northumbrian's chairman.
David Cranston, then finance director, temporarily combined that role with
Murden's while a replacement was sought. Cranston now continues as group
chief executive.
In his new job, Taylor will be responsible for the development and
implementation of financial strategy and control throughout the group, and
for the group's treasury, tax and audit functions.
Cranston said yesterday: 'We have been keen to make sure we make the right
appointment. Michael Taylor's appointment will allow me to devote more time
to the strategic development of the group.'

FT  05 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the derivatives market remained directionless and volatile as the
lack of economic or political data gave little on which to focus, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Stock index futures opened at 2,580, and an initial setback in the March
contract on the FT-SE was followed by a slight squeeze sending March to
2,582, the high of the day.
However, buying interest faded after that initial run, leaving the contracts
to drift lower to reach 2,567, its lowest point.
The firm opening on Wall Street saw interest in the contract return and a
brief rally was attempted, but New York's retreat soon put paid to further
advances. Dealers talked of sizeable rolling into the June contract and out
of March.
March ended at 2,569, just two points above estimated fair value premium to
cash of around six. Turnover at around 4,500 contracts, included over 1,000
contracts traded in June.
In traded options business was dull and turnover totalled 23,702 contracts.
The FT-SE 100 Index option traded 5,331 lots, part of which was attributed
to one house unwinding a big call spread. BP was the busiest stock option
trading 1622 contracts.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Appointments: Lawson elected to ICA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Lawson, 3i's director for Asia, Pacific and the US, was yesterday
declared vice president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales in the first ever contested elections for the post.
It makes him one of only a handful of vice-presidents in more than 100 years
of the Institute's history who does not work in a firm of chartered
accountants.
He takes up his post in June, and is likely to give greater prominence to
the concerns of chartered accountants in business, who make up more than
half of the Institute's 97,000 members.
The election remains only partly democratic. Only elected council members of
the Institute may vote, and Lawson will only succeed to the presidency after
two years.
Lawson beat Chris Swinson, the outspoken managing partner of BDO Binder
Hamlyn, and Pat Brenan, a director of Minories Finance, formally Johnson
Matthey bank, by a substantial margin in a transferable vote election.

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities show signs of
stability - Traders expect modest price gains and a gradual rise in volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When traders return today, following the traditional Carnival holiday, they
will be expecting a period of stability in Brazilian stock markets.
This trend was already evident during the last two weeks in February. The
Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa index closed the month at 14,498, a 29.37
per cent upswing in local currency terms, representing real growth of 4.75
per cent over inflation. In dollar terms, the index rose 12.8 per cent last
month.
The country's second leading market, the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange,
ended the month with a real decline of 0.15 per cent, as a strong second
half made up for a poor first fortnight.
Except for a predictably slow Friday on the eve of Carnival, volumes in Sao
Paulo hovered around Dollars 100m last week. 'We've recovered the volume we
had in the late 1970s,' notes Mr Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros, director of
Planibanc, a Sao Paulo investment bank. Volume is expected to continue to
grow, albeit at a more gradual pace.
Judging by the futures index, brokers expect the Bovespa index to increase
by about 7 per cent in dollar terms over the next 45 days. 'That's a
well-behaved gain by Brazilian standards,' says Mr Mendonca de Barros.
If the late February relative calm continues, it will contrast with
performance since late 1990, when the ups and downs of foreign debt
negotiations, the prospect of the government's privatisation programme, and
alleged price manipulation by two Sao Paulo brokerages were among the
factors which kept the market on edge.
Most of the news pushed equities up: the Bovespa index rose by 46.48 per
cent in real terms in January while Rio de Janeiro's BVRJ index recorded a
38.40 per cent real increase.
By contrast, few analysts expect any shocking news to rattle the market in
March. 'The post-Carnival scene is set, especially with the two accords with
the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club (of official creditors),'
predicts Mr Marco Antonio de Nigro, market analyst for the Sao Paulo
financial information service, Dinheiro Vivo.
In addition to the IMF and Paris Club agreements, brokers offer several
reasons for the steadying trend: the monthly inflation rate is expected to
drop modestly, with the aid of the seasonal agricultural harvest and
resulting lower food prices; an official inquiry into the price manipulation
allegations is forcing 'speculators' to keep a low profile; and the jump in
liquidity which comes with the growth in volume is proving to be a calming
influence.
Part of the added volume represents a recovery in internal savings with the
gradual release of funds blocked by President Fernando Collor's March 1990
economic plan, says Mr Mendonca de Barros. The rest is coming from foreign
institutional investors. Since they were allowed to invest directly in
Brazil for the first time last August, foreign institutions have sunk
Dollars 685.5m into the country's stock markets, according to government
figures. Just Dollars 40.1m of that has since been siphoned back out.
If these trends persist, Mr Nigro predicts that the current daily volume in
Sao Paulo, about Cr150bn (Dollars 92m), could reach Cr200bn in the coming
weeks.
With the government's announcement on February 18 of tax incentives for
exporters, companies with considerable foreign sales have taken the centre
stage in the stock market. For instance, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the
state-controlled mining company, saw its stock rise by 40.2 per cent in
February.
The effect of generally negative 1991 company results has been mixed.
Investors were braced for a poor performance from the corporate sector,
given the recession and the effects of new legislation, known as 'law
8,200', which requires companies to revalue assets to reflect real inflation
rates, which were higher than original government figures.
Blue chips continued to fare well. The stock of Petrobras, the
state-controlled petroleum company, rose 40.1 per cent in February despite
the release of the worst results in its history. Telebras, the
state-controlled telecommunications group, enjoyed a 37.8 per cent increase
in the value of its stock even although its expected Dollars 1bn profit was
trimmed to Dollars 106mn, after 'law 8,200' was taken into account.
On the other hand, Copene, the petrochemical concern, saw its stock lag
behind the Bovespa index by 4.7 per cent last week after announcing its
first loss since its foundation in 1978. Pirelli, an electronics maker, lost
21.6 per cent against the index after it released negative 1991 results.

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers after
falling below 21,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTH in pharmaceutical shares and a late round of arbitrage-related
buying left the Nikkei index with a modest rise yesterday after slipping
below the 21,000 level, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The 225-share average closed 53.71 higher at 21,105.42, just below the day's
high of 21,112.24, as drug and bio-technology issues resumed their rally.
This followed a drop of 436.11 on Tuesday; yesterday's low of 20,867.71 came
on continued corporate selling related to March 31 book-closings and
disappointment that Bank of Japan intervention by selling dollars in the
foreign exchange market had failed to curb the yen's losses.
Volume eased from 256m to 230m shares and, despite the Nikkei's modest rise,
declines led advances by 596 to 329 with 193 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section shares fell 5.21 to 1,537.22 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.25 to 1172.16.
The market continued to lack sufficient momentum for a sustained rally,
although leading trading houses sought to drum up buying interest via
pharmaceuticals, bio-tech and environmental protection stocks, dealers said.
Mochida Pharmaceutical, which jumped by some 50 per cent last week,
continued to rally strongly and finished up Y500 at Y4,180. It was boosted
by continued buying interest in the drug sector, as well as rumours that the
Ministry of Finance, a leading shareholder, is anxious to see the shares
appreciate. Dainippon Pharmaceutical also rose Y220 to Y2,030.
Environmental protection issues had another strong day, with Japan Storage
Battery up Y80 at Y1,180 as it led the active stocks list, and Mitsubishi
Kakoki Y65 better at Y900.
Electrical and auto shares languished, with Hitachi off Y17 to Y805 and
Nissan Motor Y11 to Y599. Banks, brokerages and non-life insurers also lost
ground. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y30 to Y1,990 and Tokio Marine and Fire
Y20 to Y1,040.
As the market continues to bide its time, trading around 21,000 on the
Nikkei, participants are seeking direction from the foreign exchange market
and interest rates. Conditions became even more confused yesterday as the
Bank of Japan's action on the yen coincided with comments opposing
intervention from the Japanese finance minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata.
'Nobody's sure where the economy is going or whether we're going to get an
(official discount) rate cut. It's leaving the market in a void,' said Ms.
Caroline Stone of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Investors are particularly anxious
to see the central bank's tankan report on business conditions, due out
tomorrow. If it indicates economic activity is slowing sharply, already
formidable pressure will mount further for the Bank of Japan to cut its
official discount rate from 4.5 per cent.
In Osaka, the OSE index fell 114.90 to 22,791.16. Nintendo lost Y200 to
Y10,400.
Roundup
THE REGION's equity markets were mostly mixed to higher yesterday, with Hong
Kong regaining the initiative it seemed to have lost on Tuesday.
HONG KONG closed at a record high, in spite of shedding 29 points in
afternoon trade following the budget speech. The Hang Seng Index finished up
43.37 at 4,954.5. Brokers said that the afternoon decline was largely due to
consolidation rather than negative reaction to the budget.
HSBC Holdings closed up 75 cents at HKDollars 43.50 on expectations that it
may soon make a scrip issue.
SINGAPORE closed off the day's highs on late profit-taking. The Straits
Times Industrial index gained 7.37 to 1,459.92, having earlier been at a
day's high of 1,465.24.
Brokers reported that turnover remained low due to the lack of support from
fund managers who were investing elsewhere, particularly in Hong Kong.
Volume was 44m shares against 42.5m.
SEOUL ended sharply higher on rumours that the government planned a package
of measures ahead of the election on March 24. The measures, later denied,
were said to include extending financial support to securities houses and
approving the establishment of a new investment trust company. The composite
stock index finished up 14.55 at 630.47 in turnover of Won224bn against
Won326.26bn.
TAIWAN rose in dull trade and the weighted index closed up 9.76 to 5,066.40
in turnover of TDollars 25bn compared with TDollars 32.9bn.
An announcement that the government planned a further sale of its shares in
the three largest commercial banks had little impact on the sector.
Construction shares were the biggest gainers of the day.
AUSTRALIA closed marginally lower and the All Ordinaries index closed down
6.5 at 1,615.2 in volume of 106.5m shares. News Corp lost 4 cents to
ADollars 17.76 after falling from an intraday high of ADollars 18.16.
NEW ZEALAND finished weaker with the NZSE-40 down 15.65 at 1,468.71 in
turnover of NZDollars 26.5m. Magnum, the Auckland-based liquor and grocery
group, which reported a smaller than forecast decline in half-year profits,
gained 10 cents to NZDollars 1.08. Telecom shed 5 cents to NZDollars 2.42.

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses focus on domestic
matters in quiet trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES concentrated on domestic matters yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS was active in the first hour of trading but then quietened down until
just before the close when some arbitrage-related business was noted. The
CAC-40 ended up 4.32 at 1,988.09 in moderate turnover of FFr2.4bn.
Elf fell FFr10.30 to FFr374.70 following news late on Tuesday that the
government was going ahead with the sale of 2.3 per cent of Elf's share
capital on March 13. Dealers were surprised at the fall, since the
uncertainty about the timing of the issue had now been lifted. The fact that
there was not a US tranche this time indicated that the underwriters saw
little difficulty in placing the state's shares.
Euro Disney returned to fashion, closing up FFr2.50 at FFr158.80. By
contrast, Peugeot fell FFr5 to FFr732 on news of a 6.5 per cent year-on-year
fall in its car sales in February.
There was movement in second-liners with Beghin-Say up FFr19 at FFr640 and
Spie Batignolles down FFr17 to FFr330 but dealers found no reasons for the
moves. Perrier and Exor were both re-quoted yesterday, with the former
rising FFr14 to FFr1,531 and the latter losing FFr5 to FFr1,490.
FRANKFURT paused, the DAX index falling 4.26 to 1,759.05 after a decline of
0.47 to 714.97 in the FAZ at midsession. Strength in the pre-market, with
talk of the DAX testing 1,800 was sapped by a subsequent lack of buying
orders and a feeling that the market was getting expensive after its recent
gains.
Turnover held up well at DM7.8bn after DM7.6bn. Falls in senior blue chips
were inconsistent, with Deutsche Bank only 20 pfg lower at DM735.30, after
DM740 early in the day, but Siemens closing DM9.50 lower at DM696.50
although dealers saw no selling pressure on the stock.
MILAN fell for the sixth day in a row. the Comit index fell 3.72 to 525.70
in turnover estimated at near Tuesday's L76.8bn.
The lack of volume made the market vulnerable to rumours, which ranged from
a small brokerage going bust in Turin to another Stet bond, but this time
with warrants into Sip ordinary shares.
The financial index dropped 1.8 per cent, with Banco di Roma and Santo
Spirito continuing to fall following last week's share exchange news. Banco
di Roma fell L95 or 4.2 per cent to L2,160, while Santo Spirito dropped L125
or 5.4 per to L2,205. The imminent San Paolo share offering also depressed
the sector.
In telecoms, Stet was unchanged at L2,380 while Sip fell L15 to L1,400 on
the bond rumours. Elsewhere, Breda was temporarily suspended after a sell
order in a thin market caused the stock to fall 10 per cent. When trading
resumed, the stock fell L23 or 6.7 per cent to L320.
AMSTERDAM saw strong activity in Fokker after reports that the aircraft
manufacturer was studying closer co-operation with Deutsche Aerospace. The
share price gained Fl 3.10 or 9.4 per cent before news that the group's Fl
500m rights issue would be in April. The stock closed up Fl 2.00 or 6 per
cent at Fl 34.90. The CBS Tendency Index closed 1.1 higher at 128.1 in
turnover of Fl 656.9m.
DSM, which reports 1991 results on Monday, continued its gains to close Fl
2.70 higher at Fl 112.70, while Akzo was 40 cents firmer at Fl 150.80.
Wessanen, the food manufacturer, which reports 1991 results today, gained Fl
1.00 to Fl 91.10.
ZURICH recovered from a midsession slump to close with industrials higher,
but banks and insurers under pressure from rising interest rates. Bearer
shares in Swiss Bank Corp fell SFr3 to SFr309 on profit-taking after good
1991 results.
Sulzer registered added SFr150 to SFr5,710. The engineer said on Tuesday
that it was opening its registered shares to foreigners and splitting its
shares 10-for-one.
STOCKHOLM also showed interest in the stock split theme although, with a
five-for-one split. Sharp rises in profits and dividend were also in
evidence as the retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz leapt SKr100 to SKr700.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 12.7 to 974.0 with the fashion for
cyclicals extending to the steelmaker, Sandvik, where the B free shares rose
SKr11 to SKr390.
COPENHAGEN steadied after falling in each of the previous seven days to a
succession of 1992 lows, writes Hilary Barnes. The CSE index rose 0.99 to
345.58.
Carlsberg B, DKr18 higher at DKr338, recovered losses sustained after
Monday's announcement of a rights issue. Novo Nordisk rose DKr8 to DKr525
after a period of steady decline.
BRUSSELS closed down on profit-taking. The Bel-20 ended down 1.47 at
1,233.25, after an intra-day high of 1,242.90, in turnover of BFr1bn.
Groupe AG, the insurer, rose BFr25 to BFr2,255 while Generale Bank, its
possible partner in a merger, fell BFr30 to BFr6,720.
ISTANBUL rose sharply after inflation figures showed a fall in the monthly
rate. The 75-share index closed up 138.19 or 3.96 per cent at 3,623.58.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Money Markets: All eyes on Budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money market continued its policy of watching and waiting ahead of
the Budget next Tuesday.
Speculation about the timing of a base rate cut is intensifying, with a
majority of dealers still believing one will come next week, either just
after the Budget - provided the market reacts positively to it - or on the
day itself, the so-called 'double whammy'.
Others, however, are more pessimistic, believing that the government may not
lower rates before the general election, or will hold back if market
reaction to the Budget is negative.
The key three-month interbank rate, often a pointer to the direction of
interest rates, seemed to reflect the more pessimistic view, holding steady
at 10 3/8 -10 5/16 per cent. Some players are surprised the rate is not
closer to 10, given the expectations of an imminent rate cut.
The March short sterling contract ended three basis points down at 89.66.
Liquidity was easier than in recent days, with the Bank of England quickly
taking out much of the shortage. It forecast a Pounds 1.3bn shortage, but
immediately purchased Pounds 1,272m of bills for resale to the market on
March 23, 24 and 25 at 10 7/16 per cent.
The forecast rose at midday to Pounds 1.4bn, but the Bank did not act until
a further increase in the forecast to Pounds 1.45bn, when it bought Pounds
196m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
The overnight rate was easier as a result, moving down from 10 1/2 -10 3/8
per cent to 10-9 1/2 after the Bank's morning operation, and later to around
9 1/4 per cent.
In Germany, the Bundesbank drained DM2.5bn from the banking system, a move
underscoring its determination to keep monetary policy tight. Dealers had
been expecting the bank to replace fully two securities repurchase
agreements worth DM44.5bn, which expired yesterday. In fact it allocated
only DM42bn - seen as surprising in a month in which heavy tax payments mean
large sums are withdrawn from the system.
Dealers noted the bank could have made a larger allocation, but chose not to
accept bids below 9.45 per cent. They did not, however, expect any change in
interest rates at today's regular Bundesbank council meeting. Call money
rates were virtually unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong dollar heads upwards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTINUED surge by the dollar yesterday saw it break through resistance at
the DM1.6650 level, and survive three attempts to hold it back against the
yen.
In late European trading it was carried through DM1.6650 on a rush of large
orders in New York, and closed at DM1.6720. It also broke through the Y132
level, to reach Y132.10/20.
The third successive day of heavy gains by the dollar had begun with a
breach of heavy resistance in the Far East, to take it to a close of
DM1.6630 and Y131.50.
Dealers said the Bank of Japan had intervened on three separate occasions at
Y130.90, Y130.85, and Y131.10/15, but had been unable to hold the dollar
down.
Its task was not made any easier by comments - which one dealer described as
an 'own goal' - by Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's deputy finance minister, who
remarked that currency intervention was of little use, when the dollar was
rising on the back of speculative buying at precisely the same time as the
Bank of Japan was selling dollars for yen in the market.
Many dealers now feel it would take coordinated action by central banks to
halt the dollar's progress. Dollar optimism was unaffected by slightly
disappointing US factory orders figures, which showed only a 0.4 per cent
rise for January against the 1 per cent expected. But Friday's payroll
figures remain a possible dark cloud on the horizon, although market
predictions range widely from around a 50,000 fall to a 75,000 increase.
'If Friday's payroll data are are strong they will push the dollar higher
still, and then we would be looking at the DM1.70 level,' one economist
predicted.
High German interest rates have so far limited the dollar's gains against
the D-mark, but it is still seen heading towards the DM1.70 barrier, where
resistance may be expected.
In New York last night the dollar started by largely holding onto its gains,
standing at DM1.6710/15 and Y132.05/10 at midsession.
The D-mark generally held its ground in the EMS, despite its fall against
the dollar. The French franc, against which the D-mark had hit a six-month
low on Tuesday, was unable to beat resistance at FFr3.3950, and slipped back
to FFr3.3978/79, compared with FFr3.3973/75.
The German currency also rose against the Swiss franc to SFr0.9110 from
SFr0.9089, with no sign of intervention from the Swiss National Bank.
Traders said the Swiss bank's absence was encouraging the market view that
the Swiss were prepared to suffer a weaker exchange rate to keep interest
rates below German levels.
Sterling traded in an extremely tight band against the D-mark, closing at
DM2.8825, against DM2.8800 on Tuesday. It dipped towards the close against
the dollar, ending at Dollars 1.7235 from a previous close of Dollars
1.7400.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC moves on single banana
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday made a first attempt to agree on how to
create a single market in bananas and comply with General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) tariff prescriptions for farm trade.
The Brussels executive has still to reach a consensus on on how to deal with
this sensitive issue, and a decision is not likely for two to three weeks.
The EC has to decide how to protect banana imports entering duty free from
high cost producers in its outlying territories and former colonies to which
it has treaty obligations under the Lome convention. At the same time, the
Uruguay Round trade negotiations require the EC to set a tariff for
so-called 'dollar bananas'. Dollar fruit, mostly from low-cost plantations
in Central America and Colombia, is subject to import restrictions, and a 20
per cent duty everywhere in the EC except Germany.
Dollar bananas already command three fifths of the 3.3m tonnes EC market,
and Caribbean producers fear their industry would be wiped out unless the
protection they enjoy under the Lome Convention is maintained.
Among the 12 member states, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece favour
either seeking a derogation from Gatt or quota restraints on dollar bananas
analagous to limits on Japanese car imports.
The broadly free market camp in the Commission is backing instead a high,
degressive tariff on the Latin American fruit to allow the EC's traditional
suppliers time to adjust. One suggestion is to make the tariff the
difference between the highest import price from EC banana zones and the
lowest import price from dollar zones - a duty of more than Ecu350 per
tonne. Caribbean producers are lobbying intensively against tariffication.
But bananas, several Commission officials suspect, could easily put paid to
a Uruguay Round deal, at least for this year.
The Round is already tottering because of fundamental differences between
the EC and the US and other agri-exporters over farm subsidy cuts.
But an EC failure to 'tariffy' bananas could unravel the package so far
assembled, officials say.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ lamb sales to UK fall
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S traditional role as the dominant buyer of New Zealand lamb was
eroded further last year owing to growing sales to continental Europe, the
Middle East and Asia.
In 1975 Britain took about 90 per cent of New Zealand lamb. But the Meat
Board's annual report, just published, shows this fell below 30 per cent in
the year to September, and that it could fall further as new markets are
developed.
Since 1966 there has been a swing towards added processing in New Zealand.
When the frozen meat trade was developed exclusively with Britain in 1882 UK
butchers preferred whole carcass lamb, and there was no added processing.
By 1980, 72 per cent was whole carcass lamb and 18 per cent was processed. A
decade later 45 per cent was whole carcass and 55 per cent processed. In
1990, 99 per cent of all beef was exported in boneless form.
The report says that while Britain remained the largest market for New
Zealand lamb and offal and a substantial market for mutton, prices declined
during the year, reflecting the UK recession and steep falls in the domestic
prices for mutton, pork, poultry and offal.
The board says the removal of the variable premium on domestic sheepmeat
this year should improve sales and prospects for New Zealand lamb, as would
a changed seasonal pattern of domestic lamb production. But the market will
be influenced by other meats, particularly cheap pork and poultry.
The outlook for New Zealand lamb in most European countries is promising,
with sheepmeat consumption improving, and the board expects price levels and
volumes shipped to rise.
In 1991, frozen lamb sales to France were up 120 per cent at 13,651 tonnes.
Germany took 22 per cent - 14,090 tonnes. East Germany became a new market
following unification.
Sales of frozen lamb to the Middle East rose 62 per cent from 39,396 tonnes
to 63,901 tonnes last year, or 22 per cent of all production. Total exports
to the region, including mutton, beef and veal, increased from 43,680 to
82,757 tonnes. The report says that the population growth in the Gulf, and
its inability to become self sufficient in lamb, continues to underpin this
market.
However 90 per cent of sales were to the catering trade, and the remaining
10 per cent to expatriates. 'The largest untapped market is to encourage
Arabs to buy frozen meat and sheepmeat at retail stores.'
The opening of the Japanese beef market from April 1 last year led to
confusion which will take some two years to settle down, the report says.
It anticipated that Japan would be buying 500,000 tonnes of beef a year by
1995. Korea had also liberalised its trade. Such factors, and high economic
growth rates suggested that Asia would become even more important, although
mutton volumes from New Zealand would fall in the short to medium term.
Japan preserved its position, held since 1984, as the main buyer of New
Zealand sheepmeats, although sales fell from 18,220 to 17,940 tonnes during
the year.
The report says that the North American beef market will remain strong this
year. But there were prospects of restraints under the Meat Import Law
because the trigger level was expected to be lower than in 1991.
Australian production would be the dominant factor. There were indications
that the drought-induced slaughter of 1991 could lead to reduced production
this year.
The report says significant cost savings of about 30 per cent were made
during the year on freight costs to North America.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brook Hunt predicts sharp fall
in Japanese metal demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S SHARP fall in industrial output will lead to a substantial drop in
metals demand from that country, Brook Hunt &amp; Associates, the independent
research group, points out in its latest monthly Metals Service reports.
It estimates that, compared with 1991, Japan this year will use 15 per cent
less nickel (148,000 instead of 174,000 tonnes), 9 per cent less copper
(down from 1.634m tonnes to 1.484m) and 5 per cent less aluminium (down from
2.4m tonnes to 2.272m).
The German economy is also slowing and 'while the forecast for Germany is
not nearly as bleak, the recession there is causing a Europe-wide slowdown.'
Metal exports from the former Soviet Union are also forecast to remain at
historically high levels. Brook Hunt estimates that they will total about
850,000 tonnes of aluminium, 350,000 tonnes of copper and 100,000 tonnes of
nickel this year.
The reports says that, despite the gloomy outlook, metals prices this year
have been buoyed by large-scale buying by commodity funds. These are now
benefiting from the cash flooding out of money funds in the US.
Ironically, relatively high prices are delaying necessary production cuts
and plant closures, Brook Hunt warns.
It says metals prices are unlikely to sustain high levels for long.
Consumption of aluminium, copper and nickel will be weaker in 1992 than in
1991 with little prospect of meaningful world economic recovery before the
end of this year.
'Even with sharply rising consumption in 1993, the market for all three
metals will remain in heavy surplus unless production plants are closed and
plans for future expansion delayed. Such measures will be initiated only if
prices fall significantly below current levels,' Brook Hunt concludes.
It says average cash production costs are still comfortably below market
prices for copper and nickel producers. Aluminium smelters, however, are
already in trouble because of the stockpile in London Metal Exchange
warehouses.

New York's nearby arabica coffee contract was 2 cents down in early
afternoon trading on profit taking and some selling from origin as the
market retreated from Tuesday's sharply higher close. Traders said there was
little news from Costa Rica, where coffee ministers from Central America,
Colombia and Mexico are meeting to discuss options on renewing international
price supports. London robustas closed off the highs struck earlier, when
May touched Dollars 844. Dealers noted that only 27 lots of dollar and 426
lots of sterling have been delivered since March became tenderable on
Monday, partly because much of the coffee seems to be in the hands of
companies under little pressure to sell. On the LME nickel closed just
ahead; dealers said the market's uninterrupted recent decline, which has
taken prices down some Dollars 700, was finally reversed at midsession as
active fund buying and short covering emerged at the key Dollars 7,400 level
for three-month metal - a new eight week low. Earlier losses were sparked by
producer selling and sell-stops, with option-linked selling adding to the
pressure. The steep falls brought many March puts into-the-money, prompting
hedge selling ahead of the morning's declarations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite relatively small offerings at Australian sales this week prices
failed to rise further, and some types sold at prices irregularly a little
cheaper. New Zealand wool was more definitely cheaper at this week's sale,
and about a third of the offering failed to find buyers. It is now widely
felt that the strong price rise which developed in February has been
checked. The setback, if it does in fact develop, means a quieter trading
spell but this is acceptable after recent improvement, and longer term
confidence persists. The AWC Market indicator at 648 cents a kg. is 5 cents
higher than a week ago.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican refinery strike lifts
zinc price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC PRICES broke through the psychologically-important Dollars 1,200 a
tonne level on the London Metal Exchange yesterday after Grupo Minera Mexico
said its zinc refinery had declared force majeure on deliveries because of a
strike which started on Monday. The refinery, in central Mexico, was
scheduled to produce 96,000 tonnes of zinc this year.
This is the second zinc refinery in two weeks to be declared force majeure.
Minero Peru's Cajamarquilla smelter (93,000 tonnes a year) is suffering from
power supply problems because of a drought. Traders suggested, however, it
was delivering as much as 95 per cent of ordered metal.
Market sentiment was also affected by news that a strike had started at
Asarco's New Market zinc mine in Tennessee which produced about 29,000
tonnes of the metal in concentrates last year. This represented roughly one
quarter of Asarco's total zinc output.
The lead market remained steady after Metaleurop said its Spanish
subsidiary, Penarroya, would file a petition for a suspension of payments.
This would almost certainly result in closure of Penarroya's
90,000-tonnes-a-year Santa Lucia primary lead smelter.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador shells out on shrimp
farming - The consequences of declining fish stocks and over-investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ecuador's shrimp farming business had another record year in 1991 as the gap
with other fishing exports widened.
Groups within the industry, unwilling to acknowledge over-fishing, accuse
each other of irrational practices or blame dwindling catches on climate and
ocean currents.
'We've seen this happen in other countries - with herring in the North Sea,
and anchovy in Peru,' said Mr Ian Scott, the economist in charge of
Britain's technical assistance programme for the fishing sector.
'There's been over-investment. If the Ecuadorian fleet fishes for 150 days a
year at 50 per cent efficiency, it can catch 3m tonnes - but the sustainable
stock of pelagic fish is only 500,000 to 1m tonnes.'
In the last few years fishermen supplying the fishmeal and canning
industries have seen a drastic drop in the harvest of sardines, mackerel,
thread herring and anchovies: the catch fell from 1,970,000 tonnes in 1985
to 233,000 tonnes in 1990, leaving many processing plants working at less
than 20 per cent of capacity.
Mr Scott said that although the warm southward-flowing El Nino current was
responsible for two bad years, the general decline was due to over-fishing
and licences and quota systems were needed to help stocks recover.
The tuna industry, centred in Manta, is also overblown, but the catch has
remained stable at 50,000 to 55,000 tonnes a year.
Both Ecuadorian and foreign boats fish for tuna. Local fishermen criticise
the fact that boats registered in the US, Japan and other countries are
contracted by Manta processing companies. However, it is argued that only
some of the vessels in the national fleet can freeze tuna to -40C, the
temperature necessary for good quality exports.
The under-secretary for fishing, Mr Max Aguirre, is proud of Ecuador's
record on the dolphin-tuna issue. 'The Ecuadorian law is strict. Ecuadorian
and foreign boats have their licences taken away if they fish on dolphins. I
report with satisfaction that in 43 trips with observers on board there were
zero dolphin deaths.'
Mr Aguirre admits that research studies warned of sardine fishing problems,
and says regional controls, including Peru and Chile, should be enforced.
'Licences should regulate the catch with reference to the resource.'
However, the private sector has been too powerful and the government too
timid to allow any quota-based management of stocks.
The fish sector earned about USDollars 570m in 1991, with shrimps
contributing more than 85 per cent. There are more than 125,000 hectares of
shrimp ponds along the tidal flats of the Ecuadorian coastline, mainly in
the southern provinces. Most shrimp farms are less than 50 hectares, though
the largest - up to as much as 2,000 hectares  - tend to be the most
sophisticated. Some use small aircraft to drop feed over the surface of the
ponds.
Shrimp farms produce all year round so close to the equator and two to three
harvests can be taken. With an ideal climate, plentiful larvae and
low-labour costs, Ecuador is the leading Latin American shrimp exporter.
'Our problem at the moment is the big jump in the cost of inputs. The dollar
price of shrimps has dropped and so has profitability,' said Mr Renato del
Campo of the Chamber of Shrimp Producers in Guayaquil. 'But there are
markets - the US is still attractive and we are diversifying into Europe,
especially Spain.'
Exports have risen from 10,000 tonnes in 1980 to more than 78,000 tonnes in
1991, and the need for more space and more larvae has led to conflict with
environmental groups, particularly over the clearing of mangroves.
Most shrimps are bred from wild larvae caught by thousands of seasonal
fishermen, but more than 100 laboratories have been started up in recent
years, with some exporting larvae to Colombia.
Although the shrimp fishing industry is small, accounting for less than 10
per cent of production, wild shrimp provide important breeding stocks for
the laboratories.
The sector expanded dangerously fast - from about 2,000 to 9,000 boats  - in
the 1980s and over-fishing is becoming a serious problem within a few miles
of the coast. Many of the boats are dug-out canoes based in small
communities.
'We need to teach people to take better care of the fish, then they'll also
improve their income. There should be ice available, and we need to
encourage marketing co-operatives,' said Mr Aguirre.
The British aid project, which is now ending after 12 years, has helped the
National Fisheries Institute to build up data on biology, product
development, marketing and management.
Ecuador has a stronger basis for planning resource use than many other
countries. 'There isn't any room for growth in the existing industry - it
needs reducing and consolidating,' said Mr. Scott.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Technology: Expertise on the take-away menu / Describing how
companies can benefit from buying R&amp;D services off the shelf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Research and development may be different from cleaning lavatories or
guarding factories, but like these support operations there is a thriving
contract industry.
In tune with the government's renewed emphasis on innovation, contract
research organisations (CROs) believe they can play an increasing role in
the transfer of technology to British industry.
The work of the CROs covers the same range of activities provided by an
in-house R&amp;D service. Contractors can conduct strategic research that
companies need for their next generation of products or services. They can
develop new products, and they can carry out routine testing.
Some CROs carry out strategic research on a 'club' basis, with several
companies coming together to support projects of mutual benefit. For
example, manufacturers placed contracts with the Motor Industry Research
Association (MIRA) for research into generic problems associated with
meeting controls on noise emitted by vehicles.
A research club can also unite companies that are part of a supply chain.
Geoff Callow, research manager at MIRA, cites vehicle handling as an area in
which no single supplier can solve the problems. Indeed, a company working
in isolation could come up with technology that causes headaches elsewhere.
MIRA can communicate with anybody in the supply chain.
Callow says that just 10 per cent of the organisation's activity is what he
would recognise as research. The other 90 per cent is testing and
development work, something that is especially relevant to small companies.
The sophisticated instruments needed to make detailed measurements are often
beyond their means.
By spreading the cost over a large number of customers, CROs can assemble
impressive arrays of instruments. The Leatherhead Food Research Association,
for example, recently invested Pounds 75,000 in a laser microscope. The RA's
researchers used the microscope to look at the structure of delicate samples
that would suffer under the treatment meted out by other microscopy
techniques. The laser microscope can show the structure of low-fat spreads
and bakery products, specimens that are easily damaged when put under an
ordinary microscope.
CROs can also bring expertise and measuring equipment to large companies.
The Advanced Manufacturing Technology Research Institute (AMTRI) has an
impressive background in machine tools. In the course of its work over the
years, the institute's researchers have developed a considerable
understanding of why machines vibrate, for example. Much of its work
involved testing prototype machines for companies to detect design faults
that might affect product quality when the equipment reached customers.
'We have portable people and technology that we can take to a site and make
measurements with instruments that clients do not have,' says Neil Parkin,
marketing manager of AMTRI. There is nothing unusual about the technology
used to measure vibration, says Parkin, 'but we can trundle it around'.
Holroyd, a maker of machine tools, is one of AMTRI's customers. 'We brought
AMTRI in to measure our machines and tell us what had gone wrong in them,'
says John Owen, engineering director.
When Holroyd wanted to design computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine
tools it did not have the ability in house to develop the CNC part of the
machine tool, the software and electronic microprocessors that control the
machinery. AMTRI designed the CNC system while the company's engineers
produced the mechanical designs.
Holroyd gained considerable experience working with AMTRI. This proved
invaluable when the company wanted to develop its own CNC technology. When
moving into new areas, says Owen, it is better to start off small and to
expand the in-house facility gradually.
Contract research can be especially valuable when a company has to respond
to immediate problems. From time to time the food industry has scares about
contaminated food. This can mean overnight work for researchers at the
Leatherhead Food RA. As Mark Kierstan, director, puts it: 'If someone claims
to have contaminated your products, how do you test for it?'
Similarly, if glass turns up in jars of food, did it come from a
thermometer, a broken jar, or was it inserted after the food left the
factory? 'Few firms have their own electron microscopist who can answer such
questions,' says Kierstan.
Nearer to the frontiers of science, Kierstan believes that CROs offer
companies greater flexibility to change course or to close research
projects.
If a company wants to investigate a new area of science - biotechnology, for
instance - it takes time to set up a research department. 'You will be two
years down the road before you have done one day's work,' says Kierstan.
'You may not be able to buy the best biotechnologist, but there is nothing
to stop you from renting one for a few days.'
A company that buys time from a research organisation wants to guarantee
that the results of the research it pays for do not end up in the hands of
its competitors. All contract research organisations, and increasingly
university groups that do contract research, go out of their way to maintain
confidentiality, so much so that some CROs will not talk about their work.
Walk around the corridors of the Leatherhead Food RA, for example, and signs
on the doors mark out those laboratories where researchers are dealing with
the confidential problems of a single customer.
Contract researchers admit that while they may not transfer commercially
sensitive knowledge directly from one project to another, other clients will
benefit from the general increase in knowledge brought about through a
particular contract. This may prompt customers to wonder if paying a CRO to
do R&amp;D for them supports work that will benefit competitors.
The CROs response to this is that every project builds on research that went
before. Today's contracts build on previous work as they also strengthen the
research organisation's science for the future. The CROs argue that their
ability to deal with problems across a broad spectrum gives contract
researchers an edge over a dedicated laboratory.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Technology: Electric sparks in La Rochelle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
La Rochelle, best known to French holiday makers for its sea front, is about
to find itself on another frontier - a technological one.
Peugeot, the French car maker, is so convinced that Europeans will be buying
at least 200,000 electric vehicles a year by the turn of the century, that
it is embarking on a joint venture with utility Electricite de France.
La Rochelle will be equipped with prototype recharging stations for an
initial fleet of 50 electric Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX cars to be placed
next year on long-term assessment with individual users in the city.
Depending on how well the cars are received, the number allocated to the
project may rise to 300.
According to Jean-Yves Helmer, director in charge of Peugeot group's
electric vehicles programme, the company has also signed a partnership
agreement with Generale de Transports et d'Industrie (GTI) to conduct an
experiment within another large, but as yet unnamed, French city. This will
involve a second fleet of electric cars which will be made available for
public rental.
The recharging stations, expected to be mainly adjuncts of conventional
filling stations, will be used to explore charging times, the long-term
effects of rapid-charging and other practical aspects of operating electric
cars.
Peugeot is undertaking what it describes as 'a several hundred million
francs' investment in its 'EV' (electric vehicle) programme even though it
does not expect to be able to break even on them until a volume of at least
50,000 units a year is reached.
However, Helmer stresses his belief that not only will Europeans be buying
200,000 electric vehicles a year by the end of the decade but that Peugeot
will be able to capture at least 25 per cent of that market.
Peugeot is claiming to be relatively unaffected by some of the technical
hitches, delays and disappointments that frequently have marked the motor
industry's attempts to develop viable EVs.
Despite severe limitations on range and performance imposed by current
battery technology, Helmer insists that whole-life costs of buying and
operating electric cars can be made competitive with petrol or diesel
equivalents.
The group has already built or taken orders for some 500 electric Peugeot
and Citroen vans, which it began producing last year. These are now in use
by, among others, Hong Kong's utility, China Light and Power.
Meanwhile, General Motors is unveiling at the Geneva motor show this week a
concept car which adds a new twist to the EV versus conventional car debate.
The small hatchback-sized vehicle, named 'Twin', has interchangeable petrol
or electric propulsion.
Ford is also to unveil an electric concept car at Geneva. Called the Ghia
Connecta, it uses the drivetrain technology already developed by Ford for a
100-strong fleet of Escort-based vans due to start trials in the UK and US
next year.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Technology: Retail sales tracked down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government faces private-sector competition in the tricky area of
finding out about ups and downs in retail sales - an important part of the
economy which accounts for a quarter of total UK output.
A computerised system for gathering the data on a weekly basis has been
launched by the British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the industry, in
an effort to improve on the monthly sales data published by the government's
Central Statistical Office.
A more up-to-date assessment of trends in this sector would be invaluable in
tracking the overall direction of the economy. It could also help the
Treasury to improve on its poor record in recent years in economic forecasts
 -the latest of which are being released in next Tuesday's Budget.
The trade body says it is not making the data public, however, until it is
confident they give a true picture of trends in the industry. It also wants
to iron out what it says are technical difficulties involving the computers
in the system.
However, the consortium may ultimately release the data to anyone
interested, possibly charging a fee. The consortium's scheme covers roughly
half the Pounds 150bn-a-year retail sector - patterns in which provide a
useful guide to overall activity, particularly at the consumer level.
Many of Britain's biggest retailers are among the 31 companies participating
in the initiative. They include Dixons, J. Sainsbury, Boots, Burton and
Marks &amp; Spencer.
The scheme is the most ambitious effort yet by a private-sector group to
improve on knowledge of economic trends by pulling together retailing
information on a weekly basis.
Private-sector schemes already exist for collecting weekly sales data for
the clothing and food sectors. In both cases, the information is largely
kept for the internal use of the companies involved.
The initiative by the British Retail Consortium follows an inquiry launched
last year by Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Concerned that the CSO's data on
retail sales might be failing to indicate short-term trends in the economy
which might point to a recovery from the continuing deep recession, Lamont
asked the CSO to consider its own weekly analysis.
Once it became clear that the private-sector scheme was going ahead, the CSO
decided against launching its own weekly analysis, arguing that the
government would be able to borrow the data.
The scheme has been operating on a pilot level for about three months and
involves managers from each of the 31 retailers recording at the end of each
week the value of takings over the previous seven days. They also analyse
how these takings compare with the value in the equivalent week last year.
Both sets of information are sent to staff at a London office of Touche
Ross, the accountants, who are working on the scheme on behalf of the
consortium.
Touche Ross collates the figures using computers, to provide a combined
sales picture for all 31 companies, and a view of how sales have changed
year on year.
The data related to the overall market are then returned to the
participating companies. To preserve commercial confidences, none of the
companies are allowed to see sales data related to individual rivals.
Companies involved in the scheme say that so far it is progressing well, and
that the information being derived from the system should complement the
monthly sales information from the CSO.

<TEXT>
A FLOOD of South Korean securities houses opened offices in London last
year, hoping to capture international investor interest in their country's
equities and equity-related instruments now that the Korean stock market has
opened up to direct foreign investment, writes Sara Webb.
Six of the 18 securities houses to open offices in London last year were
South Korean, according to an annual survey, New Foreign Securities Houses
in London 1991, produced by Noel Alexander Associates, the banking
consultancy. The six are Daewoo Securities, Daeyu Securities, Daishin
International, Hyundai Securities, Korea Development Securities, and
Ssangyong Securities.
'South Korean houses have come to London so that they will be well-placed to
sell Korean equities, convertibles and global depositary receipts to
international investors,' said Noel Alexander Associates.
While 18 houses opened in London, nine firms left the City. The net increase
in the number of foreign houses setting up in London last year was the
highest since 1987.
The nine which left were Kansallis Gota Securities, Levesque Beaubion
Geoffnon, Litcorp, Mark Petrotrade Futures, O'Connor Securities, Potts West
Trumbull, Shire Trust, UI Holding, and V. Berg &amp; Sons.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Cable &amp; Wireless 10-year
issue draws strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strong appetite of international investors for Eurosterling bonds was
demonstrated yesterday by the successful launch of Pounds 400m paper despite
of a sharp sell-off in the UK government bond market.
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK-listed telecommunications company, chose a
difficult day to make a debut Pounds 150m 10-year bond issue, lead managed
by Samuel Montagu. At the 10-year maturity gilts prices closed down a full
point.
However, Cable &amp; Wireless attracted strong international buying before gilts
prices started to collapse. Participants in the deal reported strong buying
from Far Eastern investors early in the day. The company's Asian
telecommunications subsidiaries account for around two thirds of profits. UK
investment managers were also strong buyers of paper issued by the UK's 17th
largest company by market capitalisation.
The 10 3/8 per cent bonds were priced to yield 86 basis points more than
gilts of the same maturity, seen as fair by most underwriting firms. By the
close of trading the yield spread over gilts had narrowed to 81 basis
points, although this also reflected higher government bond yields.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to finance capital expenditure,
including investment by Mercury, the UK telecommunications licence holder.
Cable &amp; Wireless has an annual capital expenditure programme of around
Pounds 1bn.
Finland also saw a warm response to its Pounds 250m five-year deal, lead
managed by Warburg Securities, despite losing its top triple-A credit rating
from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, on Tuesday.
The 9 3/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points more than UK
government bonds, considered generous enough to overcome any negative
sentiment.
Buying of the bonds was dominated by continental European investors starved
of high-quality sterling bonds in recent months.
Elsewhere, Turkey increased its Dollars 150m five-year bond issue launched
on Tuesday to Dollars 200m in the face of strong buying from fund managers
hungry for high-yield assets.

SEVEN Shanghai companies will float a total of 7.05m shares this week

eager investors, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The companies include the state-run Shanghai Special-Shaped Steel-Tubing

The shares, with a face value of Y10 each, are to be offered to a group of
217,000 people selected through a lottery that attracted 2.14m applicants.
Each of the applicants bought a lottery number for Y30. Numbers are to
remain valid for the three to four future lottery drawings that Shanghai
plans for this year.
The exchange plans to list a total of about 30 companies by the end of the
year. Currently 10 companies are listed.
The official New China News Agency said the lottery system had been
instituted to prevent the chaos surrounding previous issues, when police had
to be called out to control crowds of hopeful investors.

<TEXT>
UBAF, the London-based bank which is part of the associated international
Union des Banques Arabs et Francais group, has reported a 36 per cent rise
in profits after tax and provisions for 1991 to Pounds 6.4m (Dollars
10.88m).
The profit is after charging Pounds 10m to take loan loss provisions to
Pounds 11.5m, which the bank says represents 71.6 per cent of identified
problem loans.
Total capital rose to Dollars 87m, a 1 per cent rise on 1990, despite a
write back of a property revaluation of Pounds 7.9m taken into reserves in
1989.
'This more accurately represents a fair value of the premises in the current
depressed market,' said Mr Peter Taplin, the chief executive.
Mr Taplin said the bank saw improvements in profits from all its mainstream
commercial banking activities, high lighting a more than threefold rise in
fees from arranging and syndicating trade and project financing to Pounds
11.5m
Middle East Bank (MEB), which was acquired by the Dubai-owned Emirates Bank
International (EBI) late last year after running into financial problems,
suffered heavy losses in 1990 and 1991, Reuter reports from Dubai.
EBI said MEB's assets fell to Dh2.67bn (Dollars 741.6m) at the end of 1991
from Dh3.28bn in 1989. MEB did not publish a balance sheet in 1990.
The accumulated losses of MEB totalled Dh323m in the past two years, mainly
due to losses in its international operations.
EBI, which holds 86.5 per cent of MEB shares, restructured the bank's
capital by first writing off most of the losses against a Dh260m capital
reduction. MEB's nominal capital stood at DH300m.
EBI than raised MEB's capital to Dh500m, injecting fresh funds to keep the
bank going and to maintain a healthy capital to assets ratio.

The government's approval is expected to ease the group's financial pinch.
Hyundai subsidiaries have been suffering from an acute shortage of cash

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS), the cash-strapped airline, is planning
to sell its 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental Hotels, the international
hotel chain, to Inter-Continental's controlling shareholder, Saison group,
the Japanese retail and leisure combine.
SAS, which bought its stake for Dollars 500m just two years ago, has decided
it no longer wants to carry the heavy cost of its investment in
Inter-Continental, one of the world's biggest luxury hotel groups.
SAS and Saison group are expected to announce an agreement later this week.
SAS's pull-out will be a setback for the Saison group, which acquired
Inter-Continental for Dollars 2.3bn in 1988 and brought in SAS as a partner
to expand the chain's international appeal and help pay for a large-scale
refurbishment and hotel-building programme.
Quite apart from SAS's problems, Saison's ambitions have been hit by the
effects of rising interest rates, the impact of the Gulf war on
international travel and of the slow down in the world economy.
Inter-Continental has been running in the black at the operating level but
financing costs have pushed it into the red in each of the last three years.
Last year, the hotel chain made an operating profit of around Dollars 50m
and a pre-tax loss of about Dollars 100m.
Saison officials have denied that losses at Inter-Continental were putting
pressure on the whole group's finances. But they admit that
Inter-Continental missed a target in failing to break even at the pre-tax
level last year.
To relieve part of Inter-Continental's debt burden, other Saison group
companies are injecting a substantial amount of new capital into the hotel
chain, though the precise amount has yet to be disclosed. Also Mr Sueaki
Takaoka, the chairman of Saison Corporation, a core company in the group,
last month also assumed the post of chairman of Inter-Continental.
Inter-Continental is slowing down plans to expand its 100-plus hotels.
However, large-scale disposals to clear debt have been ruled out on the
grounds that the group wants to enhance Inter-Continental in the future and
that world property prices are now depressed.
Saison officials believe re-acquiring 100 per cent of Inter-Continental
would allow Saison group to take decisions more quickly.

<TEXT>
A NZDollars 56m (USDollars 31.1m) write-down by Magnum Corporation, the New
Zealand liquor and food group, on the value of its investment in fellow
drinks group Wilson Neill, helped push it to attributable losses of
NZDollars 66.24m for the first half to December.
This compares with attributable profits of NZDollars 31.25m for the year-ago
period.
Before losses from extraordinary items, Magnum made a NZDollars 10.68m
after-tax profit, a drop of 65 per cent.
This was in spite of a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to NZDollars
875.65m. No interim dividend was declared.
Magnum, which has substantial liquor interests in both New Zealand and
Australia, is controlled by a joint venture between Brierley Investments,
with 27 per cent, and Asia Pacific Breweries, which in turn is owned by both
Singaporean and Dutch interests.
Magnum wrote down the value of the Wilson Neill shares because of a
substantial fall in their value. Wilson Neill also owns hotels in Australia
and the Tasmanian brewery Cascade.
However, the writedown valued the Wilson Neill shares at 25 cents, compared
with around 8.5 cents on the share market yesterday.
Extraordinary costs were NZDollars 76.93m, against gains of NZDollars
872,000 in the same period of 1990.
Magnum is forecasting NZDollars 20m full-year profits before extraordinary
items.
Later yesterday, Brierley Investments and Asia Pacific Breweries said they
were buying a 50 per cent stake in Australian hotel group Austotel from
Magnum. Magnum bought the shares last year for NZDollars 110m.
Magnum also announced that Austotel had sold 70 hotels in Australia in a
debt reduction programme.

<TEXT>
CRA yesterday announced a 26 per cent cut in net profits to ADollars 350m
(USDollars 269.2m) for the year to December, continuing a run of poor
results from the Australian mining sector.
The group, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, said the setback was
caused by lower demand, falling metal prices and an increase in tax payments
from 37 per cent to 49 per cent of gross profits.
It said the fall in net profits was reduced to 13.4 per cent after excluding
abnormal items from the earlier period, which included profits on the sale
of convertible notes issued by Klockner Werke, the German steel and
engineering group.
However, after including extraordinary losses of ADollars 384m, the group
declared bottom line losses of ADollars 34m, compared with profits of
ADollars 400m for 1990.
The biggest component of the extraordinary loss was a write-off of the
ADollars 267m carrying value of the group's 53 per cent holding in
Bougainville Copper, which owns the Panguna copper mine in Papua New Guinea
(PNG).
CRA said there was no sign of a resolution of the conflict between the PNG
government and Bougainville separatists, who forced the closure of the mine
several years ago.
The group said that the cost of reopening the mine was now estimated at up
to K450m (Dollars 427.5m).
CRA also wrote down the value of its other copper and gold assets by
ADollars 110m to reflect the impact of financing and development constraints
in Australia and unrest in PNG, where the group's Mount Kare mine was
recently attacked by armed bandits.
The carrying value of the group's downstream aluminium businesses was
reduced by ADollars 134m following its decision to concentrate on bauxite
mining, alumina refining and smelting.
In addition, CRA booked an extraordinary loss of ADollars 32.8m as its share
of an extensive write-down of asset values announced earlier this week by
Pasminco, a zinc and lead miner in which the group holds a 40 per cent
shareholding.
The extraordinary loss would have totalled ADollars 544m but for an
offsetting profit of ADollars 159m resulting from a transfer to the profit
and loss account of surplus contributions to superannuation fund.
CRA said 1991 had been a 'difficult' year of weak economic growth and warned
the prospects of an early recovery in mineral prices or demand were 'poor.'
The directors declared a final dividend of 24 cents, fully franked, making a
total of 34 cents, compared with 44 cents in 1990.
The shares closed 24 cents higher at ADollars 14.10 on the Australian Stock
Exchange, reflecting investors relief that net profits had not fallen as far
as many analysts had forecast.
Big cuts in profits were announced earlier this week by Pasminco and
Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer which is 67 per cent owned by
CRA.
Renison Goldfields, the mineral sands producer, announced a 20 per cent rise
in interim net profits, but warned that second-half earnings would be 'well
below' last year.
Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon
group, announced a net profit of ADollars 29m before minority interests for
the six months to December, compared with ADollars 41m for the comparable
period of the previous year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's leading electronic companies expanded sales last year but
suffered a sharp decline in profitability, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
Samsung Electronics, the nation's largest electronics company and the second
largest group overall, posted sales of Won5,220bn (Dollars 11.1bn) in 1991,
up 15.9 per cent from Won4,500bn a year earlier. However, its net earnings
fell 6.04 per cent to Won68.6bn from Won73.01bn in 1990.
Goldstar, posted net earnings of Won18.5bn on sales of Won3,680bn. These
represent a 23.5 per cent gain in sales from Won2,980bn in 1990, but a sharp
44.9 per cent decline in net earnings from Won33.6bn for the same period a
year earlier.
Daewoo Electronics posted a 20.6 per cent rise in sales to Won1,580bn from
Won1,310bn for the comparable period. Its net earnings expanded 4.6 per cent
to Won13.6bn from Won13bn.
The poor performance in profits by these three large electronics groups was
the result of losses of revenue from exports, particularly consumer
electronics, the backbone of their business.
Shares of the three companies have nose-dived in the local stock market late
last year on a wave of speculation that they would report full-year losses
for 1991 as they were losing money on exports of consumer electronics and
computers.

cent jump in 1991 consolidated net income to SFr31.5m (Dollars 21m) on sales
up 18.5 per cent to SFr814.6m.
The directors have also proposed a radical capital restructuring plan that
would put all shareholders on an equal basis.
Last May, an alliance of foreign and Swiss pension funds forced the
Holzstoff board to withdraw a proposal that would have limited the voting
rights of registered shareholders.
Under the new plan, to be implemented following the change in Swiss company
law on July 1, all restrictions on the transferability and voting rights of
registered shares would be eliminated.
All bearer shares and participation shares would be converted into
registered shares and the registered shares would be split on the basis of
10 for one.
The directors said that the group had successfully completed a strategic
restructuring over the past two years and was raising the gross dividend per
share from SFr90 to SFr110.
Each share or participation holder will also receive gratis options.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Pension agency proves a
hard-nosed player / A look at the court-room battles brought about by
underfunding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN LTV, the large but bankrupt US steelmaker, unveiled its long-awaited
reorganisation plan earlier this month, the first applause came from a
seemingly obscure direction. Jolly good, said the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.
Don't be fooled. The PBGC may sound like a well-intentioned quango, but it
is frequently one of the most controversial, and hard-nosed, players in the
US bankruptcy process - and never more so than in the six-year-old battle
over LTV's carcass.
This federal agency has no real counterpart in the UK. It was created in
1974 by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa), and its title
accurately describes its mandate: to guarantee the payment of basic
retirement benefits.
In practice, the PBGC - technically, part of the US Labour Department - does
this by insuring most private employee pension plans and collecting premiums
from employers to fund its efforts. Over 40m American workers, in around
85,000 pension plans, are covered by PBGC insurance.
But the agency's task has not been easy of late. According to the 1991
annual report, released last month, total underfunding in plans guaranteed
by the PBGC has reached a staggering Dollars 40bn. Is this, pessimists
mutter darkly, another thrift industry crisis in the making?
Well, perhaps not quite. Calculations of underfunding depend on actuarial
assumptions, and there is some political incentive for the PBGC to paint a
gloomy picture.
Nevertheless, the agency's losses in recent years have been significant: the
accumulated deficit in the main 'single-employer' programme topped Dollars
2.5bn at end-1991, while PBGC itself reported a net Dollars 542m loss for
1991, after investment income.
Obviously, this dismal state of affairs is linked directly to corporate
America's parlous finances. Subject to some complex rules, PBGC's guarantees
are triggered when either an employer or the agency itself 'terminates' a
pension plan.
If it is underfunded, the PBGC becomes a trustee for the plan and, while
paying out something between the basic and maximum benefit levels, fights to
recover whatever monies it can.
Not surprisingly, the most high-profile terminations involving 'underfunded'
plans have occured in bankruptcies.
At Eastern Airlines, for example, where seven pension plans were terminated
in October 1990, the PBGC estimated the underfunding at around Dollars 700m.
At Pan Am - where the PBGC itself moved to terminate two of the three plans
last July - the agency calculated a Dollars 914m deficit. At LTV, the
unfunded pension obligations are put at Dollars 3.1bn.
So how has the federal agency - whose own internal auditing procedures were
subject to criticism two years ago - reacted to the mounting challenge? Part
of the answer lies in higher employers' premiums.
But, on a second front, the PBGC has also been involved in fisticuffs in the
courts as it tries to maximise the return from reorganisation plans hammered
out between bankrupts and their numerous creditors.
It is in this context that LTV has become a landmark case. The steel-based
conglomerate had four pension plans - one of which ran out of money shortly
after the bankruptcy filing in 1986, forcing the PBGC to take it over. The
others were terminated in early 1987.
Since then, the agency has been trying to push responsibility for the latter
trio of plans back on to LTV, and the US Supreme Court, no less, has weighed
in, in support.
In practice, the upshot at LTV looks likely to be a deal, whereby the
company takes back the three plans and makes an immediate cash injection of
around Dollars 1.5bn. The steelmaker will then make up the pension shortfall
over a 30-year period.
The PBGC, meanwhile, will receive 30-year zero coupon notes to help satisfy
a Dollars 700m claim for underfunding in the fourth plan.
The agency's enthusiasm for a reorganisation along these lines is
understandable. Assuming the scheme goes through as filed - and this may
depend on union concessions - LTV's unsecured creditors will end up with
only a small portion of their claims, satisfied largely in common stock.
But if LTV is ending in victory for the PBGC, new battles are looming.
The pension scheme at Trans World Airlines, the ailing carrier which is
owned by Mr Carl Icahn and which filed for bankruptcy in January, is
reckoned by the agency to be underfunded to the tune of Dollars 933m. Of
this, Dollars 440m refers to guaranteed benefits.
Because Mr Icahn owns over 80 per cent of TWA's equity, his other private
companies (some of which are more healthy) are deemed to be jointly and
severally liable for the TWA pension plans.
However, for most of last year it looked as if an outline reorganisation
plan at TWA would cut Mr Icahn's stake to a minority interest, and that the
PBGC would thus lose recourse to the businessman's other interests.
Then, with remarkably little publicity, the Missouri senator Mr John
Danforth introduced an Erisa amendment which was quietly enacted late in
1991. This would preserve the contingent liability of other Icahn-controlled
companies for TWA's pension plans, even if the tycoon's ownership interest
in TWA fell.
Even now, the struggle is not over. For a start, the PBGC is trying to
ensure that proceeds from any sales of TWA subsidiaries are applied to the
pension deficit, and are not distributed more generally. This was an
immediate concern, and round one has gone to the PBGC.
Last week, the airline and the pension agency agreed that the Dollars 50m
proceeds from the sale of the Travel Channel subsidiary should be applied to
the pension problem, and not used to fund operations.
Longer-term, the agency says its aim is to protect the underfunded pension
plans against any move by Mr Icahn to sell out altogether.
Meanwhile, at Continental Airlines - in bankruptcy since late-1990 - the
tussle is remarkably similar. Continental was the sister company of the
now-defunct Eastern Airlines, both being part of Mr Frank Lorenzo's airline
group.
The PBGC is trying to recover Dollars 752m on behalf of the Eastern plans
from Continental, and opposing the proposed Dollars 290m sale of Air
Micronesia (in which Continental holds a controlling stake) - again on
grounds that these proceeds should go to the Eastern pension plans.
Continental's recently-filed reorganisation scheme, however, treats the
PBGC's claim in line with other unsecured creditors. The carrier has said
that if the PBGC is given priority status, there will be little left for
other unsecured creditors - although it has stressed the desirability of
avoiding 'prolonged litigation'.
In principle, it would seem thoroughly fitting that the PBGC, in the
interests of pension protection, should play tough.
But not everyone thinks so. Some LTV creditors have complained loudly at
being squeezed so far down the repayment queue. Critics have also argued
that there may be a general reluctance to trade with, or supply credit to,
financially-stretched companies with heavily underfunded pension plans.
Should bankruptcy ensue, runs the argument, these parties know their claims
could play second fiddle to making the pension plans whole.
An even more basic complaint is that companies' attempts to reorganise are
being thrown off track.
Whatever the flaws in Mr Lorenzo's past stewardship, for example, is it
entirely fair that Continental's efforts to become a viable company should
be hampered by its past association with Eastern? Or that legal wrangles in
the LTV case should have delayed reorganisation for so long?
In reply, the PBGC maintains that it is merely seeking to 'get its rightful
due' under US law - and that this, after all, is its job. It is hard to
quarrel with such a stance, but the fundamental question goes unanswered:
are the bankruptcy laws themselves satisfactory?

FT  05 MAR 92 / Operating loss at TWA grows to Dollars 353.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn and in Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings, suffered an operating loss of Dollars 353.5m in
1991.
This compared with a Dollars 162.3m deficit in the same period a year
earlier, and a small profit of Dollars 24.3m in 1989.
The 1991 figure came on revenues down from Dollars 4.6bn to Dollars 3.66bn.
TWA sold a number of assets during the year and these included leading
routes between three US cities and London's Heathrow airport - which were
acquired by American Airlines.
Most of TWA's operating expense items were lower year-on-year, including
fuel, which fell from Dollars 898.4m in 1990 to Dollars 647.7m.
However, the overall slump in revenues outweighed the reduction in total
operating costs, from Dollars 4.77bn to Dollars 4.01bn.
At the after-tax level, the operating loss is transformed into a small net
profit of Dollars 48.3m, thanks largely to the Dollars 681.7m gain on asset
sales. Interest expenses were Dollars 287m, against Dollars 302.8m.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph will cut as many as 6,000 jobs and close 31
offices after it has deployed its voice-recognition technology for
long-distance calling in 1994, Reuter reports.
The company said the technology will allow it to automate many calls now
handled by operators.
The cuts will affect 200 to 400 management positions and 3,000 to 6,000
non-management positions in its operator services organisation by the end of
1994. AT&amp;T employs about 18,000 operators.
It said it hoped to offer jobs to affected employees, and has identified
eight types of job openings likely to occur between 1992 and 1994. Those not
placed will receive severance of up to 104 weeks' pay.
Calls that will be handled by voice recognition include collect and
billed-to-third-party calls.
An AT&amp;T spokesman said the company sees 'little or no impact' on its
earnings from the reduction plan and had not planned any reserves at
present.

<TEXT>
A SAUDI Arabian prince has asked the US Federal Reserve for permission to
convert Dollars 590m of preferred stock in Citicorp, the US's largest bank,
into common shares, making him the biggest single Citicorp shareholder, with
over 14 per cent of the bank.
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has asked to be allowed to convert the preferred
stock into a further 9.6 per cent of Citicorp common, while retaining a
separate 4.8 per cent common equity stake he already owns.
If the Fed agrees, this would boost the Saudi's overall stake to nearly 14.4
per cent, larger than the 8.05 per cent shareholding owned by Wellington
Management, a Boston-based investor presently the biggest single Citicorp
shareholder.
The Fed confirmed it received the request, but would not comment on it.
In February 1991, when Prince Al-Waleed invested Dollars 590m in the
convertible Citicorp shares, he told the Fed he would file a notice if he
wished to retain his 4.8 per cent of common stock as well as the preferred
paper.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Saudi cannot own over 15 per cent of
Citicorp for the next four years.

BANCA Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the Italian Treasury-owned bank, raised
net earnings at parent bank level by 3.2 per cent to L74.2bn (Dollars 59m)
last year. Gross profits, before depreciation and provisions, rose 22.8 per
cent to L1,204bn.
The sharp difference between BNL's net and gross earnings lies in the
L1,319bn being put aside in depreciation charges and provisions. Some L917bn
of the total is being allocated to special bad loan provisions, following a
similar provision of over L637bn last year.
Separately, a special Italian parliamentary committee investigating the
scandal over Dollars 4bn in improper Iraqi loans made by BNL's Atlanta
branch, announced its long-awaited report would not be issued until after
general elections on April 5.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler-Benz, the German vehicle,
aerospace, and electronics concern, will stay on for two more years after
reaching the normal retirement age next year.
Daimler has followed the example of Volkswagen, which extended Mr Carl
Hahn's period in the top job by two years until the end of 1993. Daimler's
supervisory board, headed by Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche
Bank, decided yesterday Mr Reuter's contract should be extended until the
end of 1995.
Mr Reuter, 64, became chief executive in 1987, succeeding Mr Werner
Breitschwerdt who was ousted after Daimler had suffered poor publicity over
car production problems and was still striving to absorb its new
acquisitions - AEG (electronics), Dornier (aerospace), and MTU (engines). It
has since bought Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm to extend its aerospace
business, now grouped into Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa).
Unlike Mr Breitschwerdt, the articulate Mr Reuter was one of the architects
of Daimler's diversification, believing other activities were needed for a
time when the car and truck markets reached possible stagnation. Supporting
Mr Reuter was Mr Werner Niefer, deputy chief executive of Daimler and head
of its Mercedes-Benz vehicle subsidiary.
Mr Niefer, 63, who joined Daimler as a toolmaking apprentice, will remain as
Mr Reuter's deputy until May, 1993, after 50 years with the company. He will
then also step down as chief executive of Mercedes to be succeeded by Mr
Helmut Werner, the former head of Continental tyres.
Both Mr Werner and Mr Jurgen Schrempp, 47, who heads Dasa, are regarded as
strong candidates to succeed Mr Reuter as the chief executive of Daimler
after 1995. Mr Werner, 55, heads Mercedes' truck operation and has moved it
into profit by curbing costs and lifting productivity. Rising domestic
demand, helped by unification, has also benefited sales.

DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest company, has signalled an important
reorganisation of its electronics activities by carving a new
microelectronics company out of two subsidiaries, AEG and Deutsche
Aerospace, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin.
The new unit, to be set up in July, was said by DB to mark an important step
in its transition from car producer to integrated technology concern. The
goal was to concentrate similar technologies within the multi-faceted group.
Mr Ernst G. Stockl, AEG chairman, and Mr Jurgen E. Schrempp, chairman of
Deutsche Aerospace, said it would also help substitute future-oriented
civilian activities for declining defence sales.
The company will produce everything from semiconductors to sensors, hybrids
and complete systems.
The as yet unnamed new company is expected to have sales this year of about
DM2.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn) and 16,500 employees.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken in SKr5.8bn deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-controlled bank, yesterday reported an
earnings loss of SKr5.8bn (Dollars 966m) for 1991 as credit losses and
provisions climbed to SKr10.5bn.
The Nordbanken results coincided with an announcement from the Swedish Bank
Inspection Board that total credit losses for the country's financial
institutions reached SKr48.1bn in 1991, almost triple the 1990 figure of
SKr17.8bn, mainly due to falling property values.
Banks accounted for SKr35.6bn of these losses, while finance companies lost
SKr9.9bn. The banks' credit losses amounted to 2.9 per cent of their total
lending volume in 1991 against 1.2 per cent in 1990.
The agency predicted that credit losses would also be large this year
because of the recession. But it added that the financial system was stable
since the banks had reserves of SKr120bn and most benefited from income
growth.
Nordbanken, which made a profit of SKr855m in 1990, has fared worst among
the big Swedish banks in 1991 with the collapse of several large property
and finance companies that borrowed heavily from the bank.
Its loan loss-provisions more than doubled from the 1990 figure of SKr4.2bn
and these credit losses accounted for 3.9 per cent of total lending volume.
The bank was also forced to write off goodwill of SKr2.1bn from its 1989
merger with PKbanken that made it Sweden's second largest bank.
Nordbanken's profit before provisions also fell by 9 per cent to SKr4.66bn,
although several of its competitors, including Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, have reported increases in pre-loss earnings.
The bank blamed the lower profits on a 7 per cent fall in interest income to
SKr8.5bn, reflecting an increase in the amount of non-performing loans,
which grew SKr8.9bn to SKr19.3bn over the past year. But Nordbanken managed
to stabilise costs at SKr6.7bn, the same amount as in 1990.
The bank's capital asset ratio increased from 7.6 per cent to 9.2 per cent
after the government subscribed to a SKr5.2bn share issue in December.
A shrinkage in the bank's assets to SKr339bn from SKr407bn was another
reason for the improvement in the capital asset ratio, which now exceeds the
8 per cent level established by the Bank of International Settlements for
the end of 1992.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Business Law: US privatisation advances at federal level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH FLOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before heading home for the Thanksgiving holiday last November, the United
States Congress completed the arduous process of hammering out the
Inter-Modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. President Bush is
expected promptly to sign the Dollars 151bn public works measure.
This legislation redirects federal spending towards regional transportation,
bridges, roads and tunnels in co-operation with the private sector. It
represents a signficant change from the focus on big, new inter-state
highways which has prevailed since the Eisenhower administration. Under the
Act, more money will be spent in the next six years than in any previous
infrastructure programme.
In many respects, the legislation, in a new manner, harnesses the private
sector in the task of re-building America's infrastructure.
Underlying the legislation is the recognition that America is in the midst
of an infrastructure crisis and that private participation is necessary for
recovery. Over the last 20 years, non-military investment in infrastructure
 -principally bridges, roads and tunnels - as a fraction of gross national
product has been only 65 per cent of America's average level during the
preceding two decades. This is a decline from 3.7 per cent to 2.4 per cent
of GNP. When depreciation is taken into account, the rate of non-military
investment in infrastructure and public works in the 1980s has been only
half that of the 1970s and just one quarter that of the 1950s and 1960s.
In a recent study, the economist David Aschauer demonstrates that the fall
in investment in infrastructure over the past quarter century has been an
important cause of the US economy's poor performance since 1970. More than
half of the decline in US productivity in that period can be explained by
lower infrastructure spending.
Mr Aschauer calls the shortfall between the current stock of infrastructure
and the present need for infrastructure capital America's Third Deficit - as
distinct from the other two: the internal and external deficits.
Mr Aschauer concludes that a 1 per cent increase in the current level of
core US physical infrastructure (defined as roads, bridges and mass transit)
would increase GNP by nearly a quarter of 1 per cent.
He is not the only economist who has noticed this relationship. In the most
recent Economic Report of the President, Michael Boskin, chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers, asserts that 'inadequate
government infrastructure can impede improvements in productivity growth'
and that 'taking advantage of productive opportunities to maintain and
improve infrastructure is an important part of federal, state, and local
government policies to raise economic growth'.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Dollars 800bn is needed in
additional spending on infrastructure to 2000.
Economists generally agree that more money needs to be invested in America's
infrastructure. But the likely size of next year's federal deficit makes it
unrealistic to expect that the federal government will spend the requisite
amount. Some money will have to come from state and local governments, but
their budgets are also strained. Most state and local governments are in a
terrible financial condition. They have poor credit ratings and are up
against debt ceilings. Accordingly, a significant portion of the cost of
infrastructure improvement will have to come from other sources.
In the past, it has not been the policy of the federal government and the
states to encourage private-sector financing of infrastructure development.
As a result, Americans have been in the anomalous position of spending
billions of dollars of private capital to build foreign infrastructure,
while ignoring their own.
The Bill is a significant step towards federal government encouragement of
private involvement in infrastructure improvement. It reflects the recent
accelerating trend toward privatisation at the state and municipal levels
detailed in my September 19 1991 article in this column - 'Double standards
in the US'.
The US Department of Transportation issued a report in March 1990 - National
Transportation Policy. This outlined the Bush administration's transport
goals, called for government at all levels to promote private-sector
involvement in transport infrastructure. In its wake, several states -
California and Virginia in particular - introduced legislation to develop
highway 'privatisation' projects. With the passage of the Inter-Modal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the federal government itself
will take the initiative.
In the Act, the federal government authorises the imposition of tolls on
federally-subsidised bridges, roads and tunnels (other than those on the
Interstate system) to finance their construction or rehabilitation. Toll
revenues may be set aside to provide a reasonable rate of return to private
investors.
Previously, tolls have been restricted to only a small number of facilities.
More important, for the first time since federal aid to highways began in
1916, the legislation permits bridge, road and tunnel toll projects to be
privately-owned and permits substantial federal subsidies to private
investors willing to undertake transportation infrastructure investments.
A federal subsidy of up to 50 per cent of costs is allowed for private
investors willing to build new roads or rehabilitate existing bridges, roads
or tunnels. A federal subsidy of up to 80 per cent is allowed to private
investors willing to construct new bridges or tunnels or replace existing
bridges or tunnels. As an additional incentive, states will be permitted to
lend all or part of the federal subsidies rather than transfer them directly
to the entities undertaking the projects.
The financial community will now be called upon to decide how best to employ
these financial arrangements. It will, however, be up to the states to take
advantage of this new flexibility. There is no assurance that the states
will act. While the provisions of the legislation are not mandatory, given
the dimensions of the US infrastructure crisis and the budgetary constraints
on the states and municipalities, we can expect this legislation to further
accelerate privatisation by states and municipalities.
The passing of the Act should provide help for rebuilding dilapidating
infrastructure, while providing a unique area for new investment activities
in the US.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BAe and Asda settle dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace and Asda, the supermarket group, have settled a dispute
about an option concerning the Burwood House Group, their property joint
venture.
The dispute flared after Arlington, BAe's property subsidiary, was forced to
pay the joint venture company Pounds 79m last month to fulfil an indemnity
agreement.
Asda argued that it had the right to exercise an option, that would force
BAe to buy it out, potentially for some Pounds 75m.
However, Arlington said the option was irrelevant, since it only applied in
the event of a default and was invalidated by the payment of Pounds 79m.
Asda said that the argument had been 'amicably settled.'

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Putting money on the smaller companies -
The sector tipped to lead the economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THREE lean years, investors in smaller companies are about to have
their day again. According to Credit Lyonnais Laing, pre-tax profits of
smaller companies with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 250m are
likely to grow by more than a third this year, twice as quickly as larger
companies.
The forecast partly reflects the belief that smaller companies, which were
the first to fall victim to recession, will be among the first to benefit
from the economic recovery now widely forecast for the second half of the
year.
Yet Credit Lyonnais Laing's forecast, drawn from its 'Behind the Balance
Sheet' report on 54 smaller companies, is only the latest indicator that the
sector is back in vogue.
In January, Lloyds and Scottish Amicable launched investment trusts to cover
smaller companies. Clerical Medical, which since early 1991 has been
reducing its weighting of FT-SE 100 stocks in its top performing Pedigree
growth fund, followed with a unit trust for those seeking an undiluted
vehicle for investment in smaller companies.
And a smaller companies show at the Barbican hosted recently by Singer &amp;
Friedlander, the merchant bank, was enthusiastically attended by more than
90 fund managers.
If smaller companies are indeed to enjoy a renaissance, it would restore a
pre-1989 relationship between the larger and the smaller sectors; for six
years before the recession set in, the FT-A All-Share Index outperformed the
FT-SE 100 Index, a pattern that has since been reversed. Mr Nigel Savage,
manager of Govett UK smaller companies unit trust, believes the indices are
about to revert to their old relationship.
Yet the renewed enthusiasm for the smallest companies may be premature, not
just because recovery is still only around the corner and not upon us.
Investor attention does appear to be shifting away from the FT-SE 100 stocks
but it may focus next on the Tootsies, the second hundred largest stocks by
market capitalisation companies valued between Pounds 290m and Pounds 1.4bn.
'We think that the next wave of enthusiasm will be the quality second line
stocks,' says Mr Savage. 'The real tiddlers, with market capitalisation of
less than Pounds 50m, will have to wait until further down the economic
cycle.'
There may also be qualitative differences between any smaller company upturn
this time and the surge of interest in the later stages of the 1980's bull
market. 'On the back of the 1980's boom the small company sector got
over-hyped and over-bought and dragged in a lot of rubbish,' says Mr Peter
Searight, the fund manager building Clerical Medical's new unit trust.
'Those were the days,' says another fund manager, 'All sorts of strange
investments were made and they still went up.'
In the more austere, debt conscious 1990s, fund managers say they will have
a much keener eye on stock selection. 'What people will be looking for is
strong balance sheets, strong market share and strong management,' says Mr
Savage.
This alone may delay a return of buoyancy to the smaller market sector. By
definition, many smaller companies may be constrained in one or all of these
areas.
In another equally important area, smaller companies will also emerge from
this recession carrying an additional burden.
Commercial banks, burned by their late 1980s lending binge, are widely
expected to be reluctant to provide the working capital and longer term debt
many companies will need to take advantage of the recovery.
Furthermore, the smaller companies' share prices may have been languishing
for so long that raising development funds through the capital markets may
be either unattractive or impossible.
Recovery may, therefore, come only to the stronger companies, making fund
managers far more selective and less inclined to buy the sector wholesale.
Analysts can call on a raft of tools with which to help fund managers
select, such as Credit Lyonnais Laing's analysis of 54 more attractive
smaller companies. This attempts to arrive at a better measure of a
company's 'financial flexibility' to finance proposed growth by using
analysts' forecasts to predict future free cash flow generation and its
impact on gearing.
The company argues that conventional cash flow calculations - post-tax
profit plus gross depreciation less net dividends - only reflect the past
and have limited value when trying to understand a company's prospects.
But many analysts say that far more important than any technical analysis,
is an assessment of the quality of management. For smaller companies this is
doubly the case; technical analysis is most valuable in warning a fund
manager which managements not to bother to visit.

buy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MEGGITT, the Dorset-based specialist engineering group, is to strengthen its
aerospace activities by buying Endevco, a US company which makes electronic
equipment and pressure sensors, for Dollars 53m (Pounds 30.1m) cash.
The vendor is Allied-Signal, a US group which supplies the aerospace and
automotive industries.
Endevco employs 600 people and has two sites in California, with additional
manufacturing operations in the US Virgin Islands and France. It also has
sales operations in the UK, France, Germany and China.
Last year Endevco made pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.5m on sales of Dollars
55m. Net assets at December 31 were Dollars 25m.
Mr Ken Coates, chairman of Meggitt, said Endevco's market position and
financial strength made it an ideal acquisition for Meggitt as it developed
the group's core activities in aerospace and industrial sensors.
Meggitt has net cash after a Pounds 39.6m rights issue in September, and its
gearing will remain in single figures after the acquisition, which is
subject to regulatory approval.
Mr Coates said the deal would increase the US balance of Meggitt's business
from about 30 to 35 per cent.

<TEXT>
LORD WHITE, one of the twin architects of the growth of Hanson, yesterday
paved the way for his successor by announcing that Mr David Clarke had been
named as deputy chairman and chief executive of Hanson Industries, the
congolmerate's US arm.
Mr Clarke, aged 50, was introduced by Lord White, chairman of Hanson's US
arm, as his successor at a meeting of fund managers and analysts in London
last month.
Mr John Raos, one of the group's chief operating officers has been promoted
to president.
The decision to name Mr Clarke as deputy chairman of Hanson Industries
increased speculation that Lord White might step down as chairman before he
is due to retire in 1996.
Mr Clarke, a director of Hanson plc since 1989, has served as president and
chief operating office of Hanson Industries since 1978.
Both men were yesterday described by Lord White as skilled practitioners of
the Hanson philosophy.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reuters shares fall as delays hit Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Reuters Holdings closed down 39p at Pounds 11.86p yesterday after
a technical problem forced the financial information and news company to
postpone a test of Globex, its screen-based system for trading futures and
options.
Reuters said the problem was encountered at an early stage of Tuesday's test
of 250 key stations in Chicago, London and Paris. The test would be
rescheduled after analysis of the difficulty, which is believed to have been
caused by a bug in the software.
Globex is being created jointly by Reuters with the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and is to be launched later this year.
Reuters is still expected to launch soon the long-delayed second phase of
Dealing 2000, its automated trading system which enables foreign exchange
traders to complete transactions on-screen.
Reuters shares have risen strongly since the group last month reported a 6.3
per cent rise to Pounds 340.3m in annual profits, in spite of weak
conditions in its traditional markets.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Strong demand boosts Victaulic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTAULIC, the pipe and fittings maker, continued to benefit from strong
demand from its main markets, the gas and water industries, which helped
lift pre-tax profits by 24 per cent from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 14.3m in
1991.
The water and gas industries accounted for 78 per cent of sales, ahead to
Pounds 114.8m (Pounds 99.6m).
The shares yesterday rose by 41p to 786p.
Capital spending by the water service companies benefited Stewarts &amp; Lloyds
Plastics, which produces polyethylene pipes for water distribution, and, to
a lesser extent, Viking Johnson, which is involved in the refurbishment of
water mains.
Mr David Stewart, managing director, said the market for gas pipe and
fittings had held up well despite the recession, although the low level of
new house construction inevitably affected demand for small diameter service
pipe and fittings.
Construction declined because of reduced demand from the fire protection
industry and the completion of the main contracts for the Channel tunnel
project.
A net cash balance at the year-end of Pounds 9.7m compared with net
borrowings of Pounds 500,000 the year before. Working capital fell from
Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 3.4m.
Earnings per share increased from 34.9p to 42.5p. A final dividend of 10p
makes a total of 14.7p (12p). A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.

Alma Holdings, the unquoted Scottish confectionery maker which went into
receivership on February 21, is to close its four factories and make its 461
employees redundant.
Mr Rod Owen, joint receiver from Peat Marwick, said that a significant
number of Alma's customers had transferred their business elsewhere making
keeping the plants going impossible.
More than 200 jobs are to go at two plants in Dundee, 150 at Glenrothes and
Kircaldy, Fife and the remainder in the sales office in Manchester. Some 115
staff are to be retained in the short term to assist with closing the
plants.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Heywood Williams falls to
Pounds 19.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEYWOOD WILLIAMS, the UK's largest glass distributor, yesterday announced
its seventh acquisition since last year's Pounds 28m rights issue as it
unveiled a 17 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended December
31 1991.
The profits fall, from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 19.2m, was struck on turnover
up by 5 per cent from Pounds 331.5m to Pounds 347.4m and was mainly due to
the depressed state of the UK construction industry.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, Heywood's chairman, said: 'The whole of the fall can be
put down to aluminium and glass connected with commercial buildings.' He
added that there were no real signs of an upturn in the UK.
The result, helped by last year's acquisition of Thurgar Bardex, the
Kettering-based manufacturer of windows and doors, was still above market
expectations. The shares rose 8p to close at 331p.
Door Panels Group, a manufacturer of plastic door panels bought for Pounds
7.8m, will be incorporated into the group's growing plastics division, which
presently accounts for one quarter of total sales.
Continental operations finished well ahead of 1990 and have recently been
boosted by two new businesses in The Netherlands and France.
The group's US businesses were only just behind their 1990 result.
The UK workforce was reduced by 420 to a total of 5,380. In the US the
Georgia manufacturing plant was closed and several glass operations in the
UK were amalgamated.
Borrowings have fallen slightly to Pounds 20m, representing 20 per cent of
shareholders' funds.
Earnings per share fell from an adjusted 22.8p to 17.2p. A final dividend of
8p is proposed, making a total for the year of 12.5p (12p adjusted).
COMMENT
There is not much Heywood Williams can do about depressed demand in one of
its main businesses. Apart from a pick up in the home improvement market in
the second half there is little chance of a significant upturn in UK housing
or construction. The group has taken advantage of the low prices of plastic
and glass business during the recession by snapping up seven companies in
its last financial year. The plastics division is growing in size and
profitability while the Continental glass operations are also providing
better results. With expected full-year profits for 1992 of Pounds 26m,
giving earnings per share of 21.1, the shares are trading on a prospective
multiple of 15.6 compared to a sector average of 18.2. Given the expected
increase in profits the shares look good value.

trust

<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION, the composite insurance group, is launching an investment
trust which will aim to take advantage of increases in environmental
protection expenditure.
CU is the second insurance company, and the first composite, to launch an
investment trust.
Unlike other recent trust launches, which have been aimed at the retail
market, the Commercial Union Environmental Trust will be placed almost
exclusively with institutional shareholders.
Shares will be available for large intermediaries, if they are interested,
but CU is making no attempt to market the shares directly to the public.
The company is also considering further investment trust launches.
The trust will have no geographical limitations, and will invest primarily
in smaller specialised companies which stand to benefit from increased
expenditure on environmental protection.
It is aiming to raise up to Pounds 30m during its launch period which lasts
until March 25. Dealing will start on April 3. The ordinary shares will be
priced at 100p each, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis.

Chrysalis, the record, communications and media company which its founder,
Mr Chris Wright, recently failed to take private, has in the last week
bought in 899,000 of its own shares for cancellation.
The company, which said last month it could not persuade one sizeable
shareholder to accept its offer of 95p per share, paid 72p for most of the
shares, and 71p for the rest. Chrysalis' shares yesterday closed unchanged
at 74p.
The cancellation of these shares increases Mr Wright's stake in the company
to 49.5 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Expansion at Intrum Justitia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTRUM JUSTITIA, the debt collection agency, yesterday reported a 35 per
cent jump in profits and a Pounds 6m acquisition in France.
The company that is bringing respectability to what has often been the less
than genteel task of chasing up late payers, increased pre-tax profits in
the year to December from Pounds 8.65m to Pounds 11.6m on sales up 48 per
cent at Pounds 75.5m.
Earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 9.1p and the company will pay a final
dividend of 1.6p, bringing a total for the year to 2.4p, up 33 per cent on
the previous 12 months.
Mr Bo Goranson, the founder and chairman, said the acquisition of Eureco, a
Strasbourg-based debt collection agency with six branches throughout France
was the latest move in the creation of a Europe-wide operation.
A quarter of the increase in sales came from organic growth with the balance
from a full year's contribution from Cas, the UK company bought in 1990, and
Dutch and Danish acquisitions during the year.
Sweden, where Mr Goranson founded his company, Finland and Switzerland had
been particularly successful and consumer credit collection in the UK had
also seen strong growth.
'Our business is recession resilient,' said Mr Goranson. 'We do well in both
a good and bad economic climate.'
Intrum Justitia, with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the credit rating and debt
collection agency, is also actively supporting a campaign by the Forum of
Private Business to introduce an automatic legal right to charge interest on
overdue commercial debts.
If such legislation is introduced, or standardised in the UK with European
practise, Intrum's commercial business in the UK would receive a substantial
boost.
Mr Gert van Laar, chief executive, said Intrum has just been awarded a trial
contract in Leeds to collect overdue TV license fees.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes climbs 13% - A record
year despite sluggish or falling sales in some markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY SCHWEPPES, the confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer, increased
pre-tax profits by 13.2 per cent to Pounds 316.4m last year, in spite of
sluggish or declining sales in some important markets.
Sir Graham Day, chairman, said the results marked 'a record year in every
single respect.' They reflected firm cost controls and continued high levels
of investment to improve efficiency and strengthen the company's brands.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, expected business conditions to remain
tough this year, though he was optimistic about prospects for the important
Easter season.
The pre-tax results, for the year to December 28, were at the top end of
market expectations and compared with Pounds 279.6m a year ago.
Sales rose 2.7 per cent to Pounds 3.23bn (Pounds 3.15bn), while trading
margins increased to 11.2 per cent (10.6 per cent).
In the UK, trading profits rose 9.2 per cent to Pounds 162.2m on a 2 per
cent increase in sales to Pounds 1.51bn. The company consolidated recent
market share gains in chocolate and increased its share of sweets sales,
though a decline in leisure purchases reduced beverage sales by 2.8 per cent
in value and 8 per cent in volume.
In continental Europe, trading profit rose 12.1 per cent to Pounds 76.2m on
sales of Pounds 655.8m, up 2.8 per cent. Trading profit improved strongly at
Poulain, the company's French chocolate subsidiary, while the merged Oasis
and Schweppes beverage business in France performed well.
Sales by the recently-formed Apollinaris-Schweppes joint venture also made a
strong start in Germany and Austria.
Though sales in the Americas rose 8.6 per cent to Pounds 438.3m, the biggest
increase in any region, poorer beverages results reduced profits by 1.2 per
cent to Pounds 42.8m. This was despite a 6.6 per cent growth in the
company's US carbonated drinks volumes.
Pacific Rim sales fell 0.9 per cent to Pounds 491.2m, but trading profit
grew 10.1 per cent to Pounds 64.5m.
Overall, operating profit on confectionery operations totalled Pounds 170.2m
(Pounds 163m) on sales of Pounds 1.39bn (1.32bn). In the beverage business,
operating profit was Pounds 192.3m (Pounds 170.9m) on sales of Pounds 1.84bn
(Pounds 1.82bn).
Positive cash flow reduced net borrowings by Pounds 31m to Pounds 333m,
contributing to a drop in gearing to 39 per cent (49 per cent).
Capital investment increased 9.3 per cent to Pounds 232m, while marketing
spending rose 5.8 per cent to Pounds 343m.
Earnings per share increased 9.6 per cent to 27.73p (25.29p).
The final dividend is raised to 9.3p (8.5p), bringing the full year total to
12.5p (11.5p).

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley on offensive over claims in Spain
by Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, which is fighting a Pounds 600m takeover bid from Redland, the
rival building materials group, yesterday moved onto the offensive over
allegations that it had over-estimated its Spanish aggregate reserves.
Redland, which had hired independent geologists to investigate Steetley's
quarries in France and Spain, claimed at the weekend that the reserves of
five companies in the Madrid area were much less than Steetley had implied
when it bought the businesses for Pounds 24.6m in 1988.
Mr David Donne, Steetley chairman, said yesterday that Redland's claims were
inaccurate and based on a meeting which had not taken place.
He said that the mayor of Velilla de San Antonio had denied having met the
geologists as they had claimed.
The investigation for Redland was conducted by the Spanish arm of BRGM, the
French institute of geology.
In a letter to Redland, the geologists had said that their findings had been
based on site inspections, geological studies and interviews with local
people, including the mayor.
They had concluded that the reserves were no more than 30m tonnes and that
planning permission was likely to be granted for only half of this because
of plans to establish a nature reserve in the area.
Mr Donne said yesterday that Redland had conducted an 'over-the-wall
geological study and got it wrong badly'.
Steetley had commissioned a full study prior to making the acquisitions.
This showed that there were 59m tonnes of sand and gravel reserves.
When it acquired the businesses in 1988, the group had said that there were
30 years' worth of proven sand and gravel reserves at current rates of
production. Redland said that this had implied reserves of at least 48m
tonnes.
Last night Mr Donne noted that BRGM had also conducted a survey of
Steetley's French reserves which had also claimed that they were much lower
than had previously been thought.
Redland said last night: 'An independent assessment of Steetley's Spanish
assets was done at our request. Its findings included the fact that part of
these reserves are situated in an area proposed as a nature reserve. This
has not been disputed by Steetley and it demonstrates the great difficulty
in placing values on these assets.'

BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, has bought the rights to
Enid Blyton's Noddy books from the administrator of Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
The 24 Noddy titles, published by Queen Anne's Press, were part of
Macdonald, MCC's UK book subsidiary. Price Waterhouse, appointed MCC's
administrator last year after the collapse of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's
business empire, last month sold the rest of Macdonald. However the buyer,
Little Brown, a US publisher specialising in art books, declined to take the
Noddy titles.
The BBC has commissioned a Noddy cartoon series from Cosgrove Hall, the
cartoon-making arm of Thames Television, which currently holds the franchise
for London weekday broadcasting.

<TEXT>
SHARES in GKN, the UK motor components, industrial services and defence
group, jumped by 20p to 352p yesterday in spite of a 44.7 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits last year and a warning of job losses to come.
Reduced borrowings, a maintained dividend and chairman Sir David Lees'
depiction of GKN as having costs under control and ready to take full
advantage of market upturns were seen as the main offsets to pre-tax profits
falling to Pounds 95m from Pounds 172m.
Sales were down 6.3 per cent, to Pounds 2.43bn from Pounds 2.59bn.
Sir David said: 'Although the immediate future in terms of demand does not
give grounds for much optimism, the resilience of the group does.'
He disclosed that all but Pounds 1m of Pounds 16.2m spent on restructuring
last year had gone into redundancies, with 1,700 of the 2,850 jobs lost
concentrated in the UK.
However, he forecast that redundancy costs this year would drop to around
Pounds 5m, indicating fewer than 800 job losses. Following last year's
shake-out the group employs 30,000 world-wide, about 18,000 overseas.
About 52 per cent of GKN's turnover is in cars, commercial vehicles and
engineering products, the trading surplus on which fell to Pounds 60m last
year from Pounds 90m.
GKN expects its Pounds 90m supplies to the Japanese in 1991 to rise to more
than Pounds 100m this year.
The group's other main activity, industrial services and distribution which
account for 29 per cent of sales, also saw a sharp drop in trading surplus,
to Pounds 35m from Pounds 59m, largely due to deterioration in the UK, US
and Australian construction markets.
The contribution made by associated companies fell by more than 50 per cent,
to Pounds 28.5m from Pounds 57.9m, almost wholly due to problems encountered
by United Engineering Steels (US).
Group trading profit was Pounds 95.4m, down from Pounds 149.3m. Net
borrowings fell Pounds 45m to Pounds 175m, reducing the group's gearing to
26.4 per cent from 32.3 per cent, the lowest for 15 years. There was a net
cash inflow of Pounds 59m, against an outflow of Pounds 9m.
The tax charge fell to Pounds 41.3m from Pounds 60.2m. Net earnings after
minority interests of Pounds 17m (against Pounds 18.7m) were Pounds 36.7m
(against Pounds 93.1m), reflecting the absence of Pounds 48.8m 1990
extraordinaries. Earnings per share were 14.2p against 36.1p in 1990. The
final dividend of 12.5p left the total dividend for the year unchanged at
20.5p.

FT  05 MAR 92 / BICC drops 56% to Pounds 81m pre-tax: Group hit by property
development write-downs and Transmanche Link provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the UK-based cables and construction group, suffered a 56 per cent
fall in pre-tax profit to Pounds 81m last year after property development
write-downs and provisions for losses on the Channel tunnel contract.
Exceptional charges amounted to Pounds 42m, of which Pounds 30m was
attributed to property development and Pounds 12m to BICC's share of
provisional losses incurred last year by Transmanche Link, a consortium of
British and French companies building the tunnel.
BICC's operating profit fell by 31 per cent to Pounds 146m from Pounds 212m
on turnover of Pounds 3.79bn, down from Pounds 3.89bn. Mr Robin Biggam,
chairman, said the profit decline included Pounds 17m of rationalisation
costs. This covered about 2,500 job losses in manufacturing worldwide and
several hundred more in Balfour Beatty, the group's construction arm.
The North American cables business slid to Pounds 3m losses, from a Pounds
26m profit. Mr Biggam described this as 'the biggest single disappointment'.
BICC Cables remained the largest profit contributor with Pounds 91m, down
from Pounds 110m. It experienced weak second-half demand for telecoms
cabling from BT in the UK, and Telefonica in Spain. As it had recently
increased its stake in Grupo Espanol General Cable (GEGC) to 55 per cent and
acquired a German company, continental sales would account for half the
divisional total this year.
Balfour Beatty improved its profit to Pounds 38m from Pounds 35m on turnover
of Pounds 1.9bn, up from Pounds 1.78bn as civil and power engineering
contracts, including overseas work, offset the downturn in UK building.
Balfour was hit by losses in a contract car and van hire business, which is
to be sold.
In Australasia, profit fell to Pounds 26m from Pounds 33m. Factory
rationalisation had been completed, electrical wholesaling recovered to
break even and a decision had been made to get out of construction.
Earnings per share fell to 10.7p from 40.2p.
Mr Biggam said one highlight was the generation of Pounds 40m cash by the
core operations, before a Pounds 57m outflow to fund property developments.
Off-balance sheet debt had been reduced from Pounds 255m to less than Pounds
200m.
On the balance sheet, net borrowings of Pounds 35m replaced Pounds 2m cash.
The group has issued Pounds 177m of convertible capital bonds and will this
year take on Pounds 100m of GEGC's debt, leaving a total of about Pounds
150m off balance sheet.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 26m was made for losses on businesses
being sold.
To maintain the total dividend at 19.25p, Pounds 51m was taken from
reserves. Net assets, however, benefited from a revaluation of sites and
rose to Pounds 685m from Pounds 665m, counting the capital bond as equity.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Measures to prevent abuse of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I M AITKEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read that MPs are expected to recommend radical
changes in pensions law ('MPs hit at City over pensions regulation', March
3).
The Pensions Management Institute takes seriously the abuses occurring
within the pensions industry, even though the vast majority of schemes are
well managed.
The council of the institute believes that measures must be taken to ensure
that these shortcomings do not and cannot occur again. We have outlined our
views in written evidence to the Commons' social security committee.
We are aware that some pension scheme trustees only pay lip service to many
aspects of the regulations and no action is taken by the authorities when
breaches occur. The Council of the institute believes that associates and
fellows of the institute (qualified by professional examinations) should be
given a statutory role in supervision. This will improve members' security
and safeguard pensions.
One cannot legislate against fraud - however, with proper supervision it can
be made more difficult.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Shareholders, management and the need for greater
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL D VARCOE-COCKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In postulating 'the reality that the shareholders, having provided the
capital, are thereby in effect the owners of the business' Dr Gillibrand
ignores one crucial point.
Whereas the managers of a business have to stay and run the business,
shareholders can, by picking up a telephone or touching a screen at a bank,
sell their shares and sever their limited and totally selfish connection
with the company.
Someone who provides finance for a defined period could be said to be an
'owner of the business', but shareholders - who can sell their shares on a
whim with no real thought for the company's well-being - cannot claim any
right to 'own' the business, still less any right to control its management.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Shareholders, management and the need for greater
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN COLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a flaw in the argument of Dr Maurice Gillibrand's letter
(March 3) which attacks Sir Owen Green's contribution to the debate at the
conference of the National Association of Pension Funds.
Dr Gillibrand's thesis is that shareholders should consider themselves the
owners of companies, and he cites in evidence 'the unrestrained action of
directors in Guinness, Polly Peck and Maxwell Communication'. He overlooks
the fact that Messrs Asil Nadir and Robert Maxwell could rely on their power
as shareholders, not their power as directors, to have their will of their
companies. They were exercising to the extreme the doctrine that
shareholders own the business.
Sir Owen is quoted as saying that shareholders would be better regarded as
freeholder landlords than owners of public companies. Freeholder landlords
have the right to ensure the preservation of their property, and leasehold
tenants do what they will within this limitation. Similarly, we must surely
recognise that shareholders (as well as directors) have limited rights and
cannot do what they will with the company.
Increased statutory regulation seems to be rejected by Dr Gillibrand, in
favour of 'an improved relationship between management and shareholders'. As
an ex-member of Robert Maxwell's staff, who feels badly let down by the
failure of the law, regulatory bodies and institutions to protect my
pension, I do not believe we should wait for such a loosely defined utopia.
Shareholders and management are often controlled by the same individuals; in
public companies at least their selfish interests must be subject to greater
regulation - and urgently.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Ford's fully-integrated operations across the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM H FIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your leading article, 'Developing cars across
borders' (February 27).
Many of your readers may remember that Ford of Britain and Ford of Germany
used to develop competing models, which they sold to whichever Ford company
could sell them.
It was to make more productive use of the company's considerable assets
across Europe that Henry Ford II formed Ford of Europe in 1967.
Most of the duplication has been steadily removed over the years, so that
today, on the eve of Europe's single market, Ford probably has one of the
most fully-integrated, European Community-wide operations of any industry.
Cross-border teamwork is the approach that we use. And it is in this vein
that we have been studying whether we could effectively increase this
teamwork by bringing members of particular teams together in the same
locations.
For example, engineers from Britain and Germany recently moved temporarily
to our Genk plant in Belgium to oversee the development and start-up of a
big project we have there.
When it comes to developing cars, our own in-house video-conferencing and
our global computer networks mean that Ford in Europe can share skills and
solutions between teams located in different countries.
This approach is indeed - as you point out - different from the one used by
many of our competitors.
Most - especially the Japanese - do all their basic design and engineering
in their country of origin, but are increasingly turning to overseas groups
to help adapt the central design for local market conditions.
Ours is a different philosophy. Ford believes that the excellent engineering
resources that it has in different countries, and on different continents,
can be a source of strength.
It is perhaps significant that Ford's European design team, located in
Britain and Germany, is leading the 'world car' project that within the next
few years will lead to the replacement of the North American Ford Tempo and
Mercury Topaz, as well as the European Sierra.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: BICC's role in development of semiconductor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M R TUBBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'GEC breakthrough improves prospects for
superconductors' (February 26), your science editor gives the impression
that the discovery of a new high temperature semiconductor was a General
Electric Company development.
The discovery was, in fact, the work of a joint team of BICC and GEC
engineers and has been patented jointly by BICC and GEC researchers.
Both companies are members of a European Community collaborative project on
superconductivity which also includes Asea Brown Boveri, Alcatel Cable,
Pirelli Cavi and Siemens.
BICC is co-ordinating a related EC techno-economic study of the applications
of superconductors, particularly for power cables.
BICC also funds, with the fellowship of engineering, a senior research
fellowship at the University of Cambridge in superconductivity.
Among other results, this has led to an improved high temperature
superconductor showing superconductivity at -145 deg C.

FT  05 MAR 92 / A better road to freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), passed something of a milestone.
Nearly 23 years after beginning a terrorist war to 'free' the Basque country
from Spain, it killed its 700th Spaniard in Madrid.
ETA has killed 271 civilians, 26 of whom have been children or teenagers.
This year alone, its bombers and pistoleros have killed 15 people, in an
accelerating attempt to frighten the Spanish government into negotiating to
ensure calm for this year's festivities: the Olympics in Barcelona and the
Universal Exposition in Seville.
Sensibly, the government has done no such thing, though it is always alert
to any cracks it might exploit in the wall of separatist fanaticism it finds
among ETA prisoners, the operating leadership which hides in France, and the
spread of support organisations in the Basque country, including the
political party, Herri Batasuna.
Occasionally, a senior Herri Batasuna figure will peel off from the fight;
sometimes a prisoner decides to leave the cause and is 're-inserted' into
society. Dozens of ETA leaders are being picked up in France and Spain.
But the killing continues and Herri Batasuna has a firm hold on 15 per cent
of the Basque vote. For any Spanish government, it must be a tiring
struggle.
It has been perhaps most depressing for Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and
his Socialist party, in power since October 1982. Many of its political and
trade union leaders, drawn from the Basque country, genuinely believed that
under enlightened liberal rule from Madrid, Basque separatist terrorism
would wither and die.
The Basque country is, probably, the most truly autonomous region in the
European Community. Its three provinces collect all their own taxes. It has
its own police force. Its obscure and difficult language is taught in
schools and universities despite the fact that fewer and fewer Basques wish
to learn it. Central government subsidies have kept alive the region's
dilapidated steel and en-gineering industries.
In Spain, Basques control some of the land's biggest business and banking
empires. The Basque country itself is a glorious place. Its chefs are
probably the best in Europe. San Sebastian, its second city, is one of the
most beautiful. Its alpine countryside is a breathtaking relief from the
arid meseta at the centre of Spain.
It is easy to understand why Basques love their country. They all do, and
they are almost all nationalists. But a small and determined group continues
to kill and maim for it.
Few countries would have been able to respond to this violence with the
maturity shown by Spain. It quite reasonably considers the Basque country to
be an integral part of its territory and has refused to bend to the
provincial and anachronistic arguments for separation that draw - as do most
such causes - on dreams of recreating history before the birth of modern
nation states.
Madrid does not expect anyone else to fight its battle for the hearts and
minds of the Basques, but somehow the issue needs to be broadened. ETA's war
is not of much concern to the rest of the world, but it remains a serious
threat - probably the only threat - to a liberal and respected democracy.
Somehow, ETA's supporters need to know that violence will not be rewarded
and that violent separation from Spain means exclusion from the political
and economic communities Spain already belongs to.
Members of ETA are highly motivated and well-organised. They draw morale and
political sustenance from the Basque public that regularly votes for Herri
Batasuna. It is time Spain's friends and neighbours began to speak to those
voters before the Basque country becomes a European problem closer to the
heart of the continent than Northern Ireland.
This does not excuse Madrid from doing everything possible to find its own
political solution. But the narrow Basque gaze needs to be shifted from
Madrid to the wider European stage.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Modern plumbing for a shaken house / Assessing the reforms
at Salomon, the US securities firm brought low by scandal last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Deryck Maughan, the softly spoken Englishman catapulted into running
Salomon Brothers, the scandal-stricken US securities firm, simply calls it
'a tremendous amount of sewer and pipeline work'.
It is a classic understatement. For what Mr Maughan is talking about is
nothing less than reforming the management systems of one of Wall Street's
biggest firms - including tackling the sensitive issue of pay.
Furthermore, the overhaul of Salomon's plumbing has been largely carried out
in just four months, in the shadow of a bond trading scandal which came
close to destroying the business, and which may yet cause it serious harm.
Crisis management does not come much tougher.
When Salomon's new management team of Mr Warren Buffett, interim chairman,
and Mr Maughan, chief operating officer, took over last August they faced
three main challenges.
The first, accomplished with some deft financial footwork and delicate
politicking, was to prevent a liquidity crisis which could have bankrupted
the firm.
The second was to regain a reputation for honest dealing. This had been
shattered by the revelations that Mr Paul Mozer, the firm's senior bond
trader, had faked orders at US Treasury bond auctions; worse, Salomon's
former management, led by Mr John Gutfreund, its ousted chairman, had failed
to report Mr Mozer to the authorities when it discovered his wrongdoing.
The third, much more complex, challenge was to shake up Salomon's management
systems and improve the basic profitability of its businesses without
further damaging the group's shaken morale. On this the jury is still out.
Many securities firms are prone to weak management. But it is now clear that
even by Wall Street's standards, the management systems at the old Salomon
were poor and promoted intrigue, indecision and croneyism.
Mr Gutfreund, the man once dubbed 'The King of Wall Street' by BusinessWeek
magazine, presided over a structure resembling a mediaeval court. Charming,
contemptuous and and ruthless by turns, he had built Salomon up from a US
bond trading business into a leading integrated global securities house.
Mr Gutfreund devolved power onto a group of independent fiefdoms, each
running a main business line, but made sure their leaders remained dependent
on his patronage. For example, department managers had overlapping
responsibilities, making it unclear who was responsible for what - a
situation Mr Gutfreund reportedly seemed to encourage.
Nor was there a modern budgeting system, with revenue and expense targets
coherently defined for departments at the start of the year. 'The game was
allocate the expense and see if anyone objects,' Mr Maughan recently
admitted.
The link between pay and performance was also weak, with the allocation of
bonuses depending substantially on a individual's relationship with Mr
Gutfreund and Mr Tom Strauss, his deputy.
In 1990, a year when operating profits were flat, the wage bill leaped by
Dollars 120m (which at the time prompted an unsuccessful and secret
boardroom revolt by Mr Buffett in his capacity as a non-executive director).
It was a system lacking accountability, guaranteed to create strife, and
perilously dependent on strong central leadership. That, say insiders, is
what it increasingly lacked: both Mr Gutfreund and Mr Strauss tended to
procrastinate over difficult decisions, and the former became increasingly
remote from day-to-day operations.
Reform has been left by the hands-off Mr Buffett largely to Mr Maughan. A
44-year-old coal miner's son who once worked in the British Treasury, he
joined Salomon in 1983 and made his name running its highly successful
Japanese operations. He had only been back in New York a few months, as
co-head of investment banking, when the scandal broke.
One of his most basic reforms has been to make clear just which managers are
responsible for what businesses. The starting point has been to define
Salomon as a series of global product lines. One, for example, deals in US
fixed income securities, another in Japanese equities.
Next, Salomon needed to decide which centre should have responsibility for
these operations. For example, should someone trading Japanese warrants in
London report to an executive in the British capital, New York or Tokyo? The
old Salomon, in common with some of its Wall Street rivals, had always
fudged this issue.
Now, the Japanese warrant trader would report to a London manager on a
day-to-day basis, but the strategic direction of his business and his pay
would be set in Japan. This is because the businesses dealing in Asian
securities will now be run out of Japan, European ones out of London, and US
securities out of New York, which is also the centre for the global
investment banking business.
With business units more clearly defined, Mr Maughan has also been able to
draw up revenue and expense targets for each, as well as making pay much
more closely related to a department's performance.
The reshaping of compensation began last autumn, when Dollars 110m
previously allocated for bonuses was clawed back, making 1991's total wage
bill rather smaller than 1990's - even though profits rose by two-thirds.
This year, the firm is implementing a new wages and bonuses system. Each
department has been guaranteed a minimum pool of money, substantially lower
than last year's pay packet, but it can earn much more if it exceeds its
revenue targets. A much higher proportion of bonuses will be paid out as
Salomon stock, to link an individual's interests more closely with those of
the company.
These changes in pay have caused unrest and numerous defections. Apparently
unnerved by the departures, in January the firm offered pay guarantees to
six members of its US equity research department to prevent them quitting -
breaking its own ban on such ironclad offers.
Staff unrest has been exacerbated by the Buffett/Maughan changes in
Salomon's business mix, for in an attempt to boost profits they have made
made cuts in parts of its two weakest areas, equities and investment
banking, which the Gutfreund regime was prepared to subsidise from bond
trading activities.
In equities, Salomon has abandoned speculative proprietary trading, which
means it no longer takes large shareholdings for itself in US stocks in the
hope of making a profit. It now admits this business was unprofitable and
absorbed too much capital.
In investment banking, some 50 staff have been trimmed across the board,
most notably in real estate, where about 20 out of 40 jobs have gone - a
troubled area for all Wall Street. However, many of these cuts were planned
before the scandal broke, because of market changes.
The cuts have led to accusations from departing employees that Salomon is
abandoning its commitment both to equities and investment banking,
retreating to its origins in bond trading. This is a serious charge to level
against a company which aims to be one of a handful of integrated global
securities houses, a role which demands a strong presence in all three
areas.
Salomon's leaders insist it is quite wrong. 'It is unthinkable that we would
come out of the investment banking business,' says Mr Maughan. 'It is
unthinkable we would give up underwriting.' What Salomon is simply trying to
do, he says, is manage these businesses better. The firm insists it is
adding to its equity research and distribution capabilities.
Nevertheless, it is ironic that both equities and investment banking have
suffered far more from the bond trading scandal than the department which
caused it. This is not just because of the cuts. Their trading operations
have also been hit hard.
For while companies have continued using Salomon for bond issues, they have
been reluctant to give it the lead management of sensitive equity
underwritings or takeover advisory work while the firm is still under
government investigation.
In US equity underwriting - normally an extremely profitable operation  -
Salomon slipped from fifth in the Wall Street league table in the first
eight months of last year to ninth position in the August 1991-January 1992
period.
This was reflected in Salomon Brothers' minuscule Dollars 27m fourth quarter
pre-tax profits - at a time when the rest of Wall Street was making hay.
(Parent Salomon Inc, which includes its Phibro Energy business, had a
Dollars 29m net loss.)
Salomon's rivals are predicting that the firm, Wall Street's former bully
boy, will emerge from the crisis a mere shadow of its former self, both in
terms of business scope and that elusive, but vital, ingredient for a
successful securities firm - group morale.
'Buffett has gone too far,' opines a top executive at another leading Wall
Street house. 'He's talked down the company to the point where many of its
young people, who were just doing their job, have got the impression he
doesn't value what they have accomplished.'
But the doom-mongering involves a degree of wishful thinking. For one thing,
Salomon retains enormous clout in global capital markets, with one of the
leading positions in debt and equity underwriting. For another, the reforms
now being put in place could allow the firm to emerge from the crisis a
better managed and possibly more profitable business.
Nevertheless, the firm still has to pay the price for its misdeeds. It is in
negotiations with the government over a settlement, will at least be fined
heavily, and has taken a Dollars 200m charge against earnings to cover this
and a host of private lawsuits.
Less certain is the scope of any government sanctions. It seems unlikely
that Salomon will be barred completely from Treasury auctions. However, a
ban imposed in August on it bidding at auction for its customers (it can
still bid for itself) could be extended.
The key questions facing the firm now are how quickly the government will
decide on its punishment; whether this, coupled with the management
upheavals, will sap staff morale much further; and whether it will win back
lost clients and improve its earnings.
Despite Wall Street's recruiting efforts, Salomon has not lost too many big
names so far. But it recently had to hand over large payments to senior
executives in a special deferred compensation programme devised by Mr
Gutfreund. This has loosened the 'golden handcuffs' tieing many to the firm,
and is already adding to the outflow.
Another uncertainty is whether the new, squeaky-clean Salomon will be quite
as willing to take the aggressive risks with positions in the bond and
derivatives markets that were the life-blood of the old firm. Senior
executives insist it will, pointing out that its capital base is still the
biggest on Wall Street. Outsiders remain dubious.
Mr Buffett, echoing the great banker J P Morgan, declares that Salomon's
goal is to do 'first-class business . . . in a first-class way'. But might
this lead the firm to pull its punches? After all, Mr Buffett is also on
record as saying that 'if you want to make money, go to Wall Street and hold
your nose'.
Striking the right balance may not be easy, though the installation of a
modern plumbing system should at least keep more nasty odours at bay.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Bosnia must be saved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT THE civil war in Croatia, the central Yugoslav republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina managed to stay on the side-lines. It was not easy.
Whenever federal units withdrew from Croatia, they were transferred to
Bosnia. As a result, this ethnically mixed republic of Moslems, Serbs and
Croats has one of Europe's largest armies stationed on its territory.
Moreover, this army is perceived as an ally of Serbia, and could be called
upon to fight on the side of the Serbs if Bosnia's turn for full-scale civil
war, far bloodier than that in Croatia, cannot be avoided. In addition, the
governments of Croatia and Serbia have repeatedly said parts of Bosnia
should be annexed to their respective republics. If both claims were
satisfied, little or no territory would be left for the Moslems, the largest
ethnic group, who make up 43 per cent of the population.
Fears of such a partition or civil war have prompted the Bosnian government
to adopt three measures. It has assured all citizens of the republic that
their ethnic, cultural and political rights will be respected. It has
guaranteed that the army will be housed and paid. And, on the recommendation
of the European Community, it held a referendum on independence last
weekend. The hope was that the outcome of the referendum would finally
establish the republic's status, and bring stability. Alas, not so.
Serbs' boycott
The Serbs - one third of the population - boycotted the referendum,
contesting the right of the other two communities to split them from their
cousins in Serbia and force them to join a new state. For their part,
Moslems and Croats overwhelmingly voted for independence. Once the result
was known, armed Serbs threw up barricades around Sarajevo, the capital.
Several people were killed. In the north of the republic, where Serbs have
established an autonomous region, Croats and Serbs have already been
fighting each other.
Rather than risk plunging the republic into civil war, the Bosnian
government earlier this week made some concessions to the Serbs, promising
them more access to the media and more representation in the police. But it
also appealed to the EC again for recognition.
The EC is faced with a difficult choice. If it recognises the new state it
may fire the starting-gun for civil war, since Serb leaders have said they
will fight rather than live in an independent Bosnia. But if it delays
recognition, it will be perceived as yielding to Serbian intimidation. More
worrying, delay is likely to radicalise the Moslems, and encourage
nationalist Croats to seek unity with Croatia.
Territorial integrity
Independence for Bosnia will be meaningless unless the territorial integrity
of the republic can be guaranteed. Therefore the EC, if it goes ahead with
recognition, must serve notice that it will not countenance claims on
Bosnian territory by either Croatia or Serbia. And it must send a clear
warning to Serbia that the Bosnian Serbs should not be encouraged, still
less materially aided, in any attempt to thwart by force the expressed wish
of the majority of the republic's citizens. It should be clear to Serbia's
leaders that interference in Bosnia will delay the lifting of EC sanctions
against Serbia.
The EC peace conference on Yugoslavia has already set up a committee aimed
at reaching consensus among all the ethnic groups in Bosnia. This should be
convened immediately with the aim of assuring the republic's Serbs that they
will not face any discrimination, and of trying to stop the violence.
Meanwhile, the UN peacekeeping troops should be sent as soon as possible to
Sarajevo, which has been designated as their headquarters. Although their
mandate is to keep the peace in Croatia, their presence in Bosnia should
help to discourage violence there. Serbia must realise that escalating the
tension in Bosnia will only delay the deployment of UN troops to protect the
Serbs in Croatia.
In short, the UN as peace-keeper and the EC as peacemaker must continue to
work in parallel. The barricades in Sarajevo should not deter either from
acting quickly.

All that remains is for FTAT, the furniture union, to join forces with MSF

Still on the subject of big wheels and their revolving spokespersons,
eyebrows will be raised by Sir Alastair Morton's latest Eurotunnel recruit.
John Noulton, a former under secretary at the department of trade, is
deserting Transmanche-Link, where he was administration director, to be
Eurotunnel's latest director of public affairs. Will this exacerbate the
already frosty relations between the two sides of the project, or help heal
the split? At least Noulton should be able to stand up to the abrasive
Morton and it could enhance the chances of an amicable settlement.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Observer: Fourth attempt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Jacques Attali finally met his match? Barbara Ann Clay, formerly public
affairs director at the US Treasury, is the fourth person to accept what
many outsiders regard as a pretty thankless task: handling relations between
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's president and the
outside world.
Her immediate predecessor Graham Watson walked out after mere months because
he couldn't work with Attali, so was she not a little uneasy?
The 37-year-old Clay is too shrewd a political cookie to be drawn into that
sort of debate. Having run a restaurant on New York's Long Island for five
years, she has had more than her fair share of difficult customers.
Her political training started when she followed President Reagan into the
White House in 1981 as an unpaid intern. Ending up as press secretary to
several directors of the Office of Management and Budget, she should know
how to deal with intelligent men with big egos.
The fact that she was David Mulford's press secretary at the US Treasury
inevitably raises a suspicion that the Americans have put in another of
their own to keep an eye on Attali's grand ideas. But Clay, whose French is
'not as good as it should be', firmly denies it.
Even so, noting that her degree from the State University of New York at
Oneonta is in theatre, Observer would love to be backstage when she and her
new employer have their first big row.

Metal Bulletin's chairman Trevor Tarring is clearly chuffed with the way his
company is bucking industry trends and reporting higher profits.
Nevertheless, he is concerned that Emap, which has picked up a 20 per cent
stake, might launch a full takeover bid.
Emap paid a substantial premium over market prices for its shares and
Tarring observes 'it is unfortunate that it required transactions of this
nature to persuade the stock market that the valuation placed on our shares
a year ago was so far out of line with their intrinsic worth. Even the 200p
a share Emap paid was not a serious reflection of the value of MB.'
In that case, why did Tarring sell some of his MB shares last year?
'My wife wanted a swimming pool,' he says with a resigned shrug of the
shoulders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What did Britain's Royal Navy reject as 'a low class of weapon, underhand,
unfair and un-English'? The sub- marine, of course, on first being offered
one by the legendary arms dealer Basil Zaharoff.
Observer is indebted for the quotation to Vickers' managing director Sir
Colin Chandler, whose memory has been jogged by today's launching of the
UK's first Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard. Like the vessel's now
independent builders VSEL, Zaharoff once belonged to the Vickers group; he
was its chief agent from the turn of the century until the inter-war years.
The submarines he was flogging in the 1880s, however, were Swedish-designed.
Although spurned by the RN, he persuaded the Greeks to pay Pounds 9,000 for
one which, despite its refusal to work properly, scared the Turks into
buying two. Whereupon the super-salesman wrote to the Russians suggesting
that, as a great power, they needed at least four.
'Needless to say, the Russians fell for it,' Chandler told an Edinburgh
University meeting last night, before adding:
'There is no record of Zaharoff having sold submarines to Switzerland. But,
then, the Swiss were always a secretive people.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However many miles they may have clocked up in cars loaned by manufacturers,
the world's motoring journalists have never been taken for a smoother ride
than by Volkswagen's Carl Hahn at VW's press dinner in Geneva.
Speculation has been raging for weeks about who will succeed him as chairman
of the management board of Europe's biggest car-maker. While pole position
was held by former French academic Daniel Goeudevert, board chairman of the
Volkswagen division, he has evidently been overhauled by engineer Ferdinand
Piech, head of VW's Audi subsidiary and a family shareholder in troubled
Porsche.
Despite his reticent public manner, the latest betting rates Piech as the
narrow favourite to be Hahn's replacement.
Hence an audible high-revving of interest among the banqueting hacks when,
after reciting the familiar list of the group's achievements, Hahn declared:
'Now let's come to talk about the successor,' and paused pregnantly before
continuing:
'The successor of the Golf II, the Golf III, is proving an outstanding
success. The successor must always be better than the predecessor and that
must be the case in the future too, and not only for cars.'

Can you bring yourself to watch the first episode of The Big One on C4? This
new comedy series with Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig (whose name, like
Trebor, should surely be read backwards) has been so insistently trailed
that I have already developed a mild hostility towards it. McShane and
Givskot are known from 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', the improvisation show
from which an endless succession of very variable comedies is spinning off.
She is the small, very funny, one and he is big and rather less funny. In
The Big One he plays a successful and tidy American writer who comes to stay
with her, the unusccessful and untidy English writer (8.30). That is
followed by the opening episode of a 4-part adaptation of Mary Wesley's
English family saga The Camomile Lawn (9.00). It follows the fortunes of
five cousins, from the summer of 1939 when they gather on the lawn behind
their aunt's Cornish house, to 1984. Paul Eddington and Felicity Kendal star
and the direction is by Peter Hall.
The last in BBC2's interesting, if patchy, documentary series about Spain,
Fire In The Blood looks at Barcelona, one of Europe's most fashionable
cities, and the venue for the 1992 Olympic games.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: Ann-Christine Goransson - Purcell Room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This 25-year-old Swedish 'soprano' won the 1991 BP Peter Pears Award, and
her recital on Tuesday made it perfectly clear why. She wields her voice
with entrancing ease and naturalness; it is warm, true, unaffected and
communicative, an unalloyed pleasure to hear. Obviously she has a promising
future, but precisely which remains to be discovered. This small-hall
recital hinted continually at a broader scale which she was careful not to
unleash.
It might well be opera - or even musical comedy: her generous personality
could be hugely successful in the latter. Since she had changed her
announced programme, replacing Wolf and Mahler with Schumann's 'Mignon'
songs after Goethe and lighter stuff by Poulenc, Walton, Grieg and Ture
Rangstrom, we could only guess at her full dramatic range. It was noticeable
that in the higher soprano register she touched her notes in at a sweet,
precise mezza voce, whereas her ample mid-voice revelled in expansive
character. To me she sounded like a distinctive mezzo-in-the-making, with
the bonus of a fine upper extension.
In Mozart's aria 'Al desio' (K. 577, composed as a substitute for Susanna's
'Deh vieni' in Figaro) neither she nor her bright young accompanist Mikael
Kjellgren was quite convincing: Kjellgren was inadvertently strident -
victim to the Purcell Room acoustic, which wrong-foots many a new pianist -
and Miss Goransson too modern-colloquial for this poised rondo. She was
appealing in her Schumann set, but preferred to capture the general moods
(very well) instead of lighting them up word-by-word as they deserve.
Barber's wry, shapely Hermit Songs struck much nearer to the bone. Though
Miss Goransson's English may still be a tad foreign, she palpably thinks in
it, whereas she left Schumann's Goethe lyrics over-smooth and
under-articulated.
Her Poulenc and Duparc carried richer conviction, as did her partner's
contribution. For Walton's three Sitwell numbers (the latter two adapted
from Facade) she found exactly the right teasing, playful address, even
without the benefit of native diction, and in her Scandinavian songs she was
buoyantly at home. By then nobody could have doubted that hers is a voice to
fill much larger halls, as surely it will do: heartwarmingly candid and
direct, faithfully musical. One day soon somebody will find Miss Goransson a
slot where she can expand to her best, and she will make a lot more
music-lovers very happy.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: 'King Roger' in Palermo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER

<TEXT>
Years ago Andrew Porter wrote of Karol Szymanowski's opera King Roger that
'Enthusiasts will travel hundreds, thousands of miles to attend the rare
performances' of the piece. Even an ordinary opera-lover, unfamiliar with
the Polish composer's virtually unknown sole, full length opera, might have
found it worth a trip to Palermo last month where he could have heard not
only a more-than-respectable performance of the piece but also could have
seen the city that largely inspired it.
Like so many Northern artists, Szymanowski loved Southern Italy, and Sicily
in particular, seeing the sensual, scented island as a Dionysian antidote to
his cold, stern, inhibited homeland. In choosing the Norman king Roger II as
their emblematic hero, Szymanowski and his librettist Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz
gave themselves ample occasion to surround the intimate conflict of the
introspective king with Byzantine colour and pagan solarity.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: Momix - Sadler's Wells Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A hundred years ago the American performer Loie Fuller took Paris by storm.
Her work was a phantasmagoria of lighting, fabric and music; and she, moving
at the centre of the picture, seemed to keep transforming herself. She was a
butterfly, an orchid, a flame: illusion upon illusion. Several people noted
that, strictly speaking, she was not a dancer - but that hardly mattered.
She was taken seriously, won high praise from Mallarme and became a living
icon of Art Nouveau.
The two American groups Pilobolus and Momix look nothing like her or like
Art Nouveau but, mutatis mutandis, they are her spiritual heirs. Image
succeeds image with happy fecundity. The performers create one illusion
after another by means of skilled movement assisted by light, sound and
sometimes props. Frequent metamorphosis is a key part of the Pilobolus/Momix
experience. The movement of either troupe is a lyrical form of athleticism,
and is like little else in dance, mime or theatre.
Pilobolus is the parent group, founded over 20 years ago; Momix was launched
10 years later by a founder-Pilobolan, Moses Pendleton, who is still its
director. On either side of the Atlantic, both have always polarised critics
who on most other subjects are in concord. Audiences, however, have seldom
failed to acclaim either company warmly.
Of the two troupes, it is Pilobolus that at its best provides the purer and
more transporting experience. Momix's current 70-minute show, Passion, is
blighted by numerous tacky features and I have never watched work by either
company with such conflicting feelings as on this occasion. On the one side
there is delight in five superb performers and the streams of changing
images that they supply. On the other is resentment at having to watch that
through a gauze on which is projected further imagery, often ironic or
irrelevant; and my rejection of the muzak.
Passion is a misnomer. Its imagery is by turns zoological, botanical,
primitive, exotic and even religious. Much of the time we are watching those
animal and/or vegetable episodes that have always been the marvel of
Pilobolus/Momix theatre. A man squats like an animal and spins his head and
neck round in circles like a ball-and-chain. This signal brings on another
like-spirited male animal. Now they move like amphibians, now like amoeba -
and suddenly from all fours they are jumping high into the air, like
crickets. Funny, surprising, supple, yes. But what is finest here and often
elsewhere in Passion is the pervasive lyricism of the movement.
In the most impassioned scene, one near-nude man hangs in a trapeze,
radiantly spreadeagled like a Renaissance diagram of human geometry. Then he
starts to fold and fall, hanging now like a sinner at the Last Judgment and
calling in silent pain. Two other characters, robed and hooded in scarlet
(devils? cardinals?), spin brilliantly on either side as if in waiting.
Clasping their hands in prayer, they look sanctimonious; and next they try
to catch him; no, next he tries to catch them. A sinner and the prelates of
the church? or Faust and a pair of devils? The scene has a marvellous
ambiguity.
Meanwhile, however, superimposed over the episodes of Passion are pictures
of a flower or a brain or a tree or a pearl necklace or a Renaissance lady.
The eponymous muzak by Peter Gabriel (now a boys' choir, now pop baroque,
now rock-Indian) encourages the impression that Passion is just a druggy
dream-trip without coherence. What is good about Momix seems thrillingly
natural. But here it has been manipulated by charlatans.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Small company reports judged not so
beautiful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a well-attended meeting in the cavernous Old Library of the Guildhall one
morning last week, a large crowd of City luminaries gathered in
anticipation.
Among them were anxious company directors eager to hear who would receive
the annual award for published accounts, sponsored by the Stock Exchange,
and the institutes of chartered accountants in England, Wales, Scotland and
Ireland.
Which company would take the place of BOC Group, the UK industrial gases and
healthcare concern, the winner in the larger company category in 1991?
Which would inherit the separate title among smaller companies (with net
assets not exceeding Pounds 50m) from Nestor-BNA, the healthcare and
specialist personnel group?
Few except the judges and one of the winning companies - which had brought
along large numbers of its annual report for distribution - knew of the
decision.
It was the chairman of J Sainsbury, the retailer, who stepped forward to
accept the first award.
The spotlight, however, quickly moved to the other award. A small note at
the bottom of the official programme explained that it would not, in fact,
be given out this year. Mr Richard Sykes, QC, the chairman of the judges,
felt obliged to explain why in his speech.
Even the Stock Exchange, which is not normally known as an outspoken voice,
took the rather unusual step of accentuating the negative. The first
sentence of its own press release on the ceremony said: 'the co-sponsors . .
. decided to give only one award this year'. This decision, it continued,
was 'unprecedented'.
'I owe you an explanation of why we decided not to make an award in the
small company section,' Mr Sykes told his audience. 'A winner is a report
which I can hold up as an example to others. The fact is that there was no
report in the small company category which achieved that desired and
desirable standard, in the view of the panel.'
'Undoubtedly there were some solid workmanlike reports,' he said.
'Undoubtedly there were some reports which in some areas achieved an
excellent standard. But whenever we began to enthuse about some aspect of a
particular report we were brought back to earth by a failure or inadequacy
in some other aspect.'
Three important elements give the judges' decision an importance that it
might not otherwise have had. First, it is assessed by a reputable panel of
senior individuals from business, accountancy and law. Second, it is
probably the most comprehensive award of its type, covering every annual
report sent to the Stock Exchange. Third, it assesses all aspects of the
report, with a stress on the presentation of financial information. If any
of the current awards for corporate reporting should be taken seriously,
this is probably the one.
The criteria on which the panel's decisions are based are never published.
They are inevitably partly determined by personal attitudes. Nevertheless,
more significant than the whims and subjective assessments which helped the
judges pick out exemplary reports as potential winners is the objective fact
that none of the smaller company reports was thought worthy of consideration
for an award.
More than 2,000 reports - which are monitored as a matter of course by Stock
Exchange staff - were whittled down to an initial list of 300 contenders,
and then a short list of 150, which the 10 judges considered.
Among the companies the shortlist excluded were annual reports which failed
to meet legal obligations, Stock Exchange requirements or accounting
standards. A 1989 amendment to the 1985 companies act has frequently been
overlooked, for example. Section 36A requires a statement in the accounts
that they have been prepared in accordance with accepted accounting
practice. The Financial Reporting Review Panel, the enforcement arm of the
Financial Reporting Council, has written to more than 240 companies for
failing to comply with this requirement.
It is believed that about another 300 of the reports scrutinised by the
Stock Exchange fell down on other information they are legally obliged to
give. This included failure to split details of their turnover and profits
by geographical region, to provide information about non-executive
directors, or to indicate in which countries they operated.
Equally depressing is that few of the remaining companies went much beyond
the statutory minimum in an attempt to provide readers of accounts with
enough information to make the figures meaningful. Mr Sykes said his
criteria for selecting the winner included whether on first impression the
report makes the reader want to read any further, whether it provides an
understanding of the company and its operations and whether its separate
activities are adequately explained.
In addition, he asked his fellow judges to consider if the accounts
adequately explain the numbers, whether the statistics contained are honest,
helpful and consistent, and whether any additional information to help the
reader understand the accounts has been provided.
He stressed that these factors need not be neglected during the recession,
when companies are less likely to spend large sums on hiring design
consultants to help produce their reports. In fact, he criticised some
reports as clearly over-designed.
What the recession may have done is to have discouraged many companies from
being as candid in explaining and illustrating their results as they were
when their performance looked far more healthy during the 1980s.
On the criteria given, Mr Nigel Macdonald, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young who
was one of the judges, certainly argues that there was an undeniable decline
in quality among last year's accounts compared with previous periods. It is
a development he finds depressing.
'If we believe in the market economy,' he says, 'then the performance of
companies is absolutely essential to the proper allocation of resources.
Accounts have their place in that grand scheme of things. Ordinary
shareholders are entitled to a decent briefing.'
He says that aspects of the accounts that appeared particularly weak
included a neglect of ratios such as gearing and return on capital employed;
little explanation of the constituent parts of the business and its future
strategy; and an excessive amount of small print which made the reports
difficult to read.
Above all, he would like to see something more akin to the management
discussion and analysis which is required in US accounts, and which gives
far more detail than its British counterparts on the management of the
company and a commentary on the figures in the accounts.
Those involved in the preparation of accounts might do well to take these
comments seriously. They go beyond the opinions of a few judges on a
particular award. They may well soon be enshrined in future codes of
practice.
As remarks written by Sir Adrian Cadbury for a speech at last week's
ceremony warned, 'the overall standard of financial reporting in Britain has
to be raised'. When his task force on the financial aspects of corporate
governance reports later this year, these thoughts may well be translated
into guidelines of change.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Management: Silent enemy poised for attack / A look at the
threat to Europe from the arrival of US warehouse clubs - Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat posed by US 'warehouse clubs' opening their vast sheds on the
eastern side of the Atlantic has set the European retailing industry
aquiver.
The clubs, dubbed the 'silent enemy' in the US because of their devastating
impact on traditional retailers, sell huge volumes of a narrow range of
goods at deeply-discounted prices from low-cost, edge-of-town outlets, more
than three times the size of the biggest grocery superstores in the UK.
One of the leading warehouse clubs, Costco, which is 20 per cent owned by
Carrefour, the French retailer, looks set to open two stores in the UK
within the next 18 months. Others are rumoured to be keen to follow.
In a study of the potential impact of the entry of these clubs into the UK,
the team of retail analysts at Goldman Sachs, the US securities house,
argues that they could turn 'the retail scene upside-down' within the
decade.
It suggests there is scope for 30 Costco-style warehouse clubs in the UK
generating sales of Pounds 2bn within five to 10 years. This would make the
company one of the dozen biggest retailers in Britain with a knock-on
influence across the entire retail sector.
'The warehouse clubs are hugely-efficient channels of distribution which
just strip cost out of every link in the supply chain,' says Paul Deacon,
retailing analyst at Goldman Sachs, reminiscing fondly about the bargain
price he paid for a canoe at one of the clubs.
He suggests the clubs are able to minimise their costs by running
rudimentary stores in cheap locations, maintaining tight levels of stock,
keeping the wage bill low, having a cash-only payment policy, and limiting
marketing and advertising expenditure. They run on gross margins of around
10 per cent, compared with the 25 per cent enjoyed by traditional
supermarkets in the US.
The clubs have a very high stock-turn (18.8 times a year at the
industry-leading Price Club) and dispense entirely with costly central
distribution networks. Such is the speed with which stock is pushed through
the distribution channel that in many cases the retailer has sold the goods
before paying for them.
The goods for sale are carefully selected: they are almost all high-quality,
top-of-the-range branded goods - about 60 per cent are non-food lines with
40 per cent food.
Price Club sells 2,800 different lines, of which 2,000 are constant and the
rest vary according to the season and what deals the company is able to
negotiate. This 'treasure hunt' element gives the clubs considerable
customer appeal.
The clubs' customers pay an annual membership fee of about Dollars 25.
Typically, two-thirds of members are business customers, such as small
retailers and caterers, who use the clubs as a wholesale outlet; the
remainder are everyday shoppers drawn in by the cheap prices.
The value of the average transaction is very high at Dollars 160. The
warehouse clubs have experienced explosive growth in the US over the past
decade. The industry is dominated by five big and very successful players
which account for Pounds 26.7bn of sales.
Whether any of them can now transfer their trading formula to Europe,
however, remains a matter of doubt.
One of the crucial constraints may be the differing cost structures on each
side of the Atlantic.
In the US, site and building costs are relatively cheap; the higher cost
structure of the European retailing industry may well wreck the economics of
the pure warehouse club format.
In the UK it may boil down to a matter of classification. Goldman Sachs
estimates that if a club were to buy a 12-acre site with permission to open
a retailing operation, it might cost Pounds 24m. A site on an old industrial
estate open only to wholesalers might be just Pounds 3m.
Such differences may lead to a hybrid form of warehouse club being
introduced. The clubs may limit themselves to the wholesale market before
later spreading into a retailing formula. Or they may restrict themselves to
non-food lines and then later broaden into foods.
But the UK wholesaling industry is dismissive of the potential threat and
argues that local operators already fully satisfy the market.
David Poole, managing director of Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash-and-carry
operator which has an annual turnover of more than Pounds 1.3bn, says:
'Costco could not operate more efficiently than we do.'
Alan Toft, director general of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors,
which represents wholesalers in the food and drink industry, even goes so
far as to say that 'there is no way that this form of discount warehouse can
have any impact on wholesaling companies in the UK'.
He argues that small retailers who traditionally patronise cash-and-carry
outlets would not shop at clubs if they saw them as a competitive threat.
'Retailers over here would not be seen dead in a warehouse that serves both
retailers and consumers. The people who should worry about it are Tesco and
Sainsbury,' he says.
That suggestion comes back to the question of whether warehouse clubs could
generate an attractive return on the higher capital investment needed to run
a full retail outlet.
Jane Carmichael, partner at OC&amp;C, the management consultants, suggests it is
only the relative costs that matter. 'All that is relevant is the
differential cost between a Costco and a Sainsbury or a Woolworth,' she
says.
A host of cultural differences may also detract from the clubs' appeal. UK
consumers have largely become accustomed to shopping in posh supermarkets
offering up to 30,000 lines.
Customers simply may not fancy shopping in shabby warehouses, nor buying
big, inconvenient multi-packs of 12 tubes of toothpaste or crates of
petfood.
Such differences in cost, market structures and consumer preferences may
well make the warehouse club formula untenable in Europe.
But given the extraordinary popularity of this style of trading in the US,
it would be unwise for European retailers to discount the threat entirely -
nor underestimate their customers' hunger for bargains.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Management: A fair deal on the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IF IT was going for a song but it won't play a note, where do you stand?'
ask the posters, depicting a sale-tagged radio, which appeared this week in
north-east England.
In its latest campaign to make the consumer rights message less worthy and
more accessible, the Office of Fair Trading is currently running an
experimental Square Deal Week in Tyne and Wear.
All the county's 600,000 households are receiving through their doors a
credit card-sized Consumer Rights card. You are entitled to your money back,
it says, when:
There is a major fault - even on sale goods.
The goods don't do what they are supposed to do.
The goods don't fit their description.
But you are not if:
You've changed your mind.
Clothes don't fit (as long as the correct size is shown).
The goods have been mistreated.
You were able to see the faults before purchase.
You have already accepted a credit note.
The OFT is spending Pounds 250,000 - more than fifth of its total annual
publicity budget - on the promotion. It will be monitoring the impact of the
campaign, its most intensive ever, to see whether it should be launched
elsewhere.
Square Deal Week is the latest example of the OFT's move over the past three
years towards a more populist approach to consumer rights.
Tyne and Wear was chosen for the experiment because of its relatively high
proportion of socio-economic groups C2, D and E, its strong local media and
high concentration of shopping meccas, including Newcastle's city centre
Eldon Square and Gateshead's out of town MetroCentre, the largest of their
types in Europe.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Management: Space may prove the final frontier /
Investigating the intense struggles within the media buying business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is meant to be the year of EC harmonisation. It is also turning out to
be the year when one of the most important, yet overlooked, aspects of
marketing and advertising - the media space-buying business  - may witness
some intense struggles among the biggest European players.
Reports that the French company Publicis, and its partner in Europe, Foote
Cone and Belding, may link with The Media Partnership (TMP) have been around
for many months. TMP negotiates media-buying for a number of traditional
advertising agencies which offer a full range of services, winning discounts
from media owners by bulk-buying large volumes of advertising.
The rumours took flight in February, when there were suggestions that
Publicis-FCB Europe had signed a letter of intent to join TMP. Publicis
executives this week strongly denied that but acknowledged that negotiations
were 'continuing' with TMP.
At the same time Publicis is also considering expanding its media-buying
links with Interpublic, the US group; Publicis and Interpublic use
Publi-Media Service (PMS) in France as their media-buying agency.
The background to this flurry is the growing belief among the larger
full-service agencies that greater, European-wide fragmentation of the forms
and outlets of media, in conjunction with increased concentration of media
ownership, requires an equal concentration of media-buying in order to
ensure the best prices.
Media owners might be controlling bigger empires; but audiences and
readerships are becoming more specialised. There has been an explosion of
European media outlets in the last 20 years. In 1980 there were no satellite
television channels; in 1990 there were 82. The number of radio stations has
more than doubled (to 5,820); consumer magazine titles have increased from
5,400 to 8,240; terrestrial television channels have grown from 15 to 38.
That development offers opportunities for media space-buyers to haggle over
volume prices. As the number of media outlets seeking advertising revenue
has soared, and the general recession has forced collapses in advertising
spending, the jam is being spread more thinly.
Hence the current interest in forming 'media-buying clubs' such as TMP and
PMS, which exist solely to negotiate discounts on volume advertising
expenditure. Media buying is a complex business. But in terms of its impact
on advertising spending budgets, it vital particularly in a recession.
On average, advertisers spend 15 per cent of their advertising budget on
creative work and 85 per cent on the space for their commercials, be they
placed in newspapers, television or radio. Advertisers have already managed
to squeeze down the traditional 15 per cent commission on advertising
budgets they pay for creative work; attacks on the space-buying front are
now the order of the day. That is especially true in France, where Carat
(part of Aegis), PMS, TMP and Eurocom together account for almost 80 per
cent of all media-buying activities.
TMP is but one 'buying club' among several; their sole rationale is to
negotiate better deals for full-service advertising agencies on the basis of
volume. In France today, discounts on the standard advertising rate card of
up to 50 per cent can be wrung from some of the weaker media, such as radio.
There is a growing belief among media-buying agencies that the French model
will spread to the rest of Europe sooner or later. This is not welcomed by
either media owners or media space-buyers, who fear that a valuable product
 -advertising space - is rapidly being turned into a commodity where price
will be the only determining factor. Some advertisers, however, may welcome
such a move; it will force down the cost of advertising, albeit at the risk
of lessening their control as to where and when their commercials run.
It is easy to see which way the wind is blowing; specialist space-buyers and
'buying clubs' accounted for just 11 per cent of all advertising buying in
Europe in 1980; by 1990 that had jumped to 47 per cent. The losers were the
conventional 'full-service' advertising agencies.
Of specialist space-buyers, Carat is dominant in Europe, with 1991 billings
of Dollars 5.2bn. Optimedia, the media-buying wing of Publicis, came 7th
with billings of some Dollars 1.2bn; TMP was fourth with some Dollars 1.4bn;
PMS registered some Dollars 1.3bn. Were Publicis (through PMS and Optimedia)
to join TMP, the new group could leap-frog into second place, still
significantly behind Carat but displacing another powerful media-buying
company, Zenith (part of the Saatchi group). The big guns are being rolled
into position; but howitzers are cumbersome and heavy - it may be a
considerable time before Publicis makes up its mind who will be its best
partner, if at all.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Tireless effort as Mrs Evans generates a deal: The struggle
to finance an electricity project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Anne Evans was not in a champagne mood yesterday. True, the sun was
shining on Wolverhampton and she had just completed a 15-month struggle to
secure financing for the UK's largest non-fossil fuel electricity generating
plant. Rather, she was a trifle wan. It was all a bit of an anti-climax,
said the US businesswoman.
It had been a close-run thing. She told the lawyers in London at 11.20pm on
Tuesday that either everybody signed up or she would walk away from the
Pounds 49m project, which will use about 20 per cent of the UK's scrap
tyres. Come what may, she was catching the 11.40pm train to Wolverhampton.
The agreements were signed.
But the signatures were obtained about a year later than Mrs Evans had
expected. In October 1990 she was talking of a Pounds 36m project on the
site of an old Wolverhampton iron foundry. Now there is Pounds 13m more at
stake - and it is that extra sum which caused a year of difficult
negotiations and a final five days of tetchy discussions.
Mrs Evans's company, Performance Services Corporation of Hebron,
Connecticut, acts as a consultant on the use of scrap tyres in energy
production. The Wolverhampton project, whose company name is Elm Energy,
stems from the Department of Trade and Industry's desire to be rid of a
growing mountain of waste tyres.
Originally the scheme was to have been financed by Pounds 12m of equity and
Pounds 24m of bank borrowings. Final financing is Pounds 14.5m equity and
Pounds 34.5m of debt. So Mrs Evans had to persuade her equity backers to put
up more money, and to persuade the banks to lend more.
The cost escalation came from a number of factors. Finding a contractor
proved difficult. Eventually a consortium of Tarmac of Wolverhampton and
Black &amp; Veatch Engineering of Kansas City agreed to take on construction -
Tarmac for its building expertise, Black &amp; Veatch for its knowledge of plant
mechanics.
Designers then altered the plans to increase the plant's output. This is set
at 25MW, to be sold to Midlands Electricity as power for about 25,000 homes.
Land-reclamation costs rose. Applications for a Pounds 2m reclamation grant
were accepted by the Department of Environment but rejected by the Treasury.
As the costs rose so did Mrs Evans's demands on her US partner, Nipsco
Development, a subsidiary of the Indiana electricity utility. Nipsco had
first agreed to put up Pounds 4m. The amount grew and at the end of last
week the US company threatened to pull out.
The more Nipsco put up as equity, the more Mrs Evans's stake was diluted.
She now has 5 per cent, Nipsco 95 per cent.
The banks were cautious. In the background was concern about the rapidly
changing pattern of environmental regulation, not to speak of more stringent
lending policies.
Mrs Evans said she has a 13-year non-recourse loan at a margin over base
rate, but only after the contractors had been tightly screwed down. They
have a Pounds 38m fixed-price contract with performance guarantees.
Work began yesterday.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Ministers act alone on food label rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to press ahead with its own plans to regulate nutrition
claims on food labels, after losing patience with the European Commission's
failure to issue promised proposals for Community-wide controls.
Mr David MacLean, the food minister, said in a Commons written reply
yesterday that he hoped its decision would influence the commission's
thinking and encourage it to take action soon. Though the government expects
the commission to bar it from introducing its own rules for 12 months,
Whitehall hopes yesterday's announcement will increase pressure on Brussels
to speed up its deliberations.
The EC council of ministers approved two years ago a directive requiring
that food products making nutrition claims, such as 'low-fat' or
'high-fibre', should carry information on their labels about the nutrients
they contain.
The directive is due to take effect in October next year. However, proposals
are still awaited from the commission for firm standards which food
manufacturers would have to meet to justify such nutrition claims.
Three years ago the government accepted recommendations for such standards
by Britain's Food Advisory Committee, a panel of experts which includes food
industry representatives.
However, it suspended further action after the commission said it would
propose EC-wide controls.
The government has now called for comment on the committee's proposals and
says it plans to introduce its own regulations in October next year if there
is still no prospect of EC controls by then.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Minimum wage will be costly, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S proposed minimum wage would raise unemployment by at least 150,000
and add more than Pounds 2.5bn a year to employment costs, the Confederation
of British Industry said yesterday.
The CBI renewed its onslaught on Labour's plans, warning that they
threatened to destroy a number of industries which are already struggling in
the recession.
Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said that a minimum wage would mean
the profits of some sectors were completely wiped out. There was particular
concern about textiles, clothing footwear, tourism and agriculture.
The CBI's criticisms lend some support to the claims from the government
about the impact of a minimum wage, although Mr Michael Howard, the
employment secretary, has said Labour's policy could mean 2m job losses.
A CBI document put to the organisation's council estimated that a minimum
wage would affect up to 3.4m jobs, including most of the 1.1m part-time jobs
created during the last decade.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Further lead case on swaps is settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER of the lead cases in the long-running litigation over
interest-rate-swap agreements has been settled out of court.
Samuel Montagu &amp; Co, the investment arm of Midland Bank, yesterday reached
agreement with Welwyn Hatfield District Council, against which it was
claiming Pounds 1.26m under two swap agreements.
Welwyn has also settled its third party claims for Pounds 181,538 and Pounds
1.06m respectively against the London boroughs of Hackney and Islington.
The terms of the settlements have not been disclosed.
It is the third of the six lead cases to be resolved without a trial. Last
month Samuel Montagu settled with Birmingham City Council, while Barclays
and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its investment banking subsidiary, reached
agreement with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham - in both cases
on undisclosed terms.
Another lead action in which Citicorp Investment Bank is claiming Pounds
521,323 against Sandwell Borough Council is due for trial next Monday. In
third-party proceedings Sandwell is claiming Pounds 269,246 from the London
Borough of Hackney, while Hackney has a claim for interest against the
London Borough of Brent.
The remaining lead cases of Chemical Bank and National Bank of North
Carolina v Hammersmith and Fulham are scheduled to be heard after Easter.
The lead cases were selected because they covered the great majority of the
points of law that arose following the House of Lords' ruling in January
last year that all interest-rate-swap agreements between banks and local
authorities were invalid because they had been outside the councils' legal
powers.
The ruling left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m on transactions
with 130 councils. Their only recourse was to try to recover around a
quarter of their losses by suing councils for the return of funds earned by
writing swap contracts.
The object of selecting lead cases - which are not strictly speaking test
cases as a ruling in one would not be binding on any other - was to try to
give guidance for the remaining cases and avoid multiplicity of litigation.
A consequence of the out-of-court settlements is that such guidance is less
likely to be available to any who are unable to resolve their differences
without going to court.

THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment watchdog,
has asked Imro, the self-regulatory body for fund managers, for a report
explaining how it regulated investment companies owned by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
The move comes as a parliamentary committee prepares to release its report

Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) will bear the brunt of fierce
criticism for regulatory failure.
In particular, SIB wants to know why Imro approved Bishopsgate Investment
Management as an occupational pension scheme member under section 191 of its
rulebook - a section that subjected it to a much looser regulatory regime
than other fund managers. Of Imro's roughly 1,200 members, 170 are in this
category.
Imro had initially intended section 191 to apply only to those trustees who
managed investment business on a day-to-day basis. Eventually the category
was extended to cover fund-management companies owned by the employer or
'any company whose relationship to the scheme was such that Imro felt this
chapter should apply'.
Of the nine directors of BIM, only four were pension-fund trustees and BIM
was not owned by the companies whose pension schemes it managed. Thus, SIB
has asked how Imro saw BIM as a suitable candidate for less stringent rules,
particularly in light of its initial unease about approving the company.
Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, said yesterday in an interview with
the Financial Times that the self-regulatory body is reviewing its
application of section 191 to pension fund managers.
Meanwhile, Mr Morgan called for a new pensions act to clarify the
obligations and duties of trustees and their relationship to investment
business. 'It seems to me that it (a new pensions act) is inescapable,' Mr
Morgan said. 'It is a bit simple-minded to argue that a few good ideas will
solve everything.'
There are signs of growing support within the City and the pensions industry
for new pensions legislation.
In particular, Mr Morgan is urging that a new act should contain reporting
requirements under which trustees would have to report their investment
plans to an independent body, such as the Occupational Pensions Board. These
plans would have to be reviewed by auditors at the end of each year and
their reports be submitted to the OPB. Additionally, he is urging that
beneficiaries have an automatic right to receive reports of trustees,
accountants and actuaries.
Mr Morgan declined to be drawn on whether the government has a moral
responsibility to make restitution to Maxwell company pensioners because its
own regulatory system proved faulty.
Pensioners are pressing for compensation, arguing that IMRO's failure to
supervise BIM properly allowed assets to be siphoned off.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems urge borrowing for
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS yesterday called for a Pounds 6bn increase in public
borrowing for spending on investment to bring Britain out of recession.
Mr Alan Beith, presenting the party's 'alternative Budget', said the
increase was almost certainly greater than the government planned to give
away in tax cuts and extra spending next Tuesday. His package, however, was
a 'prudent' and temporary increase which would feed through more rapidly
into economic growth.
Mr Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, confirmed that extra borrowing
would mean the 1p increase in the basic rate of tax which Liberal Democrats
have warned might be necessary to fund a Pounds 2bn increase in education
spending, would not be needed.
However, the party is set to enter the election pledged to reverse any tax
cuts announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The party's economic strategy seeks to identify it as embracing the private
enterprise spirit of the Tories with the commitment to public investment of
Labour.
Full costings, including a self-financing package of tax rates and child
benefit increases, will be published with the party's election manifesto.
The two-year recovery package unveiled yesterday includes a freeze on the
Uniform Business Rate and equalisation between UBR rates in Scotland,
England and Wales. Capital spending on schools, hospitals, housing and
transport would total Pounds 3bn. A further Pounds 1bn would be devoted to
training.
Mr Beith said UK public borrowing compared favourably with other European
countries and 'a significantly higher level of borrowing at the moment ought
not to be an anxiety'. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)
increases he planned were not inconsistent with the economic convergence
targets in last December's Maastricht treaty between EC nations.

Support for the Conservative party in Scotland has fallen, according to an
opinion poll which shows strong backing for the Scottish National party but
a decline in support for Scottish independence.
The poll, by Market Research Scotland for Grampian Television and the
Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal, put support for the Conservative party at 18 per
cent, compared with 21 per cent earlier in the month. Labour was down two
points at 39 per cent, the SNP up one point at 30 per cent and the Liberal

network
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE world's biggest airline booking networks is due to be set up
today by the merger of Galileo, owned by a consortium of European airlines,
and Apollo, ultimately controlled by United Airlines, one of the top two US
carriers.
United will be the single biggest shareholder in the new entity with a stake
of about 38 per cent. British Airways is the next biggest shareholder with
14 per cent and Swissair is third.
Apollo and Galileo have had close links for several years. Several European
and US airlines have direct and indirect stakes in both. Covia, the holding
company for Apollo, estimates 'a 90 per cent overlap in ownership' since
1988 when United Airlines sold half its 100 per cent stake to other
airlines.
The merger follows pressure for booking systems to be distanced from
individual airlines. It was feared tickets from one airline could be
promoted through booking systems.
The new company will develop a single database for all the world's air
routes.

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt's the best we've got, so don't junk
it, says new ITC chief - 'Old Ugly is better than Old Nothing.'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DON Newquist, the new chairman of the US International Trade Commission
(ITC), is not a fan of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) but
has nevertheless concluded that 'Old Ugly is better than Old Nothing'.
(Texan-to-English translation: 'The current international trading system is
preferable to no system.')
'I see the Gatt as unwieldy, ineffective, and I damn sure wouldn't want my
money at risk in that type of decision-making environment,' he said. 'Even
saying that, it's the best you got. Don't junk it.'
Nor does the former Texas businessman much like the reforms proposed by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general: 'If I were a member of Congress, I'd
be seriously concerned about turning over the administration of my trade
laws to an international bureaucrat in Geneva. In fact, I wouldn't do it]'
The ITC is the independent agency designated to rule on complaints by US
businesses which believe that they have been injured by imports. It is
supposed to be both non-partisan and non-political. Commissioners serve
nine-year terms; no more than three of the six members can be from one
political party.
Mr Newquist is the first Democrat chairman since Mrs Paula Stern served from
1984-86. The Republican Reagan and Bush administrations ignored the
legislative intent by appointing 'independents' thought to be free-traders
and as few Democrats as possible.
The new chairman calls himself 'Texas all the way'. He was born there in
1943, growing up in a Swedish Lutheran community. Living on a farm
concentrated his mind on getting a job in town.
He attended college in Texas, served in Vietnam, and progressed in his
business career mostly in Texas, until he asked Texan Senator Lloyd Bentsen
for a job in Washington.
Mr Bentsen is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which holds
jurisdiction over trade matters; so, in 1988, Mr Newquist ended up at the
ITC, an agency of which he had not heard until he had come to the capital
with a group of oil industry lobbyists.
He still seems a stranger in the world of 'dumping margins,' 'de minimus'
and 'culmination', acknowledging he relies heavily on his staff in legal
matters.
Mr Newquist is intensely interested in the politics of trade, and the talk
ranges from the North American Free Trade Agreement (which, like most other
Texans, he favours strongly) to Gatt Plus (a proposal by Senator Bentsen for
those countries which want to sign up for stronger trade rules than are
agreed in Gatt). He favours 'levelling the playing field' for US companies
which have to bear the burden of environmental costs.
Mr Bentsen said he recommended Mr Newquist for a commission seat to provide
a business angle. Mrs Stern says it is 'valuable' to have someone on the
board who knows how a company's fortunes can depend on ITC decisions.
Mr Newquist tends to vote for domestic industries rather than against them.
Mrs Stern said that under the Reagan and Bush administrations, trade was
politicised, relief being granted to industries only when politically
expedient. This signalled the White House would only act 'when kicked'.
Ultimately, Senator Bentsen refused to approve any presidential appointees
until Mr Bush nominated a Democrat chairman and ensured three members from
each of the two parties. Now, Mr Newquist hopes to promote more open debate.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the US electrical and plastics conglomerate, is expanding
its business in India in moves seen as reflecting a more optimistic
assessment of India's prospects by foreign investors.
The group said yesterday it had committed Rs1bn (Pounds 21m) fresh equity
capital this year to new joint ventures in India in electrical appliances,
medical systems, engineering plastics and lighting.
GE is also discussing tie-ups with Indian public-sector companies to make
defence, aerospace and transport equipment. It is bidding to build, own and
operate a 800-900MW power station for Delhi.
'The potential of expansion (in India) over the next 10 years is
unequalled,' said Mr Paola Fresco, senior vice-president (international) in
New Delhi yesterday. Similar opportunities could only be found in south-east
Asia and Mexico.
GE's increased commitment to India could provide a catalyst for other
foreign investors, as had GE's entry into Hungary with the collapse of
communism there.
GE is taking a 40 per cent stake in a tie-up with Godrej and Boyce, the
Indian consumer appliances company, to make washing machines, refrigerators
and compressors, for the Indian market and abroad through GE's sales
network. GE will contribute its share of the Rs1.2bn equity in fresh foreign
funds for a new plant at Malanpur in Madhya Pradesh. Godrej will make its
contribution through transfer of existing plant.
Other new ventures include: a 50/50 joint venture with the state-owned
Indian Petrochemicals Corporation to make engineering plastics for the
electronics, automotive and appliance industries, involving equity capital
of Dollars 36m (Pounds 20.4m); and a venture with Wipro, the Indian
electronics company, to make medical systems with the two sides sharing the
Dollars 10m equity capital.
GE is also involved in talks with two of India's biggest public-sector
corporations over licensing agreements in aersopace, defence and locomotive
technology. In the defence sector, it has been discussing with Bharat Heavy
Electricals the licensing of digital tank turret drives and tank gunner
simulators.

<TEXT>
KUWAIT has awarded Foster Wheeler of the US a contract worth an estimated
Dollars 47m (Pounds 26.7m) to manage refurbishment of its three war-damaged
oil refineries.
The contract is the first formally awarded to repair the Mina Abdullah, Mina
al Ahmadi and Shuaiba refineries, where early ad hoc repairs have so far
been undertaken under the auspices of Bechtel of California.
Foster Wheeler, which beat strong competition from Fluor Daniel and Brown &amp;
Root to win the deal, will undertake detailed damage assessment and offer
consultancy services for overall repair of the three plants, an exercise
expected to cost Dollars 2bn overall, in the next two years.
Mr Homoud al Rqobah, Kuwait oil minister, said recently the repair work
would include an element of upgrading all three refineries.
The three at present produce a total 270,000 b/d (170,000 b/d from Mina Al
Ahmadi and 100,000 b/d from Mina Abdulla) of a pre-war capacity of over
700,000 b/d. It is hoped capacity will reach 650,000 b/d by next year.

<TEXT>
CITROEN, a division of Peugeot, the French car maker, expects to reach final
agreement shortly with the Chinese government to set up a car assembly plant
in central China.
Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot chief executive, said yesterday that the deal,
the most ambitious car project undertaken by the Peugeot group outside
Europe, should be completed by the end of April.
Citroen is to take a 30 per cent stake in a joint venture with the Second
Automobile Works in Wuhan in central China to set up the plant to produce
the Citroen ZX small family car.
Mr Calvet said the plant would have capacity to produce nearly 40,000 cars a
year in the first phase, but the expected agreement calls for this to be
raised in three more stages to an eventual capacity of 150,000 cars a year.
Mr Xavier Karcher, head of the Citroen division, said the joint venture
would also set up engine and gearbox assembly operations at Wuhan.
Total investment for the 150,000-car-a-year project is estimated at some
FFr5bn. (Pounds 510m). Mr Karcher said that part of the financing would come
from French government grants together with French state-guaranteed loans
and commercial bank loans.
In the initial stage of the project, Citroen will begin to supply later this
year simple kits from Europe, including already painted bodies for final
assembly in Wuhan. The eventual aim is to develop integrated car assembly
facilities from panel stamping to final assembly.
To increase the level of local content, some 26 European, mainly French,
automotive components suppliers are also planning to set up joint ventures
in China to supply the Citroen joint venture and the existing Peugeot small
volume assembly plant in Canton, Mr Karcher said.
The Citroen project is one of the most ambitious automotive ventures to be
established in China.
It will be second only to the two vehicle assembly operations already under
development by the Volkswagen group of Germany.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Argentine prices show rise of 2.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINE retail prices rose 2.2 per cent in February, it was announced
yesterday, fuelling concerns about the government's economic policy which
heavily depends on fixing the Argentine currency against the US dollar.
However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, said the exchange
rate policy was sustainable and promised 'a hand-to-hand battle with
inflation'.
He also announced that the International Monetary Fund has agreed in
principle to a new Dollars 3.61bn loan package. The deal - which includes
elements of a current Dollars 1.04bn standby loan and a new three-year
extended fund facility loan - should be approved at an IMF board meeting
later this month. Approval would help Argentina win a deal to reduce its
Dollars 31bn debt to commercial banks by mid-year.
Although small compared with a 27 per cent increase in February 1991, last
month's rise showed that retail price inflation is proving remarkably
resistant to Mr Cavallo's orthodox economic policies.
Retail prices rose 3 per cent in January and are expected to increase a
further 2-3 per cent in March, bringing first quarter inflation to 7.5-8.5
per cent. Inflation is fuelled by seasonal factors and a heavy increase in
consumer demand. The cartelised service and retail sectors are also accused
of widening margins: retail prices have risen 42 per cent over the past year
while wholesale prices rose by just 5 per cent.
Prices will continue rising this month because the government raised value
added tax by two percentage points to 18 per cent on March 1.
Although low by Argentine standards, inflation must fall towards US levels
because of the pegging of the peso to the US dollar. Retail price inflation
has risen by 28 per cent in the 11 months since Mr Cavallo made the peso
convertible.
One danger is that this will damage the competitiveness of Argentine
exporters. However, Mr Cavallo insists exporters - whose costs rise in line
with wholesale prices - are not becoming uncompetitive, in part because of
the greater efficiency generated by the government's other reforms.
However, some economists see a danger that high retail price inflation will
bring demands for a return to price and wage indexation.

FT  05 MAR 92 / US 'needs visionary policy' to hone competitive edge: A new
federal advisory council, is calling for a radical and national reappraisal
for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIGHT THE next US president, Republican or Democrat, be tempted to
experiment with some form of 'industrial policy'?
If the first report* from the bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council is
any guide, future administrations will certainly face increased pressure to
develop explicit policies for different industrial sectors.
As part of a comprehensive 'competitiveness strategy,' involving a shift
from budget deficit to surplus, the council argues that the federal
government should set out 'visions' of 'industry paths that would be
compatible with a prosperous and competitive American economy'.
The council bemoans the fact that the country's two top economic officials
(Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve chairman) focus mainly on
financial matters, saying that the US needs to expand the role of the
Department of Commerce or International Trade Commission.
In addition to assessing US business strength, an expanded agency could
monitor the activities of foreign governments and companies to provide
'early warning of competitiveness problems'. The US intelligence community,
having lost its Cold War responsibilities, could also be mobilised to gather
such information.
The council, a federal advisory committee, is chaired by Mr Fred Bergsten,
the director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington
think-tank.
It was formed last year under the aegis of the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act of 1988; 12 members appointed by the administration and
both houses of Congress are drawn equally from business, labour, government
and the public.
It should not be confused with either the residential Council on
Competitiveness, headed by Vice-President Dan Quayle and concerned mainly to
reduce the federal regulatory burden, or with the private-sector Council on
Competitiveness, a pressure group set up in 1987.
Mr Bergsten, a former economic official in the Carter administration, is
well aware that sector-specific industrial policies are likely to be the
most controversial aspect of the group's competitiveness strategy.
'I am not trying to imitate Japan Inc,' he said, but rather 'to improve the
federal government's analytical capabilities so that it can respond
intelligently to proposals for assistance from specific industries.'
But, why should government develop sector-specific expertise, when the US
has relied successfully on the free-market for decades?
The council regards this as a misreading of history and says that the US has
'carried out strategies towards certain sectors of the economy and key
industries from the birth of the republic under different rubrics -
including agricultural policy, defence policy and aerospace policy.'
In spite of some failures, the results 'have sometimes been spectacularly
successful: the world's most efficient farms and commercial aircraft, a
robust computer industry and many more. There need be no embarrassment over
conscious endorsement of a such a policy ..'
Both Republican and Democrat administrations, the council points out, have
frequently employed import quotas, tax incentives, government procurement
and numerous other devices to support individual sectors and even individual
companies such as Chrysler and Lockheed. The trouble, it says, is that such
support is typically 'episodic and ad hoc.'
The report argues that the country's eroding competitiveness reflects three
main problems:
A proclivity to think and act short-term while competitors, especially Japan
and Germany, adopt longer-time horizons. It says short-termism is endemic in
all the three main sectors of households, companies and government.
Perverse incentives throughout US society. Examples include tax laws that
penalise saving, a political process that rewards spending and tax-cutting,
and an education system that offers few rewards for hard work.
A failure to think globally. The council says that business and government
policymakers remain insular in spite of the doubling of trade relative to
gross national product (GNP) that has left the US as reliant on external
markets as either Japan or the European Community
The council's advocacy of industrial policies forms part of a tripartite
approach to competitiveness problems.
The second key element is more stable and effective macroeconomic policies
designed principally to boost US savings and investment.
The council notes that the US has been living off a huge stock of capital,
much of which was accumulated in the century between the Civil War and the
Second World War.
Prior to 1940, the US savings rate was among the highest in the world, and
considerably higher than Japan's. But, while other country's savings rates
rose, that of the US remained static.
The council says that the conversion of federal budget deficits into
surpluses is essential if the savings rate is to be raised, but it declines
to recommend specific tax increases. It also advocates radical tax reforms
to reduce consumption and boost private saving.
The third element in the council's strategy consists of fundamental
structural reforms, including an overhaul of education and training,
health-care provision, corporate governance and financial markets,
technology policy and trade policy.
The council plans to make specific recommendations in these areas in a
report timed to influence the winner of this November's presidential
election.
Mr Bergsten concedes that many of the council's proposals stand a better
chance of being implemented if a Democrat were elected president, but he
stresses that Republicans on the council, from both private business and
state government, are strong supporters of initiatives such as
sector-specific industrial policies.
After three years of stagnation, the centre of economic gravity in the US
seems to be shifting rapidly. Policies that seemed unthinkable in the Reagan
era may yet form central planks in the policies of future administrations.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Corporation tax cut and loopholes closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the corporate tax rate and the closing of some tax loopholes were
the key features of the Hong Kong government's budget presented yesterday by
the colony's new financial secretary, Mr Hamish MacLeod.
The colony's corporate tax rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 17.5 per
cent - a measure that had been well leaked and discounted by the stock
market.
The budget was billed by the government as one for the man-in-the-street, a
departure for an administration seen as avowedly pro-business and a sign
that Hong Kong's experiment with limited elective democracy is having an
effect on at least the government's presentation of policy.
Mr MacLeod said his budget measures were framed against an economic
background which would see the economy expand by 5 per cent in real terms
this year after 4 per cent growth last year. Trade, the backbone of the
colony's economy, was expected to be buoyant with exports growing by 14 per
cent.
Although he was accused of not doing enough for the less well off while
penalising business, his measures are likely to pass through the Legislative
Council without serious amendment.
Mr MacLeod said stamp duty on share transactions would be lowered to 0.4 per
cent from 0.5 per cent although duty would be extended to covered warrants.
He also promised legislation to close tax loopholes which have allowed
companies to avoid taxes, especially car dealerships which fudge the true
cost of imported vehicles to pay less tax.
A combination of higher land sales, faster growth, and less capital spending
due to delays with the new airport project boosted the government's surplus
to HKDollars 14.1bn (Pounds 1.03bn) from a forecast HKDollars 1.3bn in last
year's budget. The surplus is forecast to fall to HKDollars 5.1bn this
financial year.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies plan to reduce capital spending by 4 per cent during the
financial year beginning next month, suggesting that the weakness in the
economy will continue, according to a survey by the Industrial Bank of
Japan.
The planned fall in investment follows an expected 5.4 per cent increase in
the current year and double-digit growth in the three previous years, and
highlights industry's expectation of slower domestic demand and a faint
international recovery.
Manufacturing companies told the bank that capital spending for the coming
year is likely to fall by 10.7 per cent, while non-manufacturing industry
expects a 3.1 per cent drop. Electric power companies expect a 6 per cent
rise.
The bank said that the investment decline forecast by manufacturing
companies was the largest reported in its surveys since 1978, while the fall
in the non-manufacturing sector is the first in two decades.
Capital spending has also been slowed by turmoil on Japan's financial
markets as companies had tapped the stock market for low-cost funds in the
late 1980s to expand capacity and introduce labour-saving technology to cope
with the country's labour shortage.
The predicted falls follow years of rapid growth and reflect a readjustment
of inventory that the Bank of Japan argues is to be expected for an economy
returning to more normal rates of expansion.
Electrical machinery companies, some expecting a loss this year, are
planning to cut capital spending by 19.9 per cent. The car industry, which
has experienced eight consecutive months of lower domestic sales, is
predicting an 8.5 per cent fall.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations, called for the Bank of Japan to lower the official discount
rate (ODR) as soon as possible. He also urged Japanese workers to exercise
restraint in forthcoming spring wage negotiations.

AN Algerian court yesterday ordered the dissolution of the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS), two months after the fundamentalist party was denied almost
certain victory by the cancelling of parliamentary elections, Reuter reports
from Algiers.
The decision, which takes effect in one week but is subject to appeal,
closed off any other legal outlet for FIS militants who wanted to make
Algeria an Islamic state.
Diplomats have said they feared a ban would drive hardline FIS members to

Mr Larbi Belkheir, the interior minister, had asked the court on February 9
to order the dissolution or suspension of the FIS, accusing the party of
multiple violations of the law.
The same day, the authorities ordered a 12-month state of emergency, opening
internment camps to hold detainees.
In its last communique before the court order, the FIS said those thwarted
from the legal path would have every reason to turn to 'other means.'

Kenyan riot police fired teargas at crowds of stone-throwing demonstrators
in Nairobi yesterday in the second day of protests over the clubbing by
police of women hunger strikers, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Gangs of youths set ablaze unmarked cars, believed to belong to government
security agencies, and hurled bricks at police around a main bus terminal.
The unrest is the worst confrontation between police and anti-government
demonstrators since President Daniel arap Moi gave way to pressure at home
and abroad last December and said the country would switch to a multi-party
system.

Britain's Prince Philip chided representatives of 114 governments at an
international wildlife conference yesterday for regarding conservation as a
'PR exercise', and argued that the illegal wildlife trade is 'just as
dangerous' as the drug trade, Robert Thomson writes from Tokyo.
The prince's speech to the triennial conference of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) came as developing
countries complained that wealthier nations are attempting to transform them
into fauna parks and history museums.
Government delegates to the two-week conference in Kyoto are considering
proposals to protect or to relax protection on 97 types of flora and fauna,
including elephants, bluefin tuna, and tropical timbers, as well as many
lesser-known species.
Japanese customs officials said yesterday that they had uncovered an illegal
ivory shipment of about 370kg in a container from a vessel that had docked
at Kobe after travelling to South Africa, via South Korea, Taiwan and
Singapore. The haul is the second largest found in Japan since a 1989 ban on
the ivory trade, and follows the discovery of an 800kg shipment of tusks
last April.

sector
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government is cutting financial support to the public sector  -
once the keystone of Indian socialism - more rapidly than official policy
pronouncements suggest.
The administration of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is seeking,
however, to minimise job losses that could lead to a confrontation with
labour. He told parliament yesterday that as of now 'not a single worker has
been thrown out of employment'.
His statement came as the Janata Dal and left-wing parties called for a
national strike to protest against what they call 'an anti-poor' budget.
Senior officials disclosed yesterday that the government's net contribution
towards capital spending by the public sector - steel, railways, fertilisers
and other state-owned industries will drop next year by 16 per cent to
Rs35.3bn (Pounds 768m). As a result the government's net share of capital
spending by the public sector will have fallen to 9.6 per cent from 18.5 per
cent only four years ago.
The net figures, which are not normally made public, exclude foreign
assistance to the public sector through bilateral or multilateral donors.
Total capital spending by the public sector will none the less rise
marginally next year, reflecting an improvement in the ability of
state-owned companies to generate more funds internally.
In addition to a smaller contribution to the public sector, last Saturday's
budget also includes a 41 per cent reduction to Rs4.4bn in central
government lending to cover public sector losses. Under an understanding
with the World Bank, these loans are to to be phased out in three years -
forcing closure or rationalisation of almost 50 companies which have been
making persistent losses.
The budget makes allowance for about 100,000 public sector workers to be
made redundant this year - mostly textile workers employed by mills
nationalised because the private sector was unable to finance their losses.
The government wants to avoid large retrenchments in both public and private
sector companies that are paying their way.
Indicating this week that the government was in no hurry to push through
legislation to make it easier for industry to reduce its labour force, Dr
Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said the government would proceed on a
case-by-case basis.
He said there was no need for the 'excessive publicity' and the 'fuss' that
would go with an official policy on closures and retrenchments.

<TEXT>
MR Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, yesterday returned to
Yugoslavia in an emergency mission to calm ethnic tensions among the three
main national groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Vance's mission follows a weekend referendum in which Moslems and Croats,
who make up 71 per cent of the population, voted to break away from
Yugoslavia. The remainder, Serbs, refuse to leave the remnants of the
Yugoslav federation.
Mr Vance was expected to arrive in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia, today after
meeting Serbian and Yugoslav army leaders in Belgrade, the Serbian and
federal capital. Sarajevo was designated the headquarters for UN
peacekeepers, but many fear the tensions in Bosnia could jeopardise the UN
initiative to despatch 14,000 peacekeepers to neighbouring Croatia.
Barricades have been erected, intermittently disrupting Sarajevo, as well as
Visoko, Pale and Romanija, predominantly Serb villages outside the capital.
But federal armoured vehicles yesterday rumbled through the city to prevent
militants from blocking main roads. Joint police and army patrols were part
of the peace agreement reached late on Tuesday night which staved off the
threat of open warfare between Serbs and Moslems.
A statement yesterday from the Serb headquarters, however, said: 'People
here have lost faith in the possibility of a political agreement with the
Moslem people.'
In northern Bosnia an agreement yesterday between Serb and Croat political
parties was reported to have halted fighting in Bosanski Brod, where 60
mortar bombs hit the town in an overnight attack. The 33,000 population of
the town, which borders Croatia, is 41 per cent Croat and 33 per cent Serb.
Most spent Tuesday night in underground shelters.
Radio Sarajevo reported two people were killed on Tuesday night in Gacko,
southern Bosnia.
The Commonwealth of Independent States, itself beset by ethnic turbulence,
has decided to send 900 volunteers to join UN peacekeeping forces in
Yugoslavia, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow.
Colonel Viktor Loginov, an, Afghan veteran, will command the infantry
battalion made up of elite paratroopers.

   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S defence minister, Mr Virginio Rognoni, yesterday issued a blunt
warning to senior military officers to stop challenging proposals for a
radical re-organisation of the country's defences.
In an open letter published in Corriere della Serra, he said the services
had been fully consulted and had had ample opportunity to express their
views during more than two years' discussion on a new defence strategy. 'The
time for discussion is over. . . and now the matter has passed to
parliament,' he said.
The proposals, involving a substantial cut in the armed forces, are to meet
the changed requirements of the 1990s for Italy and the Nato alliance.
They have led to attacks from disgruntled high-ranking officers and the
resignation of a senior general since being put to parliament on November
26.
The complaints have centred on plans to break up traditional units and
establish new command structures co-ordinating the three services. There are
also fears over lost jobs and continued low pay. Concern has also been
voiced about de-militarisation of the para-military carabinieri police and
creeping unionisation of military structures.
But this week General Luigi Federici, in charge of the Alpine corps, added
another controversial ingredient when he complained that switching to a
volunteer army would lead to 'meridonialisation', with the bulk of recruits
coming from the poorer south. Roughly 80 per cent of current volunteers come
from the south. His comments appear to have spurred Mr Rognoni to read the
riot act.
The reforms, to be examined by parliament after the April 5 elections, would
cut at least 90,000 civilian and military personnel from the forces by the
end of the decade. The cuts, equivalent to 23 per cent of the forces' 1990
strength, will be greatest in the army (28 per cent), followed by the air
force (13 per cent) and navy (12 per cent), with a further 20 per cent among
civilian employees. National service personnel will be halved.
The army, with a new rapid intervention role accorded by Nato for the
alliance's southern flank, will be remodelled round 15 brigades instead of
the present 25. Five will contain frontline troops trained for rapid
deployment, including out-of-area actions. The navy will have less of an
ocean-going role, while six air force squadrons will be cut and the number
of air bases reduced from 24 to 20.
The overall cost of the changes is expected to add an extra L40,000bn
(Pounds 18.5bn) to the defence budget over the next decade. However, this
will help shift the burden of expenditure away from personnel costs and more
towards materiel.
Italy's inflation slowed to a three-year low of 5.4 per cent in February,
down from a year-on-year 6.1 per cent the month before, Reuter reports from
Milan. The figures will give a boost to government parties in the election
campaign.

<TEXT>
AN Ecu500m (Pounds 350m) line of credit guaranteed by the EC for supplies of
food and agricultural products to the former Soviet Union, delayed since
November because of the political turmoil in Moscow, has finally been
signed, for Russia alone.
Deutsche Bank, whose Luxembourg subsidiary is the lead bank of the
consortium providing the EC-guaranteed credit, said yesterday the necessary
legal and financial alterations to the contract had been agreed. Meanwhile,
an unidentified number of banks in the consortium have dropped out, their
participation taken over by Deutsche Bank. The turnover is not a response to
uncertainty in the former Soviet Union, because the entire credit enjoys an
EC guarantee.
The delay was caused by uncertainty over the status of Vnesheconombank, the
foreign trade bank of the former Soviet Union, whose status Russia has
reduced to agent responsible for repaying historic debts. In this case, it
has been allowed to take on a new loan, probably its last, because the deal
was agreed before the Soviet Union collapsed.
'The Vnesheconombank can now open letters of credit in favour of the
exporters,' the Deutsche Bank said yesterday.
The fact that the entire credit will now go to Russia was determined by the
fact that the Vnesheconombank is now entirely controlled by that country,
the bank said. The other republics will have to seek their share of EC food
credits from the subsequent Ecu1.25bn - still blocked by disagreement over
counterpart guarantees from Russia.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Protests grow as Portugal faces up to Euro-integration:
Lisbon's social democrats are under attack on several fronts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS everything was running smoothly with Portugal's six-month presidency
of the European Community, a wave of protests has acted as a sharp reminder
of the difficulties for the country as it faces the demands of European
integration.
The protests have different origins - mainly pay for public-sector workers,
working conditions for some professions and an unpopular exam for students -
but they have brought to the surface discontent and thrown the social
democratic administration of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva on the
defensive.
The scale of student protests took everyone by surprise. For several days
last month, thousands of students carried out wild-cat actions blocking
streets, causing traffic chaos and leaving the police bewildered. Lisbon
faces more chaos today, with another public transport strike and possible
further disruption by students.
The students want the controversial PGA exam - the key to higher education
and university entrance - to be abolished. They say it favours better-off
students by focusing on broad cultural questions which are often not covered
in the official syllabus.
They have won widespread sympathy, and support from the opposition
socialists, who were delighted to find a popular issue with which to attack
the government. Mr Diamantino Durao, the education minister, hastily
declared his own doubts about the PGA, agreed to review the exam's content
and said dissatisfied students could sit it again in May.
In the public sector, wages are the main concern. A government offer of an 8
per cent pay rise, in line with its inflation forecast, for public
administration employees was thrown out by the unions who want double-digit
rises.
Demonstrations followed, and the unions called a one-day nationwide strike,
which prompted the government to retreat from its 'final' offer and enabled
it to reach an agreement with the more moderate of the two main unions for a
basic 10 per cent rise which, according to economists, will increase the
total wages by around 14 per cent.
Nevertheless, the strike went ahead, paralysing public transport and
disrupting public administration, the health service, education, and the
judiciary. The left-wing CGTP union confederation has called for another day
of nationwide action later this month.
The number of strikes is rising: there were 60 strikes and stoppages in
January, almost double that in January 1991 and the worse record since 1986.
The private sector has been practically strife-free, but that may change as
restructuring begins to hurt traditional industries such as textiles where
extensive lay-offs are inevitable.
The deepening crisis in agriculture is another source of concern and area of
potential conflict. Small farmers, who see their livelihood threatened by
the advent of the EC single market, gave a foretaste last July of their
likely reaction to any deal to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. They
rose up against their own unions, blocking roads with tractors until
paramilitary police cleared the way.
The government's problem is that it must make tough adjustments now to meet
its ambitious targets for European economic union in the second half of the
1990s. The budget deficit and inflation have to be reduced substantially,
while growth and investment must be maintained at higher than the EC
average. Its dilemma is that giving in to popular demands would undermine
its economic convergence strategy; resisting the pressures would deprive it
of more popular support.
In theory, the government is safe from political upsets. The ruling Social
Democratic party (PSD) won an absolute majority of votes and parliamentary
seats in last October's general election, and Mr Cavaco Silva - as the
architect of that victory - has his party firmly under control.
The opposition is in disarray, and the Socialist Party (PS), which is the
only political force potentially able to challenge the government, has just
elected a new leader in an attempt to revamp its image following its poor
showing in the elections, when it received less than 30 per cent of the
vote. Mr Antonio Guterres, the party's new general secretary, will need to
apply all his political skills if he is to provide the fractious socialists
a new sense of direction.
For the time being, public and social pressures will worry the government
most, especially as it is keen to avoid unrest during its stint in the EC
presidency.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN AIRLINES have recovered from the collapse in business caused a year
ago by the Gulf War.
January saw 12.6 per cent more passenger traffic than a year earlier, when
the Gulf War began, and a 6 per cent improvement on 1990, according to the
Association of European Airlines (AEA).
'A measure of real market growth has resumed,' it said.
The news follows figures from the International Air Transport Association,
which showed a 14 per cent improvement in world air traffic over the
depressed levels of January 1991.
Apart from links to the Middle East, which jumped almost 80 per cent from a
low level, the AEA said that links with Latin America remained the fastest
growing area. This was the best performing sector during 1991 and January
showed a 20.8 improvement over the same month of 1991.
On the North Atlantic, the world's busiest long-haul route, traffic was 10
per cent up on 1991 and 8.6 per cent higher over two years.
While the figures for passenger travel encouraged the AEA, the outlook for
air freight was less favourable. January freight traffic was still 3 per
cent below its level of two years earlier.

<TEXT>
THE START of pay talks for Germany's 4m engineering workers was marked
yesterday by warnings of heavy job losses and a flurry of grim news from
manufacturing companies.
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of the Gesamtmetall employers'
association, said every percentage point above the inflation rate in this
year's award would cost 200,000 jobs.
At the first round of talks, held in Hamburg on behalf of 120,000 workers in
northern Germany, the local IG Metall union branch claimed a 9 per cent
increase. Most of the other nine regional branches, due to start negotiating
in the coming weeks, have asked for 9.5 per cent. Inflation this year is
expected to average 4.5 per cent at most.
Mr Franz Fillbach, Gesamt-metall's negotiator in Hamburg, made no offer
during the opening session and the talks were adjourned to March 24. But he
said the engineering industry was on a downward slope. Domestic demand had
fallen sharply and export orders were stagnating.
Reports from leading companies confirmed that the downturn is now biting in
all metal-working sectors. Gildemeister, one of western Germany's largest
machine tool makers, said yesterday it would pay no dividend for 1991 and
none should be expected this year. Group turnover fell 12 per cent last year
and overseas sales dropped 23 per cent.
Georg Muller, a Nuremberg bearings manufacturer, reported that it started
the year with 46 per cent fewer orders than 12 months earlier. Ymos, a
Bavarian company specialising in car components, said it had missed its 1991
financial targets by a wide margin because orders had not been renewed and
motor manufacturers had delayed launching new models.
In Dusseldorf the German Steel Federation added to the gloom with a report
that orders for steel fell 9 per cent in the final quarter of 1991.
In another pay case, the OTV union, negotiating for 2.3m western German
public service workers, said it wanted employers to put forward a negotiable
offer when the third round of talks starts today. The OTV is seeking a basic
9.5 per cent increase.
White collar unions yesterday stepped up their rolling programme of strike
action in pursuit of a 10.5 per cent pay claim for bank workers, and called
out 15,000 staff in banks all over western Germany. Business was not
seriously disrupted.
Some banks reported operating comfortably even though half the workforce
stayed away. The unions, meanwhile, threatened to increase the pressure
steadily until a 'reasonable offer' was made.

THREE-QUARTERS of all deaths worldwide are caused by diseases related to the
environment and to lifestyle, especially infectious diseases and cancer, the
World Health Organisation said in a report published yesterday.
Arguing that action to stop environmental deterioration was essential to
avert potentially disastrous consequences for human health and survival, the
report said 2.5bn people suffer from illnesses resulting from insufficient
or contaminated water and lack of sanitation.
The 270-page report, 'Our planet, our health', the UN agency's contribution
to the Earth Summit in Brazil in June, calls for measures to reduce
population growth, waste and overconsumption in industrialised countries and
poverty.
The report says that while economic development has historically led to big
improvements in human health, population pressures in poor countries and
profligate lifestyles in rich ones are degrading the environment in ways
that damage health.
It cites urban overcrowding and insanitary conditions, high levels of air
pollution including indoor pollution from open fires, unsafe working
conditions especially in poor countries, and growing pressures on water
reserves.
International problems include acid rain, disposal of hazardous wastes,
atmospheric ozone loss and global warming which may lead to crop failures
and migration of diseases.

MR Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, warned yesterday that
unless the EC could put together 'a strong, unambiguous position,' he would
not attend the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Mr Ripa di Meana listed five requirements, stressing particularly the need
to agree on a location for the blocked European Environment Agency (EEA),
and for a coherent policy to combat global warming.
'We must go to Rio, as it were, with a dowry,' he said. 'If we do not have
this, I will not be participating in the conference, which will become a
carnival of declarations in Copacabana.'
The Portuguese presidency of the EC has to select a site for the EEA by
March 23, after a Commission idea to rotate the headquarters was shelved.
France is blocking agreement until Strasbourg is confirmed as the definitive
home of the European Parliament. Some officials believe Paris may now prove
more pliable, faced with a rise in support for ecologists in regional
elections later this month.
Copenhagen has been tipped as the likely seat of the EEA.
The EC would look 'ludicrous' at Rio unless this impasse is unblocked, the
commissioner said. It would be 'vulnerable to the elementary remark that the
Community has not set up its agency because it cannot agree where to put
it.'
On the Commission's controversial plan for a mixed carbon and energy tax to
cut carbon dioxide emissions, Mr Ripa di Meana said: 'We have to make up our
minds and adopt the proposal ..if we adopt this position, movement will be
possible among our &lt;trading&gt; partners.'
While Mr Ripa di Meana acknowledged that economic conditions may not allow
the EC to go ahead with a tax unless the US and Japan could be persuaded to
follow suit, he believes they are unlikely to do so unless the Twelve
clearly demonstrate they are serious about using fiscal instruments to
defeat the greenhouse effect.
The Commission yesterday formally endorsed plans to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances by the end
of 1995.

THE Polish government, which relies on farm interests for its parliamentary
majority, could face protests from farmers' unions despite a controversial
decision this week to introduce minimum procurement prices and subsidise
farm credits.
The unions have long campaigned for minimum farm prices but it could prove a
hollow victory as officials in the Ministry of Agriculture expect the
government to fail to set the price of milk, wheat and rye at levels the
farmers want.
Feelings in the countryside are running high as real incomes last year fell
40 per cent below 1989 levels while production in 1991 remained above the
average of the late 1980s.
The government of Mr Jan Olszewski is under pressure from the International
Monetary Fund to cut spending and keep the budget within Zl 65,000bn or 5
per cent of GDP.
It has already cut government spending on farm products while the increase
in subsidised farm credits is below the rate of inflation. The only real
concession to farmers is lower interest rates for the purchase of tractors .

THE PARIS Club of western creditor governments has apparently softened its
insistence that Ukraine should assume collective responsibility, together
with the other republics, for the former Soviet Union's foreign debt.
Although western negotiators refused to give details yesterday, Mr Vitold
Fokin, Ukrainian prime minister, described a meeting on Tuesday with Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, Paris Club president, as 'a victory for Ukraine'.
Mr Fokin said the negotiations would open the door to western credit which
G7 nations have hitherto blocked in an effort to force Ukraine to drop its
insistence on paying its 16.37 per cent or Dollars 13.42bn share of Soviet
debt independently. A final agreement is not expected until a March 11
meeting between Mr Trichet and Ukraine and Russia.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, Russian central bank chairman, yesterday stuck to the
Russian position that the former Soviet republics should maintain a
centralised system to repay the debt. 'It is absolutely impossible to divide
up the debt,' he said.
Canadian officials, who broke ranks with their G7 partners last month by
opening a CDollars 50m line of credit to Ukraine, met Mr Fokin earlier on
Tuesday and are thought to have helped broker a deal with the Paris Club.
They said Mr Trichet had agreed that Ukraine could pay independently of
Russia and that a final agreement might be based on a proposal Ukraine
presented to Canada whereby the former republics would be grouped into two
debt-paying blocs, one guaranteed by Ukraine and one by Russia. However, Mr
Trichet himself did not comment yesterday.
Mr Boris Soboliev, deputy minister for foreign economic relations, said that
during the meeting 'a fundamental reorganisation of Vnesheconombank (through
which debt is paid) was discussed, including the possibility that it will be
moved to Minsk.'

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: IRI unit sells 7.1% of Elsag
Bailey

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINMECCANICA, the holding company which controls the engineering interests
of Italy's IRI state holding group, has sold 7.1 per cent of its Elsag
Bailey subsidiary to a group of foreign investors including Credit Lyonnais
and Mercury Asset Management (MAM).
Elsag Bailey, a precision engineering group with 1990 sales of L1,353bn
(Dollars 1.09bn), was floated on the stock exchange last July. The latest
deal will reduce the IRI group's stake in the company to around 72 per cent
from 79 per cent after the flotation, if warrants are fully exercised.
Elsag Bailey, based in Genova, had net profits of L26.5bn in 1990, the
latest year for which figures are available. The company specialises in
continuous process control automation equipment, and on machinery for
automating services such as letter sorting.
Credit Lyonnais has bought a 4 per cent holding through its Clinvest
subsidiary, while MAM's stake has not been disclosed.
The deals, which were co-ordinated by Wasserstein Perella the US investment
bank, took place on the Italian block market at L4,625 a share. Elsag
Bailey's shares were fixed in Milan at L4,650 yesterday.
Like much of the IRI group, Finmeccanica has been facing a growing financial
squeeze owing to heavy investment commitments at a time of sharply-reduced
government funding recently.
Elsag Bailey itself has grown rapidly of late through a series of
acquisitions, notably in the US. However, its gearing has also risen
sharply, and the latest deal, which Finmeccanica said was with 'long-term'
investors, should raise around L30bn.
Milan-based building entrepreneur Mr Salvatore Ligresti has acquired a 5 per
cent stake in German tyremaker Continental for DM110m, according to German
press reports.

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Hungary to put up steel trade barriers
next week
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY has decided to put up trade barriers against steel imports from next
week in the latest concession to industries and joint ventures demanding
protection.
The ministry of international economic relations said that Hungary would
introduce quotas on imports of 15 steel products.
The move comes after the local industry accused competitors in other east
European countries, notably Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union, of
dumping subsidised production.
Officials also promised Voest-Alpine, the Austrian state-owned steelmaker,
that imports would be curtailed, when a month ago, the company bought into
Hungary's largest cold-rolling mill at Dunaujvaros.
The measure is a sign of increasing protectionist pressure, particularly
effective when it comes from western joint ventures.
The government sees its concessions to the protectionist lobby as tactical
and denies that they go so far as to compromise Hungary's general commitment
to import liberalisation.
Hungary is locked into reducing tariffs by the rules of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and the terms of its association
agreement with the European Community, the trade element of which came into
effect this month.
None the less, in quick succession, Hungary has restricted imports of steel
and cars, along with cement and televisions.
Hungary issued licences for only 84,000 cars to be imported in the first
half of 1992, a reduction of 44 per cent on the 1991 level.
The cut was in response to claims to infant-industry status by General
Motors of the US and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation, both of which have
set up new car plants in Hungary.
The Hungarian authorities have also raised to 25 per cent the tariff on
colour televisions, which Samsung, the South Korean electronics company,
produces locally.
The overall trend, however, is still towards liberalisation.
Of imports, 92 per cent in 1991 needed no licences, up from 70 per cent the
year before.
Meanwhile the average tariff rate fell from 16 to 13 per cent.

Jordan, still officially at war with Israel, yesterday announced plans to
suspend compulsory military service to try to help forge a more
cost-effective, modern army, Reuter reports from Amman.
Mr Sharif Zeid bin Shaker, the prime minister, asked the lower house of
parliament to give the government authorisation both to stop the two-year
draft programme and to reactivate it when needed. The 80-seat house is
likely to endorse the plan on Sunday.
The small army, a major source of King Hussein's power, is widely respected
as a disciplined, well-trained force.
Bin Shaker said lessons drawn from the Gulf war last year showed career
soldiers performed much better than conscripts.

<TEXT>
THE prime minister last night reinforced expectations that the Conservatives
would launch their campaign for an April 9 election with a tax cutting
Budget next Tuesday, Philip Stephens writes.
Despite renewed warnings from some on the right of his party of the need for
a 'prudent' Budget package which would win the confidence of financial
markets, Mr Major defended a sharp increase in public borrowing.
In an interview in today's Glasgow Herald, the prime minister suggested that
the Budget could act as the springboard for recovery by boosting the
'confidence' factor in the economy.
He defended present levels of public borrowing as a 'cyclical' response to
the recession recalling that the Labour party had cut taxes in 1978 despite
a high borrowing requirement.

to record high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
DESPITE ANOTHER rise in bond yields, an increase in monthly housing starts
and a rise in leading economic indicators helped the Dow Jones Industrial
Average reach another new record close yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the end of trading the Dow was up 14.98 at 3,290.25, eclipsing its
previous record close of 3,283.32 which was achieved last week. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 0.41 at 412.86,
while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, still prey to
profit-takers, edged 1.22 lower to 634.25. Turnover on the NYSE was 202m
shares, and rises outpaced declines by 906 to 780.
On Monday the main influence on stock market sentiment was the big jump in
bond yields, and the fear that high long-term interest rates might stifle
the economic recovery. Yesterday, however, the market shrugged off another
increase in bond yields, concentrating instead on the rise in January
leading indicators and the 12.9 per cent advance in monthly housing starts.
Both sets of data back up other recent evidence pointing to a modest
recovery in economic activity.
ITT jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 in turnover of 1.6m shares after
the company announced that it expected to realise a Dollars 400m gain from
the sale of its 30 per cent stake in Alcatel NV, the telecommunications
subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom of France. ITT also said that it may use the
cash to buy back some of its own stock.
UAL rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 153 after the airline filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission plans for a shelf offering of up to
Dollars 1bn of equipment trust certificates.
Toys 'R' Us firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 in busy trading after Mr
Michael Exstein, analyst with County NatWest, reiterated his 'buy'
recommendation on the stock, arguing that the decision of the toy retailer's
main rivals, especially Child World, to focus on profitability will aid Toys
'R' Us, which has been under strong pricing pressure from competitors
recently.
Santa Fe Pacific rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 11 3/4 following an upgrade
from Shearson Lehman Brothers, which believes the decline in the railroad
company's stock price now makes the shares attractive.
Amdahl fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange
as some industry analysts cut their earnings estimates for the computer
company on the news that it is delaying shipment of its 5995M computers
until the third quarter.
Nutmeg Industries rose Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 24 1/4 following fourth
quarter profits for the sportswear manufacturer and retailer of 23 cents a
share, a big improvement on the six cents a share earned at the same stage
in 1990.
On the over-the-counter market, Sunrise Technologies plunged Dollars 4 1/2 ,
or 26 per cent, to Dollars 13 after the company projected a first quarter
loss from operations.
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed little changed in moderate trading which was
concentrated mostly in the last two hours of the session because of a
technical problem between 10 am and 2 pm EST.
According to preliminary data, the composite index slipped 2.68 points, or
0.07 per cent, to 3,576.7 and losing issues edged winners by 268 to 251.
Volume of 19.5m shares was above the previous 18.4m, and trading value was
CDollars 213.9m against CDollars 201.4m.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm reforms tripped in
final straight - The battery of imponderables facing the Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Commission plans to reform fundamentally the Common Agricultural
Policy entered what looked like the final straight yesterday - at which
point several EC member states stuck out their legs to trip them up.
Nonetheless, the main evidence that agriculture ministers are at last having
to face up to decisions on reform was that some were forced to drop any
pretence at going along with the Brussels blueprint and state their real
objections.
Before the ministers was a detailed compromise proposal by the Portuguese
presidency of the EC, worked out by officials from the 12 within the
Commission's framework. This was billed as 'the final compromise'.
For cereals, the centrepiece of the reform, the Commission's planned 35 per
cent price cut over three years has been reduced to 30 per cent. Less
compensation for the price cuts would be paid, however, although the
possibility of more compensation for taking land out of production is
contemplated.
The price cuts are meant to cut overproduction, while compensating farmers
fully with direct income payments - conditional for larger farms on setting
aside land. The policing of this scheme on an individual farm basis ran into
strong administrative resistance among the 12.
Germany claimed it would cost Ecu500m (Dollars 602m) to monitor and Belgium
said it would take five years to introduce. That argument has been resolved
by selecting the equivalent of an English county as the unit from which to
calculate the areas sown and set aside. Individual farmers can also present
their own 'base area", but both units will be penalised for any cheating.
The compromise also envisages a less restrictive definition of beef and
dairy herd eligibility for premium payments. The Commission had wanted to
discourage intensive farming by setting a density limit of 1.4 head per
hectare. This would now rise to 2 head per hectare.
A ceiling on intervention stockpiles of beef would be established at 800,000
tonnes in 1993, descending gradually to 300,000 tonnes in 1997.
The beef mountain now stands at some some 1m tonnes, but only because a
further 1m tonnes was sold abroad last year at prices around a quarter of
market levels. Equally, the complex 'safety net' arrangement, whereby the
Commission must buy in surplus beef once prices fall below 72 per cent of EC
'intervention' prices, would have its price trigger lowered to 55 per cent -
though this presupposes a 15 per cent price cut.
British sheep farmers in disadvantaged hill areas would be subsidised for
herds up to 1,000 head, as now, rather than 750, as Brussels had planned.
And milk producers across the EC would be treated more flexibly than the
reform envisaged - especially in Italy, Greece and Spain.
Although ministers last November accepted the thrust of the Commission's
reform, the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands - which as EC president at that
time announced acceptance 'in principle' of the Brussels plan - yesterday
raised objections of principle.
Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, said 'this was not a whole lot of
countries whingeing about national interest, but saying that although we
have to have reform, the avenue down which we are going is the wrong one.'
He called for 'degressive compensation for price cuts ..so that the market
signals get through.'
France, the plan's most resolute opponent until recently, accepted its
thrust. Ireland, its usual ally, was deeply unhappy with the proposed beef
regime. But Germany, the EC's leading advocate of farm subsidy cuts to
enable a Uruguay Round world trade deal, presented a point by point shopping
list of objections which would greatly raise the already criticised cost of
the reform.
The German stance visibly disconcerted the Commission, which now faces a
battery of imponderables before deciding its tactics:
The fast-fading Uruguay Round talks, which hinge on farm subsidy cuts which
condition CAP reform;
Criticised Commission plans to increase EC revenue by a third in the next
five years. Germany, the main net contributor to the EC budget, is least
disposed towards the increase. Yet Mr Ignaz Kiechle, its farm minister, is
adding to the bill even while the Commission is looking for budget cuts -
which may start in agriculture;
Forthcoming elections in the UK, France and Italy, seen as a disincentive to
radical decision-making;
The 1992-93 farm price regime, which the Commission is due to agree on March
18.
Mr Ray MacSharry, author of the reform plan, said yesterday he would 'take
account of the stage and state of the (reform) negotiations' before deciding
whether to introduce new price cuts this year without compensation.
This weapon is a double-edged sword, however, in that it would favour the
position of the UK, Holland and Denmark, in a negotiation where each member
state is trying to safeguard the competitive position of its farmers.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US and Canada declare war on
gypsy moth invaders
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEST-CONTROL authorities in the US and Canada next month will start spraying
insecticide over large parts of three west coast cities, including
Vancouver's central business district, in the hope of controlling an influx
of Asian gypsy moths.
The moths, which have arrived on Russian grain vessels over the past few
years, are voracious foliage eaters, especially of coniferous plant species
found in British Columbia and the north-west US.
Apart from the the threat posed to forests, Canadian authorities are
concerned that Washington may try to contain the moths by imposing a
certification requirement or some other non-tariff barrier on British
Columbia lumber exports.
Aerial and ground spraying is expected to start in Vancouver and the US
cities of Portland, Oregon, and Tacoma, Washington, in the second half of
April. The programme is scheduled for completion in early June.
The Vancouver programme, covering 43,000 acres, has already been approved.
US Department of Agriculture officials are still awaiting funding for the
Dollars 20m budget to spray almost 140,000 acres in Tacoma and Portland.
The US programme also provides for surveys at other high-risk ports used by
vessels from eastern Russia.
The spraying will be done with a bacterial insecticide, known as bacillus
thuringiensis, which is specifically designed to exterminate caterpillars
and has no known effects on humans, large animals or fish.
Mr Gordon Powell, the Canadian official in charge of the Vancouver project,
said that discomfort to humans is expected to be minimal.
Helicopters will spray three applications of the insecticide over
Vancouver's downtown area between sunrise and 7am when few people are on the
streets.
The Asian moths were first noticed in substantial numbers in the winter of
1990-91.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Strong rise in home sales adds to

A STRONG rise in home sales, improved leading indicators and upbeat remarks
on the economy from the chairman of the Federal Reserve left bond prices
lower yesterday, although late short-covering lifted the market off the
bottom.
In late trading, the benchmark issue had recovered from an early  3/4 -point
fall and was down  11/32 at 100 25/32 , yielding 7.924 per cent. The
two-year note also bounced back from initial losses, and by late afternoon
was unchanged at 99 27/32 , yielding 5.442 per cent.
Prices opened easier and lost further ground on the news that US home sales
rose 12.9 per cent in January, more than double the expected increase, and
that the index of leading economic indicators had risen 0.9 per cent in
January. They were the latest sets of data to point to a recovery in the
housing market.
Sentiment took a further knock when Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
said that the recent easing of monetary policy was 'clearly working', and
that he believed there was probably sufficient stimulus in the system to
ensure a recovery. However, as he did at other recent Congressional
appearances, Mr Greenspan left the door open for further interest rate cuts,
which would act as a form of policy 'insurance' if economic growth was too
sluggish.
THE COMBINATION of the yen's weakening against the US dollar and the
overnight drop in the US Treasury bond market helped push Japanese
government bond prices lower yesterday.
The dollar traded at Y130.05 in Tokyo on optimism about the state of the US
economy, compared with Monday's Tokyo close of Y129.53. Traders said there
was no sign of central bank intervention in Tokyo trading as the Japanese
currency weakened.
The benchmark No 129 bond opened with a yield of 5.41 per cent and closed at
5.44 per cent. The key June futures ended at 101.90, down from Monday's
close of 102.18, having traded in a range of 101.86-102.14. Meanwhile,
overnight unsecured call rates eased slightly, trading at around 5.56 per
cent yesterday.
The market is waiting for Friday's quarterly 'Tankan' report from the Bank
of Japan in the hope that it will encourage a cut in the official discount
rate. The report is expected to show growing pessimism among businessmen
over the state of the Japanese economy.
BUDGET and election worries prompted profit-taking in the UK government bond
market yesterday, with long-dated issues losing over a quarter of a
percentage point.
Traders noted some switching from long-dated gilts into shorter maturities,
but said market participants saw little scope for a significant advance in
gilt prices over the next few weeks because of the UK Budget and election
campaign.
Trading was mainly futures-driven, with yesterday's volume of 29,000
contracts well above average. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07
fell from 116 9/32 to 115 31/32 . Among short-dated stocks, the 10 per cent
gilt due 1996 slipped from 102 3/32 to 102.00.
GERMAN government bonds regained their early losses to close higher on the
day, with the March Liffe bund futures contract rising from its opening of
88.07 to trade at 88.19 by late afternoon.
Traders noted some switching out of five-year bunds into shorter-dated
issues, mainly two-year paper. The market remained fairly quiet because of
the holiday: in the futures market, only 23,000 March futures contracts and
about 24,000 of the June contracts were traded . The June futures contract
takes over from the March contract this week.

<TEXT>
ROCHE, the Swiss drug company which is one of the largest and
fastest-growing in the industry, yesterday extended its involvement in
genetic engineering by signing a deal to promote a new cystic fibrosis drug,
DNase, made by Genentech of the US, writes Daniel Green.
DNase should be approved by 1994. Sales could be as high as Dollars 250m a
year, and Roche will develop and promote the drug in Europe.
The deal is the latest in a series following Roche's acquisition two years
ago of a 60 per cent stake in Genentech for Dollars 2.1bn. Genentech was one
of the pioneers in genetic engineering. Last year, Roche paid Dollars 300m
for a genetic engineering production process called PCR developed by Cetus,
a US drug company.

TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn and currently in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, made an operating loss of Dollars 353.5m
in 1991.
This compared with a Dollars 162.3m deficit in the same period a year
earlier, and a small Dollars 24.3m profit in 1989.
The 1991 figure came on revenues down from Dollars 4.6bn to Dollars 3.66bn.
TWA sold a number of assets during the year and these included leading
routes between three US cities and London's Heathrow Airport - which were
acquired by American Airlines.
Most of TWA's operating expense items were lower year-on-year, including
fuel, which fell from Dollars 898.4m in 1990 to Dollars 647.7m.
However, the overall slump in revenues outweighed the reduction in total
operating costs, from Dollars 4.77bn to Dollars 4.01bn.
At the after-tax level, the operating loss is transformed in a small net
profit of Dollars 48.3m, thanks largely to the Dollars 681.7m gain on asset
sales, against Dollars 205m.
Interest expenses were Dollars 287m, against Dollars 302.8m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SAUDI Arabian prince has asked the US Federal Reserve for permission to
convert Dollars 590m of preferred stock in Citicorp, the US's largest bank,
into common shares, making him the biggest single Citicorp shareholder, with
over 14 per cent of the bank.
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has asked to be allowed to convert the preferred
stock into a further 9.6 per cent of Citicorp common, while retaining a
separate 4.8 per cent common equity stake he already owns.
If the Fed agrees, this would boost the Saudi's overall stake to nearly 14.4
per cent, larger than the 8.05 per cent shareholding owned by Wellington
Management, a Boston-based investor presently the biggest single Citicorp
shareholder.
The Federal Reserve confirmed it received the request, but would not comment
on it.
In February 1991, when Prince Al-Waleed invested Dollars 590m in the
convertible Citicorp shares, he told the Federal Reserve he would file a
notice if he wished to retain his 4.8 per cent of common stock as well as
the preferred paper. Under the terms of the agreement, the Saudi cannot own
over 15 per cent of Citicorp for the next four years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOWARD Smith, the Sydney-based shipping and engineering group, felt the
sting of the Australian recession in the first half to December with a 75
per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 25.67m (USDollars 19.74m) from
ADollars 104.07m a year earlier, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The decline was in spite of a 7.6 per cent increase in sales to Dollars
352.2m from ADollars 327.25m.
The interim dividend is being held at 10 cents a share.
A key factor in the result was a reduction from ADollars 15.8m to ADollars
6.9m in interest revenue following payment last year of a ADollars 140.1m
special dividend and capital return. This payout capped a turbulent period
for the company as it battled to throw off effective control by the Adelaide
Steamship group, then headed by entrepreneur Mr John Spalvins.
Howard Smith directors said the company had suffered from recession in
Australia and the UK, where it controls the Medway towage and salvage group.

<TEXT>
FORGET the Japanese encroachment into baseball and Hollywood. L. L. Bean,
the quintessentially US sporting goods group, yesterday signed an agreement
with two Japanese companies, which will establish a chain of stores selling
L. L Bean goods in Japan.
L. L Bean, a privately owned company based in Freeport, Maine, said the
first store would open in Tokyo, this autumn. The plan then envisages
establishing five stores within five years.
The two Japanese partners, who have set up the L. L. Bean Japan
joint-venture company, are Seiyu, a large Japanese supermarket chain and
part of the Saison group, and Matsushita Electric Company, whose brand names
range from Panasonic to Technics and which recently acquired the US
entertainment group, MCA.
They will run the retail operation in Japan, with L. L. Bean supplying the
vast bulk of the stock. L. L. Bean will also provide training for the
Japanese sales staff.
Speculation that L. L. Bean goods could be sold through Japanese retail
outlets has circulated for some time, and yesterday L. L. Bean said it was
approached by the Japanese a year and a half ago.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and Varity to make job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW JERSEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the US telecommunications company, is
to shed between 3,000 to 6,000 non-management and 200 to 400 management jobs
with the closure of 31 offices in 21 states by the end of 1994, AP-DJ
reports from New Jersey.
AT&amp;T said yesterday the job losses and office closures would result from
plans to introduce its new voice-recognition technology nationwide,
automating many long-distance calls now handled by operators. Developed by
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, this technology recognises and responds to the human
voice.
The company said it based its decision to eliminate the positions and close
the offices on 'a growing trend among callers to place long-distance calls
without operator assistance, on other recent improvements in
operator-services technology, and on the introduction of voice recognition'.
The company currently employs about 18,000 operators.
AT&amp;T said it hopes to offer other jobs to affected employees and has
identified eight types of job openings likely to occur between 1992 and
1994. Those not placed will receive severance of up to 104 weeks' pay.
Meanwhile, Varity, maker of Massey-Ferguson farm machinery and Perkins
diesel engines, is to cut another 1,300 jobs and sell five subsidiaries as
part of a renewed effort to staunch its losses, writes Bernard Simon in
Toronto.
Varity said the latest round of layoffs would cut its payroll to 16,800 by
the end of the year. This level represents a 20 per cent reduction compared
with two years ago and only about a quarter of the workforce in the
company's heyday in the late 1970s when it was known as Massey-Ferguson.
Mr Victor Rice, Varity's chairman, said that the latest measures were a
response to 'severe and prolonged recessionary conditions' in leading
markets and the company expected no near-term improvement in conditions.
Besides farm and industrial machinery, Varity's interests include
Kelsey-Hayes, a Michigan-based manufacturer of anti-lock brakes and other
vehicle components. Automotive products now contribute more than 40 per cent
of revenues.
Varity, which moved its head office last year from Toronto to Buffalo, New
York state, hoped to return to the black in the middle of last year, but
suffered a Dollars 62.7m loss for the nine months to October 31.
The restructuring will result in special charges of Dollars 110m, to be
included in fourth-quarter results due for release later this month. About
Dollars 70m of the total will reflect the writedown of five non-core
businesses which are being put up for sale.

<TEXT>
ALUSUISSE, the Swiss aluminium, speciality chemical and packaging group,
reports a steep fall in profits for last year and says its plans to cut its
dividend.
Net profits tumbled 63 per cent to SFr101m (Dollars 67.7m). According to
Alusuisse the main problem has been the collapse of aluminium prices.
The directors expect some improvement in results this year as the group
continues to diversify away from its commodity-based activities. But they
have nevertheless recommended cutting the dividend from 14 per cent to 10
per cent.
Sales were flat at SFr6.3bn, with aluminium sales amounting to just over
half the total, chemicals 30 per cent and packaging 17 per cent. The group
revealed a breakdown of its operating profits for the first time, with
aluminium contributing SFr106m, chemicals SFr131m and packaging SFr83m.
Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, said the group had curtailed its
aluminium capacity by 20 per cent in response to the slump in metal prices
and might have to cut it further if prices did not recover soon.
The directors also proposed a capital restructuring, consisting of
converting the SFr250 bearer shares into one SFr125 bearer share and one
SFr125 registered share. Participation certificates are also to be converted
at the rate of 10 PCs for one SFr250 bearer share.
As part of the changes, the limit on ownership of registered shares in
Alusuisse is to rise from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. The company plans a
issue of bonus options to raise SFr17.5m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEX Bernstein, chairman of Granada Group yesterday had to justify at its
annual meeting the forced resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of
Granada Television.
As the meeting was drawing to an end, with the time for questions already
over, Mrs Patricia Davies, a shareholder and former producer on the
University Challenge television programme, said she wanted some explanation
for the departure. Mr Plowright had always been associated with high
quality, she said.
Mr Bernstein replied that while he understood the concern it was a team not
an individual that had won the new franchise for Granada.
'I am quite confident that Granada Television can continue to carry out the
terms of the franchise satisfactorily,' he said adding that all ITV
companies were having to look at their cost structures. Granada Television
could be no exception.
Mr Gerry Robinson, the new chief executive who sought Mr Plowright's
resignation, said although the departure was very unfortunate it was
'absolutely vital' to have straight-talking from a new chief executive on
what was required from every part of the group in terms of better profits
for shareholders and employees.
There had been a lack of consistent dialogue with Mr Plowright. 'I was sad
about that but it could not be allowed to get in the way of nursing the
company back to health,' Mr Robinson said.
Mr Bernstein was attacked by Mr David Boulton, former head of arts and
regional programmes at Granada, for 'giving in to pressure from others' in
getting rid of Mr Plowright.
'Our dismay and concern is all the greater when the axemanship is done by a
new chief executive whose quality record in the business he ran before is
deplorable,' Mr Boulton said. He added that Compass, the industrial catering
group run by Mr Robinson, had lost contract after contract.
Mr Robinson said that Compass had won caterer of the year awards and said he
was dedicated to quality.
'I believe totally in quality and I have no time at all for people who
confuse spending with quality,' said Mr Robinson to a round of applause.
Earlier there had been complaints about the size of payments to directors
and in particular the Pounds 579,550 pay-off to Mr Derek Lewis, the former
chief executive. Mr Bernstein said Mr Lewis had been paid his entitlement
under his contract.

Hardanger Properties, the Kidderminster-based retail property developer, is
being placed in administration after the collapse of a rescue package.
The company announced yesterday that certain Hong Kong investors, who in
December proposed refinancing its debts, have withdrawn. Substitute
investors are not acceptable to Barclays, its main creditor.
The shares were suspended at 65p in April following delayed property sales
and high borrowings. The depressed property market prevented the company
making necessary sales to reduce its interest charges.
Hardanger has about Pounds 80m in secured creditors, with Barclays owed more
than Pounds 40m. Unsecured creditors are thought to total less than Pounds
10m.

Hampden Homecare, which operates Texas Homecare stores in Ireland, almost

Pre-tax profit of this USM-quoted group surged from Pounds 506,000 to Pounds
1.3m on turnover of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 22.7m). The previous year was hit
by an extraordinary Pounds 1.8m provision thought necessary following
refusal of planning permission for a new store.
Earnings per share rose to 6.37p (2p). The final dividend is 1.8p for a
total of 2p (0.2p).
In Northern Ireland margins moved ahead significantly. With the exception of
Ballymena, all stores increased sales and profits. The flagship Sprucefield
store re-opened in October 1991, following a fire.
Mr Peter Goldstone is retiring as chairman and will be replaced by Mr

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Masking turbulence with treasury flair -
Abbey National's bad debt problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I THINK we are over the worst in the housing market,' said Mr Peter Birch,
Abbey National chief executive, sitting in his Baker Street office
surrounded by soothing if slightly predictable pictures of the great English
medieval abbeys.
Bland pictures seemed a fitting backdrop for what were on the face of them
soothing and predictable results at a time of market turbulence.
Abbey National's 1991 pre-tax profits landed almost exactly on target at
Pounds 618m, 6.2 per cent above 1991 - and this despite a sharp increase in
bad debt provisions, which soared from Pounds 55m a year ago to Pounds 155m.
The result makes Abbey the second most profitable UK bank after Lloyds, well
ahead of Barclays, even though Abbey National's total assets of Pounds
57.4bn are less than half those of Barclays.
Other features of the results contained little to alarm the market. Losses
at Cornerstone, Abbey National's estate agency operation, were down by
Pounds 1m on 1990. The cost income ratio of 45.1 per cent was slightly up on
last year, but still about 20 percentage points below those of most high
street banks.
Instead of hailing these results as a triumph, the market treated them with
considerable caution. Abbey National's share price fell by 11p during the
day and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the City stockbrokers who know the company
best, downgraded their recommendation from hold to sell.
'If you take out the huge jump in profits from treasury operations, which
went up from Pounds 2m in 1990 to Pounds 62m last year, then you are left
with a much less sparkling performance by Abbey National's core retail
banking businesses,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
banking analyst.
The group's UK retail banking profits in fact went down by 4.5 per cent to
Pounds 585m from Pounds 612m.
The fall is entirely due to bad debt problems. Abbey National's heartland is
still London and the south-east, the areas which have been hit hardest in
the housing market recession. Without provisions, UK retail operations would
have risen by 15 per cent to Pounds 772m.
This lacklustre performance may not seem very surprising given the state of
the UK housing market. Profits are expected to be well down this year at
other large south-eastern based mortgage lenders such as Alliance &amp;
Leicester and Woolwich building societies.
But some large lenders have fared relatively well. Yorkshire Building
Society is expected to announce a 20 per cent increase in its pre-tax
profits this year. National &amp; Provincial, regarded for several years as one
of the more troubled lenders in the industry, last week posted a 68 per cent
increase in its pre-tax profits for 1991.
The success of Abbey National's treasury operations reflects the fact that,
like TSB, it is a bank sitting on a large chest of capital raised at the
time of its flotation.
Abbey National has engaged in some cautious diversification, creating a
network of subsidiaries in Spain, Italy, and France with the single European
market in mind, and last year it bought Scottish Mutual Life Assurance and
is using the Scottish company to set up its own life assurance subsidiary.
Mr Birch says that Abbey National does not want to risk wasting its capital
on diversification which might go awry, like TSB's ill-fated purchase of
Hill Samuel.
In fact one post-flotation initiative, the strong new Treasury team created
since 1989 under Mr Gareth Jones, was responsible for over half the group's
balance sheet growth and 10 per cent of this year's profits.
But Treasury operations are a volatile business where banks have to work
hard to earn even small margins. Mr Jones's team is unlikely to be able to
pull off the same feat two years running. Abbey National's retail operations
are going to have to pedal hard in 1992 if the bank's soothing aura of
success is to be maintained.

FT  04 MAR 92 / ITT sells remaining Alcatel stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALCATEL-Alsthom, the French telecommunications equipment group, is buying
the 30 per cent stake held by ITT of the US in Alcatel, its main
telecommunications subsidiary, in a deal worth FFr18.7bn (Pounds 1.9bn).
The acquisition marks the end of a six-year partnership between
Alcatel-Alsthom and ITT. It also represents a strategy change for the US
conglomerate, which has been examining ways to help its lacklustre share
price.
Alcatel-Alsthom will pay FFr13.2bn in cash, in three instalments, for the
stake. ITT will take a 7 per cent holding in the Alcatel-Alsthom group,
making it the second largest shareholder after Societe Generale, the French
bank.
The deal surprised and pleased Wall Street, where ITT's shares rose Dollars
3 1/8 to close at Dollars 69 3/4 amid speculation this might be the first of
a number of restructuring moves by the company.
ITT's shares have advanced strongly during the past week, from about Dollars
60, after Mr Rand Araskog, chairman, said he was considering a number of
options to make the company 'more exciting to the investment community'.
ITT and Alcatel-Alsthom came together in 1986 when they merged their
telecommunications interests in Alcatel, enabling it to outstrip American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph as the world's single biggest manufacturer of
telecommunications equipment.
ITT, whose origins lay in the telecommunications business, retained a 37 per
cent stake in the combined operation (later reduced to 30 per cent), while
its French partner held just over 56 per cent. Under the terms of the
original agreement each partner could exercise pre-emptive rights if the
other sold all or part of their shares.
Alcatel-Alsthom decided to do so when ITT said that it wanted to sell its
shares.
Alcatel, which is the largest single part of Alcatel-Alsthom, made net
profits of FFr4.09bn in 1990, and recently reported an 18 per cent increase
in sales to FFr109.7bn in 1991.
Alcatel-Alsthom is funding the share purchase with debt, increasing its
gearing from 16 per cent to 26 per cent.
ITT said it would record an after-tax gain of about Dollars 400m. Some
analysts were surprised the figure was not higher, but the company faces a
steep US tax bill on the deal.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Japan's gift to executive stress: the pocket-size
resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, have
been ordered to bring letters of resignation to work each morning - as a
reminder that they are personally responsible for hauling the company out of
loss.
Mr Hiroshi Hamada, Ricoh's president, told the 23 directors, each of whom is
directly responsible for a business division, to 'have a resignation letter
in your shirt pocket'.
He warned that he wanted to promote younger managers, and hinted that
resignations could become effective at any time if the company's performance
did not improve.
The Ricoh resignation method is one of the more dramatic responses to
plunging profits at Japanese companies, which have been shaken by a slowing
domestic economy.
Ricoh said yesterday that most of the directors had already drafted their
resignation letters, and some had submitted them to Mr Hamada.
His order came after Ricoh announced that it would report a Y5.8bn (Pounds
25m) pre-tax loss for the year to March 31, the first loss since the company
was listed in 1949.
Ricoh said the resignation threat should be seen as 'not merely ceremony',
as is generally the case with executive resignations in Japan.
At the height of the stock scandals last year, the president and chairman of
Nomura Securities resigned to take responsibility for the shame brought on
the company.
'The resignations show our sincerity. They indicate our responsibility to
our shareholders, customers, and our employees,' Ricoh said.
Ricoh, like Sony Corporation, is regarded as a maverick in Japanese
industry, having risen outside the powerful corporate families known as
keiretsu. These companies, guided by often charismatic executives, have
cultivated strong corporate cultures and sometimes employ unorthodox methods
in crisis control. However, Sony, which expected to report a Y20bn loss,
said yesterday that it would not start a 'resignation movement'.
Mr Hamada is fond of philosophy and likes to remind listeners of 'The Spirit
of the Three Loves', the company's guiding principles of: 'Love Your
Neighbour, Love Your Country, and Love Your Work.' In a recent speech, he
explained that he liked executives to 'own' their problems. By drafting
resignation letters, he had forced the directors to stake their future on
the company's recovery.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Pension fund trustees face stiff rules: MPs to propose
reforms in line with regulations for company directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION FUND trustees would be subject to the same strict rules as company
directors under proposals for sweeping pension law changes to be put forward
next week by a cross-party parliamentary committee.
The select committee on social security, which has been looking into the
disappearance of hundreds of millions of pounds from pension funds
controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, will cite Companies Act rules
requiring an annual general meeting for members, timely release of annual
accounts and the requirement that company directors be 'fit and proper'
people.
It will urge that a new pensions law translate these rules into requirements
for trustees.
Also, the committee will recommend that the remit of the Occupational
Pensions Board, which oversees some aspects of pensions operations, be
extended to cover all the assets of occupational pension schemes.
At present the board is only required to determine that each scheme has
enough assets to pay the small portion of workers' pensions which would
otherwise be covered by the state. For the great majority of UK pension
funds which have 'opted out' of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme,
that portion is no more than 20 per cent of a worker's pension.
MPs on the committee are expected to agree today a report which calls for a
Royal Commission or lower level inquiry following the failure of regulators
to stop Mr Maxwell from raiding pension funds of the companies he operated.
Separately, the Department of Social Security is understood to be taking
steps to organise an inquiry, just below the level of a Royal Commission,
into pension fund legislation to be announced after the general election.
The committee is expected to condemn the City regulatory authorities for
being intimidated by Mr Maxwell.
They believe there was a vacuum in the regulatory system which justifies a
radical overhaul after the general election of UK pension legislation.
The report is expected to call on the Securities and Investments Board, the
City watchdog, to review the activities of the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation which allowed Mr Maxwell to control a fund
management company that gave him personal access to his employees' pension
funds.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, moved to quell speculation
that the report would recommend compensation for Maxwell pensioners. The MPs
have run out of time before the election for a full inquiry into the role of
banks in the affair.
'At the centre of the inquiry has been concern for Maxwell pensioners, and
we are anxious not to raise expectations about compensation which we could
not fulfil,' he said.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Thought for paws as Lib Dems enter election dogfight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LET'S HOPE it is April 9. Conclusive evidence emerged yesterday that
Britain's political parties have run out of things to say in their long
pre-election phoney war.
As Messrs Kinnock and Major engaged in their twice-weekly Commons dogfight,
the Liberal Democrats solemnly unveiled 'A Pet is for Life', a policy
document which crowed that they were 'the first party to formulate a policy
for pets'.
This bid for the potentially crucial canine and feline vote includes a
'pets' equivalent to the MOT certificate', to be free at the point of sale,
and an Animal Protection Commission to enforce and recommend changes to
legislation.
Mr Simon Hughes, the party's fresh-faced proponent of good causes, has high
hopes of getting such a commission on to the agenda if the Liberal Democrats
become involved in post-election coalition talks.
Yesterday's policy document covered 'an extremely important subject indeed',
Mr Hughes said, struggling in vain to keep a straight face and fooling
nobody. The Protection of Animals Act of 1911, on which much of the law is
still based, was, after all, 'a piece of Liberal legislation'.
As he proceeded with his supporting address to a thinly attended press
conference, we learnt among other fascinating tit-bits that the Liberal
Democrat environment spokesman used to prosecute on behalf of the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
He also 'came from a home that had dogs, pigeons and mice', once owning a
rodent named Priscilla.
Disappointingly bereft of furry or feathered props, the honourable member
for Southwark and Bermondsey went on to pledge stringent Liberal Democrat
restrictions on 'tail-docking, ear-cropping and other cosmetic mutilations'.
Nobody under the age of 16 should be able to buy animals from pet shops, he
proposed. Compulsory registration of dogs and their owners should be
introduced.
As he rabbited on, a dog-eared poster of party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown gazed
down approvingly on the proceedings. I took my leave as an earnest
discussion of the 'microchip method' of dog identification started with a
doggy trade journalist.

FT  04 MAR 92 / IoD urges radical economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY directors yesterday urged an incoming government to adopt sweeping
economic reforms based on the application of market forces and the eventual
abolition of income tax and other direct taxes.
The Institute of Directors published its 112-point programme as a challenge
to the main political parties as they prepare their election manifestos. The
tone of the document is uncompromising. It advocates a free market economy
untrammelled by subsidies or any government interference.
Among the more provocative recommendations are the abolition of capital
gains and inheritance taxes as well as income tax, the privatisation of all
remaining state-controlled enterprises - including motorways  - and the
introduction of tax relief on health insurance and private education.
The document only has a prospect of acceptance by a Conservative
administration. Even there, support could be less than total.
The institute, under Mr Peter Morgan, its director-general, and his
predecessor Sir John Hoskyns, is regarded as one of the more influential
policy organisations of the right, although it has no direct political
affiliation.
However, there is an assumption that Mr John Major is not as keen on some of
the IoD's ideas as was Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Morgan said at a London press conference yesterday that a refocusing of
the balance between government, markets and the individual was the theme of
the document. 'It outlines what company directors want the new government to
do and what they do not want it to do.'
He said: 'Their adoption will create favourable conditions in which
directors can lead their businesses and create wealth. The prosperity of
everyone in the UK depends on their success.'
A complete overhaul of the tax system would include establishing a single
rate of income tax. This would fall to 20p in the next parliament and
subsequently be abolished altogether. The cost of abolishing a range of
direct taxes would be met by limiting the growth of public expenditure to
half the growth in the economy.
Two new government departments are advocated, one for the market, based on a
reformed Trade and Industry Department, and the other for human resources,
responsible for ensuring education, training and employment policy is geared
to individual needs.
David Owen writes: Labour last night called on Mr Major to make clear which
of the institute's proposals enjoyed Conservative support, warning that
voters would 'seriously suspect' the manifesto was the party's 'secret
agenda'.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Europe's security surplus - Instead of
setting up rival structures, Nato should become the 'secular arm' of CSCE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The challenges we face in this new Europe cannot be comprehensively
add-ressed by one institution alone, but only in a framework of interlocking
institutions tying together the countries of Europe and North America.'
Thus spake the heads of state and government of Nato at their meeting in
Rome last November. And of course they were right. The new order in Europe
was never expected to be orderly, and the 'new security architecture',
lacking a single architect, was bound to be a ramshackle affair.
The phrase 'interlocking institutions' has caught on, but 'institutional
overcrowding' might be a more apt description of what is happening. Broadly
speaking, all the institutions are trying to move in the same direction -
that is, they aspire to absorb and integrate the ravaged economies and
warring nationalities of central and eastern Europe into the relatively
prosperous and peace-loving North Atlantic world. Their plurality could even
be seen as a fine example of the pluralism they all preach. Even if they all
map out different routes to the common destination, that could be a good
thing - so long as their 'interlocking' does not take the form of gridlock.
Things are not that bad yet, but the routes are beginning to criss-cross in
a rather alarming way. Or, to change the metaphor, the alphabet soup is
getting a little too thick to be digestible; and Nato is guilty of
thickening it gratuitously. That is ironic, because Nato's strongest
argument throughout this bewildering process has been that we should hold on
to and make use of existing institutions, rather than invent airy-fairy new
ones which would only spawn new bureaucracies. Yet Nato itself has spawned
an unnecessary and possibly mischievous institution: the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council (NACC).
You can tell there is something wrong with this animal by the very fact that
it has to be pronounced nack-see, to distinguish it from NAC, the North
Atlantic Council, which is Nato's governing body. (One of the most common
symptoms of institutional overcrowding is what we doctors call 'acronymic
overload'.) But a more serious objection is that it duplicates the
membership of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE),
while taking over what should be that body's functions.
NACC was formed at the end of last year as a forum for co-operation between
Nato and its erstwhile adversaries, the former members of the former Warsaw
Pact. In large part it was intended to console them for Nato's unwillingness
to admit them as members or give them security guarantees. It thus comes
into the category of confidence and security building measures, which has
always been the concern of CSCE. Its most useful role at present is to
discuss the implementation by the republics of the former Soviet Union of
arms control agreements signed by Moscow - especially the treaty on
conventional forces in Europe. But that treaty, although negotiated between
the members of the two alliances, was formally part of the CSCE process, and
its adjustment to the new realities could have been done within a CSCE
framework.
It is true that the new democracies, which were very keen on CSCE two years
ago when it seemed to offer the best hope of escaping from the old blocs and
forging new ties with the west, have lately shown more interest in Nato, as
being something firmer and more tangible. But what is firm and tangible
about Nato is its character as a mutual defence pact and military alliance,
with integrated force structures and a firm commitment of 'all for one and
one for all'. And it is precisely those aspects of Nato that are being
withheld, for the time being anyway, from central and eastern Europe.
If central and east European countries are disillusioned with CSCE it is
because Nato countries have been very cautious about investing it with any
real security functions, or with the staff and resources to carry them out.
CSCE could have been given a boost, had it been made the forum for the kinds
of security co-operation now to be carried on in NACC.
The parallelism between the two bodies has been underlined by the way they
have both reacted to the break-up of the Soviet Union. Both have been ready,
without any real debate, to welcome all the ex-Soviet republics including
those of central Asia which, by definition, are outside Europe and, for that
matter, a very long way from the North Atlantic.
This makes it all the more obvious that the main difference between the two
organisations is that NACC, while including all Nato's former adversaries,
excludes Europe's 'neutral and non-aligned' states. It is as though Nato
believed that Moldova and Tajikistan, which are members of NACC had somehow
become more deserving, more reliable, or more important to north Atlantic
security than Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland: a
manifestly absurd proposition.
Institutions once created are hard to get rid of. NACC is probably with us
now until such time as all its members are admitted to Nato proper. But
people do seem to be realising already that Nato's true vocation in the post
cold war world is to become the military muscle of CSCE.
Nato's secretary-general, Mr Manfred Worner, suggested recently that the
alliance could make its military expertise, and even troops, available for
missions ordered by CSCE. Within the last ten days that idea has been taken
up by such diverse authorities as the German Social Democrats, the Dutch
foreign minister and, most interestingly, the chief US delegate to the CSCE
review conference, to be held in Helsinki later this month.
CSCE has no troops of its own, but it is developing a political and
diplomatic role, in response to an evident demand. Two weeks ago it sent a
mission to Armenia and Azerbaijan, led by the charismatic Count Karl
Schwarzenberg, who is chief of staff to President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia. (He apparently worked wonders in persuading nervous Russian
helicopter pilots to fly the mission into Nagorno-Karabakh in the midst of
the fighting.)
Last Friday, after hearing the mission's report, the CSCE, meeting in Prague
at the level of senior civil servants, put forward a plan for a ceasefire,
humanitarian aid, renewal of the Russo-Kazakh mediation effort and the
deployment of ceasefire observers drawn from CSCE countries, if the warring
communities can agree to accept this.
Such observers would need military experience, and Nato would be well placed
to supply them. It could also supply a peacekeeping force if that proves to
be necessary - the UN's capacities in this department being already
stretched to breaking point. It is ironic to think that a Nato force would
now almost certainly be more acceptable politically than a Russian one, on
what was a few months ago Soviet territory, and that the Russians themselves
would be delighted to see it go there.
Of course, even if Nato supplies the expertise and logistics, there is no
need for a CSCE peacekeeping force to be drawn exclusively from Nato
members. If Germany, for instance, had constitutional inhibitions about
sending its own troops, perhaps it could pay 'scutage' in lieu and the money
could be used to finance, say, a Polish or even a Serb or Croat contingent.
Experience of other people's wars might help the armed forces of some east
European countries to see their own problems in better perspective; and they
could certainly do with the hard currency.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Bank icons under threat: The response of UK clearers to poor
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Pearse is something of an iconoclast, for a lifelong banker.
Reflecting on the recent financial results of the English clearing banks -
their worst since the 1930s by most measures  - Midland's chief executive
wondered whether a clearing bank needed to be involved in the transmission
of money.
Here speaks the banking heretic. The process of collecting cheques and
shipping them to the payee's bank underlies all clearers' mainstream
activities. Mr Pearse's question is the equivalent of British Rail's
chairman asking whether BR should be involved in managing the national
network of railway lines.
But Mr Pearse believes that the clearers - Barclays, National Westminster,
Midland and Lloyds - have been so shocked by their financial results that
they will 'have to re-examine the fundamentals of how they operate'. The
spotlight must fall on their money transmission networks, which have huge
running costs.
The weakness of their performance is shown up by the better figures released
yesterday by Abbey National, a much simpler business serving personal
customers. An analysis of the clearers' results shows why a re-evaluation of
the way the industry operates may be necessary. Last year the clearers lost
Pounds 5.6bn on their loans - or to use the technical term, they made
provisions to cover loan losses of that magnitude.
The bad debt charges were the biggest ever to afflict these banks - a
particular humiliation given that they arose in the heart of their
traditional business, lending to small companies and individuals.
However, the threat to the English clearers should not be exaggerated. They
all remained in profit, in spite of the fears of industry observers that
NatWest and Midland would fall into losses for the first time since they
began to disclose their profit and loss accounts two decades ago.
Indeed the clearers pushed up revenues from fees and commission and
increased their interest earnings, so they all made record trading profits
if the effect of bad debt charges is excluded.
The profits picture has prompted complaints from consumer pressure groups
that customers are being forced to pay - in higher charges and wider margins
between borrowing and lending rates - for the banks' lending mistakes.
However, it is arguable that some customers were undercharged in the 1980s.
For instance, Midland's charges and interest rates for personal customers
were uneconomic for many years.
Although there is no doubt that the banks are able to push up prices once or
even twice with impunity - because customers are slow to move their accounts
when dissatisfied - there is little prospect of their obtaining growth from
further such rises. They face too much competition from other financial
institutions in all their main markets, except perhaps the business of
supplying services to small companies.
'They cannot continue pushing up charges indefinitely, or they will lose
business,' comments Mr Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of IBCA, the
agency which rates banks' performance.
Last year's increase in lending margins should be viewed as a blip in a
long-term trend of declining margins. Figures from Lloyds show the margin on
UK lending fell continuously from 7.1 per cent in 1982 to 5.11 per cent in
1990, excluding interest lost on loans that had gone bad, before recovering
to 5.33 per cent in 1991.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, is equally pessimistic about the
prospects of pushing up non-interest earnings. 'We expect revenue growth to
be sluggish throughout the 1990s,' he says. 'The key challenge is to adjust
the cost base to the lower revenue base - cutting costs is the core of
Lloyds' strategy.'
Last year, only the running expenses of Barclays rose sharply. In the case
of Lloyds and Midland, overheads were static and at NatWest they rose in
line with inflation.
Savings were mainly achieved by quietly cutting staff, with significant
consequences. In total, the banks reduced their worldwide workforces by
22,000 to 339,000 - and are likely to cut up to 15,000 in the current year.
But there is a limit to how far banks can cut costs by closing branches and
reducing numbers without alienating both staff and customers. Mr
Monro-Davies says: 'If banks' profits are to grow significantly over the
next few years, they need reductions in the bad debt charge.'
Improving the quality of loans is also a personnel issue. The concept of
individual responsibility for decisions was eroded by a trend to
centralisation in the 1970s and 1980s.
In most industries, the disclosure of such poor results would have led to
sackings and demotions of the managers responsible. But bankers blame the
recession first and foremost for their bad debts.
Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, says no one at his bank has been dismissed
as a direct result of having lent imprudently. 'The spotlight has not fallen
on a person or persons for bad lending,' he says.
Mr Pearse, who says Midland has dismissed some bankers for making bad loans,
accepts that nonetheless there is a problem in attributing blame to
individuals, because big loans were approved by credit committees consisting
of several managers and executives.
As for the small loans which have gone bad, branch managers were often
encouraged by their head offices to increase lending. 'There is no doubt
that we put too much pressure on the managers to make loans,' says a senior
banker.
Midland is reorganising to give more power to branch managers and make them
personally responsible for the performance of their branches. A similar
process of making individuals more accountable is being examined by NatWest.
However, banks also need to be able to keep closer track of individual
businesses. Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays, says the bank is
trying to develop a management system to allow it to measure the risk and
reward of its many different products and services in a much more precise
way.
But banks' fundamental flaw may be that they have become too diversified and
too big. One senior banker recalls that 'a Department of Trade and Industry
inspector who was investigating NatWest's role in the Blue Arrow share issue
told me he thought the problem was that NatWest had become unmanageable'.
Support for this thesis is provided by the superior performance of Lloyds,
which has resisted the temptation to diversify into securities trading and
has concentrated its resources on a limited number of markets. It has
specialised in serving personal customers and medium-sized corporate
customers, reducing its involvement in the more glamorous but less
profitable business of lending to big companies in the UK and around the
world. Although half the size of NatWest and Barclays, it is now more
profitable.
But Mr Pearse points out that divestments of some bank operations are
generally regarded as impossible. Even if, for example, a bank calculated
that providing loans and banking services to companies produced far too low
a return for the capital employed, it might be impracticable to withdraw
from this business.
The reason is that the huge fixed costs of a bank's money transmission
network are supported by all banking revenues, earned from companies and
individuals. Without the revenues from companies, money transmission costs
would be carried by the retail banking business alone - and would probably
make this business unprofitable.
Mr Pearse muses about a possible solution. Banks could merge their money
transmission capabilities, so achieving economies of scale and increasing
productivity. It might be sensible to demerge this activity into a separate
company.
Banks would then be free to concentrate on the businesses of manufacturing
financial products and selling them. The new transmission company would
charge the banks a combination of rent and usage fee.
The thought of having a cheque account at a bank with no direct involvement
in processing and transporting cheques may seem strange. It would, however,
be no more peculiar than buying electricity from a company which plays no
direct part in operating the national grid - and that is already a reality.

Britain's Conservative party is keen to hold on to its lone parliamentary
seat on Tyneside. Since the start of the year, its marginal Tynemouth
constituency has been a favourite visiting place for heavyweight Tory
figures, starting with the prime minister. Now, without warning, the
government has done a U-turn and announced that it will after all upgrade
the 122 miles of the A1 between Newcastle and Edinburgh into a dual
carriageway.
The two Tories who made the joint announcement - transport secretary Malcolm
Rifkind and James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish roads minister  - are both
defending marginal seats in Edinburgh. And the local Tyneside Tory MP's name
is Neville Trotter.
A blatant piece of pre-election pork-barrel politics . . .?

Britain's big insurance companies are enthusiastic supporters of
non-executive directors playing a forceful role in a company's affairs.
Indeed, when it comes to recruiting blue-chip names themselves, they vie
with the big banks for the most sparkling connections.
Yesterday it was General Accident's turn to add a couple more trophy names
to its letterhead. Sir Peter Middleton, the former permanent secretary at
the Treasury now carving out a second career at Barclays, is joined by
Louise Botting, the ex-presenter of Radio 4's Money Box programme. They
enter a boardroom which includes the Earl of Airlie (lord chamberlain of the
Queen's Household), the Earl of Mansfield (first Crown Estates
Commissioner), Lord MacFarlane (one of Scotland's best-connected
businessmen), Sir Nicholas Goodison (chairman of the TSB), Sir Anthony
Cleaver (chairman of IBM UK) and Sir David Nickson (a former CBI president),
to name but a few.
If non-executive directors are really such a good idea, it is difficult to
understand why insurance companies and banks have made so many mistakes and
plunged into such terrible losses.

Germany's Bertelsmann may be only the second largest international
publishing empire (after Time-Warner), but these days its sounds like the
cat that swallowed the canary.
It is feeling very self-satisfied about landing Mikhail Gorbachev for his
first international trip since he gave up the unequal struggle to hold the
Soviet Union together.
The former Soviet superstar will be spending an entire week in Germany. For,
as well as catching up on a bit of sight-seeing with Raisa, he is there to
plug his new book, The Disintegration of the Soviet Union: My Viewpoint.
Bertelsmann brings the tome out, in German, in April.
With a title like that, and the former Soviet leader's leaden prose style,
it will need all the plugging it can get.
The itinerary includes dinner with Chancellor Kohl (they are on familiar
'du' terms), breakfast with President Richard von Weizsacker, and lunch with
former Chancellor Willy Brandt, the inventor of Ostpolitik.
But the unlikely recipient of three whole days of Gorby's time is Theo
Waigel, the finance minister. As leader of the Christian Social Union in
Bavaria - by far the most conservative and formerly anti-Soviet part of the
ruling coalition - he will have a chance to inflict on Gorbachev the
strangest Bavarian practices at his Munich home.
That means attending the 'Fischessen' - a sort of fish stew bash with beer -
with several hundred CSU luminaries on Friday night, in the cavernous and
hideous Hofbrauhaus, a must for any visiting tourist.

The tone of the debate on the future of British television between John
Cleese, the comic actor and maker of classic management training films, and
Gerry Robinson, the new chief executive of Granada, has risen a notch or
two.
When Cleese heard that Robinson had fired David Plowright, chairman of
Granada Television, he fired off a very rude fax. Robinson penned a polite
reply. Now Cleese has counter-attacked again 'in a slightly less abusive
way'.
'You win your franchise as a result of the 'quality threshold' against
rivals who bid four times as much. With the franchise nice and safe, you get
rid of the man whose reputation for quality was largely responsible for your
winning the franchise, and then start dismantling the team that delivered
the programmes,' says Cleese.
Then he goes and ruins his case by wishing Robinson 'fairly good wishes
pending further developments'.

<TEXT>
Stiff upper lips at Bass, owners of the world's largest hotel chain. Its
Holiday Inn franchisee in Sarajevo, which operates the city's premier hotel,
is having staff problems. Service has not been the same since the 310-room
hotel apparently fell into the hands of Serb extremists for a while.
Only this week a colleague was having a quiet drink when guests in the lobby
came under fire from the direction of the management office on the first
floor balcony. After emptying a few rounds, the Serb vigil-
antes then took their place in the hotel restaurant, one of the few
remaining open in a city held under siege by their comrades.
To add insult to injury, the gun-toting Serbs were served by smiling waiters
while guests were told a hot meal would require at least a three-hour wait
and there was no question of a reduction on the bill.
Bass plays down the incident. First it said that it had been in contact with
the hotel and it was so quiet that the general manager had gone home.
But hadn't there been any complaints about shooting? After another call to
the battle-front, Bass confirmed that a group of Serbs had tried to take
over the hostelry on Monday but had been repulsed by Holiday Inn's loyal
security staff. 'It's absolutely back to normal now,' insists Ben
Hanbury, Bass's director of corporate affairs.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Extra hurdle for Emu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PRESSING for the plan for European economic and monetary union (Emu) to
be based firmly on price stability and fiscal discipline, the German
government and the Bundesbank have done Europe a service. The principles of
economic management which have fostered the strength and stability of the
D-Mark are the only ones suited to guide the journey towards a single
European currency.
The Emu treaty agreed at the Maastricht summit in December does not fulfil
all Germany's wishes. But it ensures that the criteria for selecting the
countries taking part in Emu, and for operating the system when and if it
becomes a reality, will embody the Germans' own standards of financial
rectitude. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl keeps pointing out, the legal statute
for the mooted European central bank is more unambiguously geared to
fighting inflation than the 1957 Bundesbank Law.
Despite these successful features, Maastricht was not a triumph for either
German or EC diplomacy. There is still ample opportunity for upsets; and one
now seems to have emerged, with the likelihood that the German parliament
will ratify the Maastricht treaty this summer only with important strings
attached. The procedural details have not yet been worked out. But both
chambers of parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, are expected to
insist on the need to re-examine the Emu treaty in 1996 as a prime condition
for passing the Maastricht agreement this summer.
Final say
German officials say that adding an extra hurdle to the ratification process
is necessary for fundamental constitutional reasons. The German line is that
parliament, not the executive, has to have the final say in deciding whether
Emu really will conform to Bundesbank-style 'stability-first' principles.
German officials declare that this does not add up to a backdoor escape
route from Emu. Nonetheless, insistence on fresh parliamentary appraisal in
four years' time throws an undoubted spanner into the Maastricht works,
which could disturb the ratification machinery in other countries too. If it
is enacted, the Bonn proposal would significantly weaken the 'irreversible'
procedure agreed at Maastricht, under which Emu would enter into force by
1999 at the latest (assuming at least two countries meet the agreed criteria
for economic convergence).
More to lose
Behind Bonn's wish for extra conditions, there are some undoubted
similarities to the motives which led Britain to negotiate its celebrated
'opt out' clause. In view of the D-Mark's status as Europe's strongest
currency, the Germans have much more to lose through Emu than anyone else.
Though in different circumstances to Britain, Germany shares the same
reluctance to give up its monetary sovereignty unless it is sure that its
national interests will be met.
That is a legitimate anxiety. But, having signed up for Emu at Maastricht,
Mr Kohl will now need to make maximum efforts to ensure that a wish for
extra safeguards is not interpreted in other EC capitals as a sign of
flagging interest. The 'irreversible' element to the Emu plan contradicts
the Bundesbank's basic position that Bonn should agree nothing which sets
down an automatic expiry date for the D-Mark. Furthermore, Mr Kohl received
only the vaguest of commitments by the other EC countries to proceed towards
European political union - a goal which Mr Kohl himself had set as the prime
condition for giving his blessing to Emu.
Mr Kohl's dilemma is a delicate one. By appearing three months ago to make
Emu virtually a fait accompli, he bowed to the demands of the Emu
protagonists in France and Italy - but has reaped antagonism from important
parts of the German body politic.
Mr Kohl will not be able to please both groups. Germany is right to insist
that conditions be met before the move to Emu takes place. But the way this
requirement is being reintroduced is bound to awaken doubts about the
credibility of its European commitments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Barker's new play is very well acted, has the odd touch of Barker's
direct use of language, but is otherwise totally, relentlessly, almost
rivetingly boring - not a word I normally use of the theatre. It is tempting
to say that A Hard Heart is about Mrs Thatcher out of office, though a
programme note is even more pretentious. Here is a walled European city
under siege - it could, the note suggests, be the Peloponnesian War.
A woman architect, mysteriously called Riddler, is called in to save the
city and its queen. Even more mysteriously, the woman has a son called
Attila - the product, she says, of a 'single night of love'. Attila is a bit
of a mummy's boy, not at all what the name suggests, and constantly responds
to his mother's desire to kiss her. Riddler, played by Anna Massey, thinks
that she is a genius, even a god, and can do no wrong. However, she does not
succeed in her plans to protect the city and the queen commits suicide.
'I never failed,' says Riddler towards the end, which is where the analogy
with Mrs Thatcher comes in, 'I was ever perfect.' She admits to loving the
crisis and could not bear to be around during a period of peace and
reconstruction.
It is far from clear by this time what has happened to Attila. Riddler seems
set to go off with a man she has described a 'bald idiot', who has declared
his love for her with lines like 'My fingers want to run amok in all your
garments', and has cut off a bit of her skirt which he wears first as a
cod-piece and then on his head.
You might think that, in a plot like that, there must be some redeeming
sense of humour. Not a bit of it. So far as one can tell it is intended to
be desperately serious - all 100 minutes of it, played without an interval.
Ms Massey is a very fine actress. I also like the way Angela Down plays the
queen, and it is true that Barker has written some interesting works in the
past. Yet you must wonder what can be conceivably going through the
Massey/Down heads while appearing in a piece like this. Surely they cannot
believe in it, though I suppose that the director, Ian McDiarmid, must do.
A Hard Heart was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and first broadcast last month.
I made the mistake of listening to a tape of the broadcast version, also
starring Ms Massey - though the rest of the cast is different - before going
to the theatre. Twice in one day is close to torture. The play does not
improve by being on stage; if anything, it seems even more pointless and is
not enhanced by the endless up and down movements of a scale map of the
walled city. Anyone who disbelieves me should listen to Radio 3 on April 21
when it will be rebroadcast. It would be going too far to go to the Almeida
to see it.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: The Road - The Cochrane Theatre, WC1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The black Talawa Theatre Company has taken up long-term residence at what we
used to know as the Jeannetta Cochrane, now brightly refurbished by a
Nigerian architect. Talawa's most recent successes have been in Wilde and
Shakespeare, but understandably they have chosen an African play for their
housewarming. Not that they play Wole Soyinka's piece (first seen in 1965 at
Stratford East) as to the manner born, exactly - there are almost as many
different black English accents to be heard as there are actors.
The Road is meant to be played out 'on the edge of a Lagos motor park'. Sue
Bayes has set it on and among stately heaps of wrecked cars - the Arrabal
echo is apt - stacked two and three deep, which immediately fix one theme of
the play: that on this road, nobody is going anywhere much. At the rear a
handsome arch of stained-glass, suggesting the Christian church that haunts
the 'Professor''s mind, is composed of shattered windscreens. There is
indeed scarcely any real action, but any amount of colourful byplay, and the
car heaps provide ideal springboards for strutting, menacing, leaping and
posing, rapid vanishings and reappearances. (The upward hops from ground to
car-roofs are particularly impressive.)
As directed by Yvonne Brewster, the acting is extrovert and physical above
all. The mostly low-life characters have the sharpness of 3-D cartoons: the
central pair of no-hopers Samson (Cyril Ikechukwu Nri) and Kotonu, who has
gone off being a hired driver (Willie Jonah), the charismatic, obsessive
'Professor' (Ben Thomas with elegant spectacles, watch-chain, shooting-stick
and stage-British diction) who has a nice little earner in driver's licence
forgery, the American sheriff-style police chief (Gregory Munroe) in
cahoots, the wide-boy Say Tokyo Kid (David Webber). Steve Ashton, Lenny
Aljernon Edwards and Akim Mogaji offer vivid silhouettes, too.
In fact this crew recalls Kurosawa's version of The Lower Depths, and even
O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh. Almost everybody projects an image with
hopeful, hopeless braggadocio - but nobody believes anybody else. Current
folklore has it that Nigerian social intercourse runs on just such funny
terms; that may be a myth, but Soyinka illustrates it with bitter, satirical
conviction. He does it, however, in language that runs the gamut between
what seems to be pungent Nigerian English and his own extravaganzas upon it:
polysyllabic, impacted and gnomic.
As delivered in all these tantalising dialects, too much of it was
impenetrable. For most of the audience, understanding two lines out of three
in the first hour or so would have been better than par for the course.
Probably we missed flashes of individual character beyond the cartoons;
certainly the motor of the play, the Professor's mad, visionary drive toward
a blasphemous ceremony which leaves everyone shaken and horrified, revolved
in profound obscurity. Though the dramatic rhythm was persuasive enough, we
needed - well, subtitles.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: Jan Garbarek Group - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That Jan Garbarek's best selling album, I took up the runes (ECM 1419/New
Note), sold best in his native Norway - per capita  - says much about his
recent playing and writing. The saxophonist is one of the German label's
most popular artists and his mistily evocative music is at present spreading
around the UK as part of the newly-launched Silk Cut City Jazz programme.
His group looks and sounds a splendidly Norse affair, as befits the
material. Beside the ascetic form of black-suited Garbarek sits Eberhard
Weber, flaxen hair falling around his electro-bass contraption. Marilyn
Mazur, from Denmark and previously heard with Miles Davis and Wayne Shorter,
stands in the middle of a mixture of exotic percussion and conventional kit
performing an elfin dance. The round, bald, yet otherwise hirsute head of
Rainer Bruninghaus peers from behind the keyboards which provide the chilly
soundscape.
The trademark plaintiveness of Garbarek's own playing cuts this melancholic
accompaniment through, simple hummable melodies ebbing and flowing between
stark improvisation. With the thematic material of 'Runes', which quotes
Nordic folk tales or joiks, he switches easily from swirling drama on tenor
to persuasive and snaking lamentation on soprano. Garbarek might not
improvise in the conventional jazz sense, but his shrill solo excursions are
a marvellous and integral part of the whole.
Weber, an ECM frontman in his own right, is a similarly outstanding soloist:
the masterly technique and bass technology summed up to great melancholic
effect. Bowed, plucked, whittled and beaten before passing through his box
of pedalled tricks, the electro-bass's rich sounds are mesmerising in his
hands. Garbarek's arrangements, with their strong melodic undercurrents, are
ideal for Weber's romantic and grandiloquent ideas.
Mazur, who replaces Nana Vasconcelos in the original Runes line-up, should
simply add to the Scandinavian element but instead brings a curious Eastern
feel with her tiny bells and gongs. Her playing has the appearance of
musical T'ai Chi as she makes sweeping runs around the cymbals and then
suddenly drops to her feet to strike at wood blocks. Bruninghaus, in control
of the dynamics with his synth, is a strident soloist at the grand.
If Garbarek's work with this ensemble is designed to send a shiver down the
spine it does so pleasurably. It fills the senses with North European
tradition, the smell of conifers and wood smoke. One wonders what his next
outing on ECM will offer, given that it features musicians from Pakistan.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Recruitment: When a change is as good as a rest - The
benefits of sabbatical leave to both companies and their employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sabbatical leave - once restricted to academic circles and a few media
organisations - looks set to catch on more widely in the UK. Managers of
post offices, for example, recently won the right to take periods of
extended leave. Mr Ernest Saunders, former Guinness chief, is said to refer
to his spell in Ford Open Prison as his 'sabbatical in Sussex'.
A sabbatical does not necessarily mean having to engage in worthy
self-improving activities directly related to the job; it may mean spending
more time with family, fulfilling a long-held dream or simply rebuilding the
patio.
John Lewis Partnership, which has operated 'long leave' since 1979, cites
the example of a man whose hobby was to keep boa constrictors in his drawing
room. His sabbatical enabled him to do voluntary work in the reptile house
at London Zoo.
A woman from the Peter Jones department store went trekking in the Himalayas
which, she says, was 'not too strenuous after having been on her feet all
day for years'.
Employee representatives concede that, with inflation falling and the
recession squeezing, the scope for delivering impressive-looking pay rises
is limited. More effort is being put into fringe benefits and measures to
improve the quality of life.
Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the Communication Managers'
Association, the union of the 3,000 post office counter managers who
recently won their sabbaticals, is frank about pay prospects for many
groups.
'The point has been reached where, in pure pay bargaining terms, there is
not much further to go,' he says. The particular attraction of the
sabbatical is that, unlike many other perks, it is not taxed as a benefit in
kind, Mr Deegan adds.
One of the most powerful arguments in favour of an extended break from work
from time to time is that, at the very least, it allows employees to recover
fully from the stresses of the job. Longer periods off may also enable
managers to think innovatively and strategically, according to Professor
Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of
Manchester's Institute of Science and Technology.
'My business is blooming,' says Prof Cooper, who acts as a consultant to
organisations battling against the effects of stress. Pressures on
executives and managers are acute, according to Prof Cooper.
'So much is changing. They don't have time to refresh themselves or absorb
new information. There's burn-out all over the place.' Having to take a few
months off work because of burn-out is a kind of enforced - and for the
employer more disruptive - sabbatical, he points out.
In Australia and Prof Cooper's native US, sabbaticals are more common,
although Americans do less well than their UK counterparts when it comes to
annual holidays. According to New Ways to Work, a London-based charity which
promotes more flexible patterns of working, more than 13 per cent of US
companies offer their employees some form of paid sabbatical leave.
Some of these US companies have exported sabbaticals to Europe. McDonald's,
the fast food chain, offers sabbaticals of eight weeks after 10 years of
service. This can be tagged on to the normal five weeks' annual holiday,
giving a block of three months. The benefit is available only to full-time
staff but applies to all ranks.
Unlike McDonald's, Prudential, the UK's biggest life insurer, restricts the
breaks to managers. Three days are awarded for each year of service as a
manager, with sabbaticals of 10-12 weeks the norm. This is in addition to
the normal leave entitlement of six weeks a year, although very senior
managers have no set holidays.
Details of sabbatical schemes do vary considerably. The post office counter
managers' scheme consists entirely of banked leave which can be taken
together with a period of unpaid leave. However, the union is hoping to
build on this by negotiating further paid leave.
John Lewis's 'long leave' is up to six months fully paid for those with over
25 years' service.
Secondment, perhaps to a voluntary organisation or overseas, is a variation
on the theme. Prudential, for example, sometimes allows employees to work
with charities or government departments.
Mr Gwes Lloyd, who is in charge of the company's corporate identity, was
seconded. He is credited with having invented the 10-year passport - which
largely replaced the less economical five-year model - when he spent six
months with the Foreign Office.
The charity Voluntary Service Overseas says ICI and IBM are examples of
companies that sponsor individuals on foreign two-year placements. ICI
currently has a manager who is teaching science in Tonga and IBM has allowed
one of its employees to be a training officer in the ministry of finance in
Malawi.
British Coal has agreed to sponsor one of its employees who has actually
left the company to go and work as a land surveyor in Zimbabwe.
Secondment need not necessarily be overseas: the charity Action Resource
Centre matches secondees from industry, commerce and the public sector with
community organisations in the UK which would like to benefit from their
skills.
Mr Andy Powell, the charity's chief executive, says organisations used to
use secondment as a way of easing employees into retirement or to fill
awkward gaps between jobs or when, for example, workers returned from
postings abroad.
Now, however, secondment is more likely to be used for career development -
as a way of making managers 'broader and more streetwise in a chaotic and
increasingly complex world', says Mr Powell.
Marks and Spencer and Nationwide Anglia Building Society are two examples of
organisations that use secondment in this way early on in potential
managers' careers.
British Rail provides an example of mid-career secondment: Ms Jane Crofts,
who has been with BR for 10 years, was working in customer relations but
wanted to develop skills as a trainer. She has spent six months each with
two local training organisations helping to set up new courses and
developing an accreditation system.
Secondment may even be used as part of an 'exit package'. IBM, for example,
runs a programme which enables employees wanting a second career in the
voluntary sector to take a year's paid secondment.
The option of unpaid or part-paid leave may be used as a way of reducing
staff numbers. British Airways told its 50,000 staff worldwide a year ago
that they could apply for unpaid leave of between one week and three months.
It is this link between time off and slimming down - or 'decruitment' as
Prof Cooper heard it called recently - that has led to another common
phenomenon: the employee who is entitled to a sabbatical but refuses to take
it.
The reason, in a word, is fear, says Prof Cooper. 'The individual is worried
they won't be missed or that someone else will step into their shoes,' he
says. Nor is this necessarily paranoia: fears may be fully justified in
today's corporate jungle, he adds.
The academic's year off to think, research and travel may be more than most
highly-competitive and autocratic organisations, or their insecure managers,
can cope with but Prof Cooper pleads for a start to be made with shorter
periods of leave of between one and three months.
'We need more people from industry in universities, so does government, and
people need to go from government to the private sector,' he says.
Failing that, there are many suburban patios in need of reconstruction.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Management: The multinational myth explodes - A
controversial theory which sets out to re-write conventional wisdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers and politicians take note. The term 'multinational company' has
become so embedded in our business language over the last 30 years that few
people now question what it signifies. But they should, for it is either
meaningless, misleading, or both.
You can certainly forget everything you have read about the emergence of
'stateless' corporations with their activities spread in balanced fashion
across a 'borderless world'. Contrary to the new conventional wisdom, such
enterprises do not exist: with a handful of exceptions, so-called
'multinational', 'global' and 'transnational' companies are merely national
entities with foreign operations.
This is the controversial thesis of Yao-Su Hu, an ex-World Bank economist
who combines his vice-presidency of a Hong Kong college with visiting
professorships at Sussex University and Henley.
In arguing his case, Hu may be stretching a point or two. He also makes a
few factual errors. But, in direction if not in degree, his argument is
closer to the truth than most 'multinational' companies would admit.
Writing in the issue of the California Management Review which is about to
be published, Hu argues that there are precious few real multinationals. At
the very furthest stretch of his definition, they include ICI, Nestle, ABB,
Shell and Unilever - though he says the last three should be classed as
'binational'. Hu's argument has several strands.
Geographic spread and scope. Most so-called multinationals - such as General
Motors, Du Pont, and US General Electric - have less than half their
operations and employees abroad. The only ones which do are British
companies such as ICI, plus some from smaller European nations.
But, just as home country economics and politics are of overwhelming
importance to GM and co, so they are to ICI: the company 'owes more loyalty'
to the UK than to any other country. ICI's case is typical of most
'multinationals', claims Hu.
Ownership and control. At the level of the parent company, these remain
heavily national (or binational), rather than multinational - however much
the company may strive to attract foreign shareholders and stress 'good
citizenship' within its various host nations.
People. Foreigners usually occupy a 'minuscule' fraction of the most senior
positions in top management - much lower than the percentage of foreigners
in the total number of employees. The national character of top management
is especially pronounced in Japanese companies.
Legal nationality and taxation. In law, there is no such thing as a
multinational or global company. So the multinational is exposed to many
jurisdictions around the world. But it usually has a home government and a
home tax authority - that is, a legal and a fiscal nationality that matter
to it more than others. In many cases, the home government can choose to tax
it on its worldwide earnings.
Hu then assesses the various implications of all this.
First, the primary source of a company's international competitive advantage
lies in its home nation, he argues. Foreign sources can supplement national
ones but not replace them. Even Nestle, with 95 per cent or more of its
assets and employees outside Switzerland, gains considerable advantage from
being perceived as Swiss.
Moreover, most 'multinationals' for which data are available do the bulk of
their research and development in the home nation: both IBM and Du Pont, for
example, have a higher proportion of R&amp;D personnel at home than their
domestic ratio of total employees and assets.
The nation where the bulk of a company's R&amp;D takes place is where strategic
and integrated decisions can be taken rapidly, Hu says. It is its
'locomotive'.
Second, Hu concludes that his analysis demolishes Robert Reich's highly
influential 'Who is Us?' article in the Harvard Business Review two years
ago. This claimed that foreign (especially Japanese) companies which
undertake manufacturing in the US - and, in some cases research, design and
development as well - may be more 'American' than American companies with
international operations.
In this part of his argument, Hu is certainly correct. On the other hand, he
vastly underrates the significance to a company, and to the nations
concerned, of a divisional headquarters being transferred away from the home
base.
Where that division is given a global mandate, the parent company - or at
least part of it - does justify the epithet 'transnational' that has begun
to be applied to it. IBM, Unilever, and ABB can all rightly claim this
status.
Nor does Hu recognise that a few companies are starting at least to try to
disperse various corporate head office activities around the world.
This trend, albeit nascent, is another way of becoming 'transnational'. Hu
also underestimates the growing proportion of non-home nation managers at
senior levels in many multinationals, especially European ones but also some
American.
The article contains a few erroneous assertions, such as that multinationals
almost always account internally in their home currency and that the
citizens and institutions of host nations cannot participate directly in the
ownership of multinationals' local subsidiaries. (What about Shell's many
local minority stakes around the world?).
But, apart from such deviations, and the tone of exaggeration that runs
through his article (just like Reich's), Hu's basic drift is correct.
An image of multinationalism, globalism or 'borderlessness' can do wonders
for a company's public relations, especially for an emergent Japanese
enterprise faced with western suspicion. But there is almost always less to
the image than meets the eye.
The substance may gradually catch up with the image, but only over the next
30 years. Meanwhile, Hu has his feet reasonably well rooted in today's
reality. By comparison, Reich is a hopeful time traveller trying to shift
the distant future into the present.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Management: Cleaning up your act at work - A more effective
way to shuffle her papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you get to the office in the morning, do you make yourself a cup of
coffee and start sorting through a pile of papers? 'I must ring X about that
and I'll sort that one out later.' There are papers on your desk and more on
the floor.
In your drawer, along with an umbrella and a tin of shoe polish there are
more papers, but the important fax you were sent yesterday seems to have
disappeared.
It sounds like you do not know how to work. You are in good company.
Inefficiency is rife at all levels.
According to the OECD, productivity of white collar workers barely changed
in the 1980s despite the introduction of computers, while that of factory
workers rose by 75 per cent.
People are trained to do every other aspect of their jobs, but when it comes
to organising themselves they are usually left to their own devices.
Changing bad habits is not easy, but it is possible, according to Jay
Hurwitz of the Institute for Business Technology. His training company
claims to have made 40,000 office workers more productive using what is
grandly described as a 'Personal Efficiency Programme.'
Its ideas are so simple it is hard to believe that people pay good money for
them.
DO IT NOW
The PEP golden rule and a principle that even the most inefficient person
knows to be a good one.
However, simply saying those three words is one thing, living by them is
another. PEP graduates have impressed on them that if they Do It Now they
will
Handle things only once and so save time
Have fewer distractions and concentrate better
Catch problems while they are small
Not have to worry about not doing things or waste time explaining to others
why you have not done so
Once this has really sunk home, you can move to the next principle
GET RID OF CLUTTER
Clear out all your drawers and files. With each piece of paper ask yourself:
have I ever used it and do I reasonably expect to use it? If I throw it
away, and unexpectedly need it, will I be able to get another copy?
Create a 'reference' filing system for papers that pass this test, and
another 'archive' for things that you do not need, but have to keep for
statutory reasons.
Set up tree trays on your desk: In, Out and Pending. The last is not for
things that have been put off, but those that cannot yet be completed.
Use the middle drawer in your desk - or somewhere else close at hand - for
all current work. Divide the work into different projects, each in its own
folder.
Make sure that you have all the other things you need - from telephone
directories to paper clips - to hand.
PLAN YOUR DAY
Don't let yourself be a slave to the in-tray. According to some recent US
studies, managers receive five times as much information as they actually
need. Managers waste too much time reading unnecessary material and clog up
their filing systems with the rest.
Set up a new filing system for every day of the coming month. It should
contain all the relevant papers for that day's meetings and details of
delegated work that is due to be finished on that day. That way you do not
have to clog up your mind with things to remember.
Make yourself a realistic plan for the day-week of priorities for work, and
mark yourself off against them.
Delegate more. According to Hurwitz, most bosses spend 20 per cent of their
valuable time doing things that could be equally well done by their
secretaries.
Do not agree to meetings that are not likely to be useful to you, or that
will make it harder for you to meet your own targets for the week.
It is all easily said. But it seems habits can only be changed under duress.
The PEP team stand over each employee, breathing down their necks, to make
sure they really are throwing away the contents of their drawers.
One man had 20 cardboard boxes in his office containing the papers from
previous jobs. Persuading him to throw them out 'took three days and was a
very painful experience for that individual', says Hurwitz.
The trainers go back after a few weeks and then after a few months to keep
the pressure on. Each time they draw up a written contract against which to
mark the employee. But does it last? 'There is some slippage, but they do
not ever go back to where they started from,' says Hurwitz.
As for me, I was planning to clear out my desk drawers after my conversation
with Hurwitz, but I have not got round to it yet.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith urges four-tier government -
Constitutional Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Smith, shadow chancellor, yesterday threw his formidable political
weight behind his party's commitment to radical constitutional reform if
Labour wins the general election.
Speaking at a lunch organised by the Newspaper Press Fund, the journalists'
charity, Mr Smith called for the large-scale dispersal of decision-making
from Whitehall and Westminster to update 'the constitutional architecture'
of the UK.
Drawing a strong link between systems of government and relative prosperity,
he contrasted the UK's relative decline with Germany's economic success.
Mr Smith dismissed the idea that the Commons was among the west's powerful
and effective legislatures. Concentration of political authority in the
executive had left parliament weak and out of date.
Devolution for Scotland and closer integration in the European Community
should be seen as the starting point for reforms.
He envisaged a structure in which power was properly shared across four
tiers of government. At the lowest level would be local authorities. Above
them the Scottish, Welsh and English regional assemblies proposed by Labour.
The third and fourth tiers would be Westminster and Brussels respectively.
Mr Smith did not mention a move to a proportional voting system at
Westminster. Colleagues believe he would back such a change, however, if it
smoothed the transition to more devolved government.
Mr Neil Kinnock has professed himself to be 'open-minded' about proportional
representation. Mr Jack Cunningham and Mr Robin Cook, however, are among a
growing number of leading Labour figures openly backing a switch from the
first-past-the-post voting system.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, is expected to take up
the theme in a speech next Monday to Charter 88, the pressure group for
constitutional change.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Nadir payments to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Asil Nadir secretly transferred at least Pounds 130,000 in donations to
the Conservative Party during the 1980s from companies within his Polly Peck
business empire, Andrew Jack writes.
A team led by Mr Christopher Morris of accountants Touche Ross, one of the
joint administrators of Polly Peck International, unearthed cheques drawn on
companies within the Polly Peck group between 1985 and 1990. None of the
donations was disclosed in the accounts for the years concerned.
Mr Nadir, who was chairman of PPI, currently faces 66 charges of fraud and
false accounting.
It has been known for some time that Mr Nadir made donations to the
Conservatives but it had previously been believed that these were made
solely from his own money.
Touche Ross confirmed last night that it had identified donations from Polly
Peck companies soon after the group went into administration.
Mr Morris has been advised that nothing can be done to recover the money.
Company legislation requires that political and charitable contributions
made by companies are disclosed in the annual report and accounts. However,
the DTI was unable to confirm last night whether these disclosure
requirements cover subsidiary companies or simply the parent.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Backstage anger as leaders clash
over NHS - Prime Minister's Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAYING TEMPERS and mounting campaign fatigue were clearly in evidence at
Westminster yesterday as the party leaders again clashed over the National
Health Service and party officials traded insults over behind-the-scenes
smear stories.
At what many MPs believed would be the third-last prime minister's question
time before the general election, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, tried
to link alleged underfunding of the NHS with widely anticipated Budget tax
cuts.
Quoting a consultant cardiologist at Guy's Trust Hospital, he said that
doctors were now turning away patients on the grounds that funding for their
operations was unavailable.
Mr Kinnock went on to charge the prime minister with planning to borrow for
tax cuts when the voters' wanted available resources spent on health and
other public services.
'You want to bribe. They want to build. Why don't you listen to them?' he
asked, to a chorus of cheers from the Opposition backbenches.
Mr John Major responded angrily that while the Conservatives had raised NHS
spending beyond the rates promised in the 1987 Labour manifesto, his
opponent still refused to reveal how much he would spend on health.
'Your priorities do not add up and you know it,' he told the Labour leader.
'You can't put a cost on your compassion for it is bogus.'
The exchange came after Labour had launched a fresh assault on the Tories by
publishing an opinion poll on attitudes to the Tory record along with
forecasts purporting to illustrate how living standards would deteriorate if
the Conservatives won a fourth term.
The attack was immediately undermined by the revelation that one key figure
was wrong. The claim that 79 per cent of those polled believed their
financial situation had got worse over the last 13 years had been subtitled
with the slogan Conservative Britain: they'll never get it right.
In fact, to Labour's embarrassment, the figure was a misprint that should
have read 39 per cent - provoking a jubilant Conservative Central Office to
charge their rivals with running a gaffe-ridden campaign.
Fewer than one in three staff in tax offices say they will vote for the
Conservative party at the coming election, according to a survey by the
Inland Revenue Staff Federation.
Some 45 per cent of a 1,000-member poll, carried out by Mori, said they
would vote Labour, 31 per cent Conservative and 19 per cent Liberal
Democrat.
IRSF officers believe the figures represent a marked shift towards the
opposition parties.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: DTI is accused of favouring Revenue
 -Investor Protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Tory backbencher last night used the case of a collapsed Wiltshire
investment company to launch a strongly worded attack on the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Sir Charles Morrison, the MP for Devizes, who will stand down at the
forthcoming election, said the DTI had failed to grasp the meaning of
investor protection in the case of Selective Investment Brokers and urged
the government to consider compensating investors.
The Chippenham-based investment group went into liquidation in July 1988
owing investors Pounds 1.3m. Earlier this year Mr Anthony Wheeler, the sole
director, was sentenced to four years in prison for fraudulent trading.
The essence of Sir Charles' argument was that the DTI had been warned of
irregularities well in advance of the liquidation but failed to act.
He suggested this was because any action to wind up the company would have
resulted in the Inland Revenue being reduced to the status of an unsecured
creditor.
The case showed what he termed an obvious degree of complicity on the DTI's
part in an unhealthy and unauthorised relationship with the Inland Revenue.
This had enabled the Inland Revenue to be 'preferred directly' at the
expense of new investors in the company.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said he stood by a report from
the parliamentary ombudsman which exonerated the DTI from any
maladministration in the case.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: King attacked over BAe order -
Defence Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs accused the government in the Commons yesterday of using orders
for defence equipment to strengthen the position of Conservative MPs in
marginal constituencies at the coming general election.
Mr Tom King, defence secretary, announced that the decision to place a
Pounds 570m contract with British Aerospace Defence for the development and
initial production of its advanced short range air-to-air missile (Asraam)
would 'safeguard' 7,000 jobs.
Mr Robert Hayward, who won his Kingswood constituency with a majority of
1,797 at the last general election, and Mr David Sumberg, returned for Bury
South with a majority of 3,720, were among the Tory backbenchers who warmly
welcomed the announcement.
The minister stressed that the contract would bring welcome work not only to
British Aerospace Dynamics Division factories in Stevenage and Lostock near
Bolton, but also to its principal sub-contractors Hughes at Glenrothes in
Scotland, Royal Ordnance at Kidderminster, Thorn EMI at Feltham, and Lucas
at Bradford.
Mr Patrick Ground (C Feltham and Heston), who did not participate in the
exchanges, had a majority of 2,148.
Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow defence secretary, pointed out that the
announcement had come too late to save the jobs of 450 BAe employees who
were told last month they were to be made redundant.
In more strident tones, Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover) said the
announcement had not really been about defence but about 'Tory marginals'.
Mr King hit back by condemning the 'hypocrisy' of Labour MPs, whose party
had voted for 'huge cuts' in defence expenditure and then criticised the
government.
The minister won further cheers from the Conservative benches when he told
the House that HMS Vanguard, the first of the Trident submarines which are
to replace the Polaris nuclear deterrent force, was set to roll out of the
Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow today.
He confirmed that contract negotiations with Vickers Shipbuilding and
Engineering for the fourth Trident submarine were under way.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP abused stamp of authority -
Commons Business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, agreed to repay
Pounds 1,406 for postage on 4,559 House of Commons envelopes used as part of
a survey, it emerged last night.
Mr Maude's Conservative constituency association in North Warwickshire made
the repayment after the serjeant at arms said the pre-paid mailing
facilities should not have been used for the letters.
Mr Maude's office said the payment covered stationery, envelopes and
first-class postage used for correspondence sent as part of a survey of
constituents' concerns on local and national issues.
The first disclosure about the incident last March came when Mr Don Dixon,
Labour's deputy chief whip, raised the matter on a point of order in the
Commons last night.
He claimed that Mr Maude had 'abused the system' for the use of Commons
facilities.
Meanwhile, Mr Robin Squire the Conservative MP for Hornchurch also protested
to Mr Bernard Weatherill Speaker about Hornchurch Labour party documents
found beside a Commons photocopier.
Mr Weatherill told Mr Squire to report the matter to the serjeant at arms.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government firm over pay body -
News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday defeated a call for a pay review body for
university academic staff, as the further and higher education bill (Lords)
entered its remaining Commons stages, David Owen writes.
The call was defeated with a government majority of 65 after Mr Alan
Howarth, education minister, rejected it on the grounds that 40 per cent of
higher education institutions' income came from sources other than the
taxpayer.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said the notion of a review body
had been backed by 56 Conservative backbench signatories to an early day
motion.
The bill will remove further education and sixth-form colleges from local
authority control and enables polytechnics to call themselves universities.
Money for the sectors will be channeled through Further Education Funding
Councils and Higher Education Funding Councils for England and Wales.
The bill was given a third reading by 305 votes to 210, a government
majority of 95. It now returns to the Lords.
POLL TAX: A call for the Budget to include an interest-free loan from
government to local councils to pay for the poll tax 'non-payment surcharge'
was made yesterday by Mr David Bellotti, the Liberal Democrats' local
government spokesman.
Mr Bellotti said a Pounds 300m loan would mean the exchequer lost only the
interest, estimated at Pounds 30m, as the principal would be recovered as
councils pursued those who had not paid.
The party today launches its 'shadow Budget' or two-year recovery programme
under the slogan 'Turning Britain Round'.
Provisional surcharges in a number of urban areas such as Manchester,
Leicester, Reading and Rochdale are likely to be about Pounds 50. Mr
Bellotti said it was unacceptable for poll tax payers to have to be charged
more because of those who did not pay.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, dismissed the proposal
as 'setting up a government bank to bail out authorities which have been
least effective in their efforts to collect the community charge.'
HOME AFFAIRS: The Aggravated Vehicle-Taking Bill, introduced by home
secretary Kenneth Baker to combat joy-riding, gained its Lords third reading
last night and now goes for Royal Assent.
The bill gives courts power to impose up to five years jail, a driving ban
and an unlimited fine on drivers and passengers who take a vehicle which is
then damaged, driven dangerously, involved in an accident or damages
property.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): EOC backs bias claim on pension age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINETY-ONE women whose employer raised their pension age from 60 to 65
without their consent are being backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission
in a claim of unlawful sexual discrimination.
The women, who work for Avdel Systems, the industrial fasteners maker based
in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, had planned to retire at 60 on full
pension. They were told that unless they continued to work until they were
65 their annual pensions would be reduced by 4 per cent.
Equality of retirement ages has been required by UK law since the European
Court judgment in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange in 1986.
The Avdel case is the second to be financially supported by the EOC at an
industrial tribunal hearing.
A similar, smaller case has been delayed for technical reasons. This
involves 30 clerical workers at the Cameron Iron Works in Leeds. They argued
at an industrial tribunal that a reduced pension on retirement at 60
amounted to a worsening of their terms of employ-ment.
The EOC said that if the 91 women were successful an important legal point
could be made which might affect many employers.
A recent survey by the National Association of Pension Funds found that more
than 60 per cent of employers had decided to raise the pension age of women
workers to 65 - the same age as men  - to comply with the Barber judgment.
The EOC believes that in many cases employers were actuarially reducing the
pensions of women who wanted to retire at 60. It thinks this could be
unlawful.
Avdel Systems said yesterday that the equalisation of pension ages was part
of a package of changes that were introduced in the best interests of the
pension scheme as a whole. These changes put men and women on an equal
footing without reducing the value of women members' benefits.
It said: 'The company denies that the changes were introduced at the expense
of working women and notes that the EOC admits it is unsure of the legal
position.' More than 36,000 companies are to be sent a guide from the
government on equal opportunities at work, urging them to establish policies
to help women, ethnic groups and disabled people find jobs.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Social Fund receives Pounds 34m boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day announced a Pounds 34m increase in the Social Fund
which provides discretionary loans and grants for people on social security.
This follows a Pounds 41m boost in August and will take the fund's budget
for 1992-93 to Pounds 302m - more than 30 per cent higher than the amount
budgeted last April for the current year.
The announcement was made soon after publication of a report from the Social
Security Advisory Committee which was critical of the fund's inadequate
budget.
The official social security watchdog also called for the operation of the
fund to be restructured to make it fairer.
Benefits offices can currently use up their share of the cash-limited fund.
This means that applications refused in one area could succeed in another.
The committee described this as 'inequitable'.
The report proposed changes to the rules so that fewer non-repayable grants
would be made and funds available for grants and repayable loans would not
run out.
Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, welcomed the committee's
report. He said it would be considered after the completion of another
study, by researchers at York University.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Clarke's move to the right makes a
wrong - The troubled course of the education secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, was riding for a fall. His proposal
to allow school governing bodies in England and Wales to choose and pay
their own inspectors was condemned on all sides long before the House of
Lords gave it the coup de grace. So was his plan to refuse local education
authorities an automatic right to inspect their own schools.
Mr Clarke blamed Monday's defeats on those issues in the Lords on heavy
lobbying by unions, but a united front by the teaching unions is a rare
event these days.
Mr David Hart, the widely respected general secretary of the National
Association of Head Teachers, described the Lords' action as 'introducing
much-needed sanity into the inspection arrangements for schools, which were
always fatally flawed'.
Mr Clarke had already started to back down. Last week he accepted an
amendment from the Tory peer Lord Renfrew, master of Jesus College,
Cambridge, giving the chief inspector of schools a veto over an
institution's choice of inspectors.
The next question is why Mr Clarke lumbered himself with the dubious scheme
at all.
The answer is not difficult to find. Since becoming education secretary in
November 1990 Mr Clarke has cultivated the Conservative party's rightwing.
He succeeded Mr John MacGregor, who came under heavy fire from the right for
failing to sustain momentum for Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act of
1988. On the left of the party himself, Mr Clarke was keen to be classed as
a reformer.
The plan for private, competing inspectorates originated with the rightwing
Centre for Policy Studies. Suddenly last summer Mr Clarke set up an inquiry
into the future of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. During its deliberations the
CPS published a paper by Mr John Burchill, Tory-controlled Wandsworth's
chief schools inspector.
In a mere seven pages Mr Burchill called for HMI to be broken up, with a
successor body 'concerned more with oversight of inspection arrangements by
other bodies than with itself observing the process of teaching in schools'.
The latter task, he argued, should lie with 'small consultancy teams not
recruited solely from the teaching profession', and licensed by the new
national inspectorate.
Almost a carbon copy of that scheme appeared in the Schools Bill, introduced
last November. It diverged in important respects from that recommended by Mr
Clarke's own inquiry and was privately criticised by some leading
inspectors.
Reform of the inspectorate is not the only area where Mr Clarke has played
to the right. Plans announced last year to reshape teacher training bear a
marked CPS influence. Recently his willingness to allow grant-maintained
schools to introduce selection was a clear sop.
But even if the government were to leave the Lords' amendments intact, the
parent's charter pledge of school inspections would be met and Mr Clarke's
bold attempt at more would have earned him credibility with a section of the
party crucial to his post-election prospects.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Tories determined on Schools Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is deter-mined to get the Schools Bill through parliament
before the election in spite of the defeats in the Lords, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the education secretary, said yesterday.
Privately, ministers sounded unruffled by the setback. If they lost the
bill, or this element of it, because of lack of time before the general
election, an incoming Tory government could re-introduce it immediately
afterwards.
Mr Clarke was adamant that the bill would become law in a 'sensible,
workable form', and emphasised that his priority was getting the parent's
charter through, including performance league tables for schools.
Peers decided on Monday night that the chief inspector of schools, rather
than individual governing bodies, should decide who should carry out
inspections and that local authorities should still be able to inspect
schools they maintain.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was said to be 'disappointed' at the
decisions.
The government could try to overturn the defeats at the bill's report stage
next Tuesday, or use the opportunity to dilute the involvement of the chief
inspector. The provisional date for the final Lords stage is Monday March
16, but if an election was announced before then it could be taken earlier.
Labour believes that it will benefit politically whatever ministers do.
Either the government is defeated - through trying unsuccessfully to insist
on its way or by having to compromise - or it is seen to be behaving
high-handedly in pressing ahead with an unpopular policy.

<TEXT>
THE COURT of Appeal yesterday upheld a High Court ruling that North Tyneside
Council was not entitled in 1990 to offer workers enhanced voluntary
redundancy terms.
The decision has implications for other local authorities which may have
been considering generous packages as a way of avoiding compulsory
redundancies and confrontation with unions.
About 350 employees received sums which were, on average, three-and-a-half
times higher than the sum the council was legally obliged to pay out.
Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Militant to seek leadership of CPSA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUPPORTER of Militant Tendency is to seek the leadership of the CPSA,
Britain's biggest Civil Service union, after Mr John Ellis, the current
general secretary, yesterday secured a job with another organisation,
Michael Smith writes.
Mr John Macreadie, the deputy general secretary and a Militant supporter, is
thought to stand a chance of success. The favourite, however, will be Mr
Barry Reamsbottom, a candidate for the union's moderate faction.
Six years ago Mr Macreadie beat Mr Ellis in an election for the top job but
lost a second contest after voting irregularities were uncovered in the
first. Militant's influence in the CPSA has declined since then but Mr
Macreadie, aged 45, has a high profile as deputy general secretary.
If elected he would be expected to seek a more confrontational stance in the
124,000-strong union's negotiations with the Treasury.
Mr Ellis was yesterday chosen to succeed Mr Peter Jones, who is retiring in
June as general secretary of the Council for Civil Service Unions, the
representative body on certain common issues.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Britons get richer and spend more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE British household is 20 per cent richer in real terms than 10
years ago, according to a survey published yesterday.
The study by Mintel, the international market research group, also shows
that potential individual wealth - calculated by saleable assets  - has
surged by more than 200 per cent over the same period.
The survey of lifestyle and spending habits of the past decade shows the
British spend a greater proportion of their income than in 1981. UK consumer
spending was Pounds 376.5bn last year, 26 per cent more in real terms than
in 1981. Savings as a proportion of income fell to 7.5 per cent, against
13.1 per cent in 1981.
Much of that increased spending now goes towards insurance and pensions,
which accounted for just Pounds 3.9bn in 1981 but had risen to more than
Pounds 17bn by last year. Sickness and accident insurance has grown almost
five times in cash terms since 1981.
Mintel's report identifies trends which it expects will alter the nature of
consumer spending in the current decade. The number of households is likely
to increase from 22.7m last year to more than 24m by 2001 but average
household size will probably fall from 2.5 people to 2.3 people.
Single-person households are predicted to increase to 6.8m by 2001, compared
with 4.6m in 1981 and 5.9m last year.
The study suggests that the household services market has been a boom area
in the past decade, growing by almost 450 per cent and now worth Pounds
2.9bn. According to Mintel it may be worth Pounds 5.5bn by 1996.
Britain appears to be turning into a nation of restaurant lovers. Last year
spending on food for consumption in the home was Pounds 42.56bn, a decline
to 11 per cent of total expenditure from 15 per cent 10 years ago. Total
food expenditure increased by 8 per cent in real terms in the decade. At the
same time spending on eating out grew by 4 per cent annually. Britons now
spend Pounds 13.7bn a year in restaurants.
Britons have spent an average of 3 per cent a year more on holidays over the
past decade. The record, tape and musical instrument business has been the
fastest-growing leisure sector, at 12 per cent a year. The losing sector is
clearly tobacco products, with sales falling by an average annual rate of
almost 3 per cent since 1981.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Credit-card issuers act to stem Pounds
165m-a-year fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS AND building societies yesterday started a campaign to combat
credit-card fraud following a 35 per cent surge in the crime last year.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, said that credit-card fraudsters stole
Pounds 165m last year. 'By reducing the attraction of cards as a soft target
we can do much to reduce these crimes,' he said at the launch of the Card
Watch campaign.
According to the Association for Payment Clearing Services, which has
organised the campaign, leading banks and building societies have issued
more than 80m plastic cards. At least 2m are stolen each year, an average of
5,500 a day. Most thefts take place at work, but other target areas are cars
and the home.
The initiative, part of a three-year programme, involves increasing public
awareness and the introduction of more sophisticated technology such as
digital signatures, fingerprint recognition and personal identification
numbers for shop transactions.
Mr Baker said that the initiative would make it harder for thieves to get
hold of cheque and credit cards by improving the delivery of new cards and
by making it easier for cashiers and shopkeepers to check the identities of
users.
Mr Jim Parsons, the association's head of fraud prevention, said that lost
or stolen cards accounted for 75 per cent of fraud losses and cards that did
not reach the genuine customers 20 per cent. The remainder was accounted for
by fraudulent applications and counterfeit cards.
'There is no single solution to beating this serious crime,' said Mr
Parsons. 'The battle against card fraud must be waged on many fronts and we
are investing heavily on a wide range of initiatives.'
The anti-fraud campaign includes increasing the number of transactions in
retail stores which require authorisation, developing a comprehensive file
of more than 3m 'wanted' cards, and using computer systems that would detect
unusual spending patterns on accounts before a card is reported missing.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Sparks with a tough at the top - Paul
Gallagher, new EETPU general secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Frank Chapple left the general secretary's job at the EETPU
electricians' union after a controversial tenure, he predicted that his
successor would carry on the tradition. 'If you think I'm rightwing, wait
until you see Eric Hammond.'
Eight years later Mr Hammond says the same about Mr Paul Gallagher, who
takes over from him next week. The view is expressed only half-seriously,
with the broad grin that accompanies many of Mr Hammond's pronouncements.
Political differences between right and left in unions have become less
pronounced since the Labour party's move to the political centre.
Nonetheless many believe the type of trade unionism symbolised by the EETPU
remains a threat to traditional union values.
Mr Gallagher's stewardship of the union will have effects far wider than the
360,000 EETPU members. The union and the AEU engineers will today announce
the outcome of a merger ballot. If the result is positive they will unite to
form Britain's second-largest union, with 1m members.
Mr Gallagher, 47, will be in a strong position to become general secretary
after the new union draws up a constitution. In any event, he will have a
strong influence on employees' relations with their employers and on whether
trade unions can present a more united front than in recent years.
The EETPU was expelled from the Trades Union Congress in 1988 after a series
of rows culminating in its refusal to accept a congress instruction to
withdraw from two single-union deals. If there is a 'yes' vote today, the
AEU-EETPU will talk with the TUC about affiliation.
What kind of man will the TUC - and the employers he will deal with  - find?
The son of a dustcart driver and a home help, Mr Gallagher left school at 15
and qualified as an electrician four years later. In the meantime he joined
and left the Communist party. That had a significant effect and he became a
firm opponent of the political creed he once believed in.
'When I first joined the EETPU I would sort of stand up in the branch and
advocate we hang Frank Chapple and fight for Utopia. And then I learnt some
sense. I became alarmed at the way I perceived the trade union movement
being used by leftwing and Communist elements and decided that communism
would be bad for the UK.'
In the EETPU Mr Gallagher found the right home. Following ballot-rigging
scandals in the late 1950s it had banned Communists from holding posts and
was firmly in the control of the right. Mr Gallagher had carte blanche to
harry his political opponents. In a typical example, at a TUC conference in
1983 he accused Mr Arthur Scargill of being a 'boot-licker' and
'contemptible' after the miners' leader made a trip to Moscow.
Mr Gallagher's abusive verbal style, as much as his politics, has earned him
the suspicion, and sometimes contempt, of opponents, some of whom believe it
to be the product of shyness. He is a constant smoker and sometimes appears
nervous. One union general secretary says: 'He is a thug. He bawls and he
shouts. He is liable to blow up at any time. Someone has told him that it is
clever to be nasty.'
Supporters say his abrasive exterior belies his compassion. A colleague
says: 'When you gain his confidence he backs you to the hilt. He worries
about the welfare of people he works with and that helps explain why he has
built up a loyal feeling within the EETPU. But whereas Eric Hammond is
laconic and controlled, Paul can sometimes speak without thinking first and
his sarcasm can be quite hurtful.'
The verbal pugilism stems in part from his background in the union. His rise
in the EETPU began when at 22 he became an officer in the Manchester branch,
dealing with electrical contracting.
Mr Ian Brown, a former colleague who left the union after its expulsion from
the TUC, says: 'Contracting is a rough, tough environment. Work in
contracting is often casual and that leads to casual attitudes. You do not
get any respect unless you operate like Gallagher. He is no different from
many other people in the industry.'
He is well respected in the industry. Mr Harry Simpson, director of the
Electrical Contractors Association, says Mr Gallagher represents members
well. 'The EETPU are most effective bargainers and Paul Gallagher is in that
mould. They do their homework and they can quite often win a better deal
than would other, less well-trained and well-prepared unions.'
Mr Simpson praises Mr Gallagher for his role, as president of the union
since 1986, in setting up three ECA-EETPU joint companies to provide
temporary labour for the industry, and pensions and training for workers.
It is this type of partnership with employers that has earned the distrust
of other unions. In party terms Mr Gallagher is not far removed from many
other trade unionists. 'I find myself on most counts now sitting very
comfortably with the policies of the Labour party,' he says.
What irked the left most about the EETPU in the 1980s was its challenge to
traditional ideas of what a union should do. Some found its flaunting of
offers of financial and other services to members to be a distraction from
the main business of a union. Most were alarmed when it accepted government
money for leadership elections. Only the AEU opposed its expulsion from the
TUC.
The differences are less stark now. Other unions have moved towards the
EETPU way of thinking on service provision. Most take part in 'beauty
contests' for single-union deals.
The main difference is in the leadership. In the controversies of the 1980s
the EETPU was led by a supremely confident man. Mr Hammond revelled in the
intellectual challenge of taking on his opponents.
Mr Gallagher, sharp-witted but not an original thinker, would be less
comfortable if faced with the kind of animosity directed at Mr Hammond. Most
colleagues believe he wants to find a way back into the trade union
mainstream. One colleague says: 'He is much more a man of the movement than
Eric.'
Mr John Aitkin, leader of the Electrical Plumbing and Industries Union, an
EETPU breakaway, is sceptical. 'The view is that Gallagher will be more
pliable than Hammond. But then they said that about Hammond when he took
over from Chapple, and look what happened with him.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Minister scraps licensing scheme for holiday groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday abandoned controversial plans to set up an
authority to license package travel operators. It proposed instead a
self-regulatory scheme to protect holidaymakers against the risk of tour
company collapses.
Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, said in a Commons written answer
that the Department of Trade and Industry had dropped its licensing
proposals, published last July, on the grounds of cost and administrative
complexity.
His decision was welcomed by the Consumers' Association and the
government-backed National Consumer Council, which had criticised the plans.
But the association said the revised approach still did not go far enough to
ensure complete protection for consumers.
The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said it wanted to discuss
with the government how these proposals would be implemented, and
particularly the need for a back-up fund to ensure full protection in cases
of fraud.
Abta operates a protection scheme on behalf of its members. It is concerned
about its legal position if these voluntary safeguards were turned into a
statutory responsibility.
Mr Leigh said the government had decided that tour organisers should make
their own arrangements to provide security for refunds in insolvencies. He
suggested that three options:
Depositing bonds equal to the maximum pre-payments held by tour organisers
with an 'approved organisation'.
Insurance against insolvency. Depositing pre-payments in an account which
could be drawn on only after delivery of the service for which the
pre-payments were made.
Organisers of tours abroad would have to provide security against the cost
of repatriation of stranded holidaymakers.
The proposals are intended to comply with a 1990 European Community
directive requiring protection for package tourists by the year-end.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Tories redraw post-election plans for BR sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVILY revised plans for the privatisation of British Rail are likely to be
published soon after the general election in the event of a Conservative
victory.
The plans, which have been agreed by ministers, represent a defeat for the
approach favoured by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary. But
details are unlikely to appear in the Conservative party manifesto for fear
that they could lose more votes than they win.
Instead, the manifesto will focus on the shorter-term objective of ending
BR's statutory monopoly on railway services and encouraging the private
sector to run trains in competition with BR.
Since Mr Rifkind first announced plans to end BR's statutory monopoly
several private-sector operators, such as Virgin Group, Orient-Express
Hotels, Stagecoach Holdings and National Power, have expressed strong
interest in running their own passenger or freight trains.
The manifesto will stress that opening BR's tracks to these operators will
bring an increase in the number of trains running on BR because existing
services, including subsidised ones, will continue.
A white paper preparing for privatisation was to have appeared by the end of
last year but was held up by ministerial differences over the best way to
proceed.
The centrepiece of Mr Rifkind's much-leaked plan was a speedy sale of the
profitable InterCity and Railfreight sectors complete with tracks and
trains. Other ministers - notably Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry
secretary - argued that if companies operating trains also owned the tracks
they would inevitably try to inhibit competition from other entrants.
Mr Lilley and his allies have successfully argued that all BR's tracks
should be put into the ownership of a single central body which will open
them up to BR or any private-sector companies wanting to run trains on them.
BR's four operating divisions - InterCity, Railfreight, Network SouthEast
and Regional Railways - will then be sold to the private sector without
their tracks as each becomes profitable.
The four divisions' profits will be boosted by stripping out unprofitable
but socially necessary services and putting them out to tender, with
franchises going to whichever private operators require the smallest subsidy
to operate them.
Fair play between former BR operating divisions and new private-sector
competitors will be supervised by a regulatory authority such as those
already operating in the other former nationalised industries.
Delaying publication of the plans until after the general election will
avoid any embarrassing climbdown by Mr Rifkind, who faces a tough electoral
battle to retain his marginal Edinburgh Pentlands seat. If he is re-elected,
awkwardness could be avoided if he was given a new post in a cabinet
reshuffle.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Leeds acts on domestic toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST large-scale attempt to find a safe method of disposing of toxic or
environmentally unfriendly household waste such as paint, garden chemicals
and engine oil will be launched in Leeds today.
The project is being funded by ICI Paints, the B&amp;Q DIY retail chain and BP
Oil. It will be run by Leeds City Council.
The rubbish will be collected by a mobile 'wastewagon' that has cost nearly
Pounds 25,000. If the experiment works the backers expect the scheme to be
introduced by other councils although the costs would have to be borne by
the public sector out of national and council taxes.
Some wastes pose environmental problems if they are put out with normal
household rubbish and garbage.
They may not be suit-able for safe incineration at low temperatures or, if
buried in landfill sites, they may react years later during decomposition to
give off poisonous fumes.
Local authorities are also becoming concerned at people pouring solvents or
other liquid wastes down drains or lavatories.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Anglo-Italian deal on toll motorway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND EXPRESSWAY, an Anglo-Italian joint venture, yesterday signed the
agreement to build and run Britain's first privately financed toll motorway.
The Birmingham Northern Relief Road, which will extend for 30 miles, will
provide motorists with an alternative to the congested M6 motorway including
Spaghetti Junction to the north of the city.
The winning bid was submitted by a joint venture between Trafalgar House,
the UK construction to hotels group, and Iritecna of Italy, Europe's biggest
toll-road operator.
The concession will run for 53 years. The road, which will run between
junctions 4 and 11 of the M6, is expected to cost Pounds 270m to build -
rising to Pounds 450m if finance charges are included. Tolls are expected to
be equivalent to Pounds 1.50 for a car and Pounds 3 for a lorry at present
prices when the road opens in the late 1990s.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Gold and currency reserves rise Dollars 181m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's gold and currency reserves rose by an underlying Dollars 181m last
month, indicating that the Bank of England did not have to support sterling
in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System last month.
The Treasury said the increase, which confounded market expectations of a
small Dollars 120m decline in the reserves, partly reflected Dollars 51m of
foreign proceeds from the privatisation of Britain's power companies.
The overall level of Britain's official reserves, which includes borrowings
in foreign currencies and the Ecu and official repayments, rose by Dollars
169m to Dollars 44.76bn at the end of last month from Dollars 44.59bn at the
end of January.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Public-sector tendering criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S tender-ing procedures for information-technology contracts
result in unnecessarily high costs for both sides, a director at a leading
computer services group warned yesterday.
Mr David Millard, public sector group accounts director of Hoskyns Group,
said the tendering mechanism involved much longer sales lead times than in
the private sector and an unnecessarily high number of contractors.
This could result in reduced competition as contractors were bankrupted or
forced to withdraw because of the costs involved.
Even after efforts had been made to streamline the process, procurement for
an entire IT package from hardware to training had taken Hoskyns 56 weeks to
win.
The IT industry has become more involved in the public sector, at both
national and local levels, since the government white paper on competing for
quality. At the same time, IT manufacturers have looked increasingly to the
public sector for business, as recession has reduced business in the private
sector.
Mr Millard said the public sector was forced to go through 'a tortuous
formalised process' of tendering to meet public accountability requirements.
A pre-qualification phase to reduce the number of bidders would help to
simplify the process and reduce costs without limiting competition.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Management consultancies' sharp growth in fees halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent spectacular growth in management consultancy fees came to an
abrupt end last year and employment fell for the first time in 12 years,
according to the Management Consultancies Association, which has 33 members
accounting for about 60 per cent of the UK market.
Members' fee income grew by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 843m from Pounds
810m the previous year, after average annual growth of around 30 per cent
for three years.
Mr Brian O'Rorke, executive director of the association, said that last year
was 'one of the hardest trading periods in living memory' and predicted a
'more aggressive and competitive' market this year.
The number of consultants employed by the association's companies fell 4 per
cent to 6,963, the first annual decline since 1980.
The figures appear to show the effect of sharp price competition - the total
number of UK clients increased by 10.5 per cent to 16,909. Fee income fell
in all fields except project management, which grew from Pounds 14m to
Pounds 28m, and information technology and systems, where fee income
accounted for Pounds 339m - 46 per cent of the big companies' Pounds 732m in
UK fees last year.
Work for local authorities and the National Health Service increased sharply
last year, reflecting the impact of the government's health reforms and the
drive for efficiency.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Talks fail to end TV listings row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS involving a number of secret offers between the BBC and
newspaper and magazine groups to try to reach agreement on payments for
television listings information have failed.
The issue will now be settled by the Copyright Tribunal, which is finalising
its decision on copyright fees for programme listings. It is due to make an
announcement later this month after holding a hearing from November 12 to
December 20 last year.
A number of publishing organisations had complained that the broadcasters'
fees were too high. The organisations were the Newspaper Publishers
Association (NPA), representing national newspapers; the Newspaper Society,
representing regional newspapers; Time Out, the London listings magazine;
Hello, the celebrity magazine; and the Surrey Advertiser group.
While the tribunal has been deliberating on its verdict BBC Enterprises, the
BBC's commercial arm, has made a number of 'without prejudice' offers to
publishers. These were rejected, even though they envisaged lower payments
than the corporation had initially sought.
The NPA offered both the BBC and ITV a deal that would involve a single
annual payment enabling national newspapers to carry seven-day listings of
television programmes. This in turn was rejected by the broadcasters.
The wrangle follows the government's decision to end the duopoly enjoyed by
Radio Times and TV Times magazines in the television listings market, and to
give all publishers access to all programming listings in return for a
copyright fee.
Since the new regime began in March last year, most publishers have been
paying the BBC and Independent Television Publishers, holder of ITV
programmes copyright, only a token sum of Pounds 250 a year.
Once the Copyright Tribunal has ruled, the actual fees will be backdated to
March last year.
After the government's decision the BBC initially proposed 10 different band
rates for weekly and daily papers. These ran from Pounds 600 a year for a
weekly with a circulation of 11,000, to Pounds 210,000 for a national daily
with sales of more than 1.7m.
While the Copyright Tribunal had been considering its decision some national
newspapers have launched seven-day television listings supplements. This,
the BBC has argued, proves how valuable television-listings copyright is.

FT  04 MAR 92 / 24 big companies back Olympics bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER'S bid to stage the Olympics in the year 2000 will be backed by 24
leading companies in the region. These include Amec, Coats Viyella, Granada
TV, Johnson Group, Kellogg, Littlewoods, Manchester Airport and Pilkington.
The bid, which was last week given government backing of Pounds 55m, was
officially launched in Manchester yesterday.
The Duke of Westminster, who is leading the city's bid, said the companies
were ready to support Manchester as the site for the summer games. The
private sector has so far contributed Pounds 1m towards the Pounds 5m needed
to mount the bid and must now match Pounds 2m given by the government as
part of last week's package.
The logo for the bid was presented at the launch, which was staged by
Granada TV in a dancing blaze of coloured laser lights which merged to form
a flickering representation of red, white and blue Olympic flames. A flood
of merchandising - from T-shirts and coffee mugs to lapel pins and car
stickers - was also released.
Apart from supporting the bid, initial government funding is to go towards
an arena for events such as gymnastics, a national velodrome for cycling,
and preparing the site for a Pounds 170m stadium. The business leadership
team has long favoured a national stadium in the north as a potential
economic generator.
The government is committed to spending about Pounds 360m if Manchester's
bid succeeds. The rest of the Pounds 1bn estimated cost would have to come
from the private sector.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Lloyd's wins court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday won a move to have a legal dispute between it
and several hundred Names transferred to the Commercial Court.
The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance
market - seek injunctions to stop Lloyd's drawing on their deposits to meet
cash calls. They had wanted the case to be heard in Chancery Court.
Judge Mervyn Davies refused Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor for the Names,
automatic leave to appeal against the decision.
Mr Freeman said last night: 'It would be a waste of time to appeal the
decision. We really want to get on with it.'
He said Chancery was the most appropriate court to consider the case because
of its trust implications. Lloyd's argued that the Commercial Court had most
experience of dealing with these matters.
The case will go to the Queens Bench, but Lloyd's said yesterday that
subsequent transfer to the Commercial Court would be a formality.
Hearings in the case, in which about 720 Names have issued motions for
injunction against members' agents, are due to take place at the end of this
month.
Lloyd's said yesterday that 300 syndicates named in a suit brought by 91 US
Names were seeking to have the case thrown out. The Names allege that
Lloyd's had breached securities laws and legislation against racketeering in
the US.
The syndicates say they cannot be sued because they are not legal entities.
Meanwhile, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, has consented to make
available to members comprehensive details of the composition of Lloyd's
syndicates.
In a letter to Sir William Clark MP, Mr Coleridge said Lloyd's would give
all members access to 'information about the number of working and external
Names on every syndicate and the aggregate values of those participating for
each of the last six years'.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Late rally helps Ford keep lead on sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REGISTRATIONS of new Ford cars in the UK speeded up late last month, in
spite of the company's repeated claims that it would not 'buy market share'
to boost sales figures.
At the end of last week Ford of Britain said overall sales of new cars in
the UK had weakened dramatically in the final days of the month, as private
buyers delayed purchases ahead of a possible cut in car tax in next week's
Budget. It expected to be ousted by Vauxhall from leadership of the market
for the first time - on a monthly basis  - since the mid 1970s.
Official car registration figures for February will be announced tomorrow.
It was disclosed at the Geneva motor show yesterday that Ford's sales surged
late in the month, contrary to the company's statement last week.
Ford's daily market share was never above 20 per cent in the first 20 days
of the month, but its daily share accelerated in the latest four reporting
days to 25 per cent, 24.1 per cent, 32.3 per cent and finally to 36.3 per
cent.
The impact of the sudden surge in Ford registrations on the UK new-car
market has been significant, with total daily sales jumping to 6,723 and
then to 7,501 in the last two reporting days available compared with a daily
average for the month of 4,884.
As a result Ford is expected to hold its market leadership narrowly ahead of
Vauxhall. With one reporting day left for the month it had captured 19.7 per
cent compared with Vauxhall's 19.8 per cent. After 20 days it was still in
third place behind Vauxhall and Rover.
Ford officials were embarrassed yesterday at the disclosure of the
last-minute surge.
Ford insisted that it was abiding by its new policy of reducing loss-making
sales of heavily discounted cars to the daily rental fleets and said there
were no special programmes in place to persuade dealers to register cars on
to their own fleets of demonstration cars.
The surge in Ford registrations means the fall in overall UK new-car sales
last month is likely to be about 11 per cent compared with the industry's
earlier fear of a 15 per cent fall.
Sales remained very depressed, however, and February's registrations are
expected to be more than 40 per cent below the 1989 peak.

FT  04 MAR 92 / IMF funds increase hits Congress hitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund's prospects of winning its Dollars 60bn
(Pounds 34.2bn) funding increase this year appear to be dwindling as a
result of mounting hostility in the US to foreign aid.
The Bush administration has asked Congress to approve the funding for the
Dollars 12bn US share of the increase but has not yet pressed hard in the
face of opposition from Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
Congressmen said attempts to pass legislation authorising the increase,
which would boost the IMF's capital base by 50 per cent, appear virtually
dead for this year.
Administration officials, however, said negotiations on the issue were not
yet over.
The administration's reluctance to push hard has been reinforced by Mr
Patrick Buchanan, President George Bush's isolationist challenger for the
Republican party's presidential nomination. He has denounced foreign aid in
general and the IMF funding in particular.
Democratic congressmen have been wary of repeating their experience with the
last IMF quota increase: they voted it at the Republican administration's
request, only to find themselves under attack from Republican opponents in
the subsequent elections for pouring money abroad.
The IMF funding has also been complicated by a dispute between the Bush
administration and the Israeli government over Israel's request for Dollars
10bn of loan guarantees to help it absorb up to 1m immigrants from the
former Soviet Union. This dispute has tied up this year's foreign aid bill -
the natural home for the IMF quota legislation.
Most other IMF member countries have already approved their contributions to
the quota increase but under IMF rules the overall increase cannot go ahead
unless approved by countries representing 85 per cent of voting power. The
US has 19 per cent of the votes.

<TEXT>
THE communications needs of manned missions to Mars, of jet-setting business
travellers and relief workers stranded in remote lands will be met more
easily after agreement yesterday between the world's telecommunications
authorities to allocate radio frequencies for such new services.
Representatives from 127 member-countries of the International
Telecommunication Union, meeting at the World Administrative Radio
Conference (WARC) in Torremolinos, Spain, agreed on the allocation of
frequencies for a range of communications services.
The month-long conference closed yesterday with mixed results. Agreement was
not reached on a global frequency for wide-bank high definition television
(HDTV) or for digital sound broadcasting.
However, mobile communications systems were boosted by the decision to
allocate frequencies for several types of mobile systems.
Both the satellite mobile communications services proposed by the US and
future mobile telecommunications services being advocated by the European
Community won the necessary frequencies.
The US and the EC had been at odds over the allocation of frequencies for
differing mobile communications systems. One US-based service, Iridium, a
Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.8bn) project that proposed to use 77 satellites
circling the globe and was backed by Motorola, the US electronics and
telecommunications group, had to postpone the closing of a public financing
until the WARC decision gave it the frequency.
The US delegation, which was able to obtain several frequencies for its
space programmes, was particularly pleased.
Among other things, it obtained a frequency that would allow astronauts on
the moon to communicate with their spaceship and one that would allow
communications from earth with manned explorations to Mars.
'You just can't get a telephone line long enough from the earth to Mars,'
said Mr Jan Barran, head of the US delegation.

<TEXT>
Sun Microsystems, the US computer company, has become one of the first
Western companies to tap the wealth of scientific talent in the former
Soviet Union by signing a research agreement with one of Russia's top
computer experts.
Sun, a specialist in computer work stations, said yesterday that Mr Boris
Babayan and some 50 colleagues at the Institute of Precision Mechanics and
Computer Technology in Moscow would carry out research on behalf of the
company.
Mr Babayan is credited with creating the supercomputers used by the Soviet
space programme and by the Soviet military to design nuclear weapons.
The California-based company said it had not hired Mr Babayan, who would
continue to work for the institute, but had provided him with a 'grant ' and
workstations. Sun appears to be getting the services of the Russian
scientists very cheaply.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Indicators spur hopes of economic recovery in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the index of leading indicators and a jump in home sales
yesterday further bolstered hopes of an early US economic recovery.
In congressional testimony, however, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, cautioned that the outlook remained highly uncertain. The pace of
recovery so far was 'little more than glacial'. The Fed stood ready to ease
monetary policy again if growth failed to materialise, he said.
The composite index of leading indicators rose 0.9 per cent in January to
register its first big rise since last July. Sales of new homes rose 12.9
per cent in January to an annual rate of 622,000, the highest level for
nearly two years. Both indicators were stronger than most analysts expected.
Rising share prices provided much of the impetus behind the recovery in
leading indicators. But the rise also reflected strength in orders for
plant, equipment and consumer goods, a rise in building permits, and faster
growth of the money supply.
Leading indicators for November and December were revised to show declines
of only 0.2 per cent in each month, rather than 0.3 per cent as previously
calculated.
Last year, the index of leading indicators began rising about three months
before the economy staged a partial recovery from recession.
Yesterday's figures, however, showed a sharp 1 per cent fall in the
composite index of coincident indicators, which track the current state of
the economy. The fourth monthly decline in the coincident indicators
suggests the economy has been experiencing a second economic dip.
Home sales in January were running at about 20 per cent above the level of
last summer and about 50 per cent higher than in January last year when they
were artificially depressed by the Gulf war. The improvement reflects falls
in mortgage rates following successive interest rate cuts by the Fed.
Last month's increase, however, was heavily concentrated in the midwest and,
to a lesser extent, the south. Home sales rose only fractionally in the west
and not at all in the depressed north east.
Yesterday's encouraging figures follow news of an unexpected surge last
month in the purchasing managers' index, a closely followed barometer of
industrial conditions.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Finnish trading regime wins praise from
Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND runs a generally liberal trading regime, but its heavy reliance on
preferential trading arrangements and high protection for domestic
agriculture come in for criticism in a report from the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Members of Gatt's governing council discussed the report yesterday. They
praised Finland for avoiding trade-curbing measures to cope with economic
difficulties resulting from world recession and collapse of the former
Soviet Union, until recently Finland's biggest export market.
The report says over 60 per cent of Finland's trade is now with EC countries
and the European Free Trade Association (Efta). While 90 per cent of imports
enter duty free, only 30 per cent come in duty free on a 'most favoured
nation' (MFN) basis under Gatt's non-discrimination principle.
Developing countries said yesterday this hampered their exports to Finland
because they face high tariffs on products such as food, textiles and
footwear while Finland's (mostly European) preferential trading partners do
not.
Concern was expressed that the share of preferential trade will increase,
with Finland's planned membership of the EC and the European Economic Area.
Trade arrangements have been set up with the Russian Federation and the
Baltic states. The council stressed the need for these moves to help develop
the multilateral trading system; it saw benefits for Finland's economy in
closer European integration.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Indian rupee slips 9.4% as shares soar after budget
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian rupee depreciated by 9.4 per cent against the dollar in money
transfer operations yesterday when foreign exchange markets reopened in
India after presentation of a new national budget on Saturday and a bank
holiday on Monday.
The Bombay Stock Market (Sensex) index, however, continued its giddy ascent,
rising to a new peak of 3457 in acclamation of the budget and the boost it
gave to the development of the capital markets. The index has risen 22 per
cent since the budget and about 80 per cent since the beginning of the year.
The slide in the rupee follows the announcement made by Dr Manmohan Singh,
the minister of finance, in the budget that the rupee would become partially
convertible with 60 per cent of foreign exchange remittances exchangeable at
a new market determined rate.
The new open market rate yesterday levelled out at Dollars 1=29.5 as against
an official rate of Dollars 1=25.82. Under the new partially floating
system, foreign exchange holders are required to change the remaining 40 per
cent of a remittance or traveller cheque at the official rate.
Dr Singh told a foreign press lunch in Delhi that he regarded the floating
rate as a step to full convertibility 'once we get the fiscal situation
under control'. The government's target is to reduce the budget deficit to 4
per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the coming years as compared
with a deficit this year of 6.4 per cent. He said the government wanted to
move towards dismantling foreign exchange controls.
Dr Singh sought to minimise the inflationary impact of the depreciation,
saying that this 'would not be very significant.' He said that the 20 per
cent devaluation of the rupee in July had not had as strong an impact as had
been anticipated on manufactured prices.
India's inflation rate has come down to 12 per cent from a 16.7 per cent
high in August. But it is still well above the 9 per cent that the finance
minister had originally projected for the end of the current financial year.
Bankers yesterday believed that the rupee would depreciate marginally
further because dollar demand in Delhi was unusually weak yesterday. The
depreciation benefited exporters less than other holders of foreign
currency. This is because exporters had previously been entitled to an
eximscrip - a marketable currency instrument - on a part of their export
earnings and which they could sell at a premium.
Difficulties in administering the eximscrip system were a leading factor in
pushing the government to move more rapidly to a partial floating of the
currency. The eximscrip system limited the volume of imports to the
availability of foreign exchange through export earnings. World Stock Market

Armenia yesterday accused Azerbaijan of shooting down a low-flying military

Interfax quoted Armenia's interior ministry as saying the helicopter was

the aircraft came down near the Azeri town of Kelbadzhar.
'According to the ministry's information, the helicopter, carrying mainly
women and children, was hit by fire from Azeri armed units,' it said.
Earlier, armed groups and civilian protesters halted the withdrawal of Red
Army troops from their base in Stepanakert. Armenian residents say only the
army can prevent an all-out Azerbaijani attack.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Russians quick to learn shadier side of capitalism:
Corruption is rife, and the newly independent states lack laws to tackle it

ON THE DAY Russia's privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, announced he
had sacked his deputy for sanctioning the embezzlement of state property,
his two small sons were involved in a car crash.
In western Europe, this would have been a coincidence. In Russia, probably
not. In a tranquil office overlooking the Kremlin and the Bolshoi ballet, Mr
Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the Russian government's new anti-corruption team,
keeps a pistol in his drawer. He is convinced the accident was organised to
frighten Mr Chubais off his campaign for a clean privatisation process. 'It
would cost only Rbs10,000 to hire an assassin to get rid of me,' he says
with a grin.
Having exposed several crooked deals during his previous career as a
journalist, Mr Gurtovoi says his mission is to save his country from
'choking on corruption'. He reports directly to Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's
deputy prime minister for economic reform, who has made fighting corruption
a key priority lest it stifle his bold efforts to switch to a market
economy.
As any foreign or Russian businessman will confirm, bribe-taking and
embezzlement are flourishing as never before.
Mr Gurtovoi's 10-man team includes former KGB officers and elite
investigating magistrates such as Mr Vladimir Kalinichenko, who made his
name uncovering high-level scandals during the communist era. Rather than
catch all the corrupt officials in Russia, the role of this elite group is
to pinpoint specific malpractices and advise the government on how to
legislate and enforce the law.
An attempt, uncovered last week, by defence plant managers and former
Communist party officials to transfer valuable state assets into a closed
joint stock company called KOLO which they owned is just one manifestation
of the corruption permeating society, says Mr Gurtovoi.
The KOLO deal itself is unlikely to have broken any written laws - the
country may have had communist laws against economic sabotage, but to date
has no laws against corruption or tax evasion.
Although the team will now investigate this deal to shed light on so-called
'nomenklatura' privatisation, whereby officials acquire state assets at well
below their value, it claims to have already stopped a major currency
swindle involving Rbs300bn and the worldwide narcotics business.
Mr Gurtovoi and his colleagues say many of the schemes are destined either
to discredit the government or to manipulate exchange rates to keep the
rouble weak.
This particular swindle, foiled two months ago, apparently went as follows.
A group of crooked commercial banks, joint ventures, and former party and
KGB officials, approached Russian enterprises and collected Rbs200bn with a
promise to reinvest it at favourable rates. To this apparently honest pile
of money, they added Rbs100bn in need of laundering because it had been
misappropriated by the Communist party or the KGB or simply stolen.
The Rbs100bn was set aside to pick up property on the cheap as privatisation
gathered pace. This would have been bought on behalf of foreign partners and
Russian comrades and would have included the purchase of hotels, factories
and narcotic-processing facilities in the former Soviet Union.
The spin-off for the Russians was not only the chance to launder illegal
funds, but also to obtain access to hard currency abroad. This came in the
form of Dollars 1.5bn deposited in accounts for the Russians by their
foreign partners, who in turn benefited from a particularly favourable
exchange rate to pick up bargains in the former Soviet Union.
Help in tracking down similar deals is only one reason Mr Gaidar has hired
New York-based Kroll Associates - the corporate investigations firm which
took on the hunt for funds sent abroad by the likes of Duvalier and Saddam
Hussein. Its other tasks will include tracking down Communist party money,
and millions of dollars sent abroad by state enterprises to avoid tax.
President Boris Yeltsin will pay a state visit to the US on June 16-17 to
review 'the ever-strengthening relationships between the two countries,'
President George Bush said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday jibbed at the IMF prescription for its
economy, objecting to proposed pay curbs and threatening to reintroduce
price controls - a big step back to central planning.
Ukraine reluctantly freed prices in January, acting only when radical
Russian reforms forced it to follow suit, and has yet to produce a
comprehensive economic reform programme of its own.
The parliament's move came after the radical labour minister introduced a
bill to cap the amount enterprises can spend on wages. This proposal,
recommended by the International Monetary Fund to stop an inflationary
spiral, provoked the deputies' anger.
Although there has been no brake on rising wages in the dominant state
sector despite a fall in production, political considerations outweighed
economic logic. MPs rejected the proposal and instead demanded that any cap
on wages be matched by reintroduction of price controls.
The cabinet of Prime Minister Vitold Fokin, the former head of the Ukrainian
central planning committee under communist rule, is likely to welcome a
return to price regulation. Popular discontent has been aroused by price
liberalisation. Monopoly enterprises have raised prices of many goods,
including food, beyond the reach of most consumers.
The IMF is likely to be disappointed. Ironically, the parliament is today
due to vote on a radical privatisation package, which, together with freed
prices, would lay the foundations for a true market. If state controls are
reintroduced now it will be politically difficult to free prices a second
time.
Meanwhile, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, French treasury director representing the
Paris Club of western creditor governments, yesterday met Mr Fokin to
discuss payment of Ukraine's 16.37 per cent share of Soviet debt.
There have been signs that Ukraine, which wants to pay independently, and
the Paris Club, which wants the former Soviet republics to assume collective
responsibility for the debt, might reach a compromise whereby Ukraine would
take responsibility for the debt of some smaller republics but pay
separately from Russia.

LIBYA yesterday asked the International Court of Justice in The Hague to
intervene in its dispute with the US and Britain over their demand for
extradition of the alleged Lockerbie bombers.
The Libyan ambassador to Brussels and The Hague, Mr Mohammed Sharaf Eddine
El Faitouri, said he had delivered an 'official complaint' to the court.
Libya's mission at the UN said it was asking the court to resolve the
dispute and to take 'appropriate interim action' regarding the extradition
case.
The US and Britain have threatened reprisals against Libya unless it hands
over two men accused of the bombing.
Britain last night described the Libyan move as 'extraordinary', but said it
would co-operate if the court decided to consider the application.
Meanwhile, Britain said President Muammer Gadaffi's claim to have broken
links with the Irish Republican Army 'falls far short' of demands that Libya
renounce backing for terrorism. Words alone were not enough, officials said.

THE Palestinians yesterday submitted to Israel and the US what it described
as a comprehensive and detailed plan for an interim self-governing authority
on the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said it was an historic
document of great significance: 'If the Israelis reject this then they will
be rejecting the whole basis of the peace process.'
The proposals which provide for elections to a Palestinian authority that
would take broad responsibility for for governing the occupied territories
are certain to be turned down by Israel. The outline of the plan was put
forward by the Palestinian delegation in January. Israel complained then
that it opened the door to a Palestinian state, something which it has
always opposed.
Mrs Ashrawi added yesterday that she hoped for an initial Israeli response
to the 16-page detailed plan at today's negotiating session which is
scheduled to be the final meeting of the present series.

FT  04 MAR 92 / West European car sales expected to fall
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST EUROPEAN new car sales are expected to fall to around 13.2m this year
from 13.42m in 1991, Mr Robert Eaton, president of General Motors Europe,
said yesterday. GM Europe, one of the least protectionist car makers in
western Europe, also signalled significant toughening of its stance against
the Japanese car industry.
While Japanese productivity was high, there was 'reason enough' for the
European car industry to 'maintain its self-confidence,' he said. 'There is
no reason to believe the future of the European industry will depend on
copying Japanese systems. Europe should stop placing the Japanese car
industry on a pedestal.'
In an attack on the Japanese industry, Mr Eaton claimed that Japanese car
makers benefited from 'different cultural, social and societal systems,
lower wages and longer working hours, the long-standing support of and close
co-operation with their government, import barriers that protected their
national industry and profitability for decades, and which are only now
being gradually removed.'
Mr Eaton said UK new car sales were forecast to rise in the second half of
the year to 1.7m compared with 1.59m last year. Sales in Germany were
expected to fall by around 13.5 per cent to some 3.6m from 4.16m in 1991.
Rover, the UK vehicle maker, yesterday took the unusual step of unveiling
two new cars simultaneously, a coupe version of the Rover 800 executive
saloon and a convertible version of the smaller Rover 200, at the Geneva
show. The unveilings mark the start of an expected flurry of new products
from Rover Group this year, to include the first MG two-seater sports model
since the Abingdon factory which produced the MGB closed a decade ago.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Moslems ready to take on Serbs in Sarajevo: Ethnic rivals in
Bosnia-Hercegovina crisis talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARMED Moslems last night took to the streets of Sarajevo, the capital of the
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, to oppose Serbs reported to be
marching on the city.
The moves again heightened tension in the ethnically divided republic in the
wake of the weekend referendum vote in favour of independence.
At the same time, Moslem and Serb leaders went into crisis negotiations with
local commanders of the Yugoslav army in an attempt to defuse the crisis.
They agreed that joint army and police patrols should ask Moslem and Serb
militants to take down newly erected barricades.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of the republic, said on
television there had been a 'partial mobilisation' of Serbs in surrounding
villages and they were reported to be marching on the capital. He urged them
not to enter the city, but to return home.
He said he had asked Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the main Serbian party
in Bosnia, to order Serbs to pull back.
'Serbs can peacefully sleep. No-one is going to attack them,' he said. 'I
beg you to stay at home. Do not attack anyone.'
Mr Karadzic said earlier he had called on Serbs to be ready to defend
themselves if needed. 'They will not attack, but they are ready,' he said.
Hundreds of nervous armed Moslems took up positions on all main roads into
the Bosnian capital. Moslems put up barricades within the city, while Serb
militants blocked roads on the outskirts.
Earlier in the day, the immediate threat of civil war in the republic
appeared to have receded after armed Serb nationalists lifted barricades
they had hastily erected around Sarajevo, following concessions by the
Bosnian government.
The concessions would allow Moslems, Serbs and Croats, the republics' three
main ethnic groups, time to consider if and how the referendum on
independence can be implemented.
Moslems and Croats voted overwhelmingly for independence from the Yugoslav
federation, but Serbs - who make up 33 per cent of the 4.3m population -
boycotted the vote, vowing to remain in a Serb-dominated and smaller
Yugoslavia.
Western diplomats yesterday said the force and intimidation used by armed
Serbs on Monday clearly showed they were now in a much stronger position to
control the republic's political agenda.
In Brussels, the EC preferred to adopt a 'wait and see' approach towards
giving diplomatic recognition. No EC state is pushing for early recognition
of Bosnia, in the way that Germany did for the republics of Slovenia and
Croatia.
EC states feel themselves bound by the Badinter report, which recommended
the referendum in Bosnia. But EC diplomats pointed out that the Twelve had
said in January that the Badinter recommendations would be only one element
in their diplomatic stance towards the republics.
Recognition of Bosnia would have the awkward effect of highlighting the EC's
own impasse over recognising Macedonia under that name. Greece fears this
would stir 'Macedonian' nationalism in northern Greece.

FT  04 MAR 92 / MPs to censure Bank over BCCI: City criticised for failure
to act against fraud as attacks on regulators mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England will face sharp criticism from an all-party House of
Commons committee next week for failing to take prompt action over fraud at
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The conclusions of the report, the second attack on City regulation by MPs
expected within days, are also understood to imply criticism of accountancy
firm Price Waterhouse for failing to identify the scale of fraud at BCCI
before it collapsed in July 1991.
The report, to be discussed today by the Commons' Treasury select committee,
will follow a highly critical report on Monday from the Commons' social
security committee on UK pensions industry and the late Robert Maxwell. That
report will also criticise the City regulatory system and call for
widespread changes to the law governing pensions.
The MPs' criticisms of the Bank of England are likely to increase pressure
on the government to help victims of BCCI's closure.
Ministers are understood largely to have escaped blame in the draft report.
However, one Labour MP on the committee - Mr Brian Sedgemore - is pushing
for amendments blaming Mr John Major for not taking action earlier. Mr
Sedgemore contends that, as chancellor at the time, Mr Major should have
acted when the Bank of England received reports of 'false or deceitful'
practices at BCCI as early as April 1990.
Mr Sedgemore is threatening to vote against the report for being too lenient
on the government. He has prepared extensive amendments, in effect amounting
to a separate report, which he is prepared to publish.
Separately, the Treasury confirmed yesterday that Lord Justice Bingham's
report into BCCI, set up by the government, will not be ready before a
possible April 9 election.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said last year he hoped that it would be
published before the election. This now seems highly unlikely.
A Treasury official said the Bingham report, which is expected to examine Mr
Major's role in the affair, is likely to be released in 'spring or early
summer, it is hoped'.
The Treasury committee's report is expected to reflect serious concern that
the Bank of England failed to act swiftly enough over BCCI.
In evidence to the committee, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor,
said that sufficient evidence of fraud to justify revoking BCCI's banking
licence did not emerge until 1991. The committee also heard from Mr Brian
Quinn, the Bank's director in charge of banking supervision.
In particular, the MPs are expected to question the effectiveness with which
the Bank exercised its regulatory functions - a lapse which led to big
losses for many depositors and created a political storm.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton told MPs how the Bank had received a Price Waterhouse
report in April 1990 saying some accounting transactions at BCCI 'had been
either false or deceitful'. This report was followed by a shake-up at BCCI
and a restructuring of its balance sheet.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he had talked to Mr Major, as chancellor, about the
restructuring but not the contents of the April 1990 report. He claimed that
hard evidence of massive and widespread fraud needed to justify the swoop to
close BCCI was obtained only after a follow-up report by Price Waterhouse
was delivered to the Bank in June 1991.
The MPs' report is written in temperate language, reflecting the caution of
Mr Terence Higgins, their Tory chairman, but its criticism of the Bank of
England is said to be clear cut.

FT  04 MAR 92 / BTR drops plan to create global engineering business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, has dropped plans to create a global
electrical engineering business in the wake of its victory last November in
the Pounds 1.5bn takeover of Hawker Siddeley.
BTR's plan to form such a business, with worldwide annual sales of Pounds
750m, surfaced during the closing stages of the fiercely contested bid
battle. At the time, Hawker executives derided the plan's logic.
In their first interview since capturing Hawker, BTR executives said senior
Hawker managers had persuaded them not to merge the company's electric
motors, transformers, switchgear and railway signalling businesses. The
proposal had also been met by City scepticism during the bid.
Mr Robert Faircloth, BTR's new chief operating officer who is supervising
the integration of Hawker, said: 'We took poetic licence to change our mind
on some of these things.'
He now believes that large electric motors, transformers and switchgears
form a coherent business. Signalling and other railway electrical equipment
will stay in the rail business, because of the shared customer base.
BTR says that rail is one area where it feels it will be necessary to form a
'strategic alliance' with another big group to survive in the competitive
world market. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, angrily denied a
recent report that he was still considering selling Hawker's rail equipment
division to Siemens, the German electrical group.
Hawker had reached an advanced stage in talks regarding the sale of its rail
business to Siemens. As part of its defence, Hawker unveiled plans to sell
60 per cent of its business and focus on three core operations - aerospace,
electric motors and batteries.
Mr Jackson said BTR was not discussing with anyone the disposal of any
Hawker assets, adding: 'The damage this sort of report has done to morale
inside the company is considerable.' Mr Faircloth said he still had an open
mind as to whether any business would be sold. Mr Jackson suggested that BTR
might end up retaining more than the 80 per cent of Hawker as mooted during
the takeover.
BTR achieved much of its success in the 1980s through rigorous profit
planning and has moved quickly to inform Hawker companies of its profits
record and expectations.
Mr Faircloth said many of Hawker's businesses were still losing money and
would need to shed many jobs, a process which had already started. He
declined to give specific figures before BTR's annual results next
Wednesday.
Mr Faircloth paid tribute to the positive attitude of Hawker staff following
the takeover. But, he said: 'The message had to go across that a large
organisation with great turnover, but generating no profit, is a meaningless
situation as far as BTR goes.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / BAe wins Pounds 570m missile contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE has won an order worth Pounds 570m to supply a new air
combat missile for the RAF after a fierce international contest.
The decision announced in the Commons yesterday by Mr Tom King, defence
secretary, provides a crucial lease of life to BAe's Dynamics division. It
is, however, unlikely to quell speculation about a reorganisation in the UK
guided weapons business.
Under the order, BAe will complete development of its Advanced Short-Range
Air-to-Air Missile (Asraam) with Hughes Aircraft of the US, and provide
initial supplies for the RAF. Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing
director, said the contract 'will provide a firm foundation for Dynamics for
the foreseeable future'.
The group has estimated its potential export market for the close-combat
missile, including the US, at more than Pounds 5bn.
The decision comes after successive delays and setbacks to the project,
launched 12 years ago as the European element in a joint US-European scheme
for arming new fighter aircraft.
Failure to win the contract would have resulted in up to 1,000 further
redundancies at BAe's Dynamics division and deprived it of its only
immediate prospect for a newly developed missile.
Competitors for the deal were GEC-Marconi in collaboration with Matra,
manufacturers of the rival French Mica missile, and BGT of Germany, which
proposed an upgraded version of the US-designed Sidewinder.
The decision is a setback for GEC-Marconi, which recently took the first
step towards becoming a producer of complete missile systems by concluding a
Pounds 38m takeover of Ferranti International's guided weapons business.
GEC-Marconi, which has acted until now as supplier of guidance systems for
BAe missiles, said: 'We will carry on regardless.' It had lost a significant
business opportunity but still had other prospects and expected to continue
its relationship with Matra.
The contract announcement followed widespread speculation about a merger
between BAe and GEC-Marconi in the missile sector. While the Asraam order
may make it less imperative for BAe to sell a stake in its Dynamics
division, analysts see it as strengthening the company's hand in trying to
obtain good terms for a joint venture deal.
A plan to merge the division with the guidance systems activities of
Thomson-CSF of France fell through a year ago.
Yesterday's contract is BAe's biggest for guided weapons for about five
years. BAe is believed to have trimmed its price for Asraam substantially
since the Ministry of Defence opened the deal to competition 18 months ago.
RAF Harrier jump-jets and the planned European Fighter Aircraft will be
equipped with the missile.
Most of the work will be carried out at BAe's plants in Stevenage, Herts,
and Lostock, Lancs, and at Hughes' facility in Glenrothes, Fife.
The main sub-contractors include Thorn EMI, Lucas Aerospace and MBB of
Germany.

PRESIDENT George Bush suffered another setback yesterday as Mr Pat Buchanan,

In the race to become the Democratic party's candidate for president, two
front-runners emerged: Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who won in Georgia
by a big margin, and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, victor in
Maryland.
Mr Bush won the primary elections of Republican voters in Georgia and
Maryland and appeared assured of victory in Colorado. But Mr Buchanan's
surprising showing turned the results into a Pyrrhic victory for the bruised
president.
In Georgia, where Mr Buchanan had concentrated his campaign, he appeared to
have scored 39 per cent to Mr Bush's 61 per cent with more than half the
polling precincts counted. In Maryland, exit polls and early returns showed
him with more than 30 per cent of the vote, although he had hardly
campaigned in the state.
The outspoken television commentator based his Georgia campaign on a
racially oriented appeal to conservative white voters, but his most
productive theme remained his assault on Mr Bush for breaking his 1988 'no
new taxes' campaign pledge.
Mr Bush yesterday acknowledged that the 1990 budget compromise - in which he
agreed to a tax increase - was one of the biggest mistakes of his
presidency. But he remained determined to interpret support for his
challenger as a protest vote directed at politicians in general, not just
his own record in office.
'To those who have been with me in the past but did not vote for me today, I
hear your concerns and understand your frustration with Washington. I am
committed to regaining your support,' he said.
Mr Buchanan still shows little sign of having a broad enough appeal to win
even a single state from Mr Bush, but his repeated strong showings seem
likely to kill any lingering hopes the Bush campaign may have nurtured that
their irritating challenger might retire from the race.
Instead, he appears sure to remain a thorn in Mr Bush's side right up to the
Republican convention in Houston in August, weakening the president's
efforts to prepare for the November 3 election.
On the Democratic side, Governor Clinton's victory in the Georgia primary
had been anticipated but the margin of victory outperformed expectations.
With 57 per cent of precincts reporting, his tally topped 63 per cent to 18
per cent for Mr Tsongas.
In Maryland, exit polls and early returns showed Mr Tsongas had won an
estimated 43 per cent, against Mr Clinton's 32 per cent. Although the margin
was narrower than Mr Clinton's in Georgia, Mr Tsongas in Maryland was
outside his home region - unlike Mr Clinton in Georgia.
In both states, the three other Democratic hopefuls - Senator Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former Governor Jerry Brown of
California - garnered so few votes that political analysts raised doubts
about whether their campaigns could continue.
But they still hoped their bids would be salvaged by the voting in other
states yesterday: primaries in Colorado and Utah, and closed party caucuses
in Minnesota, Idaho and Washington state. Results from these ballots were
not expected until this morning.
The seven states which voted yesterday account for 10 per cent of the
delegates to the Democrats' nominating convention, to be held in New York in
July. For the Republicans, only five states voted.

Decisive step forward

THE MID-ATLANTIC archipelago of the Azores is following in Madeira's
footsteps by launching a free trade zone and offshore centre based on the
island of Santa Maria. Companies that set up there benefit from conditions
similar to those in Madeira, such as a zero tax rate and EC membership as
well as cash grants covering a large proportion of investment costs.
The project took a decisive step forward in June 1991 with the final
ratification by the EC and the central Portuguese government of the Azores'
application to add an offshore financial and services centre to the free
zone. Santa Maria was chosen as the base for the free zone mainly because of
the availability of surplus manpower and infrastructures after the island's
airport, once a key transatlantic refuelling point, lost importance with the
advent of long-range aircraft. Large investments have since upgraded the
airport for the use of companies operating in the free zone. A port has been
built and telecommunications are being modernized to provide high quality
telephone, computer and satellite communications by 1993.
The free zone covers an area of more than 400,000 square metres. Modern
offices and warehouse space is rented to companies until they build their
own facilities. However, investors are not limited to setting up in the
designated area of Santa Maria. Companies can seek authorisation to
establish production facilities anywhere in the nine-island Azores
archipelago and still enjoy all the benefits of the free zone, apart from a
20 per cent reduction in some incentives.
The benefits for companies operating within the ambit of the zone include
exemption from corporate and personal taxation until 2012; exemption from
customs duties and local taxes; free repatriation of funds, dividends and
capital gains; low company registration fees; and grants of up to 100 per
cent of the cost of training workers and 50 per cent of the cost of renting
land and buildings, construction, industrial installation and the purchase
of equipment and machinery.
Two companies already working in the zone have installed plants in Sao
Miguel Island. One taps the island's forestry resources to produce
industrial wood products; the other restores and exports classic cars. A
third company, takes full advantage of training grants to provide courses
for computer technicians and will recruit the best students for its own
production plant in the Santa Maria free zone. At least 12 other companies
are preparing to set up in the zone amid growing global interest.
'Santa Maria is proving particularly attractive to companies from Australia,
China, Macao and other Asian countries who are looking for an entry to
Europe,' says Joao Gago da Camara, the head of Sociedade de Desenvolvimento
da Zona Franca Mariense (Zofram), the company that runs the zone on a
concessionary basis.
For classification of the origin of products, production in the zone is
divided into Portuguese, European and non-European classes. Normal
international quota limits apply to exports from the zone, depending on the
level of European or other content. However, Zofram hopes to establish
specific agreements with regions, including Europe and the United States, to
waive the application of quota restrictions on goods from the zone as an
added stimulus to the development of the Azores.

Ready to increase offshore business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL group of islands off the west coast of Africa, almost 900 kilometres
from Europe and where almost everything has to be imported, was an unusual
choice of location for a new international business centre.
But after three years, Madeira has nearly 500 companies registered to
operate either in its offshore financial centre or in its free trade zone.
This is few by comparison with other centres, but officials believe growth
will accelerate now that most of the legislation has been ironed out and the
infrastructure improved.
They say that Madeira offers competitive incentives and that, though it is
distant from continental Europe, it is an autonomous region of Portugal
anchored in the European Community, as well as a convenient stop-off point
between Europe and north and south America.
'We had to develop infrastructures, we are building a deep sea harbour, and
all this takes a long time, but the prospects are very good,'says Francisco
Costa, chairman of the Madeira Development Company (SDM), which is
responsible for developing offshore activities.
Nineteen banks and one insurance company are operating offshore. Most are
branches of Portuguese institutions, with a few international banks,
including Manufacturers Hanover, Lloyds Bank Fund Management (Channel
Islands), Credit Lyonnais, and Deutsche Bank. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the
Spanish banking group, is awaiting a licence to open a branch.
Bankers say the offshore business has been exceptionally good. David
Caldeira, general manager of the offshore branch of Caixa Geral de Depositos
(CGD), the biggest Portuguese bank, says business has grown faster than
expected, increasing more than tenfold between 1990 and 1991.
Investors have come mainly from Europe, and from South America where
interest has been surprisingly strong, with clients transferring their
deposits to Madeira.
Mr Caldeira. believes that the language and Madeira's image as being clean
and safe are important factors for South American investors; while European
clients are more interested in Portuguese bonds and securities and taking
advantage of the tax breaks.
Lino Bento, operations executive at the offshore branch of Banco Espirito
Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), Portugal's third largest bank, says
security is a big preoccupation among non-European clients. 'Many are not
particularly concerned about interest rates. The main thing for them is to
know that their funds are safe.'
Spanish investors see Madeira as an alternative to Gibraltar; and farther
afield, an increasing number of clients are coming from South Africa and the
Far East.
Fernando Couto, manager of New Madeira Investment Servicos, a management and
registration company, notices increased interest from Hong Kong. So far it
has been mainly in the financial sector, but he expects more companies to
come to the free zone.
The free zone, where manufacturing is concentrated, is on a 120-hectare site
on the main island's eastern coast, 8km from the airport and 30km from
Funchal, the island's main town. The first phase of development is well
advanced. The hilly landscape has been levelled, and new factories are
springing up. Work has also begun on enlarging the tunnel on the access road
between the free zone and Canical, a nearby town from where many new
factories recruit their workers.
A new deep-sea harbour, which will allow goods to be shipped directly in and
out of the free zone, is due to be completed by October.
Ten companies are manufacturing in the free zone, with two more awaiting a
licence and several others (including one from the Far East which could
create up to 1,000 jobs) under discussion. They include manufacturers of
high-tech optical instruments, textiles, household appliances, food, marble
and jewellery, and have come from as far apart as Brazil, Hong Kong,
Lebanon, Ireland and Portugal.
Bradley Clarke, general manager of Optronique, which makes precision optical
instruments, says the worst problem was bureaucracy. It had been difficult
to obtain residence permits, and there were long delays over customs
clearance for goods; but most of these problems had been overcome.
Mr Clarke came to Madeira from South Africa, because it was close to the
company's export markets in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and to
its sources of materials. It offered good financial conditions and a
politically stable environment.
Stanley Lam, of Sheenotto Industries of Hong Kong, manager of a clothes
factory, says good incentives, low labour costs, and Madeira's location
between Europe and the US were deciding factors. 'It takes 21 days to ship
goods from Hong Kong to the US, but from here it can take as little as 11
days.'
Edgar Rodrigues de Aguiar, of Amaplast, a Brazilian plastics manufacturer,
emigrated from Madeira to Brazil 16 years ago. He says there were
sentimental reasons for coming back to Madeira, but 'you don't make an
investment just for sentimental reasons'. The 2,000 square metres factory,
which makes plastic bags, is capital-intensive and employs 62 workers on
continuous production. At the moment, goods have to be sent by road to
Funchal for shipping, but the new deep-sea port will reduce transport costs
and save time.
A new international shipping register was established, to complete the range
of facilities available, but this proved troublesome. Portuguese social
security legislation and restrictive clauses covering crews had to be
changed.
Registered ships sail under the Portuguese flag, and according to Portugal's
laws, the captain and at least 50 per cent of crews had to be Portuguese,
making the register unattractive for most ship-owners. The law has been
amended, abolishing the nationality requirement for crews, except for ships
that call regularly at Portuguese ports, which must have 50 per cent EC
crews. The new law comes into force this month.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (9): The
state prevails - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY NEXT winter, Portuguese viewers will be able to choose from four
television channels instead of the existing two state-owned networks,
following the award of two private broadcasting licences.
Choice is also increasing in other walks of life, as the government pursues
an ambitious programme of economic liberalisation and privatisation.
Thirteen important companies have been wholly or partly privatised since
April 1989, raising a total of Es364bn (Dollars 2.6bn). State monopolies or
privileges involving gasoline, cereals, alcohol, sugar and other products
have been dismantled. Financial markets have been liberalised. State-owned
newspapers have been turned over to private enterprise, radio opened to
private broadcasters and airline competition freed.
In spite of this wave of liberalisation, the state continues to play a
dominant role in an economy where the public administrative sector alone
generates nearly 50 per cent of gross domestic product. Matters from the
price of bread to the cost of a train ticket are still determined by the
state.
'After the sweeping nationalisations of 1975, state ownership in Portugal
was comparable only with the communist regimes of eastern Europe,' says
Alfredo de Sousa, a professor of economics at the Universidade Nova de
Lisboa. 'The pendulum has moved a long way, but it still hasn't reached the
other side.'
Prof de Sousa is one of several critics who believe the government could
have moved the privatisation process along faster. He blames indecision,
bureaucracy and the setting of specific objectives for each privatisation
for what he sees as unnecessary delays.
Some analysts say delays in the privatisation of Portugal's steel, oil and
cement companies could lead to a substantial reduction in their price,
because of a less favourable economic climate in the relevant sectors, loss
of market position, sharp falls in profitability and unforecast losses.
But others argue that the depressed state of the country's capital markets
has held the process back. 'Only by allowing a much bigger participation of
foreigners in the privatisation programme would it have been possible to
move ahead more quickly,' says Vitor Constancio, a professor of economics
and former finance minister.
The government has made clear that foreign control of privatised companies
will not generally be authorised. In all but two privatisations, foreign
participation has been limited to between 2 and 35 per cent. This is
naturally unpopular with foreign investors. But what is proving even more
unpopular with their Portuguese counterparts is that these limits have
rarely been observed.
Prof Constancio, a former leader of the opposition Socialist party, also
opposes plans to privatise more than 50 per cent of Portucel, a leading pulp
and paper company, and two cement companies: 'I would maintain state control
over these companies which are important to the economy, use natural
resources and are in a position of virtual monopoly, especially the cement
companies . . . The only thing that is worse than a public monopoly is a
private monopoly.'
The government has announced an acceleration of the privatisation programme
in 1992, following a suspension for last October's general election. Revenue
from privatisations is forecast to reach Es350bn this year, as some of the
biggest state-owned companies go on sale.
The sale of a remaining 60 per cent of state-owned capital in Banco Espirito
Santo Comercial de Lisboa, the second largest commercial bank, was completed
on February 25. One of the biggest privatisation attractions this year will
be the beginning of the sale of the oil company Petrogal, Portugal's largest
commercial enterprise.
The first stage of the sale will by public subscription for 19m Es1,000
shares - representing a capital increase of 20 per cent  - together with the
sale of 5.2 per cent of existing capital. Bidders must undertake to purchase
a further 25 per cent of current capital within a maximum of three years
after the close of the initial sale. This will give the winner control of
more than 50 per cent of the company. The runner-up in the first phase will
be given a chance to raise its offer if it was originally within 2.5 per
cent of the top price.
Candidates must be 'financially sound' and bid through specifically
incorporated holding companies with a minimum capital of Es31bn. Foreign
participation must be limited to 40 per cent of the voting capital.
The projected price per share is Es1,700 for an expected total cash flow of
Es131bn. This is down from an earlier valuation of Es140bn, partly because
of 1991 operating losses, the first in five years. A Dollars 300m syndicated
loan agreement that Petrogal signed in London last December should help to
make the company more attractive.
Other companies expected to be at least partially privatised this year
include:
Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, with an estimated value of Es60bn;
Siderurgia Nacional, a steel company in which the state will retain a
10-per-cent 'golden share';
Mundial Confianca, an insurance company, of which an indivisible block
representing 40 per cent of the total capital will be sold;
Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the second stage of the sale of Portugal's
largest commercial bank;
Quimitecnica (chemicals);
Imperio (insurance); and
Rodoviaria de Algarve (road transport).

Sector grows fast in a decade of change - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTUGUESE insurance sector has gone through as much change in a decade
as most industries would experience in a lifetime, and the challenge is not
over yet.
Nationalisation, mergers, the growth of underdeveloped types of insurance,
an influx of foreign investors, and changes in both the products and the way
they are sold: every factor imaginable has been subject to incredible flux.
Celso Cardoso do Amaral, managing director of Union des Assurances de Paris
(UAP), a French-based international insurance company, reflects the change.
When asked what challenges he sees for the future for his company, he leaps
eagerly to his feet in an elegant boardroom, and flicks back the pages of
two flipcharts behind him.
They show rapidly-written scrawls on many sheets, evidence of brainstorming
which has taken place only a few days earlier with senior colleagues. UAP is
in the throes of adjustment to the merger of four companies: Alianca
Seguradora, UAP Portugal, UAP Portugal Vida and Garantia.
'We have sorted out our logo and decided on our new name: UAP-Allianca,' he
says proudly. 'Now we have a five-year plan. Our priorities are to harmonise
internal systems, improve performance per employee, and to do it as fast as
possible.'
In another, rather humbler, office only a few minutes away across Lisbon,
adjustments of a different kind are going on. Mr Nuno Cardoso da Silva,
director of marketing at Mundial Confianca, one of the state-owned insurance
companies, is preparing for privatisation.
A few years ago, three nationalised companies were merged into the present
one. The business is perhaps still adjusting to that influence. But now it
is having to prepare for the uncertainties of private ownership and an
increasingly competitive insurance market, while still digesting the effects
of over-staffing of the last few years.
'We were probably the only successful merger at the time it happened,' says
Mr Cardoso da Silva. 'It was highly profitable and all very nice. But I am
less optimistic about the future. Whatever happened in the past bears no
relation to what will happen now.'
If there were a book on the recent history of insurance in Portugal, it
would probably begin in 1974. Previously there had been a regulated and
stable market, which remained almost unchanged for more than 40 years.
Then came the Revolution, and with it, nationalisation. About 23 companies
were taken into state ownership. Many of the existing executives trained in
the sector left the boards. Other qualified staff drifted away. Contact with
international insurance organisations came to an end.
Renewed change did not take long, however. In 1976, the National Insurance
Institute was created under the auspices of the ministry of finance. Many
laws and regulations were reviewed. Ruy de Carvalho, president of the
Association of Portuguese Insurers, says there then followed a 'very shy
liberalisation' over the next decade, partly in preparation for membership
of the European Community.
Actions on solvency margins, third-party liability and freedom of
establishment (determining who could set up in business) were taken, to
bring Portugal into line with its other European counterparts, he says.
There were innovations in the development of work-based compensation.
Automobile insurance became compulsory. The 23 state insurance companies
were merged into six large groups, while foreign companies began to nibble
at the market again.
'We were very close to economic chaos,' says Mr Carvalho. 'It seems
incredible today but not at that time.'
It was not until the late 1980s that a clause in the Portuguese constitution
forbidding privatisation was overturned. But for several years, the
government had allowed the nationalised companies to act almost as if they
were private.
From 44 companies in 1983, the sector has now grown to about 80. Many are
branch offices of foreign insurance companies, led numerically by British
owners, followed by the Germans and the French. Foreign companies collected
19 per cent of all Portuguese premiums in 1980. Last year the figure had
increased to 28 per cent.
Aside from Acoreana, which deals with insurance in the Azores, only two
directly state-owned insurance companies remain to be fully sold to the
private sector: Mundial and Imperio. Both sales should be completed this
year.
That leaves two others - Fidelidade and Cosec  - which are owned through
state-controlled financial conglomerates. One of these at least may soon
also be sold.
Portugal still represents only a tiny part of the European market for
insurance, with an estimated market share of 0.5 per cent. But it is
developing fast. The ratio of premiums to gross domestic product, which
stood at 2 per cent for many years, is now at about 4 per cent and rapidly
growing towards the European average of 6 per cent.
The penetration for non-life business is already roughly comparable. Life
business is far less developed, and has experienced rapid compensatory
expansion in the last few years as a result, growing by 80 per cent in 1989,
more than 50 per cent in 1990 and at an estimated rate of 33 per cent in
1991.
At the same time, there has been a lot of product innovation, says Mr
Carvalho. The re-opening of the Portuguese stock exchange opened
opportunities for creating new life products. 'In the old days, we had
products we tried to sell to customers,' he says. 'Now we have clients and
try to understand what they need.'
The distribution network, for insurance, is still tightly controlled, with
work from agents and brokers representing 60-65 per cent of premiums.
However, the banks and even the post office are beginning to take a share of
business.
Before his enthusiasm goes too far, however, Mr Carvalho stops, almost in
mid-sentence. 'That's the good news. Now let's deal with the bad,' he says.
Many of the insurance companies appear to be overstaffed. That reflects
political decisions by the state to find jobs for all those returning from
its former colonies, and also to provide guarantees during the mergers
within the sector. It is still extremely difficult to fire people.
Profit levels are unsatisfactory. In fact, at 2 per cent of premiums with
current inflation, Mr Carvalho estimates that there are no profits being
made at the moment, although premiums continue to fall. Regulation and taxes
on premiums remain.
'Personally, I feel that the companies have to do something about the level
of competition,' he says. 'From now until 1995 there will be difficult
times. This year will be the most difficult.'
Mr Cardoso do Amaral, of UAP, concedes the same point. 'We must be viable
and profitable,' he says. 'These are words not often used in the insurance
industry in Portugal.'

Record inflows - Foreign investment has revitalised Setubal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment has helped to transform the port of Setubal, 40
kilometres south of Lisbon, from a depressed shipbuilding town to the
bustling heart of a new industrial region.
American golfers from local car companies are a familiar sight, where less
than a decade ago unemployed workers were queueing outside soup kitchens.
Officials are trying to bring a similar transformation to the crisis-hit
region of Vale do Ave, in northern Portugal, where the government estimates
that as many as 45,000 jobs could be lost by 2000, as textile, clothing and
footwear companies succumb to increased competition.
'Our aim is to attract foreign and domestic investment to the Vale do Ave,
so that the industrial and social map of the region can be changed in the
same way that investment helped bring new hope and a future to the Setubal
area,' says Miguel Athayde Marques, president of the Portuguese Foreign
Trade Institute (ICEP), which is also responsible for foreign investment.
Attracted mainly by low costs, a competitive labour force and high
incentives, foreign investment has flooded into the Setubal region over the
past six years. Workers shed by the shipbuilding and heavy-engineering
industries can now find jobs at high-technology plants such Ford
Electronics, Delco Remy ignition systems and Valmet tractors.
But the impact of foreign investment on the Setubal area will not reach its
peak for another three years, when an Es450bn (Dollars 3.2bn)
Ford-Volkswagen plant, the biggest foreign investment ever made in Portugal,
will begin production of a five-door, seven-seat multipurpose vehicle.
The coveted Ford-VW project helped to bring total foreign investment in
Portugal up to a record Es799bn last year, a 67 per cent increase on 1990.
This includes only shareholders' capital; overall investment in a total of
3,000 projects was above Es1,000bn. The annual rate of foreign investment
has grown a remarkable 37-fold since Portugal joined the EC in 1986.
'Investments like the Ford-VM project don't come along every day,' says Mr
Athayde Marques, 'but we will be happy if we can maintain foreign investment
in 1992 at the 1990 level of Es479bn.'
Lisbon newspapers are already reporting two big potential foreign investment
projects for the Vale do Ave area: a Samsung semi-conductor plant, involving
an investment of Es60bn and 600 jobs; and a Nokia project to produce
televisions and computer monitors, involving an investment of Es10bn.
Officials prefer not to comment on such reports, but they are confident that
the region will prove attractive.
'Companies will find ready-trained workforces that can be easily adapted to
new skills through vocational training,' says Mr Athayde Marques. 'There are
also industrial plants ready for adaptation, as well as green-field sites
and good infrastructures that are constantly being improved.'
Special EC-financed incentives will be available for investment in the area,
under a programme known as Sindave. Grants will cover 75 per cent of viable
projects. Tax incentives and venture-capital funds will also be on offer.
These incentives are additional to Portugal's intrinsic attractions to
investors. Mr Athayde Marques sees the country as a low-cost centre offering
competitive productivity and direct access to the EC's affluent consumers.
'It's a question of good value for money, rather than being cheap or
expensive,' he says. 'On top of this, Portugal enjoys political stability
and labour peace, with less than half the EC average for days lost through
strikes.'
Given Portugal's low unemployment rate and the need to diversify and
modernise industry, concern is being shown about the quality, rather than
the size, of foreign investment projects. Broadly speaking, for projects of
less than Es10bn, incentives are awarded automatically according to a points
system, regardless of whether the project is foreign or Portuguese. Above
that level, a contractual system applies, under which the authorities take
into account:
The extent to which the project introduces new technology and upgrades the
labour-force through vocational training;
The export content of the project, and the extent to which it will help
reduce the trade deficit; and
The extent to which the project will be anchored in the community, in terms
of up-stream and downstream links. Stand-alone projects that could
facilitate future disinvestment will be at a disadvantage.
In assessing potential investment, the authorities first look at an
investment banker's business plan for the financial and strategic aspects of
the project. They want to know the forecast internal rate of return, the
risks involved, and how those risks can be hedged.
They also consider how the project fits in with the company's global
strategy. A crucial condition will be that projects must be profitable in
themselves, and not depend on the award of incentives for their viability. A
further examination will be made of the impact of the project in regional
and national terms. It should also have a positive effect on trade and
foreign-exchange balances.

Market in the doldrum - Trading in shares declined on the stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE TRANSACTIONS in Portuguese government bonds and securities have boomed
in the past year, trading in shares has declined, in spite of official
efforts to attract investors back to the bolsas.
Several factors affected the market's performance.
High real interest rates and special fiscal benefits for purchasers of
shares in companies being privatised combined to favour investment in
government-influenced stocks, at the expense of the broader market.
Private Portuguese investors, who have seen the value of shares steadily
decline since the stock market crash of 1987, continued to stay away from
the market. At the same time, foreign (mainly institutional and corporate)
investors, who had been attracted by expectation of rapid gains in an
'emerging' market, have been more cautious, switching their attention to the
bond market instead.
The Portuguese market remains small, and is easily influenced by the
behaviour of a small number of large transactions. Foreign investors, who
often account for the bulk of share transactions, also have a
disproportionate effect. Recent reforms have yet to have their full impact.
Last year's figures speak for themselves. The value of transactions in
government bonds and securities rose from Es341bn (Dollars 2.4bn) in 1990 to
Es1,460bn. In contrast, the value of shares traded on the official market,
not including share flotation for privatisations or over-the-counter trading
on the secondary market, fell from Es260.2bn in 1990 to Es244.1bn last year.
The Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) index ended 1991 at 1,953.8 - almost 9 per
cent below its level a year earlier - and has since slipped below 1,900.
The focus now for investors, Portuguese and foreign, is on selective
investment, based on careful analysis of prospects for specific sectors in
the economy, and on the longer-term outlook for a small number of
well-chosen companies. Speculative investments are out, though the habit has
not been fully shaken, as demonstrated in hectic dealing in shares of
companies being privatised.
Jose Carlos Pestana Teixeira, president of the Lisbon bolsa, says high
interest rates alone do not explain the poor performance of the stock
market: lack of liquidity and insufficient information about the market also
played their part. 'A large part of information about the market never
reaches people, whether in Portugal or abroad.' Special efforts will be made
to improve the flow of information, he adds.
New instruments will also be introduced, and a futures and options market,
now under consideration, could come into being within 18 months. Meanwhile,
Mr Pestana Teixeira hopes to establish marketmakers for shares, as has been
done with the government bond market.
Some analysts believe the market remains too rigid and time-consuming. 'When
an investor takes a decision to buy or sell shares, he wants to move
straight away, not weeks later,' says one.
Mr Pestana Teixeira rejects this criticism, saying the problem is not
technical but one of liquidity, which the creation of marketmakers could
help to alleviate. 'It's partly a cultural problem. You don't create a
market by decree, but by building up the confidence of investors,' he says.
He believes that recent and forthcoming reforms will help to make the market
more efficient, flexible and transparent. These have included the division
of the market into three tiers. The first tier, or 'official market',
includes a small group of 'top' companies, listed on the new computerised
continuous-trading system that links the two exchanges in Lisbon and Oporto;
and a larger group of about 50 companies, which are quoted twice a day, as
under the old system.
Continuous trading was launched last September, with an initial three
companies. The number has since grown to 11; and up to 30 could eventually
be included, provided they have a minimum market capitalisation of Es500m.
The second tier, or 'second market', is for small and medium-size companies
with a market capitalisation of at least Es125m. Companies in this tier are
quoted whenever there is trading in their shares, but are listed on only one
of the two exchanges. At present, this second market consists of three
stocks.
The third tier, or 'market without quotations', is for companies which do
not meet the criteria on liquidity or financial status. Companies in this
tier can be traded on either of the two exchanges.
Last year, an independent securities exchange commission was set up, to
regulate and supervise the market. The exchanges are now managed by two
private companies, which will ultimately merge; while the creation of a
central clearing-house for all shares will eventually enable delivery
against payment settlements. The number of authorised brokers will be
doubled to 20 in Lisbon, and raised from 10 to 14 in Oporto, to encourage
greater competition and better services.
Mr Pestana Teixeira believes that, once the reforms are fully understood and
assimilated by investors, the market will be in a better position to
recover. Interest rates are slowly coming down, and inflation should also
fall, with a positive effect on company earnings, leading some analysts to
expect an upturn later this year.
'In our view, the BTA index is substantially undervalued,' says Jeremy
Campbell-Lamerton, director with Baring Securities. 'There are stocks
available that are as good as any in France, Germany or the UK, and we
expect foreign investors to return to Portugal in 1992.'

Spectacular growth - Expansion in the banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGUESE banks enjoyed explosive growth during 1991.
Networks expanded spectacularly; institutions diversified, and considerably
increased the range of products and services they offer; and the traditional
division of labour, between commercial and investment banks, was eroded as
players battled for market share.
Expansion was fuelled by a 23 per cent increase in corporate and personal
credit, in spite of high interest rates. Prime corporate customers now pay
about 19 per cent for funds, while the rate for consumer credit can be above
26 per cent.
Economic growth slackened, but at 2.7 per cent remained sufficiently sturdy
to encourage demand; and with real wages rising by almost 5 per cent,
private consumption was buoyant.
All this provided a propitious setting for financial institutions rushing to
complete their expansion plans before January 1993, when they will face open
competition within the European Community's single market in financial
services.
The most dramatic growth was at Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of
Portugal's leading commercial banks, which last year opened 111 branches,
bringing its total network to 242 branches. Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP
president, says 1991 was 'the year of greatest effort since the foundation
of the bank' six years ago.
BCP took on an extra 1,000 employees (it now has more than 3,000), all of
whom required specialised training; expanded the activities of the group in
fund management, leasing, brokerage and insurance; and spent another Es5bn
(Dollars 36m) on computer systems.
Mr Jardim Goncalves says this was achieved without affecting the bank's
performance. Total assets grew by over 50 per cent to Es1,206bn, and net
profits by 33 per cent to Es18.2bn. Credit extended to clients was up 75 per
cent to Es516bn, and customer deposits grew 59 per cent to Es932bn.
Taking a different route, Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI), the leading
private investment bank, pursued its own expansion plans by buying Banco
Fonsecas &amp; Burnay (BFB), a medium-size commercial bank that was privatised
last summer.
The purchase of BFB and its 115 branches gives BPI, with headquarters in
Oporto and an office in Lisbon, immediate access to a wide section of the
market. Artur Santos Silva, BPI president, says the assimilation of the bank
into the group is proceeding smoothly, and that this year's targets for
strengthening BFB's provisions to cover bad debts and replenish its
under-funded pension fund have already been passed.
'We are very pleased with what we've achieved so far. A new strategy for BFB
has been prepared, and we will open another 25 branches,' he says, adding
that BFB will be a retail, not a universal, bank, and that it will target
middle segments of the private market and small and medium-sized companies.
The effect of the purchase on the BPI group's consolidated balance sheet, is
noticeable already. Total assets rose from Es171bn in 1990 to Es975bn at end
1991, though, even without BFB, group assets doubled to Es305bn. Net profits
rose from Es8.6bn in 1990 to Es9.3bn, though the 1990 figure was inflated by
extraordinary income from the sale of an 11 per cent stake in another bank.
In direct competition with BPI, the Banco de Comercio e Industria (BCI), a
private bank with a leading position in corporate trade financing, expanded
organically into the retail sector by more than trebling the number of its
branches from 25 to 84 with a total investment of Es21bn. The bank's
physical expansion was supported by a punchy advertising campaign, pointedly
aimed at customers of the more conservative state-owned banks.
Francisco Veloso, BCI president, says results exceeded the bank's
expectations. The number of non-corporate clients almost quadrupled, and in
the last six months the value of private deposits more than doubled. 'It was
very difficult. We had to change everything to meet our targets, but we
managed to do it without a (negative) effect on our results.'
BCI officials say total deposits (private and corporate) rose from Es63bn in
1990 to Es166bn last year. Credit extended to clients was up 73 per cent
from Es94.2bn to Es163bn, and total assets rose 109 per cent from Es147bn to
Es308bn.
BCP, BPI and BCI provided the most striking examples of a general trend that
is likely to continue this year. Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA),
Portugal's second largest bank, which was 33 per cent privatised over a year
ago and is awaiting a second phase of privatisation, wants to increase the
number of its branches from 200 to 260 by the end of 1992. And Banco Totta &amp;
Acores (BTA), a leading private bank in which Banesto of Spain has an
important stake, plans to open 10 branches by June, to bring its network to
213 branches.
Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), which was fully
privatised last month, raised the number of its branches from 168 to 210
last year, and is expected to open another 40 branches this year. Final
results for 1991 are likely to show an increase in assets of over 20 per
cent, from Es1,197bn to Es1449bn, and net profits up from Es12.5bn to
Es15bn.
Now that control of BESCL has returned to the Espirito Santo group,
representing the interests of the Espirito Santo family who owned the bank
before its nationalisation in 1975, its future will depend on the group's
broader strategy.
'BESCL will be the centre of the whole group, but it will remain
fundamentally a retail bank. Other group institutions will specialise in
investment banking, leasing, insurance and other activities in Portugal and
internationally,' says Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, group chairman.
Foreign banks in Portugal also have expanded. Barclays has grown from five
branches in 1990 to 28 at the end of 1991, and plans to have up to 60
branches by the end of this year. Banco Bilbao Viscaya (BBV), the Spanish
banking group which bought Lloyds Bank Portugal with its 12 branches in
1990, plans to open another 60 branches this year. Other spanish banks are
gradually building up their Portuguese branch networks.
Newcomers add to the pressure. The Banco Nacional de Credito Imobiliario
(BNC), a housing mortgage bank established last autumn, plans to open 17
branches this year.
Finantia, a merchant bank in all but name, is awaiting official
authorisation to transform itself into a fully fledged bank, as are several
other financial services and investment companies. Eduardo Costa, managing
director, says Finantia will not compete with the retail banks in the broad
market for deposits, but as an investment bank it could effectively draw on
corporate clients to increase its funding base.
Finding a cheaper source of funding is one of the main reasons for the
investment banks' move into the retail sector. For most banks, broadening
their activities is seen also as the only way to secure their future and
maintain market shares in the face of increasing competition and declining
interest rates and margins.
Alexandre Vaz Pinto, chairman of the Portuguese Bankers Association, says
conditions will be more difficult this year. 'Margins will fall by about 1
percentage point, but it could be more, especially for banks with a small
deposit base which rely on the money markets for funding. The cost of
funding on the money markets could rise.'
With average margins of about 5 per cent for the big banks, a one-point fall
is tolerable, though some bankers believe margins could fall twice that
much, and this has to be set against rising operating and expansion costs.
'The time of cheap funding is over,' says Mr Veloso. 'Controlling costs and
risks and improving productivity will be the crucial factors.'

Presidential caution is needed - Portugal is currently a little EC-mad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Mr Sarsfield Cabral, director of the European Commission in
Lisbon, commands fine views over the city from the top floor of a modern
building. Its presence is an opulent symbol of Portugal's widening circle of
influence.
The country may be one of the most recent and remote members of the European
Community, admitted in 1986. But its enthusiasm for the institution - now
given an extra boost by its first presidency  - is clearly evident.
It does not take a long walk across Lisbon before a flag, or a poster of the
blue and gold flag of the EC, comes into view. The newspapers have devoted
regular, substantial sections on news related to the presidential period.
Portugal is currently a little EC-mad.
Mr Cabral, himself an unashamed propagandist for the EC, concedes that
perhaps it has all gone a little too far. 'This kind of euphoria has brought
some problems,' he says, singling out the inflation which has accompanied
the rapid economic growth since the mid-1980s.
Other senior government officials admit that, while it is an honour, the
timing of their presidency could hardly have been more difficult.
Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the foreign minister, will have to tread carefully
during the Portuguese EC presidency, while a number of important issues are
considered. Substantial efforts are needed to complete the formation of the
single European market by the end of the year. Delicate negotiations will be
needed to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and to agree on a new
package of EC structural funding and budget measures.
In addition, foreign affairs are likely to continue to take up considerable
time, including the situation in Yugoslavia, the Commonwealth of Independent
States, and Algeria. Portugal itself, given its colonial past, may also try
to push more Third World issues on to the agenda, according to Mr Cabral.
He says there has been tremendous change in Portugal since it joined the EC
in 1986, and that perceptions of the Community have become much more
positive.
'The first five years was a success,' he says. 'Portugal has changed
completely, and the economy has prospered. The mentality of the people has
changed from fatalistic to more optimistic and confidant as the standard of
living has improved.'
He cites the example of supermarkets, which he says have been transformed
from drab stores offering few, poor-quality goods not much better than those
in eastern Europe, into modern outlets stocked with a wide range of quality
and cosmopolitan goods.
Mr Cabral suggests that many factors fostered support for EC membership,
including the contact the people had with relatives who had emigrated,
particularly to France, and were enjoying greater prosperity there.
Equally, he says, joining the EC was seen as a way to fortify the country's
fragile democracy against both communism and the prospect of right-wing
dictatorship.
It has required a fundamental shift for a country which is geographically on
the margins of Europe, and had historically focused outwards across the
Atlantic, with its back deliberately turned away from Spain.
EC membership has brought a sense of integration with the rest of Europe. It
has also brought some very direct financial rewards: transfers to date from
EC funds total about Es550bn (Dollars 3.9bn). Another Es900bn is planned up
until 1993.
That has helped to fund large-scale infrastructure projects, and fuelled
rapid economic growth. Officials also defensively suggest that any frauds
which have taken place are minor compared with those recorded in other
member states.
Mr Cabral says the country is well advanced on implementing many EC
directives, ignoring those for which it has negotiated delays, such as
capital movements. It has taken steps in the current budget to move towards
harmonisation of VAT, for instance.
But now the sacrifices are beginning to bite. An economic convergence plan,
submitted late last year, commits Portugal to a series of tough measures to
bring the economy more in line with the rest of its EC partners. It aims to
reduce inflation and gradually cut the public-sector deficit through lower
spending and reduced interest rates.
Many industries nationalised in 1974 are now being privatised, and most
commentators expect the process to lead to redundancies. The agricultural
sector is still heavily subsidised, with a large number of uneconomic and
inefficient farms. Economic openness is also likely to increasingly effect
some of the country's traditional industries such as textiles. Many may not
survive foreign competition.
An important issue is the timing of membership of the exchange rate
mechanism. It could happen this year, and some commentators have even
suggested that, for political reasons, it might be announced during the
presidency. To do so would bring the escudo in while inflation remains much
higher than the EC average. In any event, it will bring greater discipline
to the management of the economy.
A recent OECD report on the Portuguese economy suggested that unemployment
is now below sustainable levels; while growth would be impossible to sustain
without more effective control of inflation and liquidity, a reduction in
the size of government spending, and a freer reign on exchange rates.
Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Bank of Portugal, is critical
of this report. He says a free exchange rate could jeopardise the
restructuring of the economy. But he accepts that government expenditure
must fall as part of a tough series of measures to improve the shape of the
economy.
The transition towards greater economic integration with the rest of the EC
will not come without considerable further trauma. 'So far we have only had
the benefits,' says Mr Cabral. 'Now we must pay the bills.'

Back from the honeymoon - Inflation is a pressing problem for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE WHO uses a taxi in Lisbon instantly confronts one of the most
pressing problems of the Portuguese economy. Prices are rising so quickly
that the meters cannot keep track, and all the taxis have to carry a chart
to show the latest 9 per cent fare increase.
The continued high rate of inflation, combined with a recent slow-down in
the growth of the economy, remain among the chief challenges facing the
country. If Portugal's economic honeymoon since joining the European
Community in 1986 is not yet over, then it has certainly run into its first
significant lovers' tiff.
The economic record during the first few years after accession to the EC
looked extremely impressive. Fuelled by investment and export growth,
national output grew during 1986-90 at an average of 4.6 per cent a year,
compared with 3.1 per cent across the EC.
As new jobs were created, unemployment halved over the period, to 4.2 per
cent, or just a fraction of the figure in many of its neighbouring states.
Meanwhile, the budget deficit also fell sharply.
But now conditions have changed. Growth has slowed to an estimated 2.7 per
cent for 1991, and the residual problems of a continued high deficit and
inflation - estimated at 11.4 per cent last year  - have dampened the
original optimism. Many economists believe further progress to improve the
state of the economy will prove increasingly difficult.
Miguel Namorado Rosa, a senior economist with Banco Comercial Portugues,
says he believes prospects for the corporate sector are now much gloomier
than they appeared last autumn.
The economy, which is extremely open, has moved from one in counter-cycle to
the rest of Europe to one closely linked to it. As a result, recession
elsewhere on the continent has inevitably contributed to the current
slow-down.
'We saw some signs of deceleration which were acceptable after the rapid
pace of growth over six consecutive years,' he says. 'But what we did not
realise then was the extent of the cooling of the economy: 1991 was clearly
a climax of political and economic goals.'
His most recent projections suggest that growth will continue to slow to 2.2
per cent in 1992, and increase only marginally to 2.3 per cent next year.
That compares with more optimistic estimates in the government's current
plans of 3 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1993.
The continued appreciation of the escudo, fuelled in part by high interest
rates, has had a detrimental effect on the economy by reducing the
competitiveness of Portuguese exports, argues Mr Namorado Rosa.
The strong growth of tourism has compensated in part for the decline in the
export of products. He questions how much longer this trend can last as the
recession lifts across Europe, the civil war ends in Yugoslavia and other
parts of eastern Europe begin to develop as holiday destinations.
Traditional exports such as textiles, footwear and clothing do not generally
use imported raw materials - whose cost to producers has fallen as the
exchange rate has risen.
However, the price of Portuguese goods abroad has increased because of the
strong escudo. Combined with recession in many key markets, demand has
slumped. At the same time, these key sectors are labour-intensive, and so
they have been severely affected by high wage demands spurred by continued
inflation.
The high cost of capital has also had a depressing effect on investment.
Very tight monetary policies have been introduced to control inflation. But
that has sustained interest rates above 20 per cent and discouraged
businesses from taking out loans. However, high interest rates have
attracted capital inflows which are undermining the central bank's monetary
policies by keeping liquidity levels high.
Inflation remains a key concern, but one that he believes may be difficult
to reduce much further. He estimates that it will fall to 9.5 per cent in
1992 and 8 per cent next year. 'As we approach 8 to 9 per cent inflation,
further progress may prove very difficult,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. 'Perhaps
this is a structural level of minimum inflation the economy is beginning to
accept.'
His pessimism is shared by Professor Alfredo de Sousa, a respected
independent commentator on economic affairs. Prof de Sousa says he is
disappointed with the government's 1992 budget, which was debated in
parliament last month.
While the budget deficit is likely to fall from 6.3 per cent in 1991 to a
planned 5.2 per cent this year, the reduction is being fuelled by greater
tax revenues, reflecting changes in VAT rates and greater efficiency in
collection. Together these should help to increase direct tax revenues by
22.1 per cent and indirect taxes by 27.5 per cent.
Nevertheless, government expenditure is also rising sharply for a wide range
of functions, including a public works programme. New money will be required
for a substantial public-sector wage settlement. A proposal for a 10 per
cent rise is likely to be translated in a real increase of nearer 14 per
cent, with considerable inflationary implications.
Prof de Sousa argues that the Banco de Portugal, the central bank, has tried
to compensate for government policy, keeping up interest rates because the
state has failed to control spending sufficiently. 'Lighter monetary policy
to help investment, and a tougher budget would be better,' he says.
'The rigour in the budget is not so much for the state as for the taxpayers:
they will have to pay for it. Austerity is being transfered from the
government to the taxpayer and the bank.'
'It would be politically unpopular to restrain salaries. The government
doesn't want to lose votes in forthcoming local elections or risk social
unrest, particularly while it holds the EC presidency,' he says.
The challenge falls particularly on Jorge Braga de Mercado, the
recently-appointed finance minister, who is already raising eyebrows with
his outspoken manner.
Professor de Sousa believes that the economy could continue to grow at 3 to
4 per cent over the next two years, but only if it is accompanied by what he
calls 'a rational budget policy'. He says the budget is rational in
political, not economic, terms. 'The current policy is unsustainable,' he
says.

Legislative barriers eased - Reforms in the financial system examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL system will take one of its final strides towards
liberalisation next January 1, when European Community banks become free to
operate in Portugal without special authorisation.
In preparation for the opening up of the sector, central-bank authorities
have been steadily exposing banks to stronger competition and a freer
operating environment.
The first big move in this direction was made in late 1990, when the Bank of
Portugal adopted new statutes that substantially increased its autonomy. In
particular, the relationship between the Bank and the treasury was
clarified. The central bank was prohibited from lending directly to the
government, ending the common practice of monetarising the budget deficit.
In January 1991, credit ceilings were abolished. These effectively created
huge pools of liquidity, for which the only outlet was to lend to the
government at below-market rates.
'These two measures were particularly important, because they cut off the
direct pipeline that linked the banking system to public debt,' says Antonio
Mexia, a director with financial services and investment company Espirito
Santo Sociedade de Investimentos (ESSI).
A provision for the central bank to make loans to the government, up to a
maximum of 10 per cent of budget expenditure, remains, in the shape of an
interest-free current account. But the government has drafted legislation to
abolish the account this year, separating government and central-bank
finances.
As a result of recent reforms, the central bank has grown more independent,
sharing responsibility for monetary and exchange-rate policy with the
government, rather than simply implementing government decisions as
previously. The Bank no longer needs government authorisation for
interventions in money or foreign-exchange markets.
This new-found independence clearly emerges from the public statement of
Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Bank of Portugal, and other
officials, which today can be seriously at odds with government thinking.
'Our greater outspokenness is a natural consequence of our increased
responsibility for monetary policy,' says Mr Antonio Borges, deputy governor
of the Bank. 'We are very much aware that whatever we say now carries a much
greater weight in terms of inflation expectations. We have to maintain a
strong credibility, and that requires our being as objective as possible in
our assessment of the economic situation, independently of the political
debate.'
A further substantial reform towards the modernisation of the Portuguese
financial system and its harmonisation with EC regulations is due to be
enacted this year, following the publication of a policy document based on
studies of the working of the system. The legislation clarifies the role of
the Bank of Portugal, limiting its intervention to the area of prudential
supervision but giving it more power to act.
'Previously, we were in the difficult position of monitoring situations, and
in some cases seeing banks come close to bankruptcy, without our being able
to intervene,' says Mr Borges. 'Under the new legislation we will have the
power to act immediately, if necessary going to the extremes of replacing a
bank's management or liquidating the company.'
Implementation of the policy document this year will also change the way
banks are run. Beyond the central bank's power of prudential supervision,
banks will be free to operate in a more liberalised environment. The new
legislation establishes the principle of universal banking, formally
abolishing the traditional divide between commercial and investment banking.
Some analysts believe the advent of universal banking could tempt some
managements to try to be everything at the same time. 'The danger is some
banks may think they can do anything, anywhere without any segmentation,'
says Joao Rendeiro, managing director of fund managers Gestifundo. 'The
critical elements will be an understanding of the various levels of the
market and the need to produce a flexible response to different types of
customer. The need for segmentation will be more important.'
The new legislation will greatly reduce restrictions on the activities banks
can undertake. But a separation will be maintained between banking and other
financial activities such as factoring and leasing. Banks will not be able
to run such operations directly, but they will be permitted to create
subsidiaries, of which they can own 100 per cent, to do so.
'Essentially, these operations can be carried out by the same entity and the
same management, as long as there is a total separation of accounting so
that we can conduct our prudential supervision in a more transparent way,'
says Mr Borges.
The central bank will also introduce a deposit insurance scheme in line with
EC recommendations, requiring much less intervention from the Bank of
Portugal to guarantee deposits, should a bank run into trouble.
But the influx of foreign banks is not expected to be overwhelming. In any
case, they are expected to focus on wholesale and business banking.

Braced for a period of turbulence - In 1991, after five years of spectacular
growth, the economy slowed down markedly. This was seen as an uncomfortable
reminder that the country remains vulnerable to changes in the international
environment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been an eventful year for Portugal. The big event was last October's
general election, which gave the ruling Social Democrats, led by prime
minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, their second consecutive absolute majority,
and ensured that the country would have another four years of political
stability.
But now that the sounds of cheering have faded and promises of the political
campaign have been forgotten, Portugal is having to confront gloomier
prospects as the pressures of European Community integration mount.
After five years of spectacular growth, the economy slowed down markedly in
1991 - an uncomfortable reminder that Portugal remains highly vulnerable to
changes in the international environment.
Investment slackened, growing 3.3 per cent in real terms - less than half
the previous year's rate - and exports stagnated with a further
deterioration in the visible trade balance.
At the same time, the crisis experienced by traditional sectors in the
economy, especially textiles and agriculture, has deepened. A painful
restructuring is inevitable in both sectors, and more growth and investment
will be needed to provide new jobs.
While an annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent - down from an average rate of
4.5 per cent in the previous five years - was by no means negligible and
still above the EC average, it was not enough to push real economic
convergence with the Community's richer nations significantly forward.
Similarly, inflation declined from 13.4 per cent in 1990 to 11.4 per cent
last year, but that still left Portugal with an inflation rate more than
twice the EC average.
All of which points to the difficulties ahead for Portugal, in this second
more exacting phase of its European integration.
As the new reality sinks in, public expectations are adjusting abruptly. In
the public sector, discontent has erupted into strikes and demonstrations
against government attempts to keep wage rises at levels compatible with its
8 per cent inflation target for this year. After some hesitation, the
government agreed to a basic 10 per cent pay deal for public administration
employees. This will mean an overall increase in the public sector wage bill
of around 14 per cent.
Employers in the private sector will find it difficult to offer anything
less, and this will increase pressure on wages.
Increases in value added tax and a 36 per cent rise in government current
expenditure, announced in this year's budget, will also have an effect on
inflation. Economists calculate that the VAT increases alone will add
between 1 and 1.5 percentage points to inflation this year, and, most
analysts believe inflation is more likely to be 9 to 9.5 per cent.
This presents the government with its biggest challenge: how to bring
inflation down and maintain a high growth rate, at a time when its main
trading partners are in recession.
It will not be easy. 'If developments in the outside world continue to be
negative, it will be impossible to maintain growth,' says Jose Alberto
Tavares Moreira, governor of the central bank.
Yet success or failure on both fronts will determine whether Portugal
achieves its ambition to be among the first countries to participate fully
in, and to enjoy, the benefits of European economic and monetary union (EMU)
in the second half of the 1990s.
Well before that, the escudo will have to be brought into the exchange rate
mechanism of the European monetary system, though this will prove difficult
as long as inflation remains high. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, in its latest report on Portugal, suggests
that such a move could help to bring down inflation and curb the country's
economic imbalances; but the timing and manner of entry will be a
nerve-racking and politically sensitive choice for the government.
An early entry into the ERM would lock in the escudo at a level close to or
above its present high value - which would not be welcomed by exporters, who
complain that they are suffering already from high interest rates. To delay
for too long would undermine the government's convergence strategy; while a
devaluation, either before or simultaneous with ERM entry, would have
inflationary consequences, run counter to official commitment to
exchange-rate stability, and be politically embarrassing.
Convergence also requires greater budget discipline, and the government aims
to reduce its deficit gradually over the next four years, to bring it into
line with the Community average set for the final phase of economic union.
The 1992 budget aims to cut the deficit from 6.3 per cent of gross domestic
product to 5.2 per cent. This will be achieved mainly through higher
revenues, made easier by tax reform and improvements in tax collection. A
new state-of-the-art computerised and centralised tax-collection system
makes tax avoidance much more difficult, and will increase revenues 'at the
press of a button', according to a senior tax consultant.
Critics would like the government to cut back more energetically on its own
expenditures, rather than rely primarily on monetary measures to control
inflation - which shifts the burden of good housekeeping on to the central
bank and the private sector.
Interest rates have been kept high in order to reduce internal demand, but
with limited results. Private consumption has remained buoyant, while
industrialists say the policy penalises them in the face of foreign
competitors who can raise money more cheaply outside Portugal. Mr Tavares
Moreira says the central bank does not want to tighten monetary policy any
further.
Officials say the government cannot reduce expenditures when it has to meet
co-financing commitments for EC-backed development projects, and when it
must make a huge effort to improve education and welfare.
EC funds have played a crucial role in helping to modernise Portugal's
economy and infrastructures. Between 1986 and 1990, Portugal received about
Es550bn (Dollars 3.9bn) in EC funds, representing 6 per cent of total
investment.
The amount of EC aid available to Portugal is likely to rise substantially
when the Community's next financial package of funds and budget are agreed
later this year, including additional resources from the new 'cohesion fund'
for poorer EC members. Portugal has won agreement in principle for a
reduction in the proportion of government co-financing for EC projects, but
it will still face heavy demands on its own resources.
Interest rates have began to fall, though, at about 19 per cent for prime
customers and above 26 per cent for general credit, they remain high by
international standards. 'Everything is cheap in Portugal except money,'
complained the recent headline of a popular daily newspaper.
Some banks have started for the first time to publish prime lending rates
for their best clients, thereby helping to make the market more transparent,
but rates are likely to remain on the high side for the foreseeable future.
The main beneficiaries have been the banks, though they are likely to feel
the pinch as nominal rates decline - leading to a contraction in financial
margins - and as operating costs rise. High interest rates alone do not
cause high margins, but for many years the banks ran what amounted to an
unofficial cartel to protect respective market shares (with the government's
connivance as the bulk of the banking system was nationalised).
Such cosy arrangements are coming to an end. With the liberalisation of the
banking system, the arrival of private banks and, more recently, the
privatisation of many state-owned banks, competition has risen
significantly. The establishment of a European single market in financial
services beginning next January, is an additional incentive.
'We have entered a period of turbulence,' says the president of a leading
private bank. The description could well be applied more generally, as
Portugal faces its first real test since it joined the EC in 1986.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Appointments: London Stock Exchange: Insurer's payment
pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Third best performance among the Footsie stocks came from General Accident,
the composite insurance group, after the board maintained the final dividend
in the face of a steep increase in losses over the year.
Insurance specialists said fears that General Accident's dividend might have
been threatened were strengthened after Royal Insurance passed its payment.
Although the loss for the year was in the middle of the market range of
forecasts, it included a significant transfer to reserves.
Stock market analysts were favourably impressed at the post-results meeting
with the company, Mr Youssef Ziai at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew describing the
shares as 'good value on such a small premium to asset value.'
The shares raced up 18 to 455p on heavy turnover of 4.7m, with income funds
keen buyers. There was hefty switching out of General Accident and into
Willis Corroon, the insurance broker. Willis jumped 12 to 257p on good
turnover of 2.2m. General Accident's confidence in maintaining the dividend
gave a boost to Sun Alliance - due to report on April 1 - which put on 7 to
270p.
Abbey switch
An initially favourable reception for Abbey National's preliminary figures
gave way to straightforward selling of the stock as well as switching into
other banking issues.
The immediate reaction was to hoist the shares to 307p. Thereafter they came
under persistent pressure, closing a net 11 lower at 292p as analysts
reassessed the outlook following the post-results meeting with the company.
Turnover reached a hefty 9.2m shares.
Mr Chris Wheeler at Shearson Lehman described the figures as 'fine,' but
said the market was now focusing on the recovery plays in the sector rather
than on defensive merits. He said the downside in the shares was limited but
then 'so is the upside.'
Mr John Wrigglesworth at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew turned seller for the first
time since Abbey was privatised. 'We recommend a switch into Lloyds which we
expect to double profits in two years,' he said. Lloyds rose 6 to 426p,
while Barclays moved up 9 to 371p.
Fisons upset
Healthcare group Fisons dropped back after announcing results largely in
line with City expectations, but containing a number of unwelcome elements.
Most concerns concentrated on company comments at the post-results analysts
meeting over Inferon, the group's anaemia drug, which has yet to be cleared
by the US authorities. Chairman Mr Patrick Egan hinted that if the drug
failed to meet US standards, it could be withdrawn. Together with the
Opticrom hay fever treatment, also sidelined in the US, analysts complained
that it was difficult to make recommendations on the stock.
Other anxieties included continuing debate over the vacant chief executive's
post, and some analysts raising questions over Fisons strategy. Profit
forecasts for 1992 were largely unchanged in the Pounds 220m-230m range. The
shares, down 21 at one stage, rallied to close at 384p, for a net loss of 9
on the day. Volume was a hectic 6.4m.
Ladbroke easier
Uncertainty ahead of trading figures tommorrow from Ladbroke Group saw the
shares slip 6 1/2 to 225 1/2 p in busy turnover of 3.9m. Barclays de Zoete
Wedd downgraded the leisure group, mainly on continuing worries over
Ladbroke's exposure to depressed property markets, both in the UK and the
US.
Analyst Mr Peter Hilliar said: 'Ladbroke's property portfolio is
concentrated in the central London and north-east US seaboard office
markets, which have been particularly hard hit in the downturn.' BZW has
lopped Pounds 92m off the property division's asset value and is
consequently forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 192.5m against Pounds
210m previously. These will still be satisfactory, says BZW, but the house
is moving to a short-term sell.
Smith New Court, which also reviewed the stock yesterday, remains more
bullish, with Mr Peter Joseph, part of the leisure team, optimistic on hotel
disposals bolstering the balance sheet. Smith's forecast remains at Pounds
210m.
Recurring talk of a price war in the DIY market - Ladbroke owns the Texas
Homecare chain - also added to the negative sentiment.
The regional electricity companies were strongly supported and made good
progress after BZW highlighted the attractions of the sector which it said
now largely discounts the possibility of a Labour victory in the forthcoming
general election. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was also said to have been a keen
supporter of the sector.
BZW also favoured the Scottish electricity companies, as did Smith New
Court, where the electricity analyst described the two issues as the premier
stocks in the sector.
Mr Alistair Buchanan at Smith said the two stocks offer fundamental value
and told clients to buy the shares up to 120p.
The Electricity Package jumped 55 to Pounds 2925, while Scottish Hydro edged
ahead to 105 1/2 p. Scottish Power held steady at 103p.
Speculation about a possible rights issue hit Cadbury Schweppes ahead of
today's results. The market is looking for 1991 profits of about Pounds 310m
compared with Pounds 279.6m the previous year. Fears of a cash call pushed
the shares down 9 to 463p, but Mr Carl Short, at Nomura Research, said the
company has spent some time restructuring its debt and there appears to be
no need for a rights issue unless a large acquisition is contemplated. He
added that the shares have been strong recently and this may have tempted
investors to take profits.
Although there were few surprises at Granada Group AGM yesterday, the shares
rose as the market took heart from the positive tone from the management
over prospects for BSkyB. Policies on cost-cutting, quality and strategy
were also reaffirmed, the shares adding 9 to 250p in good volume of 4.4m.
Switching operations saw Wembley partly-paid the third biggest turnover
stock of the day with 9.4m shares recorded. The shares were firm at 3p, the
fully-paid edging a half-penny to 33p.
Pharmaceutical group Glaxo Holdings gained 13 to 798p as US buyers moved
into the market. Wellcome continued to tumble as buyers stayed away on the
implications of Monday's share sale announcement by the Wellcome Trust. The
shares lost 41 to 1,025p.
Fears of a price war among the large do-it-yourself chains continued to cast
a cloud over the store sector. Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, fell 4 to 541p and
the 'A' shares in WH Smith, with its interest in Do-It-All, lost 3 to 463p.
Meanwhile WH Smith increased its presence in the US through the purchase of
59 recorded music stores for an undisclosed sum.
The expected flotation of Hillsdown Holdings' housebuilding subsidiary,
Fairview New Homes, encouraged a further recovery of 8 to 162p, on turnover
of 3.9m shares. Food groups, spotlighted on Monday, as potential bid targets
gave up some of their gains. Spanish supermarket operator, Ashley Group,
declined 3 to 47p, while food manufacturer Dalepak fell 15 to 418p. The
large UK food retailers gained ground as safe havens ahead of the general
election. Argyll put on 2 1/2 to 336 1/2 p and J. Sainsbury improved 7 to
394p.
News of a Pounds 500m missile order for British Aerospace helped the shares
initially but they drifted back to end only 2 up at 327p after analysts said
the order had been expected.
Shares in Serco Group jumped 9 to 624p after the company reported a 21 per
cent rise in full year profits to Pounds 5.2m, and increased the dividend
from 10.6p to 11.9p.
Siebe retreated initially on accountancy practice worries but calls to
analysts to reassure the market saw the shares bounce to end only 2 down at
577p.

FT  04 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in stock index futures was volatile with few features on which to
focus in thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
The day's business in March started at 2,569, but the contract immediately
ran into sellers. A leading securities house which sold 150 contracts sent
March trading down to 2,563 by 9am as traders digested the overnight falls
in Tokyo.
March gently crawled back to reach the day's high point of 2,583 by
mid-session. A further bout of selling was curtailed by Wall Street's firm
opening, though weakness before the close was noted.
March finished at 2,574, at a premium of only 9 to the underlying cash
market and some 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of
about 6. Turnover of just over 4,000 contracts was again judged poor.
In traded options, weak turnover of 24,774, saw Asda accounting for a large
part of the day's volume. Turnover reached 7,223 lots, the October 40 puts
the busiest series, after James Capel carried out a large trade in which it
crossed 5,000 contracts at 6p. This was followed by Abbey National, which
released results yesterday, trading 1,570 contracts, the March 280 calls
busy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As part of the fall-out created by the departure of Malcolm Edwards, who
last week resigned as British Coal's commercial director, a long-standing
colleague, Michael Butler, steps into his shoes as the new chairman of
British Fuels (BFL).
British Coal owns 50 per cent of BFL, the UK's leading coal and oil
distributor, and appoints two of the six directors. Butler, who is finance
director of British Coal, had, with Edwards, been instrumental in the buyout
of BFL in 1988 and had been on the board since. Martin Garrett, British Coal
treasurer, joins the BFL board as the second British Coal appointee.
David Port, chief executive of BFL, which preserves an arm's length
relationship with its largest shareholder, says that Malcolm Edwards had
made 'a tremendous contribution in terms of his personal enthusiasm and
drive, and the atmosphere he helped to create'. His replacement, a chartered
accountant by training, is 'the archetypal finance director, who will bring
control and a more structured management style', according to Port.
An outspoken and highly experienced defender of the industry, Edwards, 57,
had clashed repeatedly with British Coal chairman Neil Clarke. Both Edwards
and Butler are veterans of British Coal, with 65 years' service between
them.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Appointments: Manning moves up to Mothercare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Patricia Manning, an American marketing expert who recently helped
resuscitate the Ladybird brand for Woolworths, has been hired by Mothercare
as its new marketing director. This makes Manning the only woman currently
on the board of the mother and babycare chain. Richard Glandville,
Mothercare's commercial director, had previously covered marketing in
addition to other responsibilities.
Mothercare, part of the Storehouse group, had lost its way, she contends.
'Two years ago I could not have put together an effective marketing
campaign, but a lot has been done since then, in terms of logistics and so
on. I am now in the envious position of being able to release that.'
Manning, who is 46, spent 13 years with Levi Strauss before setting up her
own design and sourcing agency in the mid-1980s, a venture she subsequently
wound up. 'I realised I was too much a corporate person,' she admits.
At that point, in 1989, she joined Woolworths as business director for
childrenswear. 'In Ladybird they had a wonderful brand with high recognition
that had been dormant for years.' One of her successes was to double the
market share of the 0-2 years range from 5 to 10 per cent in two years.
Overall, she moved Ladybird from fifth to third in terms of childrenswear
market share, behind M &amp; S and Mothercare.
In the past year she has had various consultancies, including with
Mothercare, out of which the new job arose. 'The trick is to project
Mothercare as more fun on the fashion side while retaining the responsible,
caring image.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity sector recovers its confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOW of trading results from leading British companies continued to
provide the highlights in the UK stock market yesterday. The mood in the
equity market became more confident, although by no means enthusiastic,
ahead of next week's budget speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of
the exchequer.
The unexpected fund-raising moves on Monday brought some excitement and
traders scrutinised the market for other likely candidates for rights issue
plans. But although trading volume was boosted by activity in a handful of
heavyweight stocks, there was little improvement in business across the
broad range of equities.
The revived focus on corporate activity was fuelled by market hints of an
impending bid for a blue chip stock.
On the results front, the market accepted an increased loss from General
Accident without much surprise, and was encouraged when Abbey National, the
mortgage and banking group, referred to signs that the worst of the
recession seemed to have passed.
London was also helped in late dealings by improvement in the US leading
economic indicators, and by suggestions from Mr Alan Greenspan, chief of the
Federal Reserve, of some signs of economic recovery in the US. However, with
the Dow Industrial Average up by only 9 points in UK hours, London closed
below the day's best.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,565.4 for a net gain of 11.1
points. In early trading, the Index dipped to 2,550, the lower end of the
current trading range, but bounced when the stock index futures market
opened firmly.
At mid-session, the Footsie was 15.4 points ahead with several of the
leading components driven higher by shortage of stock. Wellcome, however,
continued to fall sharply as the market braced itself for further details of
the Wellcome Foundation's plan to reduce its stake from 73.6 per cent to
between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. Turnover was modest, however.
Abbey National's results stimulated activity among banking stocks. One
investment fund upset the market with a clumsy attempt to put funds into the
sector, and was obliged to abandon its foray.
Overnight business from the US overflowed into London, driving Reuters ahead
again and also helping ICI, BP and Shell. But Cadbury Schweppes, often a
US-driven stock, gave ground on fears of a rights issue.
Seaq volume increased to 523.2m shares from the 438.6m of the previous
session, but dealers expressed surprise; 'I don't know where yesterday's
business came from,' said one. Retail, or customer, business on Monday was
worth Pounds 881.6m, a somewhat neutral figure in terms of market
profitability. Equity market volumes remain uncomfortably low from the point
of view of the London-based securities houses.
Caution ahead of the UK budget, and the general election expected soon
after, was underlined by market strategists. Kleinwort Benson Securities
sees the Footsie remaining in its 2,500-2,600 range during March, although
it believes this may be the last opportunity to buy below 2,600. Nomura
Research Institute expects a switch out of the US and into the UK and Japan,
but adds that 'no action is yet required.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Appointments: Mars executive for Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mars, which seems to churn out marketing experts as quickly as its
ubiquitous chocolate bars, has produced another high-profile executive to
fill the post of marketing director at Asda, the Pudsey-based grocery chain.
He is Allan Leighton, 38, formerly marketing and sales director of Pedigree
Petfoods, the Mars' subsidiary. His previous jobs include marketing
controller of Mars Confectionery and general manager of its operations in
Portugal.
Asda has also appointed Gordon McBeath, the former director of management
development at BAT, as personnel director. He will succeed Jonathan Fox who
left last month.
The two additions to the Asda management board reflect the attempts of
Archie Norman, chief executive, to forge a new team to resuscitate the
struggling food retailer. He has already appointed a finance director - Phil
Cox, the former chief executive of Burns Anderson.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German turnover more than
doubles as foreigners buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOOTED on Monday, foreign buying came in to lift German shares, while
corporate news moved equities in Paris and Zurich, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reported foreign buying as German stock market turnover, cut back
by carnival on Monday, more than doubled from DM3.5bn to DM7.6bn. The big
four international blue chips, Siemens, Daimler, Deutsche Bank and
Volkswagen, accounted for more than DM4bn of the turnover total as the FAZ
index rose 6.15 to 715.44 at midsession, and the DAX closed 15.44 better to
1,763.31, its highest close since August, 1990.
Hopes that the US economy is recovering lifted Daimler and Siemens in
particular, with gains of DM11.60 to DM768.50, and DM11 to DM699.50
respectively.
Elsewhere there was relative weakness in engineers and some steels, and in
most retailers although Kaufhof went against the trend with a DM10 rise to
DM527.50. Last week Kaufhof indicated a 33 per cent rise in profits for
1991, and another good year in 1992.
PARIS was dominated by Alcatel Alsthom on the news that it was buying in
ITT's 30 per cent stake in its Alcatel NV telecommunications subsidiary. The
CAC-40 rose 4.10 to 1,983.77, off a day's high of 1,990.29. Volume improved
to FFr2.3bn, of which Alcatel accounted for 15 per cent.
Alcatel closed FFr12 higher at FFr620 with 563,930 shares traded. Analysts
said that Alcatel had struck a good deal by offering cash and shares to ITT
and that the operation was not seen as dilutive: indeed, it was likely to
enhance earnings per share by about 5 per cent this year. The downside of
the deal is that Alcatel's gearing is likely to rise to between 35 per cent
and 40 per cent from around 20 per cent.
MILAN closed broadly lower as volume dwindled ahead of the general election
next month. The banking sector was depressed by reports that Moody's, the US
credit rating agency, was concerned that the rapid growth of bank loans in
Italy would lead to a deterioration in debt quality. The Comit index fell
2.98 to 529.42 in turnover estimated at not more than Monday's L75bn.
Among banks, BCI fell 2.1 per cent or L84 to L3,841 while Credito Italiano
eased L61 or 2.9 per cent to L2,040.
The insurance sector remained weak in the wake of President Francesco
Cossiga's scuppering of an important reform of car insurance premiums at the
weekend. A flight to quality supported Generali, which added L20 to L30,710.
ZURICH moved on company news, Alusuisse bearers topping the active list and
falling SFr26 to SFr908 on a 62 per cent drop in profits and a share split
and Sulzer, the engineer, seeing its registered up SFr70 to SFr5,560 on
cooperation with a Japanese company, a plan to abolish restrictions on
foreign shareholdings immediately, and a share split here, too.
The all-share SPI index rose 3.8 to 1,151.9. Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) bearers
rose SFr2 to SFr312 ahead of today's annual news conference; meanwhile,
trading in in Banca Della Svizzera Italiana, in which SBC holds a majority,
was suspended pending an announcement, also today.
BRUSSELS maintained its strong run with the Bel-20 index closing up 5.51 at
1,234.72, its second successive record high. Turnover was BFr1.2bn against
BFr1.49bn. Delhaize was active and hit a record high of BFr9,330, before
closing up BFr90 at BFr9,270.
Groupe AG, the insurer, rose BFr30 to BFr2,230, but Generale Bank, its
possible partner in a merger, slipped back BFr10 to BFr6,750.
AMSTERDAM finished mixed, the CBS Tendency Index closing up 0.8 at 127.0 in
turnover of Fl 762.4m.
DSM, the chemicals group, gained strongly, partly on options trading and
closed up Fl 2.50 or 2.3 per cent at Fl 110.0 ahead of 1991 results next
Monday. Philips gained Fl 1.10 or 3 per cent to Fl 37.6 on good
institutional demand.
Buhrmann Tetterode recovered some of Monday's losses and finished up 20
cents at Fl 43.30.
Heineken continued to rise and closed up 60 cents at Fl 169.40. Its 1991
results are due tomorrow and net profits are forecast around Fl 389m.
MADRID slipped back slightly in dull trading. The general index closed down
0.81 at 265.55 in turnover of Pta14.6bn. The banking sector weakened after
early gains. Iberdrola put on Pta2 at Pta783 in trade of 2.5m shares.
Telefonica's initial rise of Pta15 was wiped out when Wall Street opened and
it closed unchanged at Pta1,175.
OSLO rose nearly 2 per cent: the all-share index closed up 8.28 at 427.19 in
turnover of NKr332.28m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr4.5 to NKr146, while Saga
Petroleum free shares added NKr1 to NKr91.
STOCKHOLM rose in good volume, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 10.4
higher at 961.3 in turnover of SKr525m. HELSINKI tumbled again on
profit-taking, the Hex index falling 13.4 to 888.5.
ISTANBUL's slide continued and the 75-share index fell 47.01 to 3,485.39, a
drop of 4.9 per cent on the week so far and its lowest close since November
1990.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2% as rate
cut hopes fade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tokyo
THE NIKKEI average fell 2 per cent yesterday as expectations of an interest
rate cut diminished in the face of a weaker yen and higher bond yields,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 436.11 at the day's low of 21,051.71. The
index gained briefly in the morning on continued strength in bio-technology
stocks, hitting the day's high of 21,529.61. However, profit-taking by
dealers and arbitrage unwinding pushed it lower again.
Volume rose to 240m shares from 200m as investors sold the auto, electronics
and drug sectors. Declines outnumbered advances by 742 to 207 with 179
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 18.64 to
1,542.43 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.19 to 1173.93.
The fall in drug stocks, which have been actively traded during the past
week, depressed sentiment.
Some traders noted a shift in interest to environmental protection stocks.
Japan Storage Battery, which produces batteries for electric cars, rose Y30
to Y1,100 while Ebara, the industrial pump-maker known for its sewage
technology, added Y10 to Y1,550.
Sumitomo Chemical, the most active issue of the day, rose Y28 to Y474 on
heavy buying by a UK brokerage house. Speculation that the company's
affiliate would team up with a British drug maker prompted some investors to
pursue the stock.
Aids-related issues, which had led the recent rally, fell on profit-taking.
Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y90 to Y3,680 and Nippon Mining retreated Y9 to
Y475.
A total of 73 issues hit new lows since the beginning of last year. Concerns
over slowing corporate earnings depressed Hitachi which declined Y13 to Y822
and Nissan Motor, down Y26 to Y610.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 243 to 22,906.06 in volume of 54.3m shares.
The OSE announced yesterday that it will terminate trading in its 'Stock
Futures 50', a futures contract based on 50 stocks listed on the OSE, from
March 12.
The contract, launched in 1987, was the first futures contract to be listed
on a Japanese stock exchange. Although daily volume rose above 5,000
contracts soon after its launch, investors abandoned the contract after the
listing of the Nikkei 225 futures in 1988. Trading in Stock Futures 50 has
since fallen to just one trade per day.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim ended lower, depressed by the fall in Tokyo, but Indian
share prices soared through a third successive record breaking day, boosted
by Saturday's budget.
BOMBAY's BSE Index leapt another 139.53, or 4.2 per cent, to a new closing
peak of 3,472.78. The index has risen by 22 per cent cent since the budget,
and some 80 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Brokers said that at least 80 private mutual funds are awaiting approval to
launch, hoping to bring about Rs160bn into the stock market, and that
state-owned investment institutions and mutual funds, which used to offload
stocks to stabilise the market, have stopped selling.
HONG KONG ended lower in quiet trading as investors took profits following
the market's recent record-breaking rally. The Hang Seng index lost 41.06 to
4,911.13. Hutchison fell 10 cents to HKDollars 16 on talk that it plans to
make a rights issue.
SEOUL fell following the suspension of trading in Sammi Steel shares after
rumours, later denied, that the company had sought court protection from
creditors. The composite index fell 4.73 to 615.92 in turnover of
Won326.26bn.
TAIWAN was pulled lower in late selling and the weighted index closed down
87.73 at 5,056.64 in turnover of TDollars 33bn.
MANILA fell as investors remained nervous ahead of May's presidential
election. The composite index closed down 14.37 at 1,157.46 in turnover of
388m pesos.
BANGKOK rose on heavy buying of Bangkok Bank in the last hour of trading.
The SET index ended 9.42 up at 788.52 on turnover of Bt5.52bn. Bangkok Bank
rose Bt28 to Bt660.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: European building stocks enjoy return
to favour - But many had a lot of ground to make up after an unhappy close
to 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European construction stocks have enjoyed a return to favour this year, but
many of them had a lot of ground to make up after an unhappy close to 1991.
The FT-Actuaries index for Europe, excluding the UK, ended 10.6 per cent
higher last year. According to County NatWest, the construction and building
materials component showed a rise in local currency terms of just 0.9 per
cent.
The sector dropped 12.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991. Continental
Europe joined the real estate casualty list last year and worldwide
construction activity is forecast to be weak well into 1993, especially
where central business district office buildings are concerned.
Construction is an industry where luck matters, accidents happen and
mistakes are often punished unmercifully. Country by country, and share by
share, it produced some stark contrasts in 1991.
In France, Bouygues outperformed the sector, and Europe as a whole in 1991,
rising 16.5 per cent. This compared with a 22.7 per cent drop at Spie
Batignolles, Schneider's building, civil and industrial engineering
subsidiary which accelerated into a 41.2 per cent slump in the final three
months of the year.
Both companies outperformed Europe in January; but Schneider said earlier
this month that Spie had slumped into net losses of FFr950m for 1991 against
a previous net profit of FFr250m. In February, Spie's share price ended more
or less where it started, while Bouygues rose 3.5 per cent and the Paris
market's CAC 40 index by 5.8 per cent.
James Capel said in mid-February that interest in Spie shares could only be
justified by hopes of:
A rapid improvement in earnings at the operating level, which they discount
as slim; or
Schneider disposing of one or more Spie divisions.
'It is also possible that Schneider might decide to take advantage of the
present weakness in the share price and buy up the minority interest,' said
Capel. 'However, only the brave should be prepared to buy on this
expectation.'
In Spain, Agroman stood out in a sector full of deep downtrends, with a fall
of 45 per cent in the final quarter, recovering to produce a a recovery of
about 33 per cent since then. Mr Miguel Olabarri of Schroder Securities says
that, following the Spanish budget guidelines for 1992 published last
summer, the sector reacted to drastic cuts in infrastructural expenditure.
Agroman is medium-large by Spanish standards, ranking number four in the
country. It sub-contracts very little of its work compared with other
construction groups, says Mr Olabarri, leaving it relatively exposed when a
crunch comes; the corollary is that recovery hopes have the reverse effect.
Austria's Universale-Bau offers a parallel to its Spanish counterpart with a
fall of 49.2 per cent in October/December followed by a subsequent rally of
30 per cent. Here, Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson noted two years ago
that Universale was the company most geared to the then promising Viennese
property market.
Mr Thomson's colleague, Mr Frank Jonuschat, adds that Universale's final
quarter was also hit by enormous problems in an aluminium smelting operation
that forced it to raise provisions on the project from Sch500m to Sch795m
and, under Austrian law, forced it to pass its dividend. Kleinwort fells
that Universale probably does not rate its recent performance against the
Vienna market, itself up by around a fifth this year.
In Germany, however, Hochtief still exemplifies the hopes of a boom
amplified, and extended by German reunification. Mr Roderick Hinkel and Mr
Robert Willis of Hoare Govett said on January 2 that the sector had
unprecedented opportunities to make both substantial and long-term earnings
gains and tipped Hochtief at DM981.
Hochtief shares had fallen by just 10 per cent in 1991 compared with drops
of 28 per cent for Spie, 57 per cent for Universale and 49 per cent for
Agroman. Since then they have risen by 30 per cent.
Germany's construction prospects are seen as broadly-based, and solid,
despite arguments about whether the country itself is, or is not in
recession. Mr Michael Geiger of County Natwest says that east Germany is
likely to see a 17.5 per cent rise in construction output this year, against
a 2 per cent gain for the west.
'This industry is not going over a cliff, not in the next five years,' says
Mr Geiger. 'its order backlog will last for more than a year, and its new
orders intake is fantastic.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar surges past Y130 mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR surged through the Y130 barrier yesterday after more good news on
the US economy, beginning what some dealers see as a possible prolonged
upwards push.
It closed at Y130.80, having touched Y130.99, after a climb to Y129.65/69 in
New York, and Y130.45/55 in Tokyo.
It was less buoyant against the D-mark, but still finished 1 1/2 pfennigs
higher at DM1.6555.
The rise began after Monday's unexpected increase in the National
Association of Purchasing Management index, continued overnight, and was
sustained yesterday by more encouraging figures. January's leading
indicators showed their biggest increase for six months - up by 0.9 per
cent, compared with an expected 0.7 per cent - while new home sales were up
12.9 per cent to their highest level for two years.
Dr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank said: 'People are now starting to
believe that things are on the turn, and it will probably take a lot to
knock the dollar down.
'The market seems prepared to ignore any negative indicators and act
strongly on positive ones.'
Dollar optimism was dented slightly, however, by a statement by Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that signs of recovery were 'quite
tentative' and that he did not rule out adjusting money growth if they began
to falter. The market is also waiting for Friday's payroll figures with some
anxiety, although it is increasingly felt that these may also be
encouraging.
The dollar is now expected to challenge the DM1.6640 level, where it has
previously met resistance, and head towards Y132.
It may meet resistance at that level, but the Bank of Japan appeared not to
have intervened at Y130 yesterday, possibly because it expected heavy
sell-orders at Y130, which failed to materialise. Some dealers also believe
the BoJ was badly stung the last time it intervened to try to keep the
dollar below Y128 and was able only temporarily to halt the advance.
The strength of the US currency was reported to have prompted the Bank of
Canada to intervene to support the Canadian dollar, which slipped to
CDollars 1.1912. It also knocked the D-mark. which fell back slightly in the
EMS to only 30 per cent above its central level, against 34 per cent on
Monday.
It dropped to a six-month low of FFr3.3976 against the French franc,
although this was seen to be as a result of D-mark weakness rather than any
inherent strength in the franc.
Sterling held steady against the D-mark at DM2.8800. It was encouraged
slightly by a larger-than-expected rise in the February official reserves of
Dollars 181m, showing there had been little need to intervene in sterling's
support over the month. But it fell against the dollar, ending at Dollars
1.7400, compared with Dollars 1.7555 on Monday.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Six-month blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING was extremely slow on the UK money market, with little movement
except in short rates.
While today marks six months of the 10 1/2 per cent base rate, dealers will
find little to celebrate. When the rate fell last September, the markets
expected another cut to follow soon.
It failed to materialise, and some dealers are even discounting any cut
before the general election.
'The market wants a base rate cut but doesn't know when to expect it,' said
Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. 'Most estimates see it
happening some time within about the next 20 working days.
'If it doesn't come, then it's difficult to know how the markets will
react.'
The subdued market was not helped when the liquidity shortage proved less
amenable to the authorities' efforts to relieve it than it had on Monday.
The Bank of England forecast a moderate shortage of around Pounds 600m,
mainly due to Pounds 646m of treasury bills and maturing assistance, and
Pounds 306m of bills for repurchase.
It did not operate on the early round, but later revised its forecast to
Pounds 650m. Even then, however, it purchased only Pounds 22m of band 1 and
2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
In the afternoon the forecast increased again to Pounds 750m, but the Bank
still took out only some of the shortage, purchasing Pounds 108m of band 1
bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The remaining shortfall was partly covered by
late assistance of Pounds 415m.
Early overnight rates hovered around 10 1/4 per cent, but firmed to 11-10
7/8 per cent after midday and went as far as 12-11 3/4 after the 2pm
shortage forecast, before drifting off to 11-10 1/2 per cent at the close.
Other rates were little changed, with the key three-month interbank stable
at 10 3/8 -10 5/16 per cent, although the March short sterling contract
dropped four basis points to 89.69.
German call money rates firmed slightly to 9.60/70 per cent, from 9.55/65 on
Monday, on fears that Bundesbank reserves were rather low.
As expected, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the US system through
two-day system repurchase agreements. Federal funds had been trading at at 4
3/16 per cent, above the presumed target of 4 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prices fall as India relaxes
bullion imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOMBAY bullion market reacted bearishly yesterday to the Indian
government's proposed relaxation of the 22-year ban on gold imports.
allowed to import 5 kilos of gold as part a bid to end smuggling, the
government announced in its Budget statement over the weekend.
Smuggling has hitherto been the main source of supply to citizens who crave
for the precious metal.
The gold price on the Bombay market - pacesetter for other Indian centres -
fell by 232 rupees or 5 per cent to Rs. 4,418 (Dollars 168.78) per 10 grams
of gold yesterday, the first day of trading since the announcement. Monday
was a holiday.
A 15 per cent import duty on gold, payable in convertible currencies, will
be levied with the twin purpose of narrowing the gap of Rs. 900 per 10 grams
between local and international gold prices and of easing India's present
foreign exchange crisis.
India is estimated to consume some 220 tonnes of gold a year.
Two-thirds of the country's demand is met by imports and most of the rest is
met by scrap or recycled old jewellery. Only about two tonnes of gold a year
is mined in India.
India has strict foreign exchange controls. They have encouraged a
flourishing underground economy and substantial premium for the dollar over
the official exchange rate.
Dubai-based gold smugglers also operate as money changers for Indian
expatriates, who remit money for their families back home and use the
convertible currencies to finance gold imports to India.
The Indian government has introduced a dual exchange rate for the rupee in
an attempt to put unofficial money changers out of business. Sixty per cent
of proceeds from merchandise exports and invisible earnings can be sold at
market rates and the remaining 40 per cent has to be handed over to the
Reserve Bank of India at the official rate.
The US dollar was quoted at Rs. 29.40 on the free market on the first day
yesterday against the black market conversion rate of Rs. 31.50. When parity
is achieved between the two and expatriate Indians bring in gold in
sufficient quantity, smugglers will have no role as money changers for
expatriates in the Gulf and in gold supply.

Zinc hit three-month highs on the LME while nickel closed near eight-month
lows. Three month zinc ended kerb trading above Dollars 1,200 a tonne on
short covering and talk of a pay strike at a Mexican smelter. Three-month
nickel touched an eight-month low of Dollars 7,540 a tonne in the afternoon
on trade selling. Talk that Norilsk in Russia has been granted export
licences for 20,000 tonnes of metal and can ship 8,000 tonnes out of its own
warehouses underlined bearish fundamental sentiment. Lead held near 4 1/2
 month highs struck in the morning as speculative interest was attracted by
the current upward move. The market is underpinned by talk of secondary
metal cuts in the US and impending rationalisation in Europe. Aluminium also
advanced, three-month metal moving smartly back above Dollars 1,300 on US
short covering against a background of physical demand. Silver futures were
ahead at midsession in New York, but gains were limited by Monday's news
that Comex warehouse stocks were 1.7m ounces ahead at a record 280,690,354
ounces. That offset a 0.9 per cent rise in US economic leading indicators
which pointed to an economic recovery and a possible increase in industrial
demand for the metal.

Jamaica and Barbados
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between mill operators and labour unions began yesterday in
Jamaica and Barbados with the aim of ending strikes which have crippled the
sugar industry in the two Caribbean islands.
Seven of Jamaica's nine mills have been closed by a dispute over wages.
Spokesmen for the industry said yesterday that if the stoppage does not end
in the near future it will threaten achievement of this year's production
target of 230,000 tonnes.
Reduced output will also curb the island's ability to meet its quota
commitments to the European Community and the US. While the unions are
asking for wage increases of 200 per cent, mill owners are offering 50 per
cent.
In Barbados the industry, which was shut down for several months because it
ran out of money, has been unable to start this year's harvest because of
another pay dispute.
The unions are asking for an increase of 8 per cent, but Barbados Sugar
Industry, the owner of the island's mills, is suggesting a wage freeze
because of the weak state of its finances.
It owes the state-owned Barbados National Bank about Dollars 87m. No new
credit is being granted as the government has agreed with the International
Monetary Fund to cut the public sector deficit.
Barbados's sugar industry has seen its production fall in recent years. The
1991 harvest yielded 65,774 tonnes, the lowest in 60 years.
The industry has been having difficulty meeting its quota commitments to the
EC and the US and satisfying domestic demand.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S. African gold producers
divided on forward selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES between South African gold producers about the merits of selling
gold forward have resurfaced following the publication in a local journal of
an article suggesting that the practice does not pay.
Mr Hugh Munro, formerly chief consulting engineer in Union Corporation, now
part of the Gencor group, claims in in the Journal of the South African
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy that Western gold producers lost Dollars
2.5bn revenue in 1990 through forward sales of gold.
Mr Munro's conclusions have met with a mixed, if predictable, reception.
They have been welcomed by Gengold, which is a reluctant forward seller and
dismissed by Anglo American, the world's largest producer.
Mr Munro says forward sales consist of gold leased from banks at a very low
rate of interest. It is then sold on the spot market, and the proceeds
invested at the US dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) at a much
higher interest rate.
The difference between these two rates is the gold contango. Over the past
three years has between 3 and 8 per cent.
Mr Munro's claim is that producers overlook the loss attached to enjoying
this contango. His calculations attempt to prove that every extra tonne of
gold sold per annum reduces the price by about 20 cents an ounce.
Based on Gold Fields Minerals Services figures for 1990, Mr Munro calculates
that non-Communist mines would have made a monetary gain of Dollars 2.55bn
in 1990 had they not sold gold forward.
In the article he argues that, if his views are accepted, then forward sales
will diminish and many gold loans will be repaid so that the price of gold
will rise 'fairly rapidly to a level perhaps in excess of Dollars 400 per
ounce,' and possibly as high as Dollars 500.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, said that he supported Mr
Munro's conclusions which 'back up some of the feelings we've had.'
Gengold's approach to forward sales was that they were necessary only in
special cases where a marginal mine was likely to go under if it did not
sell forward, Mr Maude added.
Mr Kelvin Williams, marketing manager for the gold and uranium division at
Anglo American, said his company was sceptical of the reasoning and
conclusions contained in the article. 'The simplistic application of
complicated mathematics to a collection of dynamic factors in the market is
sufficiently removed from reality for it to be fruitless to comment,' he
said.
Two other factors which diminish the worth of the analysis in the view of
Anglo American are the figures on which it is based and the failure to take
account of the impact of paper gold transactions on the market.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc output forecast to fall
1.1% in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE WILL continue to bear the brunt of cuts in production capacity caused
by present low zinc prices, a report from the Metal Bulletin Research
organisation suggests.
This year concentrate production is likely to cease at Outokumpu's Vihanti
smelter in Finland, Metallgesselschaft's Meggen smelter in Germany and the
Rubiales smelter owned by Exminesa in Spain. More closures can be expected
in 1993, the report adds.
In 1993, however, Asturiana de Zinc's San Juan de Nieva smelter will
eventually help to restore world-wide cuts in refined zinc production.
Closures already announced include those by Cominco in Canada and Ruhrzink
in Germany as well as Vieille Montagne's Overpelt plant in the Netherlands
and the temporary shutdown of Nouva Samin's Crontone plant in Spain.
These will 'more than outweigh the modest additions to capacity scheduled to
come on stream this year,' says Metal Bulletin Research.
Analysts Ms Rosalind Stewart and Mr Neil Buxton forecast a 1.1 per cent fall
in refined zinc output this year to 5.24m tonnes and then a 2.4 per cent
increase in 1993 to 5.365m tonnes.
They suggest the zinc market was oversupplied by 185,000 tonnes last year,
the largest surplus since the mid-1970s. In 1992 the surplus is forecast to
fall to 46,000 tonnes which would leave stocks at the end of this year at
700,000 tonnes, or 6.9 weeks of consumption - the highest since 1984. In
1993 stocks should be cut by a supply deficit of 145,000 tonnes.
The report suggests there is little room for zinc prices to fall far - a
move below Dollars 1,000 a tonne would probably prompt more output cuts -
and there should be rallies towards Dollars 1,400.
For 1992 the report expects cash zinc prices to average Dollars 1,200 a
tonne. Next year's average predicted to be Dollars 1,450 a tonne, with
prices ranging between Dollars 1,250 and Dollars 1,650.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Argentine bank to launch bond
of up to Dollars 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S largest private sector commercial bank, Banco Rio de la Plata,
is set to launch a bond of up to Dollars 100m in the international market
tomorrow, writes Stephen Fidler.
The three-year bonds, the first for a private commercial bank since the
market reopened to Argentine borrowers in late 1990, will carry a coupon of
9 1/8 per cent. They are expected to be priced to yield 3.75 percentage
points over US Treasury paper, suggesting an issue price of below 100. An
underwriting group will be led by Merrill Lynch. Argentine private sector
companies have issued Dollars 321m of bonds since late 1990.
The main shareholder of the bank, with assets of Dollars 1.7bn and a capital
to assets ratio of 4:1, is Fundacion Perez Companc, a foundation formed and
owned by the Perez Companc family, whose members also control a further 33.7
per cent of the shares.
Mr Roberto Ruiz, a bank director, said the bonds were being sold against a
backdrop of an improving Argentine economy. Argentina's banking system was
well capitalised and the indebtedness of its domestic corporate and consumer
markets was low.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: PaineWebber salesmen tune in
to Zeitgeist - The securities brokerage's changing strategy for the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU only have to look at PaineWebber's current television commercials to see
how much the atmosphere on Wall Street has changed since the Roaring
Eighties.
The spots show mini-dramas - mother-daughter anxieties, early retirement,
kids off to college, ageing parents heading for the nursing home - with a
punchline that says secure futures were achieved because of timely and
sympathetic interventions by the PaineWebber salesman. The firm's slogan for
the campaign is: 'We invest in relationships.'
This image of wholesome reliability is very much in tune with the times, and
it is one that is breeding success. Today, PaineWebber is the fifth largest
securities brokerage in the US with a network of 4,700 brokers, and last
year it rode buoyant stock and bond markets to earn record after-tax profits
of Dollars 150.7m.
Yet PaineWebber's route to success over the past decade has been somewhat
circuitous, taking in a botched merger and an advance into, then a retreat
from, investment banking. Along the way it got involved in some injudicious
arbitrage and banking deals, including one calamitous bridge loan to
Federated Department Stores in 1988 which forced the company to take an
undisclosed reserve to cover future losses.
PaineWebber has also drawn back from venture capital and trading on its own
account. Yet, while others made megabucks in the debt-driven deal-making of
the 1980s, PaineWebber was searching for more reliable pastures. As a
result, for most of that period, the company looked plain dull.
Today, however, it seems PaineWebber may have cleaned out its weaker
businesses and focused on its strengths just in time to cash in on the new
Zeitgeist. This, at least, is the view of Mr Donald Marron, who has been the
company's chief executive since 1980.
'In the 1980s, people talked about the consumer products they wanted. Now
they talk a lot about saving and investment.' The American population, he
says, is ageing and, pressed by falling real incomes since the late 1980s,
faces a change in the pensions outlook and the burden of the highest health
costs in the world.
The US, says Mr Marron, has become a nation of savers. So why has this not
shown up in the savings ratio figures? 'Because they measure the wrong
things,' he says.
At the same time, Americans have also seen their most straightforward route
to protecting savings against inflation - the easily purchased certificate
of deposit - undermined by tumbling real interest rates. With house prices
also weak, conditions could not have been better for the smiling stockbroker
to suggest a nice line in mutual funds or a new retirement account. This new
demand for equity-based savings products has not just enriched the brokers
and fund managers, it has also contributed hugely to the boom in stock
prices.
PaineWebber is certainly not the only firm to have done well in these
circumstances. Others, from the giant Merrill Lynch to more specialised
firms such as AG Edwards and discount brokerage Charles Schwab, have also
enjoyed sharp earnings growth.
But Mr Marron argues that his own firm has a strategy which will enable it
to continue its relative prosperity, and permit it to grow more rapidly
outside the US as well. The company already has a Japanese link through
insurance group Yasuda Mutual Life, which owns an 11.7 per cent stake in
PaineWebber.
Now Mr Marron is interested in finding an European partner. 'The basic idea
would be to exchange distribution systems. We could distribute their
products and they could distribute ours.' PaineWebber already claims to be
one of the top three London-based distributors of US equities to
institutions.
The underlying game plan is to increase the quality of PaineWebber's
revenues, retaining a strong balance sheet, focusing more carefully upon
what the customer wants, and preferring business lines which offer recurrent
fee income - less glamorous than other parts of the securities business, but
perhaps more reliable.
At the same time, PaineWebber is working hard to control costs. Overall,
1991 was a good year for the firm in this respect, although the biggest
category of expenses, employee compensation, rose by almost 19 per cent,
mainly because buoyant stock prices and the rush of individual investors to
the market fuelled a sharp rise in performance-related pay.
In practice, the strategy's success will be determined by how good the
company is at devising new products and services - what Mr Marron calls the
'manufacturing' side of the business - and selling them to individual
investors and savers and to financial institutions - the 'distribution'
side. It is highly competitive, but Mr Marron says foreign competition has
eased up somewhat, the savings and loans remain in disgrace, and the banks
seriously weakened.
One benchmark of progress is the rate at which the total volume of assets
controlled by PaineWebber has grown. As the chart shows, the curve has been
satisfactory in recent years, reaching Dollars 93.2bn in 1991.
It is this figure which PaineWebber sets alongside its salaries bill,
pointing out that the average investment executive in 1991 was covering
Dollars 20.6m of assets - double the level of five years earlier.
Mr Marron says of the costs outlook, that PaineWebber can extract further
economies of scale from its New Jersey computer complex, but that elsewhere:
'I don't see any big decline from here. Costs are where they are.' He would,
however, like to bolster the size of the company's retail operations.
PaineWebber is also busy training and retraining staff for the mission of
managing Main Street's savings, preparing the company for the economic
recovery. 'When the economy turns, there will be more leverage than we all
think, because there's been a big cultural change,' Mr Marron says. 'All
businesses are more aware of costs and more aware of focusing on higher
profit margin activities.'
Yet despite the bullish stock market, the booming broking business and
improved economic outlook, Mr Marron does not foresee a return to
high-living on Wall Street. 'I think we will look back at the late 1980s and
say that it was a warped period in our industry,' he says.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Treasury market sell-off affects
Eurodollar paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLACEMENT of more than Dollars 1.5bn of fresh paper in the Eurodollar bond
market yesterday was hampered by a sharp sell-off in the US Treasury market
for the second day running.
Further signs that the US economy is starting to recover prompted concern
that interest rates are unlikely to fall further. While the US Treasury
market was the hardest hit, with traders reporting large liquidations of
positions even before the opening of New York trading, the Eurodollar bond
market was also affected by changing sentiment.
Swap spreads collapsed as counterparties willing to pay the fixed-rate side
of the transaction evaporated. With substantial portions of unsold paper
launched at the start of the year still on underwriters books,
retail-targetted deals, which generally take several weeks to filter down
distribution networks, suffered most.
The African Development Bank, which made its debut offering in the dollar
sector yesterday, proved virtually immune to the wave of negative sentiment.
The deal, arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation, met strong investor demand,
due to its triple-A rating and its rarity value, as well as an extensive run
of pre-marketing.
The deal was priced at a yield spread of 38 basis points above the 10-year
Treasury yield, reflecting the marked difference in perception of the
African Development Bank's credit, compared with other triple-A rated
international agencies like the World Bank.
The African Development Bank, which plans to raise around Dollars 1bn this
year in the financial markets, hopes to reduce this pricing differential
over a period of time. The proceeds of the deal were unswapped, as the bank
was keen to lock in low dollar interest rates.
Two US companies, Du Pont and Phillip Morris, which are well regarded by
Swiss investors, launched aggressively priced offerings totalling Dollars
250m each via Credit Suisse First Boston. In a difficult market, these
retail-targetted deals attracted few takers.
Du Pont's 10-year deal was priced to yield 45 basis points above the 10-year
Treasury, while Phillip Morris' five-year paper was launched at a spread of
60 basis points above the curve. Both traded outside fees, and, despite the
declining Treasury market, the yield spreads widened by three and five basis
points respectively.
A Dollars 300m five-year deal for IMI Bank International, the Italian
financial institution, and a Dollars 350m four-year deal for Chubu Electric
Power, the Japanese power company, were both considered fairly priced but
also suffered from the fall-out.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bowater gains cheap finance
from vendors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the UK packaging and printing group which announced plans to
acquire two specialist packaging companies for Pounds 444m on Monday, has
agreed cheap financing from the vendors. The agreements are seen as a sign
that the vendors were desperate to get rid of the companies concerned.
Although the purchase of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging is to be
financed mainly by a Pounds 333.5m rights issue, Bowater has agreed to
borrow a total of about Pounds 200m at between 5 per cent and 6.3 per cent,
which is well below the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
Bowater is paying Pembridge Investments Pounds 212m for DRG Packaging. At
the same time, Societe de Banque Thomson, the French finance house which
controls Pembridge Investments, has agreed to help finance the acquisition
with a four-year Pounds 157m loan carrying an interest rate of 6.3 per cent.
One of the parties involved in the deal - who asked not to be named  - said
the low interest agreed on the loan financing was 'merely a way of covering
up the fact that the vendor is making a loss on the sale of DRG.'
Such financing by a vendor to assist with the sale of a company is not
unusual, but the interest rate in this case is considered very low.
Bowater is also buying Cope Allman for Pounds 232m, of which Pounds 200m
will be used to pay off existing debt. The debts include loans of Pounds
100m to ADT, the security and car auction business which owns 49 per cent of
Quoteplan, Cope Allman's vendor.
As part of the deal, Bowater will receive a Pounds 50m five-year loan at 5
per cent from ADT Finance BV, a company which is associated with the vendor.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P plans to widen credit
risk services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, is planning to widen its coverage
of credit risk. New services would provide customers with ratings on risks
associated with complex derivative instruments and the defaulted debt of
distressed companies.
The agency has set up a six-person working group that will 'look at ways to
complement its current ratings service by providing additional information
describing risks other than pure credit risks in transactions', said Mr Tom
Gillis, a managing director at S&amp;P.
The group hopes to complete its study and have proposals drawn up by the end
of the second quarter of this year.
Mr Gillis said changes were being considered because S&amp;P's ratings need to
reflect the growing complexity of debt instruments.
The working group will also look at improving ratings of bonds in default.
'After a bond defaults, depending upon the issuer, investors will get back
different amounts. We would like to comment on what those various amounts
might be,' Mr Gillis said.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Equity Issues: Wellcome offer likely to follow
BT pattern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international offering of shares in Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals
company, is likely to be modelled on the Pounds 5.5bn BT share sale last
December, bankers said yesterday.
Wellcome Trust, which funds medical research, said this week it planned to
sell a portion of its 73.6 per cent stake in the company, possibly reducing
its holding to 25 per cent. This would entail a share sale in the region of
Pounds 4.5bn.
Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank, has been appointed global co-ordinator
for the sale.
The only precedents for such a large secondary sale of stock are BT and the
Pounds 7.5bn sale of BP shares, which was disrupted by the stock market
collapse in October 1987.
The BT sale broke new ground for a UK offering in several respects:
The global co-ordinator for the deal, SG Warburg, ran a single global book
for the issue, rather than reserving a portion for UK institutional
investors;
The shares were priced following a 'blind auction' in which institutional
investors were encouraged to place indicative bids for stock in the three
weeks before the pricing. This may not be copied by Wellcome, although a
book-building process will take place in the weeks before the final pricing.
Investors received an over-allocation of stock, which was bought back by the
lead bank to stabilise the share price immediately after the sale.
These techniques were used to introduce competition among investors bidding
for the stock. the
However, the discount cannot be eliminated entirely, since investors will
demand an incentive to buy new shares rather than the outstanding stock. In
the BT sale, institutional investors paid 350p for new shares, against 342p
in the secondary market. However, investors paid for the new shares in
installments, reckoned to be worth 20 to 25p per share.
Instead of offering Wellcome shares partly-paid, Wellcome Trust could offer
warrants for the purchase of more shares at a future date. It is committed
to retaining a 25 per cent holding for five years.
Officials of Instituto Bancario San Paulo di Torino, one of the largest
Italian banks, were in London this week making presentations to
institutional investors ahead of its L6,250bn equity offering. UK bankers
reported a positive response to the presentations and expect the deal to be
priced on March 9 towards the lower end of the L12,000 to L14,000 per share
indicated range.
On the same date, shareholders in Banco Commercial Portugese, the largest
Portuguese bank, will meet to approve plans for the second stage of
privatisation.
In addition to a one-for-10 rights issue and a bonus issue to existing
shareholders, the bank is planning an American depositary receipt programme
in the US and the launch of a convertible bond issue in the international
market. If approval is received, the bond issue is expected to raise around
Es30bn, but will probably be denominated in Ecu.

<TEXT>
KEPPEL, the Singapore shipbuilder, yesterday announced a 22 per cent rise in
1991 group net profits to SDollars 144.72m (USDollars 88.2m), up from
SDollars 118.20m a year earlier.
Turnover rose 20 per cent to SDollars 1.68bn from SDollars 1.4bn on the back
of the completion of several large contracts at Ship-repair and Offshore
Specialised Shipbuilding, the group's main subsidiary.
Keppel benefited in the second half from strong revenue from ship repair, at
SDollars 459.6m against SDollars 385.1m.
Keppel Bank, the banking and financial services, saw a strong advance,
boosted by a newly acquired subsidiary. The group's property activities also
had better results.
Group operating profit expanded 19 per cent to SDollars 243.4m from SDollars
204.5m. Net interest income increased to SDollars 18.5m from SDollars 15.4m,
while associates' contributions lifted pre-tax profits to SDollars 270.7m
from SDollars 225.0m.
However, attributable profits fell to SDollars 160.8m from SDollars 181.2m
due to lower extraordinary gains.
With large contracts in hand and demand for most of the group's services
remaining strong, Keppel expects to maintain the 1991 level of operating
results, although the business environment may be somewhat uncertain this
year.
Keppel will continue to seek opportunities locally but will place greater
emphasis on overseas expansion, particularly in the Pacific region.
Its operations include a ship repair centre in Singapore, profitable
shipyards in the Philippines and a joint venture in India.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM plans to compete directly
with 'clones'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines plans to launch a range of lower-priced
computers that will compete directly with the many 'clones' of its original
products. The move is a bid by IBM to recharge its sluggish personal
computer sales.
Outlining the company's strategy to maintain profitability and market share,
even as personal computer prices plummet, Mr James Cannavino, president of
IBM's personal systems division, says he will transform the PS/1 home
computer into a broader range of machines aimed at price-conscious buyers.
IBM will offer two lines of personal computers - its 'premium' PS/2 line,
with leading edge technology and support services for business users, as
well as an 'industry standard' PS/1 range that competes with the lowest
priced clones. The PS/1 range will be sold primarily through large-volume
retail outlets and mail order companies.
'The error we made was to think that the PS/2 was a one-size-fits-all
product line,' says Mr Cannavino. Many buyers, particularly in the US, now
choose personal computers simply by price, he acknowledges.
In this 'commodity' segment of the market, IBM's share of personal computer
sales has fallen sharply.
IBM's new PS/1 line will span the full range of performance - from popular
386-based machines through the more powerful 486 models, and ultimately the
next generation of 586 computers, based on a new Intel microprocessor. They
are expected to be launched later this year.
IBM is 'one of the very lowest cost manufacturers in the (personal computer)
industry,' Mr Cannavino maintained. Dispelling reports that IBM will shift
much of its personal computer manufacturing to south-east Asia, Mr Cannavino
said: 'Labour costs are not much of an issue, because the labour content in
constructing a personal computer is very small.'
Instead, he said, the goal is to continually improve manufacturing
efficiency by shortening the manufacturing cycle - from component purchases
to computer sales.
IBM is also considering joint manufacturing projects similar to its venture
with Toshiba of Japan, which produces liquid crystal display screens for
portable personal computers.
Perhaps IBM's greatest challenge is to maintain its 'premium' product image
while also taking advantage of its lower cost manufacturing capabilities to
compete in the low-price segment of the personal computer market.
Yet IBM is hardly alone in struggling to maintain its position in the
rapidly changing personal computer market.
Compaq Computer, similarly, is overhauling its product strategy while trying
to reduce costs. Many second and third-tier manufacturers are also facing
extreme price pressures.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: New generation eyes seat of
power - John Akers' search for a successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANTED: Executive with broad experience, proven track record and strong
leadership qualities. Must be under 50 years of age and willing to sit on
the sidelines for at least two years before taking on one of the most
demanding jobs in corporate America.
THIS is a pivotal year for top executives at International Business
Machines. Those who fail to live up to the expectations of its chairman, Mr
John Akers, will find their careers slowing abruptly. Those with ambitions
to become chairman will have to produce the financial results to justify
their claims.
The sudden departure of two of the company's highest ranking executives,
both of whom had at one time been regarded as potential candidates for the
top job in the computer manufacturer, has generated intense speculation
about Mr Akers' successor.
Mr Michael Armstrong, a senior vice-president and heir-apparent, announced
recently that he was leaving to become chairman and chief executive of
Hughes Aircraft. A few days later, Mr George Conrades, a former general
manager of IBM USA, said he was leaving.
Mr Conrades is seen as the most obvious victim of Mr Akers' tough new policy
with his senior executives. He was demoted to a staff post last year when
IBM's domestic performance failed to meet expectations.
Under normal circumstances Mr Akers would be expected to give up the
chairmanship in late 1994 when he turns 60. IBM has only occasionally waived
its strict retirement policy - in 1988 the then joint vice-chairman, Mr
Caspar Cassani, was asked to stay a further year. This year, Mr Jack
Kuehler, the company's popular president, agreed to stay on beyond his
planned retirement in September.
These are far from normal times for IBM, however. The company has just
weathered the worst year in its history, with sales slipping over 6 per cent
to Dollars 64.79bn and a net loss, after charges, of Dollars 2.83bn.
Mr Akers' chairmanship is under pressure. The six years since he took over
have been marked by declining competitiveness and drastic measures to make
up lost ground.
The latest, put in train last year, aims to transform the company into a
holding company with dozens of operational units that work independently,
yet retain access to IBM research laboratories and other resources.
There is no guarantee the plan will succeed in time to allow Mr Akers to
make a graceful exit. Transforming IBM's ingrained hierarchical culture will
be a slow and difficult process, many observers believe. For Mr Akers - and
his top lieutenants  - renumeration is tied to results. As a result, Mr
Akers' pay could be cut 40 per cent, to less than Dollars 1.6m, this year.
Indeed, Mr Akers may be the only IBM executive who is not engaging in
private speculation about the management race. He is said to be in no mood
to discuss his retirement plans. He would like to complete the ambitious
restructuring process. This is unlikely to be completed by the end of 1994
and he might wish to remain for another year or two.
That could explain Mr Armstrong's move. Insiders insist he wanted to be a
chief executive, but at 53, his age counted against him at IBM.
IBM would want its new chairman to have 10 years in the role, according to
Mr Sam Albert, a former IBM executive with close ties to the company. That
criterion would rule out company veterans such as Mr Terry Lautenbach (53),
Mr David McKinney (57) and Mr Steven Schwartz (57).
Whether the main board, if asked, would allow Mr Akers to stay on is another
matter. Traditionally, IBM chairmen, with the board's blessing, choose their
successors. Now some suggest that for the first time IBM may look outside
for a new chief executive.
Most observers, however, expect Mr Akers to hand over to one of a group of
second-tier executives, in their mid to late 40s, who are being counted on
to improve the performance of key sectors in the toughest economic climate
IBM has ever experienced.
They include Mr Bob LaBant, 46, vice-president and general manager of IBM
USA, Mr James Cannavino, 47, general manager of personal systems, Mr Ned
Lautenbach, 48, president of IBM Asia Pacific (and Terry Lautenbach's
brother), and Mr Bernard Puckett, 47, general manager of applications
solutions.
Long shots include Mrs Ellen Hancock, 48, general manager of networking
systems and Mr Renato Riverso, chairman of IBM World Trade for Europe,
Middle East and Africa.
The smart money, however, seems to be on Mr LaBant and Mr Cannavino. Both
have charm, energy and a willingness to talk to outsiders with an openness
that would have seemed foreign to the company 10 years ago.
Mr LaBant made his name as the manager of IBM's successful mid-range
computer business. Its Rochester, Minnesota, manufacturing site last year
won the coveted Malcolm Baldrige award for quality. An amusing speaker, he
presents his arguments with a clarity which must have scored high marks in
his progress through the company.
Mr Cannavino, the enigmatic head of IBM's personal computer business, has a
key role in two of IBM's most important alliances - an agreement with Groupe
Bull focused on IBM's workstation technology, and a partnership with Apple
designed to develop new microprocessors and software for personal computers.
Mr Cannavino - someone who has addressed industry conferences wearing a
T-shirt disguised as a tuxedo - hardly fits the traditional IBM mould, but
he is very much the man of the moment. As a colleague of his remarked, the
strait-laced executives of the past are no longer heroes at IBM.
Ned Lautenbach has been in charge of Asia-Pacific operations for a year.
However, he is not thought to score as highly on charisma and leadership as
his brother Terry, who is on the company's five-man management committee.
Mr Puckett is a dark horse. Little known outside IBM, his name always comes
up when the succession is discussed. He is general manager of IBM's
applications solutions line of business, responsible for putting together
hardware and software to solve customers' problems. He previously ran the
mainframe division.
Much will now depend on how each contender performs over the next 12 months.
Running the world's largest computer company in such trying times has proved
a bed of nails for Mr Akers. As he ponders on his successor, he might well
ask himself who would really want the job.

<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment is offering early retirement to about 7,000 of its US
employees, or over 10 per cent of the computer company's US workforce, in
its latest effort to reduce costs.
Digital has been struggling to reduce employment for two years in the face
of flat sales and depressed profitability. The company employs about 119,500
people worldwide, including 60,300 full-time workers in the US.
The early retirement programme, the first of its kind offered by Digital,
applies to all US employees over the age of 50 with five years or more
service with the company, and is voluntary.
The company said the voluntary programme was in addition to existing Digital
severance programmes.
Since September 1989, when the job reduction programmes were initiated,
about 12,450 people have left the company, excluding normal attrition and
retirements.
All but 5,550 of these job cuts were mandatory.
For its second fiscal quarter, ending in December, Digital reported net
losses of Dollars 138m on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn.
Digital has taken a total of Dollars 1.6bn in restructuring charges over the
past two years to cover the cost of plant closings, consolidations and work
force reductions.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES at the top of Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers
continued yesterday when Mr Robert Salomon replaced Mr Michael Holland as
head of the asset management division.
Mr Holland left Salomon on Monday to become a vice-chairman at Oppenheimer,
the fund management group.
Although the departure of Mr Holland was not directly related to fall-out
from the bond trading scandal which engulfed Salomon last year and which led
to a massive shake-up of the company's senior management, it is the latest
in a series of top defections.
Last week, Mr Denis Bovins, a key executive in Salomon's investment banking
department, left to join rival Wall Street firm Bear Stearns.
Mr Salomon, who is a direct descendant of the family that founded Salomon
Brothers and who has been at the firm for 16 years, will take over the asset
management unit at a time when demand from institutions and wealthy
individuals for professional management of their money is booming.
Salomon Brothers Asset Management is only three years old, but in that time
it has amassed more than Dollars 8.6bn in advisory assets, plus an
additional Dollars 7bn in assets held by the Resolution Trust Corporation,
the government agency overseeing the bail-out of the collapsed thrift
industry.
Although the asset management division is still a small contributor to
Salomon's total earnings - bond trading and sales remain the mainstay of the
firm - it will play an increasingly important role in the future.
In common with many other big Wall Street firms, Salomon is expected to
build up the parts of the company that provide a regular stream of fee-based
revenues as insurance against the volatility of its earnings from
traditional securities business.

FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Equitable Life surplus shrinks
by further Dollars 290m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITABLE Life Assurance Society, the third largest US insurer, has revealed
it saw its surplus shrink by another Dollars 290m in 1991 - ahead of the
Dollars 250m 'surplus note' capital injection which Axa, the French insurer
provided in early summer.
The 'surplus' is essentially the policyholders' cushion, and changes from
year to year are the best measure of a mutual company's profits or losses.
After adding in the Dollars 250m surplus note injection and the mandatory
securities valuation reserve, Equitable's statutory capital stood at Dollars
1.65bn at the end of 1991, compared with Dollars 1.69bn in 1990.
Equitable is currently a mutual insurer - that is, one which essentially
belongs to its policyholders. It is in the process of converting to
shareholder-owned status, and Axa is expected to acquire a very large
minority stake at that stage, in return for a total Dollars 1bn investment
made last July.
Equitable said it would 'soon' be mailing the hefty documentation on this to
more than 2m eligible policyholders entitled to vote on the matter. The
documents have been awaited for several days now, and two-thirds of those
voting must be in favour.
The figures produced by Equitable for 1991 are particularly complex because
of the demutualisation scheme. Instead of just providing 'statutory'
numbers, filed with the insurance authorities, Equitable is also disclosing
how its figures would look of a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles) basis. GAAP accounting, which is more conservative, is used by
all publicly-held US corporations.
Under GAAP, Equitable shows a Dollars 898.1m loss, with Dollars 307.8m
coming from continuing operation, Dollars 561.9m from discontinued
operations and a Dollars 28.4m charge for demutualisation costs. The loss
for discontinued operations refer to the guaranteed investment contracts, an
expensive form of contract, where Equitable has now written off its losses.
The write-off was taken in one year under GAAP, but spread under the
statutory system.
A Dollars 370m write-up of the Alliance Capital subsidiary was also
disallowed under GAAP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALCESTRUZZI of Italy, part of the Ferruzzi group, has made the only firm
bid for Heracles General Cement, Europe's largest cement exporter, which is
the main attraction in Greece's privatisation programme.
The Italian group, bidding in partnership with the state-owned National Bank
of Greece, has offered Dr107bn (Dollars 575m) for a 69 per cent stake in
Heracles held by the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation (IRO), the state
holding group for companies being denationalised.
If the bid is accepted, a new company, Calnat, will be set up to manage
Heracles, in which Calcestruzzi will have a controlling interest, according
to IRO officials.
The other short-listed bidder, Italcementi, one of the largest Italian
cement producers, failed to submit a binding offer by the February 21
deadline.
However, Italcementi later offered to pay a higher price, reportedly around
Dr120bn, but on condition that National Bank gives up its alliance with
Calcestruzzi.
Co-operation with National Bank is considered essential because of a claim
by Heracles' former managers that the nationalisation procedure which was
followed in 1983, involving a compulsory capitalisation of Dollars 27bn in
debt,violated European Community directives on company law.
The European Court is in agreement with the claim, but the case is likely to
drag on for several years.
If the nationalisation is eventually reversed, IRO will lose its equity
holdings in Heracles and National Bank will become its largest shareholder.
Heracles, which is listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, is one of the few
profit-able companies in the Greek privatisation programme.
Earnings for 1991 are expected to total Dr6.1bn on turnover of more than
Dr50bn.

Aquitaine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government is making a second attempt at floating a 2.3 per cent
stake in Elf Aquitaine, France's largest state-owned company, with the
flotation scheduled for March 13.
Elf, which has extensive interests in oil and chemicals, was originally
intended to float the stake, worth roughly FFr2bn (Dollars 358m), in
December. However, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, decided
to postpone the issue on the day of the proposed sale because of the
depressed state of the Paris stock market.
The Paris market has rallied in recent weeks. The CAC 40 Index went through
the critical level of 1,900 in the third week of February and has since
strengthened. It closed at 1,984 yesterday, up 0.2 per cent on the day.
Elf's own shares closed at FFr385, significantly higher than their price of
FFr350.4 on the day that Mr Beregovoy postponed the initial share sale.
Yesterday, the French government said the stock market was sufficiently
buoyant for it to press ahead with the Elf sale. Mr Beregovoy is expected to
announce the price of the shares on March 13. After the sale, the
government's stake in Elf will be reduced from 53.8 to 51.5 per cent.
The Elf sale is politically significant in that it is intended to be the
first of a series of partial privatisations - sales of minority holdings in
state-owned companies - proposed by France's socialist government. The
government has already said it will also sell off stakes in a number of
other companies including the state-controlled insurance groups and several
industrial concerns.
The postponement of the Elf sale was seen as a blow to the government's
hopes of orchestrating a successful partial privatisation programme. The
response to the issue and the subsequent progress of Elf's share price will
be closely scrutinised as pointers to the prospects for the whole programme.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY is expected to announce today a further cash transfer to Christiania
Bank and demand that the bank implement tougher measures to improve margins
and efficiency.
The announcement will coincide with the publication of Christiania's
accounts for 1991 which, according to local analysts, will show a pre-tax
loss in the region of NKr6bn (Dollars 932m) following credit losses of
around NKr10bn.
Last December, the government took control of Christiania after the bank's
equity had been wiped out by huge trading losses. The government has already
transferred NKr7.6bn to Christiania.
Sources close to the bank said it has not yet been decided how big the new
state cash transfer would be. Christiania earlier warned that it would need
fresh state support of at least NKr2bn to meet new equity capital
requirements.
The government is understood to have warned the bank to improve income -
such as raising charges - cut costs and improve the performance of its
loss-making loan portfolio. Also, the bank will have to come up with an
improved organisational structure. Last autumn, under the leadership of Mr
Borger Lenth, Christiania was reorganised into two divisions.
At that time, the bank announced its intention to cut costs by NKr580m
during 1992. For the nine months ended September 1991, the bank plunged into
net losses of NKr7.3bn, against a 1990 loss of NKr555m. Credit losses rose
to NKr3.79bn from NKr1.66bn.
The state-backed Bank Insurance Fund, established with capital of NKr5bn,
and boosted late last year to NKr11bn, has been drained to around NKr550m by
heavy claims for cash.
It is widely expected that Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, the finance minister, will
have to call on parliament as soon as April for additional funds to prop up
the country's ailing banking system.

<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has
demonstrated the resilience of Canada's banking industry with a 10 per cent
rise in first-quarter income.
Despite a one-third jump in loan loss provisions, RBC lifted net earnings to
CDollars 256m (USDollars 215m), or 73 cents a share, in the three months to
January 31, from CDollars 232m, or 70 cents, a year earlier.
Return on equity fell to 14.5 per cent from 15.3 per cent, due to a larger
common equity base and extra dividends on two preferred share issues last
year.
Return on assets, which averaged CDollars 134.6bn in the latest period,
improved to 0.76 per cent from 0.71 per cent.
The rise in profits stems mainly from the bank's international operations
and record earnings at RBC Dominion Securities, its 74 per cent-owned
securities subsidiary. International income jumped to CDollars 97m from
CDollars 73m, with return on assets surging to 1.4 per cent from 1.03 per
cent.
A bank official yesterday attributed the strong performance to higher loan
fee and other fee income, wider interest margins, higher Third World
interest payments, and the high quality of the bank's international assets.
The US accounts for about 35 per cent of the bank's non-Canadian assets of
CDollars 27.6bn.

VOEST ALPINE of Austria is to take a 40 per cent stake in the state-owned

reports from Manila.
According to the SCC president, Mr Manuel Domingo, the deal covered debts of
Sch1.89bn (Dollars 163.4m) owed by SCC, of which Sch210m was converted into
equity in SCC.
Voest Alpine's equity participation diluted the National Development
Company's share in SCC to 56 per cent from 89 per cent and the Development
Bank of the Philippines' stake to 4 per cent from 11 per cent.
Mr Domingo said the restructuring also paves the way for the increase of
SCC's capitalisation from 475m pesos to 1.2bn pesos (Dollars 47.6m).
SCC is expected to earn a net income of 50m pesos to 100m pesos this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERTELSMANN, the German-based media and entertainment group, is spending
Dollars 119m to purchase a 44-storey office block in the heart of New York's
Times Square district.
The deal, one of the biggest Manhattan property transactions in recent
years, was agreed with a group of lenders including Citibank, the US bank
that led the consortium of 17 financial institutions which loaned Dollars
250m to complete the building in 1990.
The approval of the banks was needed because the actual owner of the 868,000
sq ft building is Broadway State Partners, a consortium of US and Japanese
investors that has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
US bankruptcy law.
Mayor David Dinkins yesterday welcomed the purchase and Bertelsmann's
decision to make the building the new headquarters of its US operations,
including the Bantam Doubleday Dell publishing group and the Bertelsmann
Music Group (BMG).
The purchase - for less than 50 per cent of the investment made just two
years ago - underscores the dire state of the New York commercial real
estate market.
It is understood that Citibank, which provided nearly 30 per cent of the
Dollars 250m initial investment, last year wrote down a significant portion
of its loan.
Bertelsmann expects to occupy two-thirds of the skyscraper, with 1,700
employees moving to the new headquarters. Remaining space will be available
for sub-lease and internal expansion.
Mr Peter Olson, president of Bertelsmann Inc, said a benefit package
provided by the City of New York was essential in making the transaction.
Financial terms of the benefit package were not disclosed.
As part of its agreement with the city government, Bertelsmann will market
over 100,000 sq ft of space to international companies not yet present in
New York. In leasing the excess space, Bertelsmann has agreed to launch a
marketing campaign in the US and Europe that will give priority to the
international companies.
Bertelsmann's New York property investment comes when the German media giant
is seeking to expand further its business areas. The company, whose BMG
division controls RCA Records as well as Arista Records, recently made an
offer to acquire Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music Group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain was yesterday forced to rescue Banco Ibercorp, an
investment house linked to several prominent members of the country's
financial establishment.
Financial regulators moved quickly following a series of damaging
allegations in the Spanish press and the breakdown of takeover negotiations
between Ibercorp and Banco Inversion, a rival financial services
institution.
The Bank of Spain said it was intervening in order to 'prevent the grave
financial deterioration' of Ibercorp and to safeguard shareholders'
interests.
Ibercorp's mutual fund deposits have reportedly dropped from Pta3.9bn
(Dollars 37.8m) to Pta1.1bn, and it has been unable to renew credit lines on
the interbank market.
At the centre of the Ibercorp scandal are allegations that the institution
engaged in insider dealing and protected a privileged group of shareholders,
among whom were several prominent public figures.
Yesterday's intervention is especially embarrassing for the governor of the
Bank of Spain, Mr Mariano Rubio, whose share portfolio was handled by Mr
Manuel de la Concha, Ibercorp's co-chairman and a close friend of Mr Rubio.
Mr Rubio presented his resignation two weeks ago but it was turned down by
the government. He then attempted to find a buyer for Ibercorp. Several
leading retail banks turned down the offer.
The conservative opposition party, Partido Popular, has accused the
government of 'covering up' the potential political impact of the collapse
by blocking a parliamentary inquiry into the affair.
The ruling Socialist party had earlier said that an inquiry was unnecessary
because Ibercorp's stockbroking activities were already under investigation
by the CMNV, the securities watchdog.
Banco Inversion's last-minute initiative failed in part because banks
refused to offer Inversion sufficient credit guarantees to mount the
takeover. Ibercorp's book value was also called into question.

PIFCO HOLDINGS, the electrical appliances group, suffered a 31 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits for the half year to end-October as it worked to
eliminate a loss at Russell Hobbs Tower, its recent acquisition.
The extensive surgery at RHT was responsible for the fall in profits to
Pounds 577,000 (Pounds 1.81m).
The integration process was also hampered by a downturn in consumer
spending.
In the 28 months prior to its acquisition from the administrators of Polly
Peck International in April 1991, RHT lost more than Pounds 30m.
Although the purchase had only cost Pifco Pounds 7.75m - just over half of
its net asset value - Mr Michael Webber, Pifco chairman, said the culture of
the business had to be turned around from 'being driven by the factory to
being driven by the market place'.
RHT is now close to break-even after tighter quality controls reduced return
levels by 10 per cent to 20 per cent; the workforce was cut by 100 to 500
and the head office in Wolverhampton was closed and incorporated into
Pifco's headquarters in Manchester.
Sales at RHT have fallen significantly, but Mr Webber said that was a price
worth paying for getting the business back into the black.
The core Pifco Salton Carmen business experienced a difficult six months due
to last year's poor summer which resulted in lower sales of Pifco fans.
The haircare and personal care business for Carmen was also lower due to
soft consumer demand.
Overall group sales rose to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 13m).
Earnings per share slumped to 5.7p (16p) but the interim dividend is held at
3.5p.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie bucks sector trend with 61% advance
to Pounds 18.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE yesterday appeared as the light at the beginning of the tunnel in
what is expected to be a dismal season for motor-related results. Against
the trend, it reported a 61 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds
11.3m to Pounds 18.2m.
The share price, which has nearly quadrupled since early last year, gained a
further 3p to close at 138p.
Cowie, which is the UK's largest company car leasing operator as well as a
motor dealer, benefited partly from reduced interest rates - its Achilles'
heel in the past - but also from increased car sales.
Although used cars contributed far more to pre-tax profit than new ones, the
number of new cars sold was increased in a year when the UK total fell by 21
per cent.
Sir Tom Cowie, chairman, has often said that every 1 percentage point fall
in interest rates adds Pounds 2.4m to the group's bottom line.
With base rates falling from 14 to 11 per cent between February and July
last year, Cowie's annual interest bill came down from Pounds 44.7m to
Pounds 36.3m.
This more than offset a small squeeze on operating profit of Pounds 54.5m
(Pounds 56m) as turnover advanced by 5 per cent to Pounds 564.9m (Pounds
536.5m).
In the Cowie Interleasing finance division, pre-tax profit rose by 46 per
cent to Pounds 11m on sales of Pounds 208.8m (Pounds 198.7m).
Mr Neil Pykett, director, said the fleet had been expanded from 53,000
vehicles in 1990 to more than 61,000 now.
In the motor division, pre-tax profit rose by 37 per cent to a record Pounds
6.61m (Pounds 4.82m) on sales of Pounds 316.5m (Pounds 276m).
A large order from Hertz UK showed through in an increase in new car sales
from 29,000 to nearly 31,000.
Mr Iain Jane, director, said new cars only contributed 6 per cent to the
division's profit. Used cars accounted for 33 per cent as sales went up from
just over 8,000 to 10,500 units. Workshops, bodyshops and parts contributed
53 per cent.
Cowie's net debt - mostly related to the fleet  - grew to Pounds 355.2m
(Pounds 328.7m), with gearing stable at 385 per cent. The increase in
borrowings followed spending of Pounds 148m on renewing the fleet plus
Pounds 45m to fund acquisitions.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 11.11p (7.22p).
A final dividend of 3.375p makes a total of 4.875p (3.7p).
COMMENT
To produce a pre-tax profit figure second only to the Pounds 25.1m of
booming 1988 is quite an achievement in a year which could hardly be more
different. Cowie has proved right those who said it was a classic interest
rate play - rather than a candidate for insolvency. But more than that, it
has proved the fundamental quality of its car leasing and dealing
businesses. Part of this rests on the synergy between the two: Interleasing
buys from its sister organisation, while the retail business has a ready
supply of used cars. Just as important are the symptoms of good
housekeeping: a conservative approach to residual values - the undoing of
others, the spreading of overheads, early pruning of poorly performing
activities. With pre-tax profit forecast to reach Pounds 23m to Pounds 25m
this year, the prospective multiple is about 9.5. The perceived risk
attached to highly geared leasing groups has dictated a discount and the
shares may pause after a fine run. Medium term there is scope for more.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Young Grp shares dive after profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG GROUP, the opencast and drift coal miner, yesterday announced that its
profits for the year to November 30 1991 were likely to be substantially
lower than expected, and that its directors have recommended no final
dividend be paid.
The announcement coincided with the reinstatement of dealing in the group's
shares, suspended on February 18 at 96p. The shares slumped to 27p, but
rallied slightly to finish the day at 39p.
In a statement issued by Lazards, its financial adviser, the USM-quoted
company, which has sites in the UK and Venezuela, said it had suffered a
shortfall in 'economically extractable reserves' at some of its opencast
sites, resulting in increased per-tonne extraction costs and reduced
profitability.
It is understood that geological problems, including underground combustion
and smaller than anticipated reserves, have hit production at several sites,
denting profitability. The geological setback, although coincidental with
the current depressed price for coal, means the County Durham-based group is
faced with developing new sites at a time when prices are sliding.
The statement said lost production and the costs of developing new sites
while restoring exhausted ones, meant additional working capital was
required. A short term facility had been arranged with shareholders' support
and discussions are continuing with NatWest, the group's bankers, and
shareholders to arrange additional finance.
Barely two months ago, the group successfully raised Pounds 5.4m net by the
issue of 5.71m convertible preference shares, gaining 3i and Hambro European
Ventures as shareholders and reducing gearing below 100 per cent.
Last summer, shortly before declaring interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
756,000, Mr Young voiced hopes of boosting coal production from 774,000
tonnes in 1990 to 1m tonnes within three years. But 1991 production will be
below the previous year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Burnfield lifted its profit by Pounds 550,000 in 1991, and following a big
reduction in exceptional costs, turned the previous pre-tax loss of Pounds
3.2m into a profit of Pounds 1.17m.
The company comprises two businesses: Isopad makes electric surface heating
systems, and Budenberg produces pressure gauges, calibration equipment and
thermometers.
Turnover was Pounds 20.6m, against Pounds 15.3m for the previous 11 months.
Exceptional costs fell to Pounds 795,000 (Pounds 4.61m) and covered the
reorganisation and restructuring of Isopad in Germany and France.
Earnings were 4.8p (losses 24.8p) net of the exceptional item equal to 3.2p
(losses 32.3p). The final dividend is 4.1p making 5.75p (5.5p).

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Serco moves away from defence and hits
Pounds 5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERCO GROUP, the task management company, yesterday announced a 21 per cent
increase to Pounds 5.2m in pre-tax profits in the year to end-December, in
line with forecasts made ahead of the October rights issue.
The company, which lists among its contracts the maintenance of Ministry of
Defence radars, one in three of London's traffic lights and 108 Marks and
Spencer stores, said progress last year was 'very satisfactory'.
Turnover improved 33 per cent from Pounds 78.4m to Pounds 104.9m. Mr George
Gray, chairman, said about Pounds 10m of the increase came from new
contracts. All main contracts which came up for review were renewed.
Defence-related business, which provided 75 per cent of turnover when the
company floated in 1988, has fallen to 47 per cent following
diversification. Since 1990 Serco has provided services to government and
local councils and started operations in Australia and New Zealand.
UK defence budget cuts will affect the group in the longer term. But Serco
expects its defence business to increase this year as contracting out to
reduce costs becomes more popular.
Following the rights issue, which raised Pounds 9.6m, Serco is looking for
acquisitions. The company is continuing talks with British
Telecommunications about the purchase of International Aeradio, its aviation
services subsidiary. This would provide Serco with a natural route into
aviation services, Mr Gray said.
Earnings per share increased to 30.2p (26.1p). A recommended final dividend
of 8p makes a total for the year of 12p (11p).
The company's shares - which had risen strongly since August  - yesterday
gained 9p to a high of 624p.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Admiral edges ahead to Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMIRAL, the Surrey-based computing company specialising in the government
sector and financial services, maintained its reputation for careful
management and cost containment last year.
Profits before tax rose 6 per cent to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 3.28m) on sales
23 per cent higher at Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 21.2m).
The failure of growth in pre-tax profits to match sales was attributed by Mr
Clay Brendish, chairman, to fierce competition and the decision to continue
to recruit staff in anticipation of an upturn in the market.
Earnings per share were up 13 per cent at 21.9p (19.4p) and the recommended
final dividend is 3.3p making a total for the year of 4.8p, up 14 per cent.
Staff numbers grew 20 per cent to 509 during the year and Mr Brendish said
the new people were now beginning to make a contribution to group
profitability.
Defence slipped from 47 per cent of the group's activities to 37 per cent,
but the decline has been more than made up by an increase from 23 per cent
to 31 per cent in financial services work.
COMMENT
Admiral, named after the red butterfly, seems to flutter over many of the
problems of computing services and is one of the few rising stars in a
troubled sector. It combines a close watch on costs with a cautious
recruitment policy and seems to command the loyalty of its customers who
return with repeat business. Its forward order book, worth Pounds 16m last
year, has now stretched to Pounds 20m. Mr Brendish says he detects signs of
an upturn and is beginning to ramp up recruitment to take advantage of new
opportunities. Analysts are taking a cautious view, partly because of the
known difficulties in the sector and also the uncertainties caused by the
election. But for next year a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.8m, giving a modest
prospective p/e of about 14, looks perfectly achievable; profits could touch
Pounds 4m if the economic situation lightens.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redland gets green light for Steetley bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND has been given permission by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary,
to proceed with its contested Pounds 600m bid for Steetley, its rival UK
building materials group.
Mr Lilley said that he had accepted undertakings by Redland that it would
dispose of two brick plants in south-east England and Steetley's clay roof
tile business if the bid succeeded.
The undertakings were sought because a takeover of Steetley would have left
the merged group with 46 per cent of the national clay roof tile market and
23 per cent of brick production capacity in south-east England.
The brick plants at Cranleigh and Tilmanstone and clay tile plants at Keele
and Knutton in Staffordshire must be sold within 18 months of the bid
succeeding.
Steetley, which must publish its defence document within two days of Mr
Lilley's clearance of Redland's offer, said that it would defend itself
vigorously against a bid which substantially under-valued its business.
Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman, said:'The undertakings they have been
required to give undermines the commercial logic of their offer.
'They are going to have to sell our two most modern brickworks, the
country's leading clay manufacturers and our best clay reserves. They will
now have to work very hard to demonstrate where they are going to make the
Pounds 30m of savings they have been saying they will achieve from buying
Steetley.'
Redland said that the businesses it would be selling accounted for less than
5 per cent Steetley's turnover and that it would achieve savings of Pounds
30m even after the undertakings.
Redland's share price yesterday fell 10p to 450p. The group is offering 85
of its shares for every 100 Steetley valuing its 156.5m ordinary shares at
Pounds 598.6m or 382 1/2 p apiece. This compared with Steetley's closing
price of 380p last night.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recruitment decline hits Hays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the business services group, said it could see no clear measurable
sign of any improvement in the economy and forecast that recovery might be
delayed until the beginning of next year.
Strong performances by the group's commercial and distribution divisions
helped offset a plunge in profits from its personnel business, which
specialises in accountancy staff.
Pre-tax profits dipped from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 26.8m in the six months
to December 31, although this was partly because of the ending of income
from an interest-capping policy, which last year contributed Pounds 1.8m.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 341m (Pounds 342m).
Stripping out the effects of the interest-capping policy, Hays said
operating profit after normal interest payments had risen by nearly 5 per
cent to Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 25.7m).
Operating profits at the personnel division fell from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds
2.5m, which Hays said reflected the depth of the recession and its
particularly harsh impact on the recruitment industry.
Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman and chief executive, said employee numbers in the
division had been cut from 1,500 to 850 over the last two years and 18
offices had been 'mothballed'. However, there had been no further
retrenchment in the half-year to December, and turnover levels now seemed to
have stabilised.
The distribution division's operating profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds
16.2m, aided by an increase in the volume of goods distributed for both
Waitrose and Tesco.
Mr Frost said the recession had affected the performance of its wine and
spirits distribution and home delivery services, but chemical distribution
had traded well.
The commercial division's operating profits grew by 33 per cent, from Pounds
6.9m to Pounds 9.2m, although some Pounds 900,000 of that increase came from
three recently acquired companies.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 4.7p, but the group said its strong
balance sheet and cash flow enabled it to maintain its policy of increasing
dividends by 15 per cent, giving an interim of 1.5p (1.3p).
COMMENT
Mr Frost can reasonably claim that his 'three-legged stool philosophy' is
proving its worth, with the strength of the distribution and commercial
businesses providing much needed support for the personnel side. The
recruitment businesses provide the group's strongest claim to be a recovery
play and Hays claims that swift cost-cutting means that 75 per cent of any
new turnover will drop straight through to profits. The catch is that Mr
Frost seems to have written off hopes of much recovery in 1992 and Hays
shares have already outperformed the market by more than 40 per cent over
the last year. Forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 58m put the shares
on a multiple of over 18. That is not unreasonable for a company with Hays'
track record, but buyers at this level should be willing to wait for
long-term growth.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO HIGH Court-appointed inspectors investigating a share dealing
controversy within Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods group, have come to
the conclusion that Mr Chris Comerford, its former managing director, 'is an
unfit person to be a director of a company in the State'.
The inspectors were appointed last September, two weeks after Mr Comerford
was forced by the board to resign from his IPounds 135,000 (Pounds 125,000)
per year position. This was triggered by a controversial 1990 buy-out of a
subsidiary, Sugar Distributors, shortly before Irish Sugar was privatised.
Mr Comerford was considered to have a conflict of interest which he had
failed to disclose, but he was offered a IPounds 1.5m severance package
which was later frozen.
The inspectors' report, published in Dublin yesterday and running to almost
300 pages, concluded that Mr Comerford 'corruptly accepted monies . . . may
have committed a criminal offence, namely forgery . . . and in his capacity
as managing director of Irish Sugar, Mr Comerford deceived the company,
being his employer, the board of directors and in particular Mr Cahill (the
chairman), from sometime in or around mid-summer 1988 until the
privatisation of Irish Sugar'.
Mr Comerford said yesterday that he intended fighting the affair through the
courts and claimed that he had been made a scapegoat by Greencore's board.
Surprisingly, the inspectors concluded that neither 'Mr Comerford nor any of
his family' ever had a beneficial interest in a company called Talmino which
was involved in the Sugar Distributors buy-out. This directly contradicts
the conclusions of another inquiry into the affair commissioned by the
Industry Minister.

Pounds 239m

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANK XEROX, the document products company, announced a 13 per cent decline
in operating profits from Pounds 452m to Pounds 395m in the year to October
31. The group, jointly owned by Xerox of the US and the Rank Organisation,
said that if the effects of the sale of its businesses in the Pacific region
were excluded, the decline was 3 per cent.
Rank Xerox sold its businesses in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and
Singapore to Fuji Xerox in the last financial year.
Pre-tax profits, after taking account of charges made by Xerox Corporation
for R&amp;D and other costs, as agreed between Xerox and Rank Corporation, were
Pounds 238.8m (Pounds 294.5m).
Mr Bernard Fournier, managing director, said that 'to achieve this is, in
our industry, is an excellent result'.
Rank Xerox increased its share of the market by 1.5 percentage points to 30
per cent in revenue terms. The group said that the recession was the main
factor behind the profit decline. Turnover was down from Pounds 2.68m to
Pounds 2.51bn.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Withdrawal of Imferon pulls Fisons down 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceutical and scientific instruments company, said
yesterday that it could abandon its attempt to reinstate a drug banned by US
regulatory authorities into the US market.
Imferon, an anaemia treatment, was taken off the US market in January 1991
because of production problems. Its absence contributed to a 17 per cent
drop to Pounds 190.5m (Pounds 230.2m) in full-year pre-tax profits.
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said it would cost Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m to
modernise Imferon production to meet standards set by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
Fisons estimated that profits from US sales of the drug would have been
Pounds 15m in 1991. The company said it was considering whether or not to
make the requested improvements to its plant in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire.
This possibility could put pressure on the FDA to moderate its demands.
There is no effective alternative to Imferon in some therapies, said Fisons.
The absence from US and Japanese markets of Imferon and another drug banned
by the FDA, hay fever treatment Opticrom, last year cost the company Pounds
65m in lost earnings and increased spending on production facilities.
'Last year was a difficult one for Fisons', said Mr Egan. The group,
nevertheless, is increasing the dividend for the year to 8.7p (7.5p) with a
final of 5.4p. Mr Egan said: 'We are confident as we enter 1992 that most of
our difficulties now lie behind us.'
He confirmed that an inspection by the FDA of production facilities for both
Opticrom and Imferon would probably be delayed until April, instead of March
as previously expected. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds
1.16bn) thanks to a strong performance from the scientific instruments
division. Earnings per share fell to 20.8p (26.3p).
Capital spending, partly to comply with FDA rules, pushed capital employed
for the year up to Pounds 686m (Pounds 614m). Return on capital employed
fell from 37.3 per cent to 29.3 per cent, the lowest for more than three
years.
Fisons signalled a change of management style giving sales figures for each
of its best selling drugs for the first time. Asthma drug Intal, easily the
best seller despite its 20 years on the market, turned over Pounds 170m at
wholesale prices, 10 per cent higher than in 1990.
Its replacement, Tilade, brought in Pounds 20m, an improvement of 45 per
cent on 1990. Tilade is still awaiting approval for the US market.
Rynacrom and Opticrom, both used for hay-fever, generated sales of Pounds
55m and Pounds 45m respectively.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Expamet falls 43% to Pounds 7.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPAMET International, the building products and security group, yesterday
reported a 43 per cent fall in profits as most of its divisions continued to
be hit by recession.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 7.3m on sales 11
per cent lower at Pounds 141m.
Earnings per share fell from 19.62p, adjusting for the 1990 rights issue, to
9.06p but the group nevertheless maintained its final dividend at 6.2p and
the total for the year at 10.38p.
Debt was cut from Pounds 17.3m at the interim stage to Pounds 10m, or
gearing of 45 per cent, a level that Mr Alex Orr, managing director,
described as comfortable.
This was achieved by an increase in profitability, following a difficult
first quarter and a sharp reduction in working capital in Europe.
The group continued to suffer from the delayed launch of five security
products from its 1989 acquisition, Radionics of the US. The radio product -
with the most promising market in the US  - is now due for launch in late
March.
A breakdown of operating profits after exceptionals showed that the security
division nearly halved to Pounds 3.9m on lower sales after disposals, a
reduction in gross margins and increased R&amp;D expenditure.
The building division was static at Pounds 5.1m after an improvement in the
ducting business in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The industrial sector's profits fell by more than half to Pounds 1.5m,
partly because of costs of halving the workforce at the old expanded metal
business.
COMMENT
One has to question the wisdom of maintaining a dividend by digging into
reserves but Expamet was probably tied to this policy by its Pounds 21m
rights issue last year. It leaves little room for manoeuvre if something
goes wrong. Nevertheless, having regained control of working capital and cut
debt, and with the prospect of some benefit from the much delayed launch of
Radionics' radio security product, the dividend is probably safe. Profits
forecast at Pounds 11m this year give earnings of 12.6p, and a multiple of
nearly 12. With a maintained dividend level, Expamet still yields an
attractive 9 per cent.

<TEXT>
Creditors of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit, electronics, and
leisure group, are to meet the company's administrators on Thursday next
week for an informal discussion about how different categories of creditor
should be paid.
No shareholders are being invited to the meeting and only creditors who have
claims of more than Pounds 10,000 may attend. There are thought to be about
300 of these.
Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, one of the group's three administrators, is
expected to explain that the administrators have had to take legal advice
about whether Dollars 400m raised at the time of the rights issue early in
1990 for the purchase of Sansui, the Japanese consumer electronics group,
was routed through PPI Holdings, a holding company in the Dutch Antilles.
'The implications of which company the funds were routed through are quite
considerable for creditors,' the administrators said yesterday.
He declined to comment on how much of a pay-out creditors can expect to
receive, but it appears that any payment for creditors owed less than Pounds
10,000 will probably be very small.
He said that Polly Peck creditors 'might have to take their own decisions'
as a result of the information that will be provided.
A decision on which course of action should be taken may emerge from the
next Polly Peck creditors' meeting, due on March 31.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Land of the rising foreign opportunity: Overseas groups
hoping to find Japanese partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and European acquisitions of Japanese companies could rise sharply as
foreign groups take advantage of weakness in Japanese stock and property
markets.
Investment bankers in Tokyo said an increasing number of foreign companies
were hiring advisers to seek potential partners.
They said overseas groups were particularly interested in acquiring
distributors for their products to increase their knowledge of the Japanese
market. Pharmaceutical companies are especially active.
Japanese purchases of foreign companies, however, still heavily outweigh
foreign acquisitions of Japanese groups, in spite of the end of Japan's
1980s speculative boom.
Last year, foreign companies bought just 14 Japanese companies worth a total
of Y178bn (Pounds 794.64m) against 259 Japanese purchases of overseas
companies worth Y684bn, said Daiwa Securities, the stockbroker.
But corporate finance specialists said the number and value of deals would
increase in 1992.
'The number of deals could double this year,' said Mr Christopher Mackenzie,
a Tokyo-based director of J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank.
'More than half our time is spent advising foreign companies on potential
Japanese acquisitions, compared with 25 per cent last year and 10 per cent
in 1990.'
According to Daiwa Securities the market is active 'below the surface',
meaning many deals are being discussed but have yet to be announced.
However, Mr Isao Matsuura, a director of Sanwa Bank, sounded a note of
caution. He said the level of foreign interest in making an acquisition had
not changed dramatically.
But the decline in Japanese asset prices means foreign companies are in a
better financial position to complete a purchase. Industries in which
foreign companies are keen to make acquisitions include pharmaceuticals,
chemicals and some specialist areas of machine tools, said Mr Matsuura.
In the past few weeks, two deals have been announced. Electronic Data
Systems, a unit of General Motors of the US and a developer of computer
systems, has said it would take a Y3.75bn stake in Japan Systems, a troubled
Japanese computer systems company quoted on the over-the-counter market.
EDS plans to inject money into the Japanese company in return for shares
which would give it a 19.9 per cent stake. Japan Systems, hit by a sharp
decline in demand for software, will use the funds to repay bank debts.
Pfizer, the US drugs and chemicals group, has announced it will buy Koshin
Medical, the privately owned Japanese distributor of medical equipment
produced by Schneider, a Pfizer subsidiary. The price was reported to be
around Y3bn.
Even after a 45 per cent decline in the Japanese stock market in the past
two years, Japanese equities are more highly valued in terms of
price/earnings multiples than shares in the US and Europe.
However, some large Japanese groups are ready to sell non-core businesses to
foreign buyers. And the owners of privately controlled small and
medium-sized companies are increasingly looking to realise some or all of
their investment.
Mr Thomas Lynch, a senior manager in Tokyo at Peat Marwick Finance Advisory,
an arm of the international accountancy firm, said foreign companies were
interested in distribution and there was a 'a lot of pressure' to sell on
the part of Japanese owners because the industry faced rationalisation with
the liberalisation of many regulations.

FT  04 MAR 92 / ABB global instrumentation business put up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group, is putting up for sale its
UK-based global instrumentation business as part of a strategy to
concentrate on its core business of electrical engineering.
The sale is expected to generate substantial worldwide interest, as it
represents a rare opportunity to purchase a large self-contained
instrumentation business with a good strategic and market position.
The proposed sale comes only two years after ABB purchased the outstanding
45.6 per cent of Luton-based ABB Kent in a deal that valued the world's
second largest manufacturer of water meters at Pounds 135m.
Two months later, ABB Kent became the lynchpin of a new process
instrumentation group which included the Taylor Instrument division of ABB
Combustion Engineering in the US. The old Brown Boveri company had
originally bought a stake in George Kent, the British instruments group, in
1974.
Morgan Stanley International in London has been retained as financial
adviser for sale of the business group, which has major manufacturing
operations in the UK, Italy, Germany and the US, annual revenues of nearly
Dollars 450m, and employs about 4,500 people.
The business produces a wide range of instruments and control valves along
with water meters. Its principal companies are ABB Kent-Taylor, Kent Introl
and Kent Meters.
ABB had foreseen the creation of a new business group when it bought out the
minority shares in ABB Kent. It had said in February 1990 that, given a
highly competitive market and rapidly changing technology, there was a clear
need for the co-ordination of product development, manufacturing and
marketing.
Yesterday, ABB said that more than 50 per cent of the instrumentation
business was related to water control and therefore not closely related to
its core electrical business.
ABB would not comment on instrumentation business profits ahead of the
engineering group's annual results due on March 18, except to say that the
business was 'doing well'.
Mr John Notley, president of the instrumentation business and chief
executive of ABB Kent, described business prospects as 'pretty good'.
Weakness in the US offset good conditions in Germany, which has benefited
from reunification.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Abbey National up 6% despite big provisions: Pre-tax profits
at Pounds 618m - Dividend rise of 10.5% is largest in sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance by its treasury operation enabled Abbey National, the
retail banking group, to report a 6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits last
year, in spite of a heavy increase in its provisions against loan losses.
Abbey National, the UK's second largest mortgage lender with 13.8 per cent
of the market, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 618m during 1991, up from
Pounds 582m in 1990.
This made it the second most profitable UK banking group last year after
Lloyds Bank. As a result, Abbey National increased its dividend by 10.5 per
cent to 10.5p, up from 9.5p last year, the largest dividend increase in the
UK banking sector.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said: 'Abbey National's business is in good
shape.' Mr Birch said the bank was positioned to continue progress, having
moved into life assurance with the purchase of Scottish Mutual.
Group assets rose 23 per cent, from Pounds 46.4bn in 1990 to Pounds 57.4bn.
However, more than half of this balance sheet growth came from Abbey
National's treasury operations, which contributed Pounds 62m to the overall
pre-tax profits, up from Pounds 2m in 1990.
The performance of Abbey National's retail banking operations was less
impressive. The bank's core mortgage lending operations shrank during the
year as the market declined, with its total net UK lending down by 20 per
cent, from Pounds 3.7bn in 1990 to Pounds 4.6bn last year.
Loan loss provisions almost trebled, rising from Pounds 55m in 1990 to
Pounds 155m.
During the year, the bank repossessed 8,871 homes, but the number
repossessed in the second half was slightly below that of the first half.
Mr Birch said that although repossessions were still at a high level, Abbey
National had fared better than the mortgage lending industry as a whole and
he believed that the bank had weathered the storm.
The number of Abbey National mortgage customers more than six months in
arrears on payments has more than doubled, rising from 11,563 in 1990 to
24,419 in 1991, about 1.75 per cent of all mortgages.
There has been a steady fall in the number of mortgage accounts coming into
serious arrears since the second half of 1991. In spite of this Abbey
National expects to go on having to make steep provisions against bad loans
through 1992 and 1993 until the fall in arrears has worked its way through
and been translated into a significant fall in repossessions.
In the market, Abbey National's shares fell 11p to close at 292p after heavy
trading.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Swiss engineers and Japanese pump maker in 5% stake swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SULZER Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, and Ebara, the leading
Japanese pump maker, are to take 5 per cent share stakes in each other,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The Sulzer shares for the transaction, valued at SFr66m (Dollars 44m), are
to come from a 10 per cent block acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)
from the collapsed Omni group last year. Ebara will issue convertible bonds
to Sulzer.
Sulzer, which has done business in Japan since the beginning of this
century, said the two groups were in talks about co-operation in the
production of pumps and environmental and refrigeration systems.
The Swiss group noted that Ebara's activities were concentrated mainly in
Japan.
With Japanese markets becoming more open, Ebara saw a need to expand its
presence in world markets. Sulzer, on the other hand, was weak in Asia.
In the pumps field, Sulzer estimated that there was a 50 per cent overlap
between the two groups, with Ebara strongest in standard, mass-produced
pumps and Sulzer ahead in engineered pumps.
Pumps have been a declining portion of Sulzer's business for some years, now
accounting for only 8 per cent of group sales.

FT  04 MAR 92 / GA losses increase by 40% to Pounds 172m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION and crime-related losses pushed General Accident, the Perth-based
composite (general and life) insurer, deeper into loss last year.
The company, the third big insurer to report a deficit for 1991, posted
pre-tax losses of Pounds 171.6m, up by more than 40 per cent on the Pounds
121.3m registered in 1990.
The losses emerged in spite of the fact that GA lost market share rather
than keep rates low. UK premium income fell marginally to Pounds 1.17bn for
the previous year.
However, GA displayed confidence about its underlying financial strength and
the prospects of recovery this year by maintaining its dividend at 26.75p.
Like its competitors, GA suffered increased underwriting losses in the UK of
Pounds 341.9m against Pounds 230.9m for 1990.
Although GA has only a 4 per cent share of the mortgage indemnity market
(insuring mortgage lenders for losses on sales of repossessed properties)
losses amounted to Pounds 45m.
Arson and theft claims were also higher, contributing to a rise in
commercial property losses to Pounds 75.6m from Pounds 65.7m in 1990.
Reserves for liability claims in the UK were strengthened by about Pounds
30m.
Worldwide underwriting losses of Pounds 569.1m, compared with Pounds 461.7m
for the previous year, were offset by investment income of Pounds 448.8m, up
from Pounds 429.9m, and life profits Pounds 27m, up from Pounds 25.2m.
Estate agency losses were Pounds 17.8m compared with Pounds 23.3m. Losses at
NZI Bank amounted to Pounds 0.8m, from Pounds 6.3m. Interest on loans
totalled Pounds 59.7m compared with Pounds 85.1m.
Reflecting on the increased loss on private and fleet motor business of
Pounds 113.9m, up from Pounds 76.5m, Mr Bob Scott, general manager (UK),
said: 'The turnround has been much slower than anticipated. You would have
thought the increases would have shown through by now.'
GA said it had plans to increase the scope of its GA 121 operation which
sells insurance via a combination of mass media marketing and telephone
sales. GA 121 insures 15 per cent of GA's motor policyholders and is to
begin sales of home insurance later this year.
Mr Scott said that staff at GA 121's offices in Glasgow and Hamilton would
be increased this year by between 75 and 100 people, up from the 150
employed at the end of last year.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Congress delay may hit IMF funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects of the Int-ernational Monetary Fund winning its Dollars 60bn
(Pounds 34bn) funding increase this year are receding because of mounting
opposition in the US to foreign aid.
The US administration has asked Congress to approve the funding for the US's
Dollars 12bn share of the increase, but has made little effort to press for
the quota increase in the face of opposition from both Republicans and
Democrats.
Congressmen and congressional aides now say attempts to pass legislation
this year authorising the IMF quota increase appear virtually dead.
The administration's reluctance to push for the quota increase has been
reinforced by the challenge to Mr Bush posed by Mr Patrick Buchanan, the
isolationist candidate for the Republican party nomination for president. Mr
Buchanan has denounced foreign aid in general and the IMF funding in
particular.
Most other IMF member countries have already approved their contributions,
but under IMF rules the overall quota increase cannot go ahead unless
approved by countries representing 85 per cent of voting powers. The US has
19 per cent of the IMF's voting rights.
Without the rise, the IMF could face a serious cash shortage later this year
as it attempts to meet growing loan demands, especially from Russia and
other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The IMF has headroom for future lending of only Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn,
which could easily be absorbed in loans for members of the CIS. Liquidity
could fall to 'dangerously low levels by the end of this year', according to
western diplomats.
In the past the IMF has overcome temporary liquidity shortages by borrowing
directly from member countries, but with most leading industrial countries
running large budget deficits, Japan is the only likely source of bilateral
support for the IMF.
US reluctance to contribute is also delaying a planned Dollars 1.3bn capital
increase for the International Finance Corporation - the World Bank's arm
for promoting the private sector in developing countries. The IFC has
already had to cut its lending operations at a time when the World Bank is
under pressure from the US administration to expand its direct support for
the private sector.
Congress still stands a slim chance of passing a foreign aid appropriations
bill - the natural home for the quota increase provision - before the
current funding expires at the end of this month. This bill is, however,
currently tied up by the impasse over Israel's request for Dollars 10bn of
loan guarantees to help it absorb up to one million immigrants from the
former Soviet Union.
But even if an aid bill is put forward, neither Senator Patrick Leahy,
chairman of the Senate appropriation subcommittee on foreign operations, nor
Congressman David Obey, his opposite number in the House of Representatives,
plans to include the IMF quota increase.
Congressional aides do not rule out the possibility that a member could
propose funding the quota increase in an amendment but it is extremely
unlikely that any member would want to take this politically unprofitable
risk.

FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Alcatel/ITT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel-Alsthom's purchase of ITT's minority stake in its telecoms
subsidiary is a logical conclusion to what was always couched as a
medium-term venture. On the face of it both parties benefit, ITT because it
is realising a Dollars 400m net profit, Alcatel because it can now
consolidate all the earnings of its most profitable division.
On closer inspection, though, Alcatel looks to have done the better of the
two. It is buying the stake at a multiple of around 12 times this year's
earnings. The generous structure of the cash payments should mean Alcatel
will avoid any dilution when it reports its 1991 results a month from now.
In addition, ITT's promise to hold its new shares for five years gives the
group a useful defensive edge. It is perhaps thus less surprising that
Alcatel's shares responded with a robust rise. In the race between Europe's
telecoms giants the gap between it and Siemens and the likes of Ericsson is
becoming ever wider.

FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems the market is never satisfied. Having registered alarm at the
prospect of industrial companies cutting or even passing their dividends, it
ought to be delighted by the rare spectacle of a bank whose dividend is
covered three times. Instead, yesterday's results presented an opportunity
to lop 4 per cent off the value of Abbey National. Investors are right,
however, to pause for thought over Abbey's dependency on treasury business.
Without the Pounds 60m increase from this quarter, pre-tax profits would
actually have fallen by 4 per cent.
Management's extreme risk aversion should mean there is no particular danger
inherent in this activity, but the sudden prominence of low-margin treasury
income does underline the weakness of Abbey's core operations in the retail
sphere. Growth is hampered on several fronts despite Abbey's remarkable
ability to force down deposit rates faster than lending charges. The housing
market is not out yet out of the woods; costs are rising as the heavy spend
on branch development continues and it will be next year before its new
insurance venture starts to pay off.
All this leaves Abbey flawed as a recovery stock, especially since it has
fewer provisions to unwind than the other clearing banks when the economic
climate finally improves. But at its current level it is not attractive in
yield terms either, despite the prospect of a real increase in the dividend
this year. Abbey's historic yield of 4.8 per cent compares with 5.2 per cent
from Lloyds. The shares may have a little further to fall before they again
find favour even with investors to whom the bank's safe but unexciting image
appeals.

FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No bad news is suddenly good news for investors in UK composite insurance
companies. That at any rate seems to be the shallow thinking behind
yesterday's 4 per cent jump in the General Accident share price after the
company announced pre-tax losses, a final dividend and shareholders' funds
bang in line with expectations.
Relief after Royal is understandable, and income funds are no doubt grateful
for a yield more than 50 per cent higher than the market average. But with
the shares still trading at a hefty premium to estimated net assets it is
hard to summon up much enthusiasm on a long term view. Take last year's
dreadful UK underwriting results, for instance. There may be some evidence
of an improvement in the last quarter, and just a hint of highly prudent
reserving, but the overall 50 per cent deterioration is pretty bleak given
GA's relatively small mortgage guarantee exposure and the comparison with a
storm-tossed 1990. Rate increases will help repair some of the damage to the
motor account - but a 34 per cent fall in fourth quarter premiums for this
type of business highlights the strategic dilemma of taking the pricing
solution too far.
As with most of its competitors, the over-riding question about GA is
whether it can sustain its dividend payout. Royal has already shown what can
happen when a company runs out of balance sheet fat. While GA is not in the
danger zone yet, it does not take much imagination - another Pounds
50m-Pounds 100m of losses this year and a reversal in the US dollar exchange
rate or the UK stock market - to see the solvency margin down in the low
30s. GA, rightly or wrongly, will do its damnedest to pay, but there are too
many unknowns to be comfortable at this stage.

FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons' sorry story
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,565.4 (+11.1)
There was a depressing air about yesterday's annual results from Fisons. A
company supposedly intent on demonstrating a new-found frankness managed to
look as secretive and self-satisfied as ever in confirming that earnings
last year fell by a fifth. Such details of the disasters in the US as it
volunteered merely served to emphasise the deep-seated nature of the group's
problems there. The novel release of sales figures for its main drug
products was tarnished by their unusual derivation from outside survey
sources, while the attempt to disguise a flat underlying sales trend by
excluding associate companies and re-stating the previous year's figures
came across as worryingly naive. A net cash outflow of Pounds 60m, the
Pounds 10m interest bill and the jump in gearing to 38 per cent suggested
that even the group's renowned financial skills have not been immune. By the
standards of its peers, Fisons is shrinking.
If the vacant chief executive's position is filled by an aggressive
outsider, it is conceivable that the management culture will be given a
shake-up. The fact that after four years a supposed wonder-product such as
Tilade purportedly has worldwide sales of only Pounds 20m reveals the extent
of Fisons' difficulties. A larger company might well have been able to make
a better fist of exploiting its undoubted commercial prospects. Fisons has
sensibly admitted that its drugs division will not be independent for much
longer. Talk of joint ventures remains vague, but at least the subject has
been broached.
Admittedly, it is possible that Fisons will pull off a recovery on its own,
in which case its shares look cheap. But given that the shares have now
barely outperformed the market over five years, investors will doubtless not
be taking that on trust.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Directors urge radical extension of free market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY DIRECTORS yesterday urged an incoming government to adopt sweeping
economic reforms based on the application of market forces and the eventual
abolition of income tax and other direct taxes.
The Institute of Directors published its 112-point programme as a challenge
to the three main political parties as they prepare their general election
manifestos.
The tone of the document is uncompromising. It advocates a free market
economy untrammelled by subsidies or any form of government interference.
Among the more provocative recommendations are the abolition of capital
gains and inheritance taxes as well as income tax, the privatisation of all
remaining state-controlled enterprises - including motorways  - and the
introduction of tax relief on health insurance and private education.
Although the IoD said it was aiming its broadside at the three main
political parties, it is clear that the document only has a prospect of
acceptance by a Conservative administration. Even there, support could be
less than total.
The institute, under Mr Peter Morgan, its director general, and his
predecessor Sir John Hoskyns, is regarded as one of the more influential
policy organisations of the right, although it has no direct political
affiliation.
However, there is an assumption that Mr John Major is not as keen on some of
the IoD's ideas as was Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Morgan said at a London press conference yesterday that a refocusing of
the balance between government, markets and the individual was the theme of
the document. 'It outlines what company directors want the new government to
do and what they do not want it to do.'
All the measures advocated were designed to increase the size of the market
and to improve the effectiveness of its operation. They could reasonably be
introduced in the lifetime of a parliament.
'Their adoption will create favourable conditions in which directors can
lead their businesses and create wealth. The prosperity of everyone in the
UK depends on their success,' he said.
A complete overhaul of the tax system would include establishing a single
rate of income tax. This would fall to 20p in the next parliament and
subsequently be abolished altogether. The cost of abolishing a range of
direct taxes would be met by limiting the growth of public expenditure to
half the growth in the economy.
Two new government departments are advocated, one for the market, based on a
reformed trade and industry department, and the other for human resources,
to be responsible for ensuring that education, training and employment
policy is geared to the needs of the individual. Forward to Prosperity; A
business leaders' manifesto for the next government. Director Publications,

FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: The real losers from fraudulent theft claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK WEIGLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article discussing measures being taken by insurers as a result of
increased theft and alleged arson claims ('Sharp rise in theft insurance
payouts', March 2) fails to take into account the problems which innocent
claimants are experiencing because of this tougher line.
The Association of British Insurers states that fire damage payouts last
year were Pounds 1.02bn. Although half of this figure is attributed to
arson, the amount believed to result from policyholders setting fire to
their own property is Pounds 100m - 10 per cent.
Nevertheless, our own experience shows that the proportion of claims which
are investigated for fraud is much higher. The result is that many innocent
policyholders face difficulties in negotiating their claims, with settlement
sometimes delayed to the point where the business's ability to reinstate and
resume trading is seriously impeded.
No-one expects insurers to pay fraudulent claims. But non-fraudulent
claimants - the majority  - have the right to expect value for the premiums
they have spent on protecting their business. It used to be the case that
you were presumed innocent until proved guilty. Some insurers now appear to
be presuming guilt and wheeling in forensic accountants and scientists to
try to prove their case. Often the only way the innocent claimant can win is
by appointing his own professional loss assessor to look after his

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RODERICK BROMLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Kathy Bradley of the Pulp and Paper Information Centre (Letters,
February 29) rightly points out the misconception that paper is made from
Brazilian hardwood.
What she omits to mention, and this is a fact to which other voyagers to
Brazil might attest, is the extent to which the rainforest has been
subjugated by the implantation of eucalyptus, from which the paper pulp does
come.

Sir, I wonder if the MPs of both main parties currently baying for the blood
of Lloyd's 'insiders' (that is, members) for the losses of many 'outside'

the shares of Royal, for instance, falling from 490p to around 180p in the
last year or so and passing its dividend?
Would it not be consistent to set the lynch mob on the company 'insiders'

Or would that be seen to be so idiotic as to be without political capital?

FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: Pollution and buses in Santiago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER R WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Leslie Crawford's report from Santiago ('Putting the brakes on the bus
cartel', February 26) usefully highlights some of the problems caused by bus
deregulation in the Chilean capital, and recent government action to
counteract them.
However, although dealing with pollution from the buses may have provided a
useful rationale for reducing the total number of buses by withdrawing the
oldest vehicles, it would be wrong to regard buses as the main source of
transport pollution.
The recent comprehensive transport study of the city published by the
Commission on Urban Transport, shows that only in respect of particulate
emissions (from diesel engines) were buses and lorries the main source. For
other transport pollutants, the car was the main source, generating two
thirds of the nitrous oxides, and 90 per cent of the carbon monoxide.
As in Britain, it is private transport (rather than public transport,
whether efficiently or badly run) that must be tackled.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Personal View: If the west wants to help Russia, now is the
time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YEGOR GAIDAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from the International Monetary Fund last week endorsed Russia's
economic programme. At the same time, Russia announced further steps to
reinforce its moves to monetary and fiscal discipline and to a market
economy.
The west is currently considering the question of foreign financial
assistance to support our reforms. I should like to explain why speedy
assistance is so important a reinforcement for our efforts.
Our basic task is this. We must conquer a powerful inflation bequeathed by
the old system, while at the same time rapidly introducing market forces and
private ownership. We inherited a budget deficit of more than 20 per cent of
gross domestic product, a mountain of roubles built up by years of monetary
and fiscal laxness, and a crippling system of price controls. The result was
a destructive combination of empty shops and explosive inflation.
We took necessary and dramatic steps, in line with the serious situation. We
freed most but not all prices in early January. Prices rose immediately by
about 250 per cent, but since then they have risen little, and in some cases
have declined. We tightened up monetary policy, and decisively cut the
budget deficit, so that the flood of roubles has been brought to a trickle.
The free market value of the rouble has started to strengthen as a result.
However, the next phase of our reform will be at least as difficult as the
first. To consolidate our budget gains, we will by the end of April free
nearly all prices, including energy prices. Only rents, public transport,
and some prices of utilities will remain controlled. Energy prices will move
to world levels progressively over a couple of years, with an export tax
accounting for the price difference. We expect energy prices to rise by a
multiple of six in April.
The resulting price rise will be a severe but unavoidable blow to our
population. They cannot be fully protected against it without initiating an
endless wage-price spiral. To prevent such a spiral from developing, it is
important to 'anchor' the price level by pursuing tight monetary and fiscal
policies, and by stabilising the value of the rouble against international
currencies.
In spite of the critical need to stabilise expectations, the future of our
exchange rate is uncertain. Without foreign financial help, we cannot
possibly attempt to peg the rouble, and certainly not at a socially and
economically tolerable rate.
At the current rate of about 80 roubles to the US dollar, average monthly
wages in industry still amount to no more than Dollars 20. This disastrously
low dollar wage reflects the utter scarcity of foreign exchange in our
economy, the result of the anti-export bias of the old system, collapsing
oil export earnings, and the severe debt crisis that we inherited. Already
in 1991, our imports fell by about 45 per cent compared with the 1990 level,
leaving the economy with an acute scarcity of foreign exchange.
This shortage is contributing to the deepening industrial crisis. Across
Russia, factories have run down the imported raw materials and spare parts
needed to maintain output. Even though these factories can now buy foreign
exchange in the free market for imports, with the weak rouble they are
squeezed between the high cost of dollars and the low purchasing power of
their domestic customers.
Within a few years, our own exports will rise strongly as a result of the
new market forces in the economy and the recovery of our oil industry; by
then the foreign exchange shortage will then have been eased by our own
efforts. However, in the coming year, we will have to rely heavily on
foreign finance.
We want to stabilise the rouble at a realistic rate, stronger than 50
roubles per dollar, and consistent with average monthly industrial wages of
about Dollars 100 later this year. For this we will need foreign exchange
reserves to help defend the currency, and a flow of balance of payments
support to help us finance critically needed imports.
To build up the reserves needed to defend the exchange rate, we have asked
the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to provide us with a
stabilisation fund similar to that provided for Poland. After allowing for
the size of our country, this would amount to some Dollars 5bn.
Ideally, of course, we would not have to draw on the fund, any more than
Poland did. But the existence of the fund would be a clear warning to
speculators that they could lose money by selling roubles.
It is very important to us to have this fund in place within weeks rather
than months. Since the impending price rises are bound to have a
destabilising effect, it is vital to show our people that the increases are
a once-for-all adjustment to complete our stabilisation, and not just
another wave in a sea of inflation.
In addition to the stabilisation fund, we have requested several kinds of
help to increase the flow of imports into the economy. We need about Dollars
6bn in humanitarian assistance, food and medicine, in 1992, to make up for
the terrible harvest shortfalls and the critical lack of pharmaceuticals.
We need another Dollars 6bn or so in non-food imports, to keep production
going in factories dependent on imported inputs, and to prevent the
foreign-exchange crisis from driving living standards to intolerably low
levels. We also need further relief on debt service (principal and interest)
this year. We stand by our debts, and will be able to service them in full,
but only if our reforms are given the chance to take hold.
Our programme is comprehensive, practical and tough. But it must bring
results as soon as is possible. This means that it must choke off inflation
while sustaining a reasonable standard of living. We can then succeed with
the critical tasks of privatisation and structural change, which are already
in motion.
Russia's economic policies for stabilisation and market reform are rapidly
coming into place. If the west wants to help us, now is the time.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: Premiums for life salesmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOB GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fear your article 'Increased share of premiums for life salesmen'
(February 26) may have had the effect of misleading some of your readers.
The story correctly draws the distinction between independent financial
advisers and agents who are tied to individual insurance companies.
However, the Lautro survey on which you were reporting clearly distinguishes
between organisations with a separate mainstream business (such as building
societies) who are tied to one insurance company, and individual company
representatives, such as a life office's full-time direct sales force - who
are often described as life salesmen and saleswomen.
Lautro's survey expressly excluded any data relating to company
representatives.
To refer to staff in offices such as building societies or estate agents as
'life salesmen' is not accurate, and could well confuse the reader.
The matter concerns me because direct sales forces invariably tend to
receive considerably less commission than that paid to both tied agents and
independent financial advisers, and it would be unfortunate if your article
failed to make itself clearly understood in that respect.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: IMF still has critical role to play in structural
adjustment programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LAURENCE COCKCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's article on the current and future role of the
International Monetary Fund ('Capitalist tool in need of sharpening',
February 26), cannot pass without challenge.
Mr Prowse argues that the fund's future role in designing structural
adjustment programmes could well be taken on by private sector consultancies
such as Sachs &amp; Associates or the Emerging Markets Corporation. Programmes
designed by such consulting companies - if given an imprimatur by an
impartial body - could 'unlock a flood of private sector capital'. This
would free the fund to concentrate on its true function of 'running the
world monetary system' - and financing short term balance of trade deficits.
This suggestion is singularly misconceived in relation to most of the
world's poorest economies and particularly those in Africa and the smaller
low-income countries of Asia and Latin America.
Economies in this category (that is, the majority) which have adopted
IMF-sponsored adjustment programmes are not experiencing a significant
increase in private-sector lending or investment even following a direct
injection of IMF funds - generally a means to leverage donors' funds and not
market funds.
In Africa as a whole, according to figures from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, total net private sector flows in
1990 (direct investment plus market lending) totalled Dollars 2.6bn out of
total flows of Dollars 32bn; in the smaller countries of low income Asia it
totalled Dollars 1.4bn out of total flows of Dollars 15bn.
No consultancy company will succeed in persuading multinational companies -
the main source of foreign direct investment  - to invest or lend equivalent
sums to those of the IMF (say Dollars 100m in one commitment) in or to
countries such as Tanzania, or even Zimbabwe.
The facts are that the costs of adjustment are high, the outcome uncertain,
and the international economic climate hostile. The Bretton Woods
institutions have a continuing critical role to play - and the fact that
they are fallible, poorly co-ordinated and should probably be merged does
not suggest that international private capital can conceivably replace their
function in low-income countries.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Book Review: What a pity about the city - A New London By
Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A New London By Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher Penguin Pounds 8.99
To judge by the activities of the Paul Hamlyn Fund and the Labour party's
arts spokesman, Mr Mark Fisher, the general election turns upon rival policy
prescriptions for London.
This is the second London book inside a year to bear the stamp of the fund -
a private donation by Mr Hamlyn to the shadow arts ministry for policy
research - the red rose and Mr Fisher. Given that on this occasion Mr
Fisher's co-author is Richard Rogers, an architect of genius, the latest
offering has a strong claim to attention.
In reality, it is hardly a joint work. Pressures from Rogers' practice - he
is best known for the Pompidou Centre in Paris and London's Lloyd's building
 -frustrated an intended unitary structure. Instead, we have the Fisher
building and the Rogers wing.
The Rogers thesis is that Europe is witnessing the rebirth of the city
state. Urban planning policies have shifted from population dispersal
towards more intense but ecologically sustainable concentrations.
Rogers is the prophet of this new city. He doesn't just like squares, he
finds that 'scarcely any pleasure compares' with them. The disfiguring of
Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square into 'just two more jammed
roundabouts' causes him pain. For Rogers, the motor vehicle is driving us
all towards a 'traffic-dominated, segregated, non-place, unjust city'.
Leaping in one undebated bound from effect to cause, he notes that London,
having once enjoyed 'the first modern, democratic metropolitan government in
Europe' (the London County Council), is now Europe's only capital without an
elected overall government. London, he says, 'needs a co-ordinated,
interventionist policy'.
The favoured overseas model is Paris. Not only does Paris have overarching
government, it has architectural grands projets by the dozen, and public
architectural competitions as a matter of course. I M Pei's glass pyramid
outside the Louvre is hailed as a masterstroke both of self-confidence and
internationalism.
Alongside Rogers' bold strokes, Fisher's manifesto prose flags. He develops
the case for making the revitalisation of the Thames London's grand projet
for the 1990s, an idea with which no Londoner could disagree. The fact that
the river remains so inaccessible to pedestrians at so many points in its
swaggering course, not least through the City, is indeed a serious planning
failure.
Fisher also attacks the cash-primed laisser faire of Docklands, whose
ill-designed transport system is another primer in how-not-to-do-it. After
visiting some of London's more desperate council estates, he praises
re-furbishment based upon close community consultation.
The argument that binds, or should bind, the two parts of the book together
is the critique of the capital's planning processes. Here, however, the
reader will be disappointed.
It is not at all clear what is proposed. Rogers speaks of transferring
powers from the London boroughs to 'a number of boards' made up of
councillors, specialists and 'lay citizens', a category in which he
includes, bizarrely, architectural journalists. There's a whiff of the
professional's secret garden in his arguments about aesthetics.
Fisher trots out the party line - a lightweight city-wide authority in
charge of strategic planning, public transport and promotion. As with
Labour's other constitutional reforms, the devil is in the detail of precise
powers, boundaries and ripple effects; such detail is evaded.
Not that any Londoner, indeed any citizen in a democracy, would deny the
desirability of 'strong political leadership' such as the authors admire in
the reconstruction of Barcelona. But how to get it? London has had, in many
of its boroughs, decades of single-party government; is that strong? When it
had a Greater London Council, that body did go in and out with the political
tide, but was that strong?
Fisher notes that the period 1965 to 1986 was the only time in London's
history when the capital had a strategic, metropolitan planning body. This
was hardly London's golden age of planning and transport policy. Indeed, it
was the period when the de-industrialisation of the Thames made that
particular grand projet do-able, but left it undone.
Londoners, however, will mostly rejoice at the spirit of this book. Of
course we should have competitive airports, a voice for London and a
government which sets an architectural example in its own building projects,
making more use of architectural competitions along the way. Personally,
I'll also sign the petition for Rogers' 'linear park' from Westminster to
Blackfriars, not to mention the wonderful idea of excluding traffic from the
north side of Trafalgar Square and so creating a great, pedestrianised apron
between the National Gallery and the square.
We need, however, to remember that London's political realities are more
complex than here allowed. If reformers misjudge them, history shows that
debilitation or paralysis will ensue.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Future of tax reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN NORMAN Lamont rises to deliver his budget next Tuesday, he will also
shape the election campaign. For what he says will tell the electorate far
more about his party's vision of the future than about the immediate
economic prospects of the UK.
On the role of public spending, Mr Lamont is, unfortunately, sure to be
silent. Nor can he respond to informed public discussion of medium-term
fiscal options. Not only does the British chancellor continue to purvey two
half budgets a year, but he also disappears into 'purdah' prior to the great
day. While Mr Lamont has been more flirtatious than usual, electioneering,
not more informed public discussion, has been his motive.
The British tax system faithfully reflects the lack of coherent public
debate and the partisan politics that surround it. It is why, for example,
the focus is on the basic rate of income tax. Yet this is much ado about
nothing. Not only does income tax generate only a quarter of public revenue,
but the basic rate of 25 per cent is among the least distorting taxes in the
entire system.
Mr Lamont should try to rise above the limitations of British budgetary
theatre. He should do more than offer a few electoral bribes. What is needed
is an agenda for reform.
Impractical commitment
For reform is still needed. Mr Lamont should, for example, admit that Nigel
Lawson's commitment to a comprehensive income tax was impractical. It has,
in any case, not happened. The drift has been in the direction of taxation
of expenditure. That development can be taken further, if not through a
comprehensive expenditure tax, at least through the extension of the assets
included in personal equity plans. Meanwhile, the tax deductibility of
mortgage interest must, on no account, be raised in order to 'kick start'
the housing market.
A fully fledged system for the taxation of expenditure would fit with the
abolition of capital gains tax, a tax that is largely voluntary and also
entails double taxation of retained earnings. But such a change would be
unacceptable without reform of inheritance taxation. The ideal here would
not be its abolition, but rather the taxation of large receipts, whether as
gifts or bequests.
Treatment of inflation remains anomalous. Capital gains are index-linked,
but that is true of neither depreciation nor interest income. The former
defect is important in the corporation tax. The failure to provide adequate
depreciation allowances creates a further bias against investment.
Integrated system
Then there is integration of taxation, national insurance and social
benefits. National insurance, for example, generates almost two-thirds as
much as income tax. Yet the tax bears no relation to individual
entitlements. What it does do is allow the government to focus on the 25 per
cent basic rate of tax, while ignoring the 34 per cent marginal tax on those
earning less than Pounds 20,280 per year (42.6 per cent if employers'
contributions are taken into account, as they should be).
No less troubling is zero-rating of VAT on clothing, food, fuels and fares.
Complete abolition could raise as much as Pounds 12bn. If the proceeds were
used to fund additional welfare benefits and lower tax rates, the result
could still be substantially more progressive than at present. It can never
be said too often that subsidising particular goods is never the best way to
help the poor.
If this does not provide Mr Lamont with an adequate agenda, he can go green.
How, for example, should he respond to the car industry's bleats about car
tax? He should abolish it, making up the difference by increasing taxation
of petrol. An increase in the latter of at least 10 per cent would do it.
Nobody expects an ideal tax system; but the chancellor should propose one
that is more coherent than the UK's. Everybody expects political debating
points; but the chancellor should recognise the importance of fiscal
stability. Few expect a complete philosophy of fiscal reform, but Mr Lamont
can do far better than a penny or two off the basic rate, increased mortgage
interest deductions, and tax deductibility for Norland Nannies.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: Margaret Price - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The years continue to pass without Margaret Price receiving the royal honour
that is her due. It may be that the criteria by which these decisions are
made cannot be divulged, but it is starting to look as though a career
largely furthered and celebrated across Europe is no substitute for a more
insular popularity at home.
On Friday the singer was in London for a recital at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall. The programme was all German song, Schumann and Brahms, and it only
served to emphasise what a European artist Miss Price has become, for there
are not many native German-speakers who sing Lieder as eloquently at the
moment; and there have been precious few British singers to equal her in
this field at any time.
In Schumann's Kerner Lieder, Op. 35, never much loved by audiences for their
heavyweight Teutonic romanticism, she came up against memories of past
London interpreters such as Hermann Prey and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and
radiated a beauty over the music that the others could not match. The songs
were taken slowly and, as is her inclination, in too deliberate a manner.
But the audience was held.
Above all, one felt for the first time that the songs made sense as a cycle.
The feeling of a sun-lit warmth of emotion, at first starting to melt the
chill ending of 'Frage' and then flooding out through 'Stille Tranen', was
gloriously handled, both by the soprano and her accompanist, Graham Johnson.
This is the way to catch the music's heartbeat and the performance made a
deeply moving descent down to the numbed desperation of the ending.
In her Brahms - a selection of eight Volkslieder and the Zigeunerlieder, Op.
103 - lighter moods predominated. A delicious sentimentality for 'Da unten
im Tale'; no false attempts at funny voices for the ever-popular
'Vergebliches Standchen'. And, always, the purity of the voice and unforced
utterance of the German poetry were there to give pleasure. For singing of
this quality no further recognition is perhaps necessary.
At the other end of the scale, just starting out on a career which one
trusts will live up to its initial promise, is the young soprano Alison
Buchanan. Still in her early 20s, she appeared on Thursday in the 'Young
Artists' lunchtime recital series at Covent Garden, coincidentally
accompanied by a young pianist, Eugene Asti, who has himself been working
with Margaret Price.
It was an enjoyable occasion, not maybe one to burn itself upon the memory,
but leaving a feeling of considerable optimism for the future. This is based
largely on the beauty and ease of Miss Buchanan's voice. Nothing in a quite
adventurous programme seemed to trouble her vocally at all. The tone is
attractively warm, beautifully lambent when she sings quietly, a voice born
of nature, not of artifice.
She sang her Debussy and Wolf songs with due care for style and language,
though not yet quite enough personality. Once into English-language songs by
Walton, Copland and Bolcom, the face lit up and so did the words. Her Cole
Porter encore about the little oyster was sheer delight: a delicious
lunchtime find]

Anyone who knows anything about food knows that one of the healthiest diets
is that of southern Italy: pasta, olive oil, fresh fruit and vegetables,
lots of fish, little meat and modest amounts of wine. My father-in-law
established this in 1945 when reviewing food supplies in occupied Europe. He
found that, despite the depredations following the Allies' northern advance,
the southern Italians were eating the healthiest diet. Nor was he the first.
Yet this fact is still regularly 'discovered'. Today Food File on C4
announces what 'experts now believe is the perfect diet'. Guess what? Well,
well, well ..
At 9.00 comes the first episode in Chances, yet another Australian soap
opera, but one which we are promised is 'steamy' and 'adult'. It is said
that the cast were required to sign 'nudity clauses', and when it began a

It tells the story of the Taylor family, beginning with a Dollars 3m lottery
win. Trouble is, you need a satellite dish to see it because it is on Sky

On Friday ITV began its six-part Fay Weldon serial Growing Rich, about three
girls from a small town in East Anglia and their involvement with the devil.
Tomorrow Channel 4 begins its adaptation of Mary Wesley's novel The Camomile
Lawn with a two-hour episode which will be followed by three more, each of
60 minutes, telling the story of three generations of a family, between 1939
and 1984. These are both 'prestige' productions, which is to say that well
known people are involved, they were expensive to create, the makers will
hope for fairly large audiences, the chattering classes are expected to
chatter, and there are good prospects of international sales.
Having watched three episodes of Growing Rich and the whole of The Camomile
Lawn I can report that both also offer a high level of entertainment. As we
have come to expect from Fay Weldon, certainly since Life And Loves Of A She
Devil and The Cloning Of Joanna May but, to some extent, even before that,
much of the pleasure comes from the combination of, and the contrast
between, television's familiar naturalism and frequent blasts of the
supernatural.
The devil, known as The Driver, is chauffeur to Sir Bernard Bellamy (John
Stride) the local Mr Big who, we suspect, must have some sort of Faustian
bargain in his background. Since the three girls fail their exams The Driver
seems their best bet for getting out of dreary Fenedge, though it is only
Carmen, the best looking of the trio, who really deals with him. When
thwarted he acts rather pettily, sending swarms of bees to chase the girls
and raising great geysers of fire in Carmen's kitchen. Even in a good mood
his tricks seem trivial: the head on a door knocker suddenly grows horns,
and when Carmen is trying on a revealing dress he enlarges her bust and
narrows her waist until she becomes a parody of the voluptuous female.
There are beautifully observed moments, as in this week's episode when the
girls go to Sir Bernard's new hotel for job interviews and enter through the
front door. Snooty Mrs Haverill, the housekeeper, tells them to use the
staff entrance, but Carmen, who noticed Sir Bernard ogling her at the school
prize giving, flounces over to a chair and flops down, hoisting her skirt to
reveal a lot of leg to Sir B. The short scene that follows, between these
three and Sir B's Sloane Ranger fiancee, provides a guided tour of the
English class system in about 90 seconds.
There are other pleasures. Martin Kemp who plays The Driver tends to deliver
his lines as though he has just learned them, a trait which, if deliberate,
is baffling in its intention, but, that aside, the acting is as consistently
splendid as we now expect in all of Britain's television drama. We seems to
have a bottomless supply of wonderful young actresses, and the three girls
here are played by three more virtual unknowns (Rosalind Bennett as Carmen,
Claire Hackett as Annie, and Caroline Harker as Laura) who not only give
good performances individually, but are also completely convincing as one of
those irritating schoolgirl trios that you find in bus queues, talking in
code and oblivious to the rest of the world. Moreover the series is
continually good to look at, especially in those sections shot in New
Zealand where we follow what happens to Annie.
Having said all that, is this anything more than a rather fancy woman's
magazine story? Given that one of the central characters is the devil, does
it have anything to tell us about good and evil? The narrative is
entertaining enough; at least we seem to have left behind those dreary
dramas of the 1960s and '70s whose makers appeared to regard story telling
as beneath their dignity. But beyond the obvious storyline of Growing Rich
is there any sort of comment about what it means to be human in 1992? This
week it becomes clear that whereas Carmen's brother is assumed by his
parents to need an education she is expected to get through life on her
looks. This could lead to interesting thoughts about the luck of pretty
girls who can choose looks or work as a means of advancement while boys are
limited to work - but instead we are left with the familiar tang of feminist
dogma.
Whatever the quality of Mary Wesley's novel, Channel 4's dramatisation of
The Camomile Lawn puts you in mind of an up-market version of one of those
Andrea Newman serials in which the main concern, in the end, is how many
more sexual pairings can be arranged without credibility disappearing
entirely. Will Polly sleep with both the twins? Simultaneously? Will it be
Oliver or Tony for whom Calypso first removes her camiknickers? The story is
of a family, consisting largely of cousins, who meet as usual for a summer
holiday in Cornwall in 1939 at the house with the camomile lawn planted by
Aunt Helena (Felicity Kendal). Many of the younger characters then join the
armed forces and most of the rest of the action takes place in London during
the second world war. It is compelling, almost addictive stuff: after the
first hour or so you really do want to know what happens next to these
people  - Coronation Street for Volvo drivers.
After the last 25 years of British television drama it would, I suppose, be
quite impossible now to produce anything set in the 1940s which did not
feature scrupulously authentic steam trains, vintage motors, enamel
hoardings for Players Navy Cut, and Fair Isle pullovers. They are here in
the usual quantities, and, under Peter Hall's direction, it was found
necessary to fit anti-shatter tape on the windows of not just one house but
an entire terrace, so that those white diamonds could be seen in the
background of tracking shots. Would that the same dedication had gone into
illustrating the way in which the war altered people.
True, the bonk rate gets very high, with affairs arranged rather as they are
in the cricket World Cup so that everyone is eventually paired with everyone
else. There is not merely the usual bonking in the bedroom but also bonking
on the train, bonking on the sofa, bonking in the front hall and even
bonking on the camomile. This makes it much more fun than the usual war
story in which people are forever being sickeningly violent, but there is
precious little attempt to move beyond the exigencies of the plot to make
any sort of observation about war or ageing or love or marriage, even though
these are the threads on which the tapestry is supposed to be woven.
There are interesting twists: Calypso marries for money, but falls in love
with her husband; generations of girls discover that good old Uncle Richard
has been putting his hand up their skirts but conclude this isn't 'terrible'
as one says but boring; and it turns out that even concentration camp
survivors can be rather unpleasant people. But without crying out for the
over-arching human understanding of a Tolstoy, one is surely entitled to
expect something more than such little twists after five hours of drama. It
is entertaining, it really is, both these serials are, but we know that
television is capable of more.
Once again the lit. crit. brigade will smile pityingly and say that mere
television can never explore the human mind nor illustrate the human
condition with the subtlety, expressiveness, or precision of print. But
those of us who watched Dennis Potter's Singing Detective know that
television can, indeed, penetrate and map that internal landscape of the
mind which was once sole territory of the novel. And anyone who saw the
whole of Kieslowski's marvellous Ten Commandments realises that television
can talk to us with tremendous power about the human condition.
Growing Rich and The Camomile Lawn are two highly entertaining serials but
it is surely not unreasonable to ask for a little more ambition from
television drama departments.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: PCBs under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plant enzymes offer a new prospect for getting rid of toxic polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), which are some of the most pernicious pollutants made by
man.
Several million kilogrammes of PCBs have been released into the environment
over the last few decades, through a wide range of industrial activities
from solvent recovery to hydraulic fluid manufacturing. They are so toxic
that land contaminated by them is unsuited for any other activity - even
landfill.
PCBs are chemically very stable organo-chlorine compounds. The conventional
method of getting rid of them is high-temperature incineration, an expensive
process (costing Pounds 2,000 per tonne of soil) which may itself give rise
to toxic fumes.
As a cheaper and safer alternative, scientists hope to exploit biotechnology
to detoxify PCBs.
A technique developed by Plant Science Limited (PSL), a company based at
Sheffield University in the north of England, uses novel peroxidase enzymes
derived from plant cell cultures. The effect of the enzymes is to polymerise
the PCBs; the individual molecules are linked together into a non-toxic
polymer which can be filtered off and disposed of by burial or incineration.
General Electric of the US is pioneering a different approach to clean up
the Hudson River in New York, which has been contaminated by its
manufacturing operations. It uses live bacteria to break down PCBs.
But Mike Fowler, PSL research director, says enzymes are a 'cleaner and more
surgical approach' - and a much better commercial prospect. 'One of the
beauties of using enzymes rather than micro-organisms is that peroxidases
are stable in the presence of solvents which might kill micro-organisms,' he
says.
PSL is collaborating with Graesser-Biotechna, a London company specialising
in anti-pollution technologies, to commercialise the enzyme-based process. A
field trial is planned for later this year.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Heads down - Who is
responsible for the pollution caused by abandoned mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pollution from the Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall - where 80m gallons of
water contaminated with toxic metals spewed into the River Carnon for
several weeks - has highlighted the environmental problems caused by
abandoned mines.
The National Rivers Authority, the UK's pollution watchdog for rivers, is
worried about the dozens of abandoned coal mines where rising waters in the
old workings are polluting rivers in South Wales and Yorkshire.
The NRA says that in Yorkshire there are 36 significant discharges from
disused coal workings causing serious pollution to 40 kilometres of river.
The capital cost of treating the 10 most serious discharges in Yorkshire is
estimated to be more than Pounds 10m. In addition, there would be
substantial operating costs. The question of who pays 'remains to be
determined' says the NRA.
Pollution at Wheal Jane turned the river and the estuary leading up to
Falmouth a rusty red, halting water sports and endangering oyster beds and
fish.
The NRA has been carrying out the clean-up and working on long-term
solutions for preventing a recurrence. The cost of these operations is
expected to be in excess of Pounds 1m - some estimates put it at Pounds 3m.
Although the NRA works on the principle that 'the polluter pays', it seems
impossible to apply it in incidents of this kind.
The Water Resources Act of 1991 says that those responsible for polluting
rivers can be prosecuted and the NRA can recover from the polluter the costs
of cleaning up.
But abandoned mines are specifically exempted from the clause. The
Department of the Environment says that this is because many of them are so
ancient that it would be impossible to discover the original owners.
There is also the difficulty in proving that the water comes from a specific
mine. These areas are usually riddled with old workings and the flood waters
may mingle to come out at one point.
Environmentalists are pressing for the law to be changed and companies which
abandon mines made liable for pollution from them. Liana Stupples, water
campaigner for Friends of the Earth, says there is a 'yawning gap' in the
law.
Such a change would make life difficult for British Coal. It would mean a
heavy financial liability which could deter investors if, as promised,
British Coal is privatised by a Conservative administration after the
upcoming general election.
As long ago as 1981 the Royal Commission on Coal and the Environment, the
Flowers Report, recommended that the costs of remedial action for existing
mines abandoned by the National Coal Board (the predecessor of British Coal)
be met by central government. But it said that the costs of pollution from
any coal mines abandoned in the future should be met by the Coal Board.
The all-party Welsh Affairs Committee of the House of Commons has just
started a new investigation into the problem in South Wales where more than
a dozen abandoned coal mines are causing pollution. The Welsh Region of the
National Rivers Authority is carrying out a two-year study costing Pounds
100,000 which is funded jointly with the BOC Foundation for the Environment
and Community.
It will examine the River Pelena in West Glamorgan, the main tributary of
the River Afan which flows into Swansea Bay at Port Talbot. The aim is to
find 'the best and most simple way of preventing the polluted water from
killing our rivers'.
David Walker, the NRA's environment and quality manager for Wales, says that
acidic discharges from old coal mines contain high concentrations of
dissolved iron.
'A clear stream can turn a vivid orange and the bed coated with iron oxides
stifling life and rendering it almost fishless,' he says.
Gareth Wardell, Labour MP for Gower and chairman of the Welsh Affairs
Committee, said the situation is 'very, very bad' and that the pollution
could change the entire ecology along the rivers. 'There is no doubt that
the law has to be changed,' he said.
The foundation, established by BOC with Pounds 1m to help clean up
pollution, is also sponsoring research into coal mine pollution on the
Little Don river near Sheffield.
There have been numerous public complaints and trout have been killed in
some Yorkshire rivers. The problem is most severe in the River Calder near
Tormoden, in the Don and Little Don near Sheffield and the Rother and its
tributaries near Chesterfield.
At the Wheal Jane abandoned tin mine the polluted water has been controlled
and is being pumped out into a dam for treatment. So far the NRA has spent
Pounds 100,000 containing the incident.
Carnon Consolidated, which bought the mine from RTZ in a management buyout,
made a loss in 1990 but broke even in 1991. It is not in a position to pay
big bills and, in any event, denies liability.
There are about 50 other old tin mines in the Carnon Valley area and water
from them could have come out through the Wheal Jane outlet.
'I do not feel we should pay for the clean up,' says Kevin Ross, managing
director of Carnon Consolidated. 'I do not accept that we are responsible
for a history which has left us with all the other old tin mines. We are not
flush with cash but we will do whatever is within our capacity to help.'
Peter Maxted, local spokesman for Friends of the Earth, says the flooding at
Wheal Jane was a tragic accident which should never have happened. FoE and
other local organisations are pressing for a public inquiry.
'It is very frightening,' said Doris Ansari, Truro's Liberal Democrat
councillor on Cornwall County Council. 'We do not know what the long-term
effects will be.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Clear skies through long-term
vision - Tokyo's example / Urban air pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSS may not gather on rolling stones but it is growing in Tokyo's parks
again. When scientists at Tokyo's Metropolitan Research Institute for
Environmental Protection looked for this essential component of Japanese
gardens 20 years ago, they found none.
Following drastic cuts in sulphur dioxide levels in Tokyo air since the last
survey, the fuzzy green stuff is once again gracing trees throughout the
city. The density of sulphur dioxide, one of worst air pollutants, is less
than an eighth of its 1966 peak. 'In Tokyo we have virtually solved the
problem,' says Noburu Yoshino, chief of automobile pollution with the Tokyo
metropolitan government.
None the less, the levels of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone
remain unacceptably high. Walking on the pavement of a congested Tokyo
street is more pleasant than in London, for example, but no one ought to
breathe too deeply.
Tokyo's air pollution crisis was a product of the density of population and
industrial plant in the Tokyo area combined with the breakneck pace of
economic development during the 1960s. Japan was determined to put post-war
poverty behind, and industrial growth was pursued with little regard for
side effects, such as environmental degradation.
By the late 1960s, however, a public backlash had gathered strength at a
time when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was losing electoral support.
A consensus developed that something had to be done.
The first target was sulphur emissions, caused primarily by industry. In
1970 the government announced a drastic reduction in the level of sulphur
permitted in fuel. The new limit was 0.5 per cent, compared with three to
four per cent in imported crude oil.
The government's next target was carbon monoxide, an important component of
automobile exhaust. The Japanese government required that all new cars sold
in Japan from 1975 be fitted with catalytic converters. The devices removed
95 per cent of carbon monoxide from exhaust.
Use of catalytic converters also led to the gradual introduction of
lead-free petrol, since lead fouls the catalyst. Nearly 100 per cent of
petrol sold in Japan is now unleaded. Although reducing atmospheric lead was
never a principal goal, this has been a welcome side effect.
Sulphur and carbon monoxide, however, were the easy steps. From here the
going will be considerably tougher.
Suspended particulate matter: The concentration of suspended particulate
matter (mainly dust and soot) in the air fell sharply in the late 1970s, but
has since remained high. The initial decline was a result in part of
switching from heavy fuel oil to gas oil and natural gas. In addition, the
government required electrostatic precipitators to be installed on
smokestacks where particulate matter is a problem.
Further progress will be difficult and expensive. Yoshino says that 30 per
cent of the problem is from nature, and cannot be controlled. Another 30 per
cent of particulate matter is generated by chemical reactions of other
pollutants, such as nitrogen and sulphuric acids. Some 20 to 30 per cent of
the total is caused by the carbon particles from diesel fuel.
NOx: The level of nitrogen oxides in Tokyo's air has remained stubbornly
high since the late 1960s. While the government has fixed a target of
reducing NOx by 50 per cent in 10 years, it has no concrete method of
achieving this. 'We are depending on a technological breakthrough,' says
Yoshino. This could be a new catalyst, which car companies the world over
are researching, use of methanol engines or electrically-powered cars.
Ozone: Photochemical oxidants, experienced as urban smog, are also an
enduring problem that is occasionally severe enough for the city government
to order some plants to cease operating.
Barring an unforeseen technical breakthrough, significant progress on
particulate matter, NOx and ozone is difficult to imagine without a
reduction in the activities, particularly automobile traffic, that cause
them. For Tokyo, however, this is especially hard to engineer. The city
already has superb public transportation, so there is little hope of coaxing
more commuters out of cars by offering a better alternative.
Road pricing schemes look especially hard to implement because traffic
congestion is spread over a huge area, rather than in the centre of the
city. Much of the diesel fuel is also consumed by delivery trucks, which are
the economic lifeline of the city.
Further progress is likely to come slowly, if at all. In the meantime, city
residents can console themselves that at least the moss does not seem to
mind.
Next week's article will focus on Athens.

FT  04 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Rates swap case goes to Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KLEINWORT BENSON LTD v CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL. BARCLAYS BANK PLC v
CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court):
Mr Justice Hirst: February 27 1992
A CLAIM against a person domiciled in Scotland for restitution of monies
paid under a contract which is null and void, cannot be heard by English
courts in that it is not a 'matter relating to a contract' within the
meaning of the 1968 Brussels Convention, and does not come within any of the
matters giving rise to a special jurisdiction to hear the case other than in
that part of the UK in which the defendant is domiciled.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when giving judgment for the defendant, the City of
Glasgow District Council, on its applications to dismiss actions brought
against it by the plaintiff banks, Kleinwort Benson Limited and Barclays
Bank plc, for lack of jurisdiction.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Glasgow was sued in two separate actions by Barclays
and Kleinwort Benson for Pounds 389,431 and Pounds 807,230 respectively, in
relation to sums paid under interest rate swap agreements.
Following on the House of Lords decision in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham
(1991) 2 WLR 372 that all such transactions were outside the powers of the
local authorities and void ab initio (from the beginning), the banks claimed
return of the sums on a restitutionary basis.
On the present summonses, Glasgow sought declarations that the court had no
jurisdiction over it in respect of the claims, and asked that the actions be
dismissed.
The two actions came within the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968
(the Brussels Convention), which concerned 'civil and commercial matters'.
Article 2 of Schedule 4 to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982
provided that persons domiciled in a part of the UK should be sued in the
courts of that part.
On the face of it, Glasgow must be sued in Scotland. The banks could only
sue in England if they could bring themselves within the special
jurisdiction laid down in articles 5 and 6 of Schedule 4.
Article 5(1) provided that a person domiciled in part of the UK might be
sued in another part 'in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for
the place of performance of the obligation in question'.
Mr Tecks for Glasgow submitted that as the House of Lords had ruled there
was no contract, the restitutionary claims could not be classified as
'matters relating to a contract'.
Mr Beazley submitted that the claims did concern matters relating to a
contract, since the court was determining the consequences of nullity of the
contracts.
He relied inter alia on article 10(1) of the 1980 Rome Convention on the Law
applicable to Contractual Obligations, which provided that the law
applicable to a contract should govern '(e) the consequences of nullity of
the contract'.
The House of Lords having held that the swap transactions were void ab
initio, the suggestion that the restitutionary claims were matters relating
to a contract, placed a severe strain on the language of article 5(1).
There was nothing in the cases to support such a conclusion (see Peters v
ZNAV (1983) ECR 987 and Arcado v Haviland (1988) 3 ECR 1539). They were
consistent with a proposition by Mr Tecks for Glasgow that there must be
either a contractual relationship giving rise to actual contractual
obligations, or a consensual obligation similar to contract giving rise to a
comparable obligation, for the case to fall within article 5(1).
So far as the Rome Convention was concerned, it was legitimate and
appropriate to take its provisions into account in construing article 5(1).
However, it could not properly be treated as determinative of the
construction of article 5(1). Moreover, the court was entitled in construing
Schedule 4, to take into account the fact that the UK had derogated from the
Rome Convention by excluding article 10(1)(e) from UK law.
The banks failed to bring themselves within article 5(1).
Article 5(3) of Schedule 4 provided that a person domiciled in a part of the
UK might be sued in another part 'in matters relating to tort, delict or
quasi-delict, in the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred .
. .'
In Kalfelis v Schroder (1988) ECR 5565, in paragraphs 17 and 18 of its
decision, the European Court said that matters relating to tort, delict or
quasi-delict within article 5(3) covered 'all actions which seek to
establish the liability of a defendant and which are not related to a
contract within the meaning of article 5(1)'.
In paragraph 19 it said 'a court which has jurisdiction under article 5(3)
over an action based on tort or delict 'does not have jurisdiction over that
action in so far as it is not so based'. And in paragraph 20 it said 'a
plaintiff is always entitled to bring his action in its entirety before the
courts for the domicil of the defendant'.
Mr Beazley submitted that paragraphs 17 and 18 were conclusive in his
favour. He said article 5(1) and (3) were to be construed as mutually
exclusive but as all-embracing so far as actions to establish the
defendants' 'liability' were concerned (apart from article 5(1) cases, and
provided that the harmful event occurred in the relevant jurisdiction).
That interpretation of Kalfelis was not accepted.
The judgment must be read as a whole. Paragraphs 19 and 20 were completely
inconsistent with Mr Beazley's construction. If he were right article 5(3)
would become a 'catch-all' provision and liability not based on tort, delict
or quasi-delict would fall within it, notwithstanding the explicit statement
to the contrary in paragraph 19.
The word 'liability' in paragraphs 17 and 18 must be interpreted as
connoting liability within the scope of the article 5(3) categories, that
is, in tort, delict or quasi-delict.
The banks failed to bring their case within article 5(3).
Article 6(1) of Schedule 4 provided that a person domiciled in part of the
UK might be sued in another part 'where he is one of a number of defendants,
in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled'.
In Kalfelis, the European Court said article 6(1) applied where it was
'expedient' to hear the actions together 'to avoid the risk of
irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings'.
In the rate swap litigation, there was a very large number of separate
actions, in all of which banks were plaintiffs and in nearly all of which
English local authorities were defendants.
They were not combined in a single trial, but were regulated by court order
so that certain cases should be lead actions, and the others stayed.
As at present, there would be two separate lead action trials. Selection of
the lead cases aimed to ensure that the majority of the points of law in
issue in all the cases were authoritatively decided, and it was hoped that
clear guidance would be given to the remaining cases, leading to settlements
and avoidance of multiplicity of litigation.
The lead cases were not strictly test cases. There might well be individual
issues arising in some of the other cases that would still need to be
litigated.
The court was not satisfied that there was a risk of irreconcilable
decisions.
There was no question of conflicting decisions on the common issues of fact.
So far as issues of law were concerned it was almost inevitable that those
cases, in view of the very difficult legal problems and the very large sums
of money at stake, would proceed in the end to the highest court. Thus, even
if there were a prospect of irreconcilable decisions at first instance or on
appeal, the House of Lords would be able to give one single decision which
would be binding in both England and Scotland, with no possibility of
irreconcilability.
The banks failed to bring themselves within article 6(1).
Article 5(8)(b) of Schedule 4 provided that a person domiciled in part of
the UK might be sued in another part, in proceedings to assert rights in
moveable property, 'in the courts of the part . . . in which the property is
situated'.
To come within that paragraph Mr Beazley must have an arguable case that the
property the banks sought to trace was situated in England.
Glasgow's evidence was that it held its funds with a Scottish bank in
Glasgow.
The court accepted that evidence. There was no arguable case that the monies
sought to be traced were now situated in England.
The banks were unable to bring themselves within article 5(8).
The banks having failed to bring themselves within any of the special
jurisdictions laid down in articles 5 or 6, article 2 prevailed. Glasgow
must be sued in its court of domicil, in Scotland.
For the banks: Thomas Beazley (Clifford Chance, and Linklaters &amp; Paines).
For Glasgow: Jonathan Tecks (William Sturges &amp; Co).

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM support for talks' resumption -
Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday welcomed the decision of
Northern Ireland politicians to restart talks with the government, saying it
showed that the people of the province would 'not be bullied by guns, by
bombs or by any other form of intimidation'.
His remarks came the day after a fresh meeting between Ulster's main party
leaders and Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary.
Mr Peter Bottomley (C Eltham), a former Northern Ireland minister, urged Mr
Major to 'send a message to the Provisional IRA and the 'disloyalists' that
the mindless, aimless use of bullets and bombs will not be as successful as
parliamentary debates and normal political campaigning'.
Mr Major replied: 'The whole House will share your view on that latter
matter.
'I warmly welcome the decision of the Northern Ireland political leaders to
start their talks again. It does give a clear and very welcome signal to all
the people in Northern Ireland of their determination to find a political
solution. That is very much needed.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems call for poll tax 'loan' -
Local authority finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for the Budget to include an interest-free loan from government to
local councils to pay for the poll tax 'non-payment surcharge' was made
yesterday by Mr David Bellotti, the Liberal Democrats' local government
spokesman.
Mr Bellotti said that the Pounds 300m loan would cost only the interest
charge, estimated at Pounds 30m, because the principal would be recovered as
councils pursued those who had not paid.
The party will launch today its 'shadow Budget' or two-year recovery
programme under the slogan 'Turning Britain Round'.
Though final figures have yet to be approved by full councils, provisional
surcharges in a number of urban areas such as Manchester, Leicester, Reading
and Rochdale are likely to be at or about Pounds 50.
Mr Bellotti said it was unacceptable for poll tax payers to have to be
charged more because of those who did not pay, and that it was fairer for
the cost to be borne by the taxpayer.
He added that he did not believe the Conservatives would gain from any delay
in sending out bills, because people already blamed the government for the
poll tax and knew they were going to receive the bills eventually.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, dismissed the proposal
as 'setting up a government bank to bail out authorities which have been
least effective in their efforts to collect the community charge.'
Ministers are sceptical about the need for councils to set large other
adjustments figures.
Liberal Democrats committed themselves yesterday to a Pounds 675m package of
help for childcare. Most would be spent on guaranteeing pre-school education
for all children aged three and four.
A further Pounds 100m would be for tax-free childcare vouchers and Pounds
50m for local authorities to boost childcare provision.
The party is also pledged to increasing child benefit by Pounds 1 a week per
child in 1992-93 at a cost of Pounds 640m.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt fine-tunes council proposals -
Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINOR CHANGES to the government's proposals for reform of the structure of
local government in Wales were announced yesterday.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said he planned to replace the existing
eight county councils and 37 district councils, with 23 unitary authorities.
Mr Hunt had originally planned for 19 unitary authorities, before
consultations with local authorities in Wales.
Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham, the biggest centres of population,
would become all-purpose authorities in the plan for ending the present
two-tier structure. Pembrokeshire, Montgomeryshire, Merionethshire and
Anglesey, all of which disappeared from the local government map in the 1974
reorganisation, are among the old counties which will be restored.
Mr Barry Jones, shadow Welsh secretary, dismissed the proposals as an
electoral diversion which would fail to prevent the return of a Labour
government committed to establishing a Welsh assembly and a larger number of
unitary authorities.
The proposals were welcomed by Mr Geraint Howells, Liberal Democrat MP for
Ceredigion and Pembroke North, but attacked by Mr Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru
MP for Caernarfon, who insisted that an elected Welsh parliament should have
the review of local government as its first remit.
Mr Hunt maintained that there was not a consensus for a Welsh assembly, and
recalled that when Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, opposed its creation
in 1979 he warned that it would lead to greater centralisation. The minister
said his proposals would return more power to people in local communities
without adding to the cost of local government.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): City plans campaign to attract
Euro-bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to attract the proposed European Central Bank to London was
called for yesterday by the Corporation of the City of London and the
Labour-led Association of London Authorities.
The Corporation - the City's local authority  - is preparing to fund and
lead a campaign. Its common council will be asked later this month to make
Pounds 1m available.
The campaign will be looking to draw on the expertise of City institutions.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy resources
committee, said: 'We intend to run a positive campaign stressing the
advantages of London, particularly the ready access to its financial
markets. We are not seeking to run down the likes of Frankfurt.'
He recognised that it would be a 'highly political stance' for the City,
given the government's non-committal attitude to the single currency.
The ALA released a report by the Henley Centre for Forecasting which
suggested that Amsterdam has the edge as most-likely location for the bank
because of internal European Community politics.
The report said: 'London's claim for the European Central Bank is certainly
not helped by the apparent lack of keen support by the UK government for
monetary union.'
It said better marketing of London was needed if it was to succeed. It
added: 'London cannot afford to neglect the broader aspects of its offer,
especially its transport and environmental constituents.'
The City's stance, in particular, will add to pressure on the government to
make an early declaration of its determination not to invoke the British
opt-out clause agreed at the Maastricht summit. Labour is already pledged to
join the currency, provided Britain meets the agreed conditions.

FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Militant to seek CPSA leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUPPORTER of Militant Tendency is to seek the leadership of the CPSA,
Britain's biggest Civil Service union, after Mr John Ellis, the current
general secretary, yesterday secured a job with another organisation.
Mr John Macreadie, the deputy general secretary and a Militant supporter, is
thought to stand a chance of success. The favourite, however, will be Mr
Barry Reamsbottom, a candidate for the union's moderate faction.
Six years ago Mr Macreadie beat Mr Ellis in an election for the top job but
lost a second contest after voting irregularities were uncovered in the
first. Militant's influence in the CPSA has declined since then but Mr
Macreadie, aged 45, has a high profile as deputy general secretary.
If elected he would be expected to seek a more confrontational stance in the
124,000-strong union's negotiations with the Treasury.
In recent years the union's moderate leadership has steered through a series
of controversial changes - including acceptance of an element of performance
pay - which have been opposed by Militant supporters. There has been only
limited industrial action in the Civil Service in recent years compared with
the early 1980s.
Mr Ellis was yesterday chosen to succeed Mr Peter Jones, who is retiring in
June as general secretary of the Council for Civil Service Unions, the
representative body for these unions on certain common issues.
Mr Ellis was chosen in preference to the only other challenger, Mr Derek
Stobbs, assistant general secretary at the FDA union for top civil servants.
Mr Macreadie and Mr Reamsbottom are the only declared candidates in the CPSA
contest. It is possible, though unlikely, that Broad Left 84, a faction
which in political terms stands between the broad left and the moderates,
will put up a candidate.
Mr Reamsbottom, aged 43, is a national officer and editor of the CPSA's
monthly journal.
On the present CPSA executive, the moderates have 22 of the 28 seats and
Militant Tendency supporters three.
Control of the executive has in the past been volatile, however, and at
several stages in the mid to late 1980s Militant was in control.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Women staff fight pension age move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINETY-ONE women whose employer raised their pension age from 60 to 65
without their consent are being backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission
in a claim of unlawful sexual discrimination.
The women, who work for Avdel Systems, the industrial fasteners maker based
in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, had planned to retire at 60 on full
pension. They were told that unless they continued to work until they were
65 their pensions would be reduced by 4 per cent a year.
Equality of retirement ages has been required by UK law since the European
Court judgment in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange in 1986.
The Avdel case is the second to be financially supported by the EOC at an
industrial tribunal hearing. A similar, smaller case has reached the appeal
stage.
The EOC said that if the 91 women were successful an important legal point
could be made which might affect a substantial number of employers.
A recent survey by the National Association of Pension Funds found more than
60 per cent of employers had decided to raise the pension age of women
workers to 65 - the same age as men  - to comply with the Barber judgment.
The EOC believes that in many cases employers were actuarially reducing the
pensions of women who wanted to retire at 60. It thinks this could be
unlawful.
The similar case being supported by the EOC involves 30 clerical workers at
the Cameron Iron Works in Leeds. They argued at an industrial tribunal that
a reduced pension on retirement at 60 amounted to a worsening of their terms
of employment.
Avdel Systems said yesterday that the equalisation of pension ages was part
of a package of changes that were introduced in the best interests of the
pension scheme as a whole. These changes put men and women on an equal
footing without reducing the value of women members' benefits.
It said: 'The company denies that the changes were introduced at the expense
of working women and notes that the EOC admits it is unsure of the legal
position. The matter has now been lodged at a tribunal and we do not feel
that further public comment is helpful or proper.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Gotti aide tells court of Mafia secrets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US prosecutors hope to make more progress in the battle against organised
crime following revelations about the structure of the Mafia by a
top-ranking member of the Gambino family, the biggest crime 'family' in the
US.
The revelations came during testimony in the Brooklyn trial of Mr John
Gotti, the reputed Mafia head of the Gambino family, who is known as the
'Dapper Don'.
Mr Gotti, who has escaped conviction in three earlier trials, is accused of
ordering five murders, extortion, illegal gambling and obstruction of
justice. The most important of the murder charges concerns the 1985 shooting
of Mr Paul Castellano, the previous head of the Gambino crime family.
Mr Salvatore Gravano, who has been identified by US officials as Mr Gotti's
second-in-command, or consigliere, described in detail on Monday how he and
Mr Gotti spent 10 months planning the assassination of Mr Castellano.
Mr Gotti remained silent, with a tense smile, as his former lieutenant
described how he had been inducted into the Mafia in 1976 in a blood
ceremony and how by testifying he had broken the Mafia's traditional pledge
of omerta, or code of silence.
'John was the boss. I was the underboss. I helped John run the family,' Mr
Gravano explained, before describing a pattern of loan-sharking, armed
robberies and his own participation in 19 murders. US prosecutors have
agreed to reduce Mr Gravano's own prison sentence to 20 years in exchange
for his turning state's witness.
Not since the 1985-86 Palermo maxi-trial has a top-ranking Mafia insider in
the US or Italy broken the code of silence and provided law enforcement
officials with such a detailed portrait of how organised crime works.
Prosecutors also hope to make use of less public leads to further their
campaign against the Gambino and other US Mafia families, whose annual
revenues total billions of dollars.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the index of leading indicators and a jump in home sales
yesterday signalled that the early stages of a US economic recovery could be
under way.
The composite index of leading indicators rose 0.9 per cent in January to
register its first big rise since last July. Sales of new homes rose 12.9
per cent in January to an annual rate of 622,000, the highest level for
nearly two years.
Both indicators were considerably stronger than most analysts expected.
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, was again cautiously optimistic
in congressional testimony.
He pointed to a 'few hopeful signs' that the economy was reviving but warned
that prospects were still highly uncertain.
Rising share prices provided much of the impetus behind the recovery in
leading indicators. But the rise also reflected strength in orders for
plant, equipment and consumer goods, a rise in building permits, and faster
growth of the money supply.
Leading indicators for November and December were revised to show declines
of only 0.2 per cent in each month, rather than 0.3 per cent as previously
calculated.
Last year, the index of leading indicators began rising about three months
before the economy staged a partial recovery from recession.
Yesterday's figures, however, showed a sharp 1 per cent fall in the
composite index of coincident indicators, which track the current state of
the economy.
The fourth monthly decline in the coincident indicators suggests the economy
has been experiencing a second economic dip.
Home sales in January were running about 20 per cent above the level of last
summer and about 50 per cent higher than in January last year, which was
artificially depressed by the Gulf crisis.
The improvement reflected falls in mortgage rates following successive
interest rate cuts by the Fed.
Last month's increase, however, was heavily concentrated in the mid-west
and, to a lesser extent, the south.
Home sales rose only fractionally in the west and not at all in the
depressed north-east.
Yesterday's encouraging figures follow news of an unexpected surge last
month in the purchasing managers' index.
This index is a closely-followed barometer of industrial conditions.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Bush promises to veto bill increasing tax on the rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday promised to veto new legislation that would
increase taxes on the wealthy, as the Senate pressed forward with a bill to
do just that.
Mr Bush had already threatened to veto a tax bill agreed last week by the
House of Representatives, and yesterday repeated his warning for a revised
version of the bill pushed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
finance committee.
'The House passed a tax increase, which I'll veto, and now the Senate is
going about the same business,' he declared yesterday, as the debate over
what sort of tax package is needed took centre-stage in the presidential
election campaign.
Mr Bush has challenged the Democrat-dominated Congress to pass his package
of fiscal measures, including a cut in the capital gains tax, which he
claims would help to stimulate the still weak US economy.
The Democrats have challenged his package, saying it is financed by
accounting gimmicks and complaining that it favours the wealthy.
They have countered with a proposal to give a tax credit to middle-income
families, to be paid for by higher taxes on the rich.
Senator Bentsen's version of this proposal would provide a tax credit of
Dollars 300 (Pounds 171.40) per child, to be paid for by a new 36 per cent
top-rate tax band which would affect couples earning over Dollars 210,000.
Both the rate and the threshold are higher than the version passed last week
by the House, countering President Bush's charge that the measure would
result in a tax increase for the middle class.
The Bentsen tax package is estimated to be worth Dollars 60bn over six
years.
President Bush has been constrained in his attacks on the Democrats in
Congress by the challenge he issued them in his State of the Union speech;
by asking them to work in a bipartisan way to pass his package of tax
measures by March 20, he has hindered himself from criticising them.
Now that the Democrats have produced their version of the tax package,
including the increase in income taxes on the wealthy, a measure anathema to
Mr Bush, he is free to attack them again.
The president also said he now regretted his 1990 budget compromise with
Congress, in which he agreed to an increase in taxes - breaking his 1988 'no
new taxes' campaign pledge - in exchange for caps on discretionary spending.
'Every once in a while, you've got to do something that tastes like castor
oil,' he said, but concluded that the compromise was in his view, a mistake.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan plan makes virtue out of necessity
 -A Pounds 186bn, six-year infrastructure development programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S Nationalist Kuomintang government is looking to its brainchild, a
six-year National Development Plan, to consolidate its support at home and
win greater recognition for Taiwan abroad.
The plan - which the government calls 'the beginning of responsible
government' - is in fact less a plan than a list of things which desperately
need doing in Taiwan.
A side-effect of the island's economic miracle has been the overburdening of
the infrastructure and supplies of electrical power and water, as well as a
lack of educational, cultural and recreational facilities; and while the
economy has been growing fast, the filth has been pouring into Taiwan's
rivers, countryside and air.
The six-year timespan was set to coincide with the term of office of
President Lee Teng-hui - who is also chairman of the Kuomintang  - which
ends in 1996. However, many of the 700 or more projects were started before
1991, and with more than 30 behind schedule at the end of last year, the
plan looks set to go beyond 1996.
With a budget of TDollars 8.2trillion (Pounds 186bn), the plan includes
several big highways, construction of which is already under way and a
high-speed railway linking Taipei to Kaohsiung. The need for a fourth
nuclear power station is still under debate.
As part of an attempt to even out the island's development internally,
Taiwan will be divided into 18 new community hubs, each with its own
employment opportunities and e and recreation, all interconnected by mass
rapid transit systems.
The plan is intended to indicate the Kuomintang's commitment to Taiwan in
the long term and bolster confidence in the island's political stability,
without softening its stance against independence or preconditions for
re-unification with mainland China.
Stimulating domestic demand and encouraging more investment on the island,
especially in research and development, are among other goals of the
six-year plan, along with the development of Taiwan as a regional financial
centre. The government is increasingly worried that Taiwan will become
over-dependent on trade with China through Hong Kong, if the economy does
not become more mature. Trade with Hong Kong exceeded Dollars 5bn in 1991.
Financing for such a huge plan has long been the subject of a cabinet-level
controversy. The government has to find TDollars 3.6trillion from its own
capital accounts, including revenue from privatisation, sale of government
stocks and the issue of construction bonds. It hopes that another TDollars
2.5trillion will come from investment by public and private companies.
Mr Wang Chien-hsien, finance minister, has, however, criticised these
estimates as being unrealistic and says 'the financial resources of the
entire nation will be needed,' if government finances are not to be
overstrained. Mr Wang estimates that in 1992-93 the government must issue
Dollars 34 of bonds for every Dollars 100 it spends.
Ms Shirley Kuo, head of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
which oversees the plan, is adamant that money is not a problem. Ms Kuo
expects that the issue of bonds will make up less than 20 per cent of the
government's commitment.
'There are many ways of borrowing from the public. . . . The government is
confident of covering the annual shortfall because our people here have
always had so much spare money,' she says.
The wealth of opportunities for participation by foreign companies has
boosted the flow of high-level missions to Taiwan in recent months.
Among those successful so far have been Acer John Taylor and London
Transport International as consulting engineers, and LT's French counterpart
Metra which has won a contract to build an entire line of the rapid
transport system.
Involvement of other foreign companies has so far mainly centred around the
construction of the rapid transport systems, already under way in Taipei and
planned for four other big cities. The Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom has high
hopes of clinching the contract to make rolling stock for the transport
system.

FT  04 MAR 92 / BA in talks with Boeing on 600-seat airliner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is discussing with Boeing the possibility of introducing
into its fleet a new 600-seat jumbo airliner by the turn of the century.
Mr Robert Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, confirmed yesterday
that Boeing had held talks with BA and other Boeing 747 jumbo operators on
developing an ultra-large commercial aircraft. But the timing of such a
project was uncertain and depended on market demand.
Boeing has formed a special unit to study developing a 600-seater aircraft
and recently invited executives from potential customer airlines to discuss
the super jumbo project. The European Airbus consortium is also studying the
possibility of building a 600-seat ultra-large aircraft.
BA said yesterday it had set up a study group to evaluate with airframe and
engine makers the airline's future requirement for a super jumbo. It would
envisage using such an airliner on long-distance routes. It sees the cost of
a super-jumbo as about Dollars 175m (Pounds 100m), against Dollars 125m for
a 400-seater Boeing 747-400.
BA suggested the new ultra-large aircraft could include a gymnasium, a
central lounge, sleeping quarters as on-board facilities. Makers expect
strong demand for a super-jumbo from airlines in the Asia-Pacific region
where air traffic is expected to expand in the next decade. Boeing and
Airbus are also seeking to interest Japanese aerospace companies in sharing
in their respective super jumbo projects.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Venezuela's tensions sharpen: The putsch is past, but the
problems mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MONTH after a thwarted military uprising aimed at toppling the elected
government of President Carlos Andres Perez, Venezuela has slid into
political crisis.
Although the country apparently returned to normal almost immediately after
the one-day putsch on February 4, the military revolt shocked the political
and military establishments, sharpening tensions already existing in the
country's 34-year-old democratic system.
Several unparalleled - and for Venezuela, shocking  - events have occurred
over the last two weeks:
Important national figures in one of the two main opposition political
parties have called on Mr Perez to resign. The president, whose five-year
term is scheduled to expire in February 1994, has refused.
In an effort to staunch widespread corruption in the judicial system, the
attorney general and other prominent figures have asked the entire supreme
court to resign so that they can be replaced with individuals not linked to
the country's two main political parties.
The chief opposition party, the Christian Democrats (Copei), and other
groups are demanding a national referendum on the government and a new
constitution.
Venezuela's armed forces were placed on alert on Monday after an apparently
minor incident where a small group of soldiers stole firearms from the
country's principal military installation, Fort Tiuna in Caracas.
Differences and mistrust between officers in the armed forces and
politicians, especially those in the ruling Democratic Action (AD) party,
have become acute. General Fernando Ochoa Antich, minister of defence,
recently made a surprising public appeal to Venezuelan politicians to show
respect for the military. This type of public statement by a Venezuelan
military leader is highly unusual.
By law, Venezuela's armed forces are banned from political activity.
However, many officers have been angered by harsh attacks aimed at the
rebels - and indirectly at all the military  - by the government and some
politicians.
All this has occurred in a tense atmosphere where much of the population
rejects the government's three-year-old economic reform programme, where
rumours of another military uprising are common and where Venezuela's
normally open media are practising self-censorship.
That the problems are deep rooted is suggested by the economic background,
which is not one of weakness but of the fastest economic growth in the
region. In 1992, the oil-dominated economy is expected to grow strongly
again for the third successive year.
The main problem, however, is inflation, which continues to offset positive
results of Mr Perez's economic reforms, such as greater employment.
At the same time, the five lieutenant-colonels who led the uprising are
becoming national heroes, something the government wished to prevent at any
cost. Though it may never be known what the arrested army officers had in
mind, they are being described in the press as bold reformers who planned to
kick out corrupt politicians, eliminate painful economic reforms and put the
country on the right track.
In fact, the putsch has emboldened critics of the government's economic
policies; rallied new efforts to reform the political system and,
especially, to attack Venezuela's legendary corruption; provided a new forum
for Mr Perez's political enemies; and aggravated tensions between the armed
forces and the civilian leadership.
President Perez has meanwhile shifted a number of army officers, changed his
cabinet, promised to intensify the government's already generous social
welfare spending.
Attention has been focused on a special presidential committee of eight
prominent individuals who have been asked to define the country's most
critical problems and propose solutions. The eight-member panel, which
includes figures who have been critical of the president's policies, are
expected to recommend - among other things  - rolling back, or at least
softening, the government's free-market economic reforms. Mr Perez has
repeatedly asserted that he will not repeal those reforms.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan and Canada attack US ruling on Honda
assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and Canada have protested against a US Customs Service ruling that
cars made by Honda in Ontario do not qualify for duty-free benefits under
the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA).
Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and industry minister, said
his ministry had expressed concern to the US on the decision and might file
a more formal complaint. The US ruling 'lacked transparency', he added - a
complaint generally made by US trade negotiators about Japanese rules.
Japan was studying whether the decision 'reflects discrimination against
foreign companies'. The US decision comes as Tokyo senses anti-Japanese
sentiment is growing in the US, leading some Japanese officials to believe
the ruling is politically motivated.
In Canada, the Honda case follows several trade disputes which are raising
questions about Washington's commitment to the letter and spirit of the 1989
free trade agreement. Mr Gordon Ritchie, who was Canada's deputy chief FTA
negotiator, noted that while others might see the Honda decision as another
case of discrimination against Japan, 'Canadians see it as Canada-bashing'.
Ottawa is expected to ask the Honda case be referred to a binational dispute
panel set up under the FTA. One such panel is already investigating the
calculation of local content at another car-assembly plant in Ontario
jointly owned by Suzuki and General Motors.
The US ruling will require Honda to pay a 2.5 per cent duty on the 80,000
Civics shipped to the US from Ontario. Under the FTA, cars assembled in
Canada must have at least 50 per cent North American content to qualify for
duty-free entry to the US.
Honda considers the Civic's North American content to be about 69 per cent.
One point in dispute is the Customs Service ruling that the Civic's engine,
assembled in Ohio by Honda of America, does not qualify as North American
because it includes various Japanese-made components.

NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, is to begin exporting engines for the first
time from its UK car plant. The engines will go to Spain for a range of
vehicles to be launched late this year.
Nissan yesterday unveiled in Geneva its new-generation Nissan Serena 'people
carrier', a seven-to-eight seat high-roof estate car, to begin production in
autumn at Nissan Motor Iberica, its Spanish vehicle subsidiary in Barcelona.
The Serena will compete in one of the fastest-growing segments of the
European market, pioneered in the 1980s by the Renault Espace. Several
European vehicle makers are developing rival products, including Volkswagen
and Ford, in a joint venture in Portugal, and Peugeot and Fiat in another in
northern France.
Nissan said yesterday it would export about 8,000 1.6- and 2-litre petrol
engines from its Sunderland plant to Spain this year for use in the Serena.
It expects Serena output to grow to about 35,000 in 1993.
It is installing capacity to build 50,000 units a year, and estimates some
70 per cent will be powered by petrol engines supplied from the UK. A diesel
engine will be manufactured in Spain.
Nissan has invested about Pounds 53m in its aluminium casting, engine
component machining and engine assembly plants at Sunderland, to supply the
UK and Spanish vehicle assembly plants. UK car output is set to rise to
175,000 this year and to 270,000 in 1993, when the Japanese manufacturer
will also launch a range of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles.

FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Hyundai tenders for HK bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government is expected to decide next week whether to allow a
very low tender from less-experienced South Korean contractors to be
short-listed to bid for a contract to build the world's second largest,
single-span, suspension bridge.
The contract to build the Tsing Ma Bridge, part of Hong Kong's HKDollars
98.6bn (Pounds 7.2bn) airport project, has prompted bids from European,
Japanese and South Korean companies.
Hyundai, Korea's second largest conglomerate, has bid HKDollars 2bn (Pounds
150m) less than the second lowest bid to build the crossing.
The group, a big international contractor, has no experience of building a
large suspension bridge. Hong Kong authorities, though tempted by the low
price, are understood to have reservations about the group's technical
expertise in suspension bridge construction on this scale.
In an attempt to overcome these reservations, Hyundai has approached several
large international engineering groups, including UK and Japanese companies,
to see if a joint bid could be made.
The Tsing Ma bridge will be the first large contract to be let under the
airport project. The Hong Kong government, which is funding the bridge and
other works, has been anxious to generate keen price competition.
Rival bidders accept that it would be very difficult, if the Korean bid is
shortlisted, for the authorities to choose another scheme. Hence the
importance being attached to the tender review board's decision on which of
four remaining bids will be allowed to proceed for final consideration.
Hyundai, according to its rivals, has bid HKDollars 5.5bn (Pounds 400m) for
the contract. The second lowest bid is understood to come from an
Anglo-Japanese consortium of Trafalgar House and Costain of the UK and
Mitsui of Japan, believed to have bid about HKDollars 7.5bn.
There are two other bidders: an international consortium including Bouygues
and Dragages of France and Hochtief of Germany, understood to have bid
HKDollars 8bn, and a Japanese consortium including Nippon Steel, Kobe Steel,
Mitsubishi and C Itoh, understood to have bid about HKDollars 10bn.
The all-Japanese bid is not expected to make the short-list, leaving the
battle for places to the three remaining groups. These could be reduced to
two when the short list is decided.

THE International Air Transport Association (Iata) said yesterday worldwide
traffic showed a healthy increase in January in what it described as a
hopeful sign for the recession-hit industry, Reuter reports from Geneva.
According to an Iata statement, international passenger traffic rose by 14
per cent over January last year and freight traffic rose by 10 per cent.
'Worldwide double-digit growth for both passenger and freight traffic in
January is a hopeful sign for the airlines,' said Mr Gunter Eser, the Iata
director general. But he added, 'We have to remember that traffic in January
1991 was depressed by the Gulf War.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Museveni sets himself against the multi-party wind: Uganda's
president will not win the plaudits on democracy he has on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UGANDA'S President Yoweri Museveni has firmly set himself against the
prevailing wind of multi-party politics blowing across the African
continent. For Uganda it would be a 'diversion' and the wrong course, he
says.
The president, widely credited by multilateral agencies and the west for
tackling the political and economic ravages inflicted by his predecessors,
is unlikely to win similar plaudits for this view.
'In our country parties are a basis for division on tribal and religious
lines,' Mr Museveni said in an interview. 'More than 90 per cent of our
people are peasants and their problems are to do with selling their crops,
getting water and education. It is easier for people to belong to one mass
movement like the (ruling) National Resistance Movement.
'Parties are not synonymous with democracy,' he added.
Mr Museveni suspended party political activity - parties were not banned
outright - soon after coming to power in 1986. He followed this by inviting
the parties and tribal factions to join his NRM in forming a broad-based
government. His aim was to achieve the reconciliation and political
stability that deserted Uganda during the ruinous reign of Idi Amin and
Milton Obote during the 1970s and early 1980s.
'Even in those countries in Africa which have adopted multi-partyism (such
as neighbouring Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia), I doubt if the experiment is
sustainable. We have seen it all before in the 1960s but where did it take
Africa? The whole thing just collapsed. I hope to be proved wrong but I just
don't see multi-partyism as the best route.'
'One only has to look at the progress Uganda has made over the last six
years by harnessing the diverse elements. So I say no to multi-partyism but
yes to democracy.'
Yet, paradoxically, a multi-party movement may be the result of the
president's own democratisation measures. Soon after coming to office, he
introduced a grassroots democratic system involving the election of
so-called 'resistance councils' (RCs) in villages, parishes, counties and
districts. The RCs in turn elect a member to represent them in the National
Resistance Council, the 268-member national legislature, which also includes
20 presidential nominees.
Several RCs, which held elections this week, are known to favour a return to
multi-party democracy. Political parties, such as the Democratic party, have
also called for the lifting of the suspension on multi-party activity.
The political debate is likely to reach a head in December when an
independent commission drafting a new constitution is due to report. Mr
Museveni has indicated he would abide by the commission's decision.
The current political debate, however, is unlikely to overshadow Mr
Museveni's impressive list of achievements on the economic front. Gross
domestic product has increased by 6 per cent for each of the past five
years; inflation has been cut from its 1988 peak of 240 per cent to about 35
per cent in 1991; inefficient state monopolies have been abolished; and a
new investment code and privatisation programme have been introduced.
Most of this radical overhaul has been with the help of a stringent World
Bank structural adjustment programme.
The World Bank says it is 'optimistic' about the outlook for the economy and
is soon to release Dollars 125m to cover the next 18 months of the
structural adjustment programme and Dollars 65m for privatisation.
One area of prime concern is falling revenues from Uganda's main foreign
exchange earner, coffee - largely the consequence of the collapse of the
International Coffee Agreement in 1989 which aimed to support prices through
an export quota system. Coffee earnings have slumped from about Dollars 285m
in 1989 to Dollars 140m last year and now account for some 70 per cent of
total export earnings, down from 97 per cent 1987.
At the same time the government has sought to ease dependence on coffee
exports by encouraging production of other crops such as bananas,
pineapples, beans and sesame seed and cotton. Last year, exports of these
crops totalled Dollars 50m.
The immediate problems of the economy however are dwarfed by the ravages
wrought by Aids. More than 1m people are reported to be HIV positive of a
population of about 17m. The disease is described by the authorities as
their greatest social problem.
Corruption remains widespread and a December 1991 Amnesty International
Report accused the Army of 'torturing, executing and detaining people'.
Mr Museveni said: 'We have tried to respect human rights. Where violations
have taken place we have taken action. I wouldn't like to say Amnesty are
not a serious group but all they seem to do is reproduce the accusations of
bandits.'
Such problems are likely to continue taxing the ingenuity of Mr Museveni at
least until 1995 when presidential elections are due. He said he was unsure
if he would stand. 'If I do, it will only be for one term. If Uganda isn't
stable by then, then I don't see why I should devote the rest of my life to
it. I have other things to do. After all, if a company does not break even
in 15 years, it will never be viable, will it?'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Doubts grow over US guarantees for Israeli loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS in Washington to patch together a compromise over the Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.7bn) loan guarantees sought by Israel appear to be failing, amid
fresh controversy over the US administration's intentions, including a
report that Washington may cut its annual aid.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, announced last week that the
administration would not approve the loan guarantees while Israel continued
to build new settlements in the Arab territories occupied since 1967. His
statement, which coincided with the opening of the fourth round of bilateral
Middle East peace talks in Washington, was bitterly denounced by Israeli
ministers.
Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on foreign aid,
has now admitted that wide differences are blocking the path to a possible
compromise. In comments to reporters, he suggested even more controversially
that Mr Baker had suggested making cuts in the annual Dollars 3bn that
Israel receives in military and civil aid from the US.
Mr Baker said last week that, if Israel wished only to complete housing
under construction on the West Bank and in Gaza, it might be possible to do
a deal on loan guarantees. He suggested deducting the costs of completion
from the amount of the loans the US would guarantee.
Senator Leahy said on Monday night that one of the biggest differences
between his compromise ideas and those of the administration's was that Mr
Baker had proposed to make the deductions not from the loan guarantees but
from annual aid appropriations.
The State Department quickly denied this, repeating Mr Baker's statement
that no conditions should be attached to Israel's annual aid appropriation.
However, a spokesman for Mr Leahy insisted yesterday that the senator stuck
firmly with his assertion.
Mr Leahy added that the whole question of political conditions being
attached to foreign aid had further complicated the issues. 'Some in
Congress still want to give basically a blank cheque,' he said. 'I'm not
going to vote for a blank cheque in foreign aid for any country. I don't
care whether it's Israel, Russia or any other country. I'm not going to do
that, nor is the administration.'

AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit in January was below the psychological
barrier of ADollars 1bn (Pounds 400m), fuelling further expectations of a
gradual recovery from the recession.
The statistics bureau yesterday reported a January deficit of ADollars 861m
in seasonally-adjusted terms, up 44 per cent on December's ADollars 599m,
but the provisional trend estimate shows a 5 per cent fall on the December
estimate, representing a third successive monthly decline.
However, both the government and the markets remained restrained in their
optimism, preferring to wait for more definite signs in the national
accounts due later this month.
Economists generally see a very modest growth in domestic production in the
quarter to December. A second set of figures released yesterday supports
this expectation, showing that stock levels remained constant in the quarter
to December after falling steadily in the past 18 months.
Meanwhile, foreign debt at the end of December stood at ADollars 144.8bn, up
4.3 per cent on the level at the end of the previous quarter.

RIOT police clubbed four women unconscious and fired shots into the air in
Nairobi's central Uhuru (Independence) Park to disperse a group of women
hunger-strikers and several hundred supporters, Reuter reports from the
Kenyan capital.
Witnesses said police waded into the group of about 50 women - many of them
mothers of prisoners - who had begun their hunger strike on Friday with an
appeal to Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, to release all 52 people they
say are in jail for politically related offences.
Mr Wako has promised to review the cases but said he could not guarantee all
the prisoners would be released
Witnesses said that four women, including a leading member of the political
opposition, Wangari Maathai, were clubbed unconscious and taken to hospital
in supporters' cars.
Police fired tear gas repeatedly and fired several shots in the air after
some demonstrators threw stones at passing vehicles, including a bus
belonging to a state transport company identified with President Daniel arap
Moi.
The government had ordered the women to end their protest, saying that it
had been taken over by opposition supporters who were using it to cause
unrest in the city. A spokesman said: 'The opposition has hijacked the
mothers' strike to promote their own selfish political interests, resulting
in rapid deterioration of security.'
AP adds: The US has halted all new development aid to Kenya and suspended a
small military training programme, a US Embassy official said in Nairobi
yesterday. He said the cut-off was forced by the legislation under which the
US Congress mandated a halt to all but food aid to countries six months in
arrears on loan repayments.
He said Kenya was six months in arrears on repayment of housing loan
guarantees and the arrears would reach Dollars 4m on April 1.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Hardliners strengthen grip on Likud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLINERS were yesterday in firm charge of the ruling Likud party of Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, after completing a resounding
victory in elections for the party's list of candidates for the general
election in June.
But the marked rightward shift in the Likud orchestrated by Mr Shamir and
his allies in more than a week of bitter feuding was won at the expense of
two important party factions whose angry disaffection could prove costly in
the election against a revitalised Labour opposition led by Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the newly-elected leader.
Mr Shamir and Mr Moshe Arens, his defence minister, combined forces with Mr
Ariel Sharon, the hardline housing minister, to ensure that the Likud's
ranked list of 51 candidates was dominated by their supporters.
The losers were Mr David Levy, the foreign minister and champion of the
large Sephardi, or Oriental Jewish faction in the Likud, and a group of
liberals.
The results were a clear assertion of supremacy by those who have flatly
refused to offer any compromise on the claim to perpetual Israeli rule over
the occupied territories in the current Middle East peace process and those
 -like Mr Sharon  - who have opposed the talks altogether.
But the outcome opened up deep splits within Likud which was formed from a
coalition of forces in the 1970s under former prime minister Menachem Begin,
himself gravely ill yesterday after a heart attack. Sephardi party members
were furious at what they saw as a crushing of their interests by the
Shamir-Arens-Sharon alliance which represents the old Ashkenazi, or European
leadership.
In his time, Mr Begin was always careful to court Sephardi support,
recognising its role in bringing the Likud to power in 1977. On Monday
night, however, his son Binyamin Begin, a senior Likud MP, was booed and
jostled out of an attempt to calm a meeting of Mr Levy's angry supporters.
Mr Levy accused his rivals of 'destroying the Likud', prompting Mr Shamir to
issue public assurances that Mr Levy's positions as deputy prime minister
and foreign minister would still be his if Likud won the election. He
brushed aside threats from Levy supporters to defect to the Labour party,
saying the divisions would soon be smoothed over.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Spectre of Le Pen stalks Marseilles ghetto: The advance of
the French National Front in regional polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Maghrebin ghettos in the northern suburbs of Marseilles, parents warn
their children that if they do not go to bed on time, Jean-Marie Le Pen will
come to get them.
The extreme right-wing National Front (FN), which Mr Le Pen leads, has made
Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur (Paca), the Mediterranean region of which
Marseilles is the capital, its main battleground for regional elections on
March 22.
Paca and Marseilles in particular are fertile ground for the FN's
anti-immigrant policies, with the region's blend of high immigration and
heavy unemployment.
'The old right, anti-Semitic and xenophobic, have traditionally been
strongest here. . . . Yet this is also one of the most cosmopolitan regions
of France,' says Mrs Edmonde Charles-Roux, the writer who is widow of the
resistance hero and former Socialist mayor of Marseilles, Gaston Defferre.
So it is that the FN has been getting 27 per cent of the vote in recent
opinion polls in Paca; roughly twice its score in the rest of France and
only three points behind Paca's ruling conservative UDF-RPR coalition. The
FN is also well ahead of the 18 per cent of millionaire businessman and
Marseilles football club owner Bernard Tapie, standing as an independent
supporter of President Francois Mitterrand.
Marseilles was where the FN first made its mark, when it started getting
more than a quarter of the votes in central parts of the city in the 1985
cantonal polls.
Among its core supporters are former French settlers in Algeria, or pieds
noirs, who returned to France in the early 1960s after Algerian
independence. But as elsewhere in France, the FN has also attracted protest
votes, against the perceived dullness of the mainstream parties' policies
and their failure to tackle unemployment.
In Paca, the FN has also had the good luck to escape the recent political
scandals which followed the brief arrest of the head of staff of Mr
Jean-Claude Gaudin, the conservative president of the region, over an
alleged attempt - denied  - to discredit Mr Tapie. Against this murky
background, Mr Le Pen looks like 'a knight on a white horse' to many voters,
says one commentator.
But Mrs Charles-Roux sees a 'real parallel' with the rise of Nazism, for her
a frightening childhood memory as daughter of the French ambassador to
Prague in the 1930s. 'Young people have no point of reference. They simply
don't realise the danger,' she warns.
Mr Robert Vigouroux, the city's left-wing mayor, believes the FN could be in
part a temporary phenomenon, but still argues that there is a worrying
parallel with the rise of fascism in the poorer regions of southern Italy -
for similar reasons  - in the 1930s.
'It just goes to show that it is a mistake for the government to forget the
south,' Mr Vigouroux warns.
So it is no surprise that FN's top men, Mr Le Pen and his deputy Mr Bruno
Megret, have both seized on Paca as the ideal place to make their mark and
are standing in the region's two biggest departements or districts.
Their message is as extreme in Paca as anywhere else: 'Marseilles has always
been a gateway to the orient. But it must be a gateway through which people
leave, not enter,' says Mr Ronald Perdomo, an FN regional councillor.
The FN is the third group on the regional council after the UDF-RPR and the
Socialists. Observers believe they have a real chance of getting a small
relative majority on the council this time if there are many abstentions.
'It is a serious risk because FN voters will always turn out, while the
abstentions will come from the centre,' says Mr Vigouroux. But even if the
FN does not end up as the largest party, it could easily be so close behind
the centre right that the regional council will be hard to govern - and
local UDF-RPR politicians insist that they are not prepared to strike an
alliance with Mr Le Pen.
'That is unthinkable,' says Prof Jean-Francois Mattei, a UDF member of
parliament for central Marseilles.
To the casual visitor, Marseilles does not look like a hotbed of extremism.
Certainly, the acres of empty warehouses along the quays testify to the slow
death of its port and some areas are desperately poor. But it is notable
that the city has not been touched by the outbreaks of urban violence that
have marred less poor parts of France over the past two years.
The number of immigrants in the region is only slightly above the national
average at 7 per cent of the population, according to Insee, the state
statistics body, though the FN claims that it is more than double that.
Unemployment, at 11.6 per cent, is two points above the national average
Paca's problem is that it not only has France's fastest growing population
but is also its most urbanised region, with nearly 80 per cent of the people
living in the big port cities. Of course, the poverty is concentrated, with
joblessness rising above 40 per cent in some city areas, and all this is
next door to some of France's plushest resorts.
As elsewhere in France, the regional election result will have more national
than local importance. The powers of regional councils are limited: mainly
high schools and roads, which are hardly likely to excite the populace at
large - and the election is being fought on national issues.
Paca is the main indicator of how the FN will do in general elections next
year, the European poll in 1994 and the presidential election in 1995. 'We
are at the beginning of what could be a complete change in the French
political landscape,' says Prof Mattei.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Asylum-seekers cost west Dollars 7bn last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE largest industrialised countries last year spent an overall Dollars
7bn-Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.58bn) on dealing with asylum-seekers
from the Third World and eastern Europe, according to informal estimates by
an international government-backed immigration secretariat in Geneva.
This is roughly one-seventh of total annual development aid made available
to the world's poorest nations by the rich western countries, which totalled
Dollars 54bn in 1990.
The total spent on asylum seekers appears to have been more than 50 per cent
higher than in 1989. This underlines the sharply growing administrative and
social security costs of processing immigrants seeking refuge in the west
from a variety of war-torn and economically distressed countries.
The main destination for asylum-seekers - above all from Romania and
Yugoslavia, as well as countries in Africa and Asia - was Europe. The 13
western European countries in the secretariat received 543,600 asylum
applications last year, up 27 per cent from the 1990 total of 426,100.
The costs of asylum include amounts spent in areas as diverse as housing,
sustenance, legal expenses and aid workers' salaries.
They cover the more than 1m people whose applications for asylum are being
dealt with by western legal and immigration authorities. Governments
generally do not like to give wide publicity to the figures, reflecting
political sensitivities in a number of countries.
In Germany - which accounts for roughly 40 per cent of all asylum requests
in the west - the latest published figure, from the Bonn Interior Ministry,
puts overall asylum costs, for 1989, at DM4bn (Pounds 2.4bn)
In view of the doubling in asylum applications in Germany during the last
three years - from 121,000 in 1989 to 256,100 last year - the actual 1991
cost was substantially higher, totalling at least Dollars 4bn, according to
estimates by German officials.
A total of 660,000 people last year applied for asylum in a group of 16
industrialised nations which constitute the main destination for migrants
fleeing from poor political or economic conditions in their homelands.
This was 22 per cent up on the total of 540,000 in 1990, according to
figures assembled by the secretariat of the 16 countries' interior
ministries, set up last summer to work on the asylum problem.
The governments are trying to find more constructive uses for the money
spent on coping with asylum seekers.
Countries such as Sweden and Germany are exploring methods of pinpointing
areas in eastern Europe, for instance, for tailor-made development aid aimed
at persuading potential immigrants to stay at home.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Hungarian court blocks communists' trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S constitutional court yesterday blocked trials of communists who
murdered and sold out their country to the Soviet Union in the early and
most brutal years of the former dictatorship.
The judges unanimously threw out the government-supported Zetenyi-Takacs
amendment, crippling the right-wing drive for Nuremberg-style trials.
The court deemed unconstitutional the amendment's suspension of the statute
of limitations on crimes of murder and treason which were allowed to expire
by the former regime.
Yesterday's decision lifts the threat of prosecution from communists who had
a hand in the violent suppression of Hungary's 1956 uprising, who were the
most obvious targets of the Zetenyi-Takacs amendment.
The judgment stops in its tracks the conservative government's Justice plan
to compensate the victims of the communist regime, and punish and purge
those who persecuted them.
The plan has repeatedly run up against constitutional principles when it has
been translated into law.
Mr Arpad Goncz, the president, had opened the way for a compromise under
which old communist criminals would be exposed but not prosecuted.
Demands for retribution are weaker in Hungary than in neighbouring
countries. The communist regime became liberal in its later days and now
stability, the main condition of economic recovery, is given top priority.
Attention now turns to the goverment's proposal to purge former agents of
III/III, the hated internal security arm of the communist secret police. The
bill to vet political, business and media leaders for secret service links
goes before parliament for voting this month. Opposition MPs have questioned
whether it is legal to discriminate for membership of an organisation which
was legitimate at the time.

BRUSSELS is coming under growing pressure, from outside and inside the EC,
not to go it alone in proposing a new tax to penalise carbon dioxide

Officials from the Gulf Co-operation Council, representing Saudi Arabia and
five smaller Gulf oil producers, met the European Commission this week to
express their concern at the EC executive's announced intention to propose a
'carbon tax' in advance of this summer's world environmental summit in
Brazil.
The GCC countries fear such a levy could hit their oil exports to the EC,
with which it is negotiating eventual free trade.
The GCC said they would prefer a global discussion, involving all energy
producers and consumers, on the impact of energy use on the environment.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Germans dig in for pay round: IG Metall and the employers
are resolute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANZ Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, Germany's most powerful trade union,
says he is used to the sound of employers banging the drum in the overture
to wage talks. But squeaking pips have added a shriller note to the
orchestration this year.
The tally of redundancies, falling orders, passed dividends and looming
losses in the engineering sector has grown in the past few weeks almost as
quickly as the mountain of pay-round propaganda.
Mr Steinkuhler's hardened ear detects an unusual harmony: 'We have never
before seen the employers putting up such a solid, radical front,' he says.
That solidarity will be put to its first test tomorrow at the launch of this
year's rolling round of pay negotiations in Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg.
Over the next three weeks IG Metall negotiators, armed with a 9.5 per cent
general claim for 4m mechanical and electrical engineering workers, and
officials of Gesamtmetall, the leading employers' association, will join the
process.
Positions on the simple issues - pay and inflation  - have already been
marked out. With consumer prices expected to rise by 4.5 per cent this year,
the employers will probably settle for anything less than 6 per cent and the
union for anything above it.
For IG Metall, a 6 per cent deal would be a signal victory in what is to
become a battle over principles. Mr Steinkuhler and his lieutenants present
themselves as front-line defenders against industrialists, economists,
politicians and central bankers allegedly conspiring to impose an average
national 5.5 per cent pay rise. Their aim, IG Metall says, is to weaken the
unions and, more ominously, to dismantle the internationally admired social
contract between workers and employers.
By inference, workers' rights in co-determination, shorter working hours,
and all the 'extras' which, according to the IW economics institute in
Hamburg, make up 47 per cent of an industrial worker's pay, could be at
risk. Protecting the country's renowned 'social' economy from transformation
into a pure market economy is a principle worth striking for, according to
Mr Steinkuhler.
Increasing pay will raise purchasing power and give the economy a necessary
lift. More importantly, he says, it will compensate wage earners for the
unfair burdens of tax and duty surcharges they have had to pay to help
integrate east Germany into the federal family.
Things seem simpler from the companies' side: industry simply cannot afford
big pay awards in the west while investing in the east, they say.
Gesamtmetall wants an immediate change in the direction of pay policy and
restoration of the country's fabled pay stability and labour market peace.
Hourly wage costs, which increased by an average 4 per cent a year between
1982 and 1989, jumped 7 per cent in 1990 and 8.2 per cent last year. They
have far outstripped compensatory productivity growth and manufacturers'
ability to pass on increased costs to dwindling customers in export and
domestic markets.
In the short-term, engineering is shedding jobs. In the last half of 1991,
when demand in east Germany tailed off and orders failed to materialise in
recession-hit export markets, 20,000 engineers lost their jobs and a further
100,000 went on short-time. In the longer term, all industry seems to agree,
Standort Deutschland - Germany as a site for investment - will lose its
attraction; the 'Made in Germany' label will be too expensive, and worse
will follow.
IG Metall dismisses the Standort Deutschland argument as a dangerous sham,
tantamount to sawing off the branch on which the German economy depends.
According to Mr Fritz-Heinrich Himmelreich, managing director of the
all-industry employers' association, BDA, the small and medium-sized
companies which feed the core of German industrial giants with components
are finding it an increasingly uncomfortable perch.
This sector, the Mittelstand is in rebellion, he says. As well as having to
face steeply rising wages bills, the companies are confronted by demands
from their customers, who are trying to retain competitiveness by demanding
lower prices or threatening to seek cheaper production bases elsewhere. East
Germany, where unions demand that pay should increase to full western levels
by the end of 1994, offers no alternative.
Another result is that they are more resolute than in the past two years in
their stand against IG Metall. Mittelstand companies, each employing up to
250 people, represent 70 per cent of Gesamtmetall's membership and employ a
total of 1.8m workers.
Summing up, Mr Steinkuhler claims that 'the phase of relative social peace
seems to be coming to an end'. Following unification in October 1990,
Germany was too busy having a party and pouring products into the former GDR
to notice that there was nothing coming back except bills for social welfare
benefits for 16m new west Germans.
The seeds of the threatening storm were sown when the east's former
communist bloc markets disappeared with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Now, as Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, leader of Gesamtmetall, told Mr
Steinkuhler last week: 'We are all standing in the rain together.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand privatisation agency, under pressure from striking east German
shipyard workers, yesterday said it would sell off the core of the ailing
Baltic ship-building industry this month, probably to Vulkan of west
Germany.
Mr Wolf Schode, spokesman for the east German agency, said the Treuhand
would have to write off more than DM1bn (Pounds 340m) in debts and provide
large state investments prior to any sale.
Despite the likely sale nearly 10,000 employees of the three main shipyards
and a diesel engine plant continued an occupation strike which began last
week. The strike had been designed to prevent the state government of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Treuhand from selling off parts of the
industry while letting the core collapse.
Mr Schode said a rival bid by Kvaerner of Norway for east Germany's largest
shipyard, Warnowwerft, would create Europe's largest shipbuilders, but
'leave the brains in Oslo'.

FT  04 MAR 92 / Clever Japanese invent pocket-size resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, have
been ordered to bring letters of resignation to work each morning - as a
reminder that they are personally responsible for hauling the company out of
loss.
Mr Hiroshi Hamada, Ricoh's president, told the 23 directors, each of whom is
directly responsible for a business division, to 'have a resignation letter
in your shirt pocket'. He warned that he wanted to promote younger managers,
and hinted that resignations could become effective at any time if the
company's performance did not improve.
The Ricoh resignation method is one of the more dramatic responses to
plunging profits at leading Japanese companies, which have been shaken by a
slowing domestic economy and embarrassed by uncharacteristically poor
results.
Ricoh said yesterday that most of the directors had already drafted their
resignation letters, and some had submitted them to Mr Hamada.
His order came after Ricoh announced that it would report a Y5.8bn (Pounds
25m) pre-tax loss for the year to March 31, the first loss since the company
was listed in 1949.
Ricoh said the resignation threat should be seen as 'not merely ceremony',
as is generally the case with executive resignations in Japan. At the height
of the stock scandals last year, the president and chairman of Nomura
Securities resigned to take responsibility for the shame brought on the
company while other executives took symbolic cuts in salary.
'The resignations show our sincerity. They indicate our responsibility to
our shareholders, customers, and our employees, Ricoh said.
Ricoh, like Sony Corporation and Honda Motor, is regarded as a maverick in
Japanese industry, having risen outside the powerful corporate families
known as keiretsu. These companies, guided by often charismatic executives,
have cultivated strong corporate cultures and sometimes employ unorthodox
methods in crisis control.
However, Sony, which expected to report a Y20bn loss, said yesterday that it
would not start a 'resignation movement'. Clarion, the car audio maker which
will also report a loss, said the company was examining its management
policy, but was not likely to take a 'drastic decision' similar to Ricoh's.
Mr Hamada, Ricoh's president, has a fondness for philosophy and likes to
remind listeners of 'The Spirit of the Three Loves', the company's guiding
principles of: 'Love Your Neighbour, Love Your Country, and Love Your Work.'
In a recent speech, Mr Hamada explained that he liked executives to 'own'
their problems. By drafting resignation letters, he had forced the directors
to stake their future on the company's recovery. 'I think that changing
human attitudes is much harder than changing methods, but that's what must
be done in order to get quality work.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Indians win a valley in Chile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHILEAN government has for the first time assumed the defence of Indian
rights by purchasing a disputed valley in the southern Andes to save a clan
of Pehuenche Indians from being evicted from their ancestral lands.
The government agreed late on Monday to pay Dollars 6.15m to the landowners
of the Quinquen valley. The deal was struck less than 24 hours before an
eviction order against 150 Pehuenche 'illegal squatters' was due to take
effect. Most of the valley will now become a protected Indian reservation -
the first to be established in Chile in over a century.
President Patricio Aylwin's decision to secure land for the Pehuenches is
likely to set an important legal precedent. Land disputes between white
settlers and Chile's 500,000 Mapuches - the tribe to which the Pehuenche
clan belongs - have escalated in recent years with the growth of cattle
ranching, forestry and tourism.
'There are over 600 cases of land poaching which the Mapuches have no hope
of winning through the courts,' says Mr Eduardo Astorga, an Indian rights
lawyer. 'The only way to settle these conflicts is for the government to
rally to their defence.'
Late last year, Mapuche groups staged a series of land seizures in southern
Chile to draw attention to their plight. The occupations were ended with
brutal efficiency by the Carabineros, Chile's paramilitary police.
Mr Astorga said Indian groups would lobby Congress this year to ensure the
passage of legislation to protect Indian rights. The government has
submitted a draft bill to establish a 'land fund' to purchase some of the
territory the Mapuches have lost this century.
Chile's right-wing parties, which control the Senate, oppose the land fund.
They are also against granting special recognition to Chile's native
peoples, which include the Aymaras in the north, the Mapuches in the south,
and the Rapa Nui on Easter Island.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE unresolved constitutional and political problems in Czechoslovakia led
President Vaclav Havel to warn recently that the federal state of Czechs and
Slovaks was 'like a ship sailing through a dangerous storm'.
Prominent among the shoals lies a general election campaign which will be
fought largely on the future of the federal state and relations between its
Czech and Slovak components. The wider question, however, is whether the
country remains a factor for stability in central Europe or becomes a
destabilising force in an already turbulent area, Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the
federal foreign minister, said yesterday.
Splitting up the federal state 'would completely change the geo-political
situation in central Europe,' he warned. 'From our perspective we have to
look at everything against the possibility of a belt of total chaos east of
our boundaries.'
The key objective must be to preserve Czechoslovakia as an example of
successful reform and transformation, he said.
His fear, and that of President Havel, is that 'even if we succeed in
maintaining the federation it will consume our energy for a long time' and
divert attention from reforming the political and economic system.
The controversial shipment of 250 Slovak-made tanks to Syria illustrates the
problem. 'If they had been made in Bohemia it would be a different matter.
But in Slovakia, where former communists and the managers of military
factories have been elected as mayors in cities dependent on the arms trade,
for the federal government to prohibit their export just provides ammunition
for Slovak nationalists.'
Speaking before delivering a speech to the Royal Institute of International
Affairs in London, Mr Dienstbier underlined that Czechoslovakia was not
facing a Yugoslav-style crisis. 'There is no danger that people will be
shooting at each other.'

FT  04 MAR 92 / Berlin walled in with problems:  The city's struggle to live
up to its new status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE height of the Cold War, Berlin was as much a symbol as a city, with
its division clearly marked by the Wall and the sectoral boundaries between
the allied and Soviet zones. After almost two years of unification Berlin is
still a symbol  - but of the painful economic and social struggle to unite
the disparate halves of Germany.
Berlin's infrastructure, housing and officials appear unable to cope not
only with the challenge of unification, but also with the city's
transformation into a capital which befits Europe's most powerful economy. A
good many Berliners are using words such as 'crisis', 'chaos' and even
'dangerous' to describe the city's economic and political malaise.
Part of the problem stems from Berlin's recent history as an economic
backwater of west Germany and the hub of east Germany's centrally planned
economy. The western half attracted those keen to flee Frankfurt and other
West German cities for a more sedate life in a highly subsidised city. But
it lost many of its more ambitious young people to careers in West Germany.
Communist East Berlin, in contrast, was a haven for those seeking a career
in state bureaucracy.
'We are paying the price of having been drained for decades of our political
and economic elite,' said Mr Kurt Kasch of Deutsche Bank in Berlin. He said
investors were avoiding Berlin in favour of east Germany, where greenfield
sites are available and labour more easily motivated.
He blamed the city administration for failing to tackle festering problems:
a critical housing shortage, traffic-clogged streets, an urgently needed
administrative reform and delays in choosing the site of a new international
airport.
The government and parliament are not expected to complete their move to
Berlin until the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the city's demands for fresh
subsidies to cope with its changing role suspiciously echo its previous
reliance on federal support for 60 per cent of the city's budget.
Critics such as Herr Kasch believe that Berliners will eventually generate
enough dynamism to overcome the present inertia. But this will mean
wrenching changes for its pampered inhabitants.
Residents worry that growing social tensions in both east and west Berlin
may explode in the interim. They condemn the city's anaemic and faceless
coalition government of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats for having
paralysed decision-making.
City officials reply that Berlin is forced to accomplish in a relatively
short time what other cities had decades to achieve.
Much of the gloom stems from the realisation that rising unemployment in
east and west Berlin is not likely to be short-lived.
Ms Angelika Heinrich, like most of the 117,357 newly unemployed east
Berliners - 17.2 per cent of the working population - said she was bitterly
disappointed in what the social market economy had brought her. With other
unmarried working mothers cosseted by the former communist regime, she now
saw 'no future' after being sacked from her job last December in the Narva
lightbulb factory.
In 1989, 30,000 east Berliners worked in the grimy cable and electricals
factories of Oberschoneweide where the streets are named after Edison and
Volta. There will soon be fewer than 5,000 jobs.
'The whole industrial base here is being rolled flat,' said Mr Lutz
Epperlein, chairman of the works council at the TRO transformer plant.
Unemployment would be even higher in east Berlin and Brandenburg if it were
not for the estimated 130,000 easterners who commute to work in west Berlin.
But even in west Berlin industrial jobs are being lost more quickly than
service jobs can be created. Nearly 105,000 west Berliners are without jobs
 -10.6 per cent - and the trend is rising.
Yet the city had 6.5 per cent economic growth in 1990 and 4 per cent last
year, largely because of a boom in spending by east Berliners - often using
state unemployment benefits from Bonn.
Manufacturers in formerly walled-in west Berlin flourished with the help of
investment incentives and up to 10 per cent VAT rebates from Bonn. These and
the income tax benefits enjoyed by Berliners are being phased out by 1994
and several large companies such as Standard Elektrik Lorenz plan to move
out to the Brandenburg surroundings or, like Bosch and Siemens, will slim
down production in Berlin.
'We face a dramatic structural problem,' Mr Uwe Petersen of the Berlin
Economic Promotion office warned.
The expected boom in the service sector to replace subsidised manufacturing
has not taken place and much of the blame is being placed on the serious
shortage of both affordable office space and housing in Berlin. Although
many newly arrived German government officials are to be housed in the more
than 6,000 flats and hundreds of villas occupied by the western allies - who
depart in 1994 - the pent-up demand among Berliners for lower-income flats
is expected to far outstrip the ability of the city to provide them.
Building activity in east Berlin, both commercial and housing, is virtually
non-existent because of conflicting property claims by previous owners
dispossessed under the Nazis and the communists.
Mr Falk Jesch, head of the city-owned housing company in east Berlin's Mitte
district, forecast that the lack of private investment meant even repairs to
the facades and roofs of long-neglected apartment buildings, 50 per cent of
them with conflicting title claims, will halt when public funds are
exhausted this year.
Legal conflicts are especially prevalent in Mitte where nearly 1,000
properties are estimated to have had Jewish owners who often sold under
duress in the 1930s.
Both Mr Jesch and Mr Hans Peter Plettner, a leading Berlin property
auctioneer, held out little hope that legal measures by Bonn to speed up the
processing of property claims and facilitate investments would bring a
solution as long as the government clung stubbornly to the principle that
restoring property to former owners takes precedence over indemnifying them.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Appointments: From merchant to high street bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The old adage about not shooting the messenger seems to have fallen on deaf
ears at National Westminster Bank; it has just replaced its director of
corporate affairs less than a week after it reported its worst results since
1975.
Simon Lewis, the 32-year-old head of public relations at merchant bank S G
Warburg, is replacing Bill Beavor, a former Vietnam vet with a PhD in
military intelligence, who has departed after only 18 months.
Lewis started his career at Shandwick Consultants, the world's largest PR
firm, and was seconded to Warburg's former parent, Mercury Securities, in
the run-up to 'Big Bang'. After a leave of absence to head public relations
for David Owen's Social Democrat party ahead of the 1987 general election,
he returned to set up Warburg's public relations department. At NatWest, he
will be in charge of relations with the media, government and community. He
will have a staff of 50 and will report to Phil Wise, general manager of
group strategy and communications - the third person in that job in the past
18 months.
Lewis, an Oxford graduate and Fulbright scholar, is well regarded as a City
PR man. However, managing the public relations of a high street bank which
has had more than its fair share of bad publicity will be a far greater
challenge than handling the image of Britain's most successful merchant
bank, whose record speaks for itself. 'All the banks have had a difficult
time but the pr challenges now are greater than at any time in the cycle,'
Lewis says.
Meanwhile, NatWest refuses to comment on Beavor's abrupt departure save to
say that there were 'apparent differences in working methods and attitudes'.
Before joining NatWest, Beavor had been the late Robert Maxwell's chief
communicator for a brief spell and had also done stints at J Walter Thompson
and Dr Barnardo's, the children's charity. He also worked part-time at the
church of St John the Divine in Brixton.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as long-term bond
yields rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended only slightly higher after investor sentiment had been
unsettled by a sharp rise in bond yields following a surprisingly bullish
purchasing managers' report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.60 at 3,275.27, the
index having spent all day within a few points of Friday's close.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished slightly weaker, down
0.29 at 412.41, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks
climbed 2.00 to 635.47.
Turnover on the NYSE was light at 181m shares, while rises marginally
outpaced declines by 882 to 830.
The announcement from the National Association of Purchasing Management that
its index of economic activity for February had risen from 47.4 per cent to
52.4 per cent was a welcome piece of economic news. But it was outweighed by
the rise in long-term bond yields, which approached 8 per cent as dealers
sold bonds in the belief that the NAPM report reduced the likelihood for
further interest rate cuts.
Equity market sentiment was affected because higher bond yields raise the
cost of borrowing, especially in the housing sector.
Paramount Communications jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 after
PaineWebber upgraded its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy' and
predicted that the entertainment group's first-quarter earnings should
underscore a big improvement in operating margins.
Digital Equipment rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 62 1/8 after the company
announced that it is offering early retirement to 7,000 staff. Other big
computer stocks were also firmer, with Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 74 3/8 , IBM Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 87 3/8 and Compaq
Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 30 1/4 .
Travelers dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 20 as investors reacted badly to
reports that a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
reveals that the insurance group is seeking capital to cover losses from its
property portfolio.
Grace Energy jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 17 1/8 on the news that W R
Grace (down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 43 3/4 ) will buy 4m shares of its
energy affiliate for Dollars 16.50 a share.
On the over-the-counter market, Scitex climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42
1/4 in turnover of 1.3m shares in response to Friday's late news that
International Paper had agreed to buy 11 per cent of Scitex. International
Paper rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 74 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO prices ended little changed in subdued dealings. Based on
preliminary data, the composite index shed 2.47 points, or 0.07 per cent, to
3,579.4, with declining issues leading advances 281 to 252. Volume fell to
18.4m shares worth CDollars 201.4m against 26.8m shares worth CDollars
285.5m on Friday. Eight of 14 sub-groups were lower, with no major swings in
the individual groups.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP strengthens Statoil link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM is taking its strategic alliance with Statoil a stage
further by selling a 45 per cent stake in a North Sea gas field to the
Norwegian state oil company.
BP Exploration announced yesterday that it had agreed to sell the stake in
the Hyde field in the southern sector of the North Sea for an undisclosed
sum.
BP already has an agreement with Statoil covering gas marketing in the UK,
technical research and exploration and selected oil provinces.
This includes a three-way joint venture agreement with Statoil and Norsk
Hydro to market Norwegian gas into the UK industrial market, a move that was
recently given special approval from the UK government.
BP also said yesterday that it will shortly begin development of the Hyde
field, with production scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of next
year.
The cost of developing the Hyde field is expected to be in the region of
Pounds 65m.
Both the sale of the stake to Statoil and the commencement of development
will require an official go-ahead.
The Hyde field lies 40 miles east of Humberside in 100 feet of water and it
contains an estimated 135bn cubic feet of gas.
It straddles four blocks. But more than 97 per cent of the reserves are
thought to be in a block held 100 per cent by BP, the company said.
According to BP, the field was long considered uneconomical but it had been
transformed into a profitable prospect by means of innovative thinking and
by new partnership arrangements that would greatly reduce costs.
It is also believed that these techniques may subsequently be applied
successfully to many other smaller fields in the North Sea.
To develop Hyde, BP has entered into partnerships with two contractors, UIE
Scotland, based on Clydeside, and Glasgow engineers Kvaerner H&amp;G Offshore,
under which cost savings would be shared.
BP said that this arrangement would encourage a more cost effective approach
among teams engaged on the project.
Hyde will be developed using a small unmanned steel platform. The gas will
be produced from three pre-drilled horizontal wells and transported via a
new seven mile pipeline to the existing West Sole system for piping ashore.
BP said that a sales agreement for Hyde gas was currently being negotiated
and that its details would be announced in due course.
