FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Banks pushing debt exposure on to trade creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DUNCAN HEENAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bad debts suffered by UK banks are much discussed at present, but
little comment is directed towards the subtle shifting of the banks' role
towards trade creditors.
Many businesses are suffering a progressive reduction in borrowing
facilities from their bankers, as the poorer results roll in from the
recession, and the bankers' confidence evaporates. This is often accompanied
by informal advice from the bank to 'lean on your suppliers'. Having no
option the business does so, creating a knock-on effect on its hapless trade
creditors. The process stops when a supplier with sufficient equity, or
adequate bank facilities, is reached in the payment chain. The result? Banks
with reduced exposure to 'risky' businesses, and their lending more confined
to companies with less risk attaching. The bad debt risk has been shifted to
trade creditors which only discover the problem too late to do much about
it.
If the banks look like having a bad debt problem now, wait for industry's
problem in the coming year] It seems wrong that in passing this problem to
trade creditors, the banks will not accept a pro rata shift of their
security to match. Duncan Heenan,

FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Curious forecasts spring from subtle imagination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN I EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an engineer rather than an accountant, I was sorry that your
article, 'Managers lack finance skills, says survey' (February 24), did not
supply the 'correct' answer to the philosophical question 'What is the basic
purpose of a profit and loss account?'
My own experience is that a good profit and loss account (and balance sheet)
is a subtle work of the imagination (with a small admixture of fact) which
has four basic purposes: to flatter the management, to reassure the bankers,
to comfort the shareholders, and to minimise the tax liability.
To balance these purposes without actually being seen to break the rules is
the true art of accountancy. Would this have been marked correct?
Your article said: 'Only 38 per cent (of managers) correctly identified
(working capital) as just cash, stock and debtors.'
I was brought up to believe that working capital was 'current assets less
current liabilities'. If nearly two out of five managers (and KPMG
Management Consulting which conducted the survey) think creditors and
overdraft can be ignored, this could account for a lot of curious working
capital forecasts and apparently perverse management decisions in British
industry.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Life products should have statutory minimum cash
surrender value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R L SUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I believe it is impossible to analyse the expenses of any organisation,
other than the smallest of one-man-bands, without human judgments having to
be made about the allocation of those expenses, and that the moment this
happens any notion of absolute accuracy evaporates. It is, therefore,
fruitless to waste time on such crudities as the 'expense ratios' which you
published ('Hidden costs that can make life policies so expensive', February
22).
In my view both the Association of British Insurers and Securities and
Investments Board are chasing a mirage in striving for practical ways of
disclosing 'expenses'.
The satisfactory solution is to free the life and pensions industry from
statutory disclosure of commission to intermediaries and the vain quest for
an equivalent for life office employees and tied agents.
Let the industry run its own affairs unhindered and make whatever
remuneration and commission payments it wants, but exact a stiff quid pro
quo by way of a statutory minimum cash surrender value formula applicable to
all life and pension products.
I would suggest that the secretary of state for trade and industry, acting
on the advice of the government actuary, be empowered to determine the
formula which should be:
equitable to all parties;
simple enough to be easily understood and remembered;
tough enough to force any badly run life office really to discriminate in
its recruitment of sales staff and in its choice of intermediaries with whom
it will do business, while also not being intolerable to any rigorously run
office.
A tentative minimum cash surrender value formula might be:
'X per cent of all premiums paid, less Pounds Y if surrendered during policy
year N', where X could be 80, 85, 90 and 95 for N 1, 2, 3 and 4 and all
greater durations. Y could be a flat Pounds 100 for all durations, but since
the value of money can change, the secretary for state would be empowered to
alter Y as and when he thought fit.
I would emphasise that any such formula would yield only a minimum value,
allowing competition to produce higher values from the better-run offices,
and should be applied to all life and pension contracts, without exception,
written after an appointed day about two years hence.
Judiciously chosen, such a formula could do much to eradicate the evil of
the public being lumbered with inappropriate and unnecessarily expensive
policies.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Australia denies its industrial tariffs are
monstrously high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would take issue with key points in Sir Roy Denman's letter (February
24).
It is true that industrial tariffs have been ratcheted down over the course
of successive General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rounds. Australia and
the Cairns Group accept that agricultural reform also cannot be achieved
overnight. However, the corruption of world agricultural markets is so
immense, not least because of EC export subsidies under the Common
Agricultural Policy, that the need for substantial reductions in subsidies
and other support should be manifest to all. At risk is a package (the
so-called Dunkel text) which would provide a substantial boost to world
trade across a wide range of both goods and services.
However, the statement I refute most strongly is 'the Australians (will do)
little to cut their monstrously high industrial tariffs'. A few facts are in
order to correct this completely out of date view.
Between 1983 and 1992 the effective level of protection of Australian
industry will have been halved. In contrast with the majors, there are now
no quantitative restrictions on imports to Australia, with the sole
exception of tariff quotas on textiles, clothing and footwear which will be
eliminated by March next year.
Australia's average protection on all imports from Most Favoured Nation
sources will be less than 5 per cent by the end of this decade. Most imports
from developing countries (including the countries of central Europe) will
be duty and quota free by July 1996.
Let us see the Community come even close to this. Despite the recession
Australia is currently experiencing, the prime minister, in his economic
statement on Wednesday, did not seek to reverse, or even slow down, the
tariff cuts in train - Australia's offer on market access in the current
Gatt round is among the highest of all parties to the negotiations. The
value to Europe is that we are offering to bind cuts of 44 per cent on a
trade-weighted basis.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Hard-Nose hedging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend will be a good one in which to refine your funk portfolio. For
the election campaign may be starting to turn Labour's way. If it is, and if
you have money to spare, you will want to place it in personal equity plans,
index-linked gilts, the name of your spouse, beneath the mattress, in an
offshore account under your aunt's signature - any good hiding-place you can
find.
I say 'be ready', not 'take action'. There is no need for investors or the
well-paid to panic. Not yet. A few weeks ago, I characterised the then
current opinion poll results as deuce, advantage Tories. Now the polls -
plus something in the political air - suggest that the score is deuce,
advantage Labour. This is a slight but not insignificant change. It needs
some explaining.
First the polls. The moving average of the last seven of them, all taken in
February, comes out at 39 per cent Conservative, 39 per cent per cent Labour
and 17 per cent Liberal Democrat. Ignore differentiated regional swings,
special cases in the marginals and similar psephological technicalities.
They usually cancel one another out. On a straightforward uniform swing,
39-39-17 produces a hung parliament, with the Conservatives commanding 14
more seats than Labour.
The picture restructures itself if you focus on the four most recent polls,
all taken in the second half of February. The score in terms of public
support is still about evens, but there is a fractional difference in favour
of Mr Neil Kinnock's party. The model on our FT computer reduces the Tory
lead in a hung parliament to just six seats. The difference is important.
With a 14-seat plurality, Ulster unionist support and a fair wind, the
government just might cling to power. If it ended up a mere six seats ahead
of Labour, the government would probably lose in the manoeuvrings that would
follow the election.
These computer games would be meaningless if it were not for the timing of
the latest wobble in the monthly graph. The four latest polls were all taken
after St Valentine's day - that is after the 'black Thursday' of February
13. On that fateful afternoon, it was announced that unemployment had risen
in January by twice as much as expected, mortgage lenders had repossessed
75,000 homes in 1991 and manufacturers had cut their capital spending. The
next morning, we were told that factory output was down by 5 per cent for
the year 1991.
Since then the hammer blows to public confidence in the government's
management of the economy have coming thundering down with rhythmic
persistence. Clearing banks have reported record losses, and announced
large-scale redundancies. A huge increase in the public sector borrowing
requirement has been excused in advance Only the Budget can save the
Conservatives now - or can it?
by the prime minister. On Tuesday, Mr Kinnock floored Mr Major with a
parliamentary question: 'The prime minister is now borrowing billions to try
to finance a pre-election tax cut. So will he tell us exactly which other
taxes he will raise to pay for the bribe?' Yesterday's trade figures were
dreadful, particularly on the export side. In yesterday's question-time
exchanges, Mr Kinnock once again linked tax cuts with unbalanced budgets. He
may eventually get this message through to a wider audience.
We should, therefore, expect signs of hesitancy about the April 9 election
date. Yesterday's Daily Express, one of the tabloids that might as well be
an organ of Conservative Central Office, argued that Mr Major 'must not be
bounced into an April poll just because the media and the opposition want
it'. In theory, the Daily Express is right; in practice, this is not the
Central Office line. The prime minister would lose more by seeming to be
afraid of April 9 than he would by delaying and hoping for something to turn
up. More to the point, he believes that the recovery awaits a Conservative
victory.
Thus boxed in, Mr Major now faces a test of nerve, particularly if Labour's
apparently renewed advantage is pressed home next week. If it is, the game
may slip away from him and we could be just 42 days from sitting stunned and
bleary-eyed before our television screens as a beaming Mr Neil Kinnock
struts before the cameras on the threshold of Number 10 Downing Street.
The most senior of the Conservatives understand this very well. They affect
to be confident of victory, but in private they are worried. Only the budget
can save them now - or can it? Mr Major's present intention is to base his
call for re-election on borrowing untold billions on the taxpayers' account
in order to finance a lower rate of income tax. If he does - that is, if the
package presented by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on March 10 knocks a
penny or two off the standard rate, raises tax thresholds and awards a free
beer mug or a nifty credit card wallet to everyone who votes Conservative -
we will then see a living sociological experiment. The power of the crude
handout will be tested before our very eyes.
There are two schools of thought on this matter. One, the Lofty school,
believes that this would be a tacky way to fight an election, and, worse,
that it would be seen to be so. Mr Kinnock could expose it by rescinding
part or all of Labour's proposals to increase taxes, arguing that if Mr
Lamont can borrow to finance tax cuts, his chancellor, Mr John Smith, could
borrow to finance expenditure, without actually raising taxes. The other
lot, the Hard-Noses, believe that floating voters in the marginals will not
be susceptible to such nuances. They will take the Tory money and vote to
keep it.
Your weekend portfolio planning should be adjusted according to which of
these theories seems the more likely to be right. It is a question of how
sophisticated and how selfless you think the electorate is. If you force me
to choose, my money remains on the Hard-Noses, but with waning confidence.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Better nuclear safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURES taken by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this
week to strengthen safeguards against nuclear proliferation are only a
modest step forward. The UN's nuclear watchdog needs far stronger powers if
its inspectors are to stand a real chance of detecting a clandestine weapons
programme like that of Iraq.
The IAEA board of governors agreed that inspectors could make 'special
inspections' of undeclared sites in countries that have comprehensive
safeguards agreements with the agency. That is real progress. But countries
with limited agreements to inspect specific reactors, such as Algeria, would
not have to open other sites for inspection.
A second measure will require countries to submit preliminary information
about new nuclear facilities and modifications to existing plants, before
construction starts. But again this will apply only to full IAEA members.
A more ambitious proposal - to set up a central registry of production,
exports and imports of nuclear materials and sensitive equipment - foundered
on the objections of several industrialised countries. They argued that a
reporting system sensitive enough to pick up suspicious shipments would
impose an unacceptably heavy administrative burden on suppliers.
Database proposal
IAEA staff will refine the database proposal in the hope that the board will
accept it at the next board meeting in June. The inspectors believe,
rightly, that a comprehensive system for tracking nuclear materials and
equipment would make it far easier to detect a country trying to conceal a
weapons programme by buying similar materials in relatively small quantities
from several suppliers in different countries, as Iraq did.
In the long run, effective global safeguards can work only if countries
still outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty, such as Israel, India and
Pakistan, sign up. But it will take strong and sustained diplomatic
pressure, particularly from the US, to make them see that the loss of
sovereignty entailed in IAEA membership is a price worth paying to prevent
nuclear proliferation among their actual or potential enemies. Meanwhile,
the existing membership must accept an inspection system powerful enough to
detect clandestine weapons development.
Challenge inspections
The 'special inspections' now proposed by the agency could develop into a
system of 'challenge inspections' similar to those permitted under the
US-Soviet arms control treaties. The IAEA must have the right to order
inspections of suspect sites at short notice; and if there is any
obstruction, this will have to be backed up by the UN Security Council
through sanctions or, in the very last resort, military action. There could
perhaps be a dual system under which a special inspection would be carried
out either at the discretion of the agency or on the request of a given
number of member states.
But there is no point in mapping out substantial new powers for the IAEA
unless it is given the resources to match. This year, the agency is having
to cut back all its existing activities by 13 per cent, mainly because the
loss of the Soviet Union's annual contribution of Dollars 20m has triggered
a financial crisis. This is hitting not only the inspection programme but
also the IAEA's work on nuclear safety, which is particularly important
given the number of unsafe Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in eastern
Europe.
Industrialised countries will have to increase their IAEA contributions to
help the agency out of its immediate crisis and then enable it to take on
new responsibilities. But at the same time, developing countries must accept
a change in the geographical balance of IAEA inspection work. Today, 60 per
cent of the inspection programme is devoted to western Europe, Canada and
Japan. In future, it should concentrate more on regions such as the Asia and
the Middle East where the risk of proliferation is greater.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Europe's wild east
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TSARIST times a stone on the main road through the Caucasus marked the
south-eastern limit of Europe. The lands beyond were part of Asia. Since
then, Europe has quietly expanded. All the ex-Soviet republics except
Georgia (disqualified by civil strife) have now been admitted, with
remarkably little discussion, into the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which thus includes the Transcaucasian
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as the four central Asian ones
and Kazakhstan. The same goes, even more astonishingly, for the North
Atlantic Co-operation Council (NACC), a kind of annex in which Nato tries to
make its former adversaries feel at home without offering them any
guarantees.
These arrangements reflect an awareness among Nato countries that they are
no longer threatened by one big neighbour's hostility, but rather by the
fall-out (metaphorical or literal) from conflict among and within a whole
host of neighbours, old and new. War between former Soviet republics can
neither be ruled out nor contemplated with equanimity. The west has an
interest in preventing it.
The war that threatens to break out most imminently is between Armenia and
Azerbaijan. Within the territory of Azerbaijan lies an enclave,
Nagorno-Karabakh, populated mainly by Armenians. These have proclaimed their
independence, but (shades of Croatia) have run into armed resistance from
the Azeri minority within the enclave. The latter are supported by the
government of Azerbaijan, the former by their kith and kin in Armenia. So
far the main fighting has been in and around the enclave, but it could
escalate at any time into war between the republics, especially if further
Armenian advances trigger the downfall of Azerbaijan's president.
Armenian diaspora
If that happened, matters might not stop there. Armenia, a Christian
country, has traditionally looked to Russia or the west for protection.
Before the first world war many Armenians lived in the Ottoman empire, on
what is now Turkish territory. Most of them perished in the genocide of
1915-16, while the survivors fled to the west, where today (especially in
the US) there is an active and influential Armenian diaspora. The Azeris, on
their side, are closely linked to Turkey by language, to Iran by religion
(they are Shia Moslems), and to their immediate neighbours in Iranian
Azerbaijan by both. In Turkey public opinion takes the Azeri side, while
Russians, west Europeans and north Americans seem more disposed to accept
the Armenian version of events. Iranians might instinctively support
fellow-Moslems, but Armenians in Iran have been well treated, by both
imperial and Islamic regimes, and the Tehran government has no interest in
encouraging Azeri separatism.
Joint mediation
Last autumn the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan attempted a joint
mediation which looked promising, but failed. Now Iran's foreign minister is
trying his hand. The leaders of Turkey and Armenia have so far behaved on
the whole with statesmanlike moderation, seeking to overcome rather than
revive past hatreds. But the Turkish prime minister did recently warn the US
against siding with Armenia in the event of war, suggesting that if it did
so Turkey 'could not stand idly by'. Turkish troops have been moved close to
the border.
Nato cannot be indifferent to the danger of a war in which one of its
members (Turkey) might be involved on one side, while the physical survival
of a nation on the other side (Armenia) might be in danger. But Nato as such
is hardly equipped to mediate. That task is best undertaken by the CSCE,
which last week sent a mission to the area and is now inviting both sides to
make use of its disputes settlement procedure, adopted a year ago but so far
untested.
The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia is only one of the potential
disputes arising from the break-up of the Soviet Union that could threaten
international peace and security. The emphasis for now must be on
negotiation. But if the CSCE concludes that a political solution is
impossible without the despatch of peacekeeping troops, this too should
remain an option.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: A couple of lustrous potters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sutton Taylor makes lustred pots of unforgettable beauty. For years now I
have only seen single examples of his pots and looked forward to a major
show. The Oxford Gallery has now mounted a large exhibition of more than 30
recently-made pots by Taylor (until March 18: 0865-242731). A self-taught
potter, Taylor was born in Yorkshire where he still works. He first became
attracted to working in clay while teaching art in Jamaica. Once back in
Yorkshire, he experimented with lustreware, digging the local red clay and
making his own materials. Now in his forties, Taylor has a keen following
and has seen his pots bought for public collections around the world.
Lustreware is a famously capricious technique. It involves firing pots three
times, the last time creating a thick, sooty atmosphere in the kiln so that
the glazes and lustre melt and fuse. If the heat is too intense, instead of
settling into the surface of the vessel the metal salts vaporise and
disappear. No two pots are ever the same, and botches are horribly frequent.
Alan Caiger-Smith, whose work is on permanent show at the Aldermaston
Pottery (0734-713579), is the name which first comes to mind in connection
with lustred ceramics. Another marvellous potter, it was Caiger-Smith's
determination to ignore what was fashionable that eventually made lustreware
respectable again among the cognoscenti after many decades of being regarded
as 'common' - on a par with liking coloured wineglasses.
A Taylor pot could never be confused with a Caiger-Smith, although both
potters throw vessels of classically elegant shapes. However, Caiger-Smith's
pots are always imbued with his sense of the past, in particular his
scholarly appreciation of Islamic and Hispano-Moorish traditions of pottery.
He paints pots with the linear flourishes of a calligrapher.
Taylor, on the other hand, is like an abstract painter. Often the design
covers the whole surface. The palette is subtle and rich, gleaming with the
metallic resonance which comes from glazes made from compounds of gold,
silver, platinum, tantalum and copper. Stray patches of dull gold glint here
and there, and as you tilt a bowl to marvel at its uncanny lightness, it
shimmers. On the inside of one big bowl the colour shifts from deep rose to
bright blue, an effect caused by copper reoxidising at a different rate over
the curved surface. Yet even Taylor's brightest pieces are carefully
controlled, never garish.
Taylor is a constant experimenter. In this exhibition for the first time he
shows porcelain bowls. These, to my eye, are indistinguishable in appearance
from the earthenware. However, in technological terms this is an important
achievement. It had been considered impossible to lustre porcelain because
the glaze requires a higher firing-point than pottery. Lustre, which can
only be fired to 750 degrees, was therefore applied to porcelain pieces as a
surface enamel. Taylor has managed to reduce the melting-point of glaze on
porcelain. However, as one might expect of a canny Yorkshireman, he is not
prepared to reveal the secret of how he does it.
The small porcelain bowls are red-purple, a favourite shade, with bands of
silver on the feet. Among the more exuberant designs I was much taken by a
little conical bowl blazing like a sunset with indigo and salmon, and by a
delightful bottle, neat as a bullfinch in crimson, black and grey. Sometimes
Taylor is clearly inspired by gardens: two plates almost seem to sway with
shadowy leaves and grasses, muted in sage-green, greys, blue and lilac.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Out of the trees to the south rose a tall fluted dome, moon-lit blue
against the deep-toned verdure and the slaty frown of a storm on the Hindu
Kush.' That, of course, is Robert Byron describing Balkh (pictured above) in
The Road to Oxiana, an account of his winter journey through Iran and
Afghanistan in in 1933-34.
Rereading it after 20 years I cannot think that anyone has ever surpassed
Byron at evoking monuments in their landscape setting. But Byron was also a
photographer of talent: this weekend is the last chance to see some 80
fascinating photographs in Along the Golden Road to Samarkand: Photographs
of Monuments in the Middle East by A. W. Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence and Robert
Byron, at the Courtauld Institute (071-873-2526).
Of this trio, Byron's photographs alone have real distinction. TE Lawrence
was a keen photographer, but his shots of Azraq in Jordan - his base in
November 1917 for operations against the Damascus to Baisan railway - and
the streets of Jidda, are pretty unremarkable. However, Lawrence fanatics
may like to know that this set of photographs are the best examples that can
be seen. They are printed from the original glass negatives given by AW
Lawrence (younger brother, fellow-spy, and archaeologist) to the Conway
Library at the Courtauld Institute.
The Byron photographs, however, are sensational, all the towers and mausolea
and mosques he describes in his travel journal - and more. Some few of these
places may look better than when Byron saw them, thanks to restorers. But
many look infinitely worse, thanks to untalented restoration and, in
Afghanistan, to Russian carpet-bombing. What has become of the remaining
minarets of Herat? Byron's thousand or so photographs, which include Russian
architecture in the 1930s, is nothing less than a publisher's goldmine, with
or without the homosexual erotica which has apparently disappeared - into
Professor Anthony Blunt's private collection.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Hobson's Choice - Birmingham Rep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hobson's Choice unites two men, each famous for one thing: Thomas Hobson for
offering customers no choice of horse at his Cambridge stable in the 1620s;
and Harold Brighouse (1882-1958) for writing this one play in 1915.
Brighouse wrote 50 others, and eight novels, but Hobson is his gift to
posterity. This blunt social comedy is treated dependably and wittily by The
Birmingham Rep in a production which balances the finesse and the force of
Brighouse's message.
The play teems with Brighouse's own family connections and with familiar
Lancashire life. Hobson, set in Salford, tells the story of a tyrannical
father whose daughters rebel and take his matrimonial injunctions to the
letter. They marry and leave home, Hobson takes to the bottle, and his
termagant daughter Maggie gives him 'Hobson's choice' of terms for her
return to save his failing health.
Hobson (played by Brian Rawlinson) begins as a champion of commonsense
inveighing against the 'gradual increase of uppishness' from his daughters.
He delivers his prejudices tersely ('you're pretty, but you lie like a gas
meter'), and agrees with his friends that 'a woman's foolishness begins
where a man's leaves off.' His daughter Maggie, superbly acted by Janice
McKenzie, is his opposite, the New Woman of the 1880s who proposes to her
hapless quarry, Willy Mossop, with the words: 'I've been watching you, and
you'll do.' Mossop (well judged by Tom Watt) grows in confidence alongside
her independence.
The play amounts to a series of non-choices constructed by Maggie on the
kind of negotiation that puts others in a position where they cannot harm
you no matter how badly they behave. But there are tender moments: she keeps
her original brass wedding ring to remind herself how far she has risen in
the world; and on her wedding night, fetches her quaking husband from the
parlour couch (in 1915, the Censor's blue pencil hovered over this scene).
The mid-Victorian ethos, all duty and self-help, belies the play's 1880
setting. But the Victorian middle-class concern for the inextricable issues
of money, marriage and respectability persists in Brighouse and in Gwenda
Hughes' solid direction. The design (Ruari Murchison) is, like Brighouse's
prose, bold and straightforward. The acting elsewhere is brisk, if not
always audible. Perhaps the time has come for a Brighouse revival, beginning
with the 1909 Dealing in Futures.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Manon - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manon is the role for which a ballerina might kill. The girl's sexual charm,
her innocent viciousness and kittenish eagerness to have her worldly cake
and eat it, and the luscious rewards of duets and solos, are as alluring for
the dancer as the diamonds with which Monsieur GM buys Manon. But an
underlying strength of the part in Kenneth MacMillan's realisation is that
the character exists in closest physical and emotional rapport with des
Grieux, with Lescaut, and with GM Manon is a show-piece for its men as for
its heroine, and for the dramatic resource of an entire company, and it is a
continuing assertion of the Royal Ballet's integrity as an ensemble that the
drama should still - after 18 years and 121 performances - have such urgency
in the theatre.
Memorable interpretations in the past have stressed the varied appetites -
for money, for sensual gratification, for security - that unite Manon and
her brother with the hapless des Grieux, and with GM So it proved again on
Wednesday night when Viviana Durante and Irek Mukhemedov were the lovers,
and Stephen Jefferies and Derek Rencher appeared as Lescaut and GM We saw,
of course, a quartet of superb theatre artists, playing at their peak.
Durante's Manon now has even greater sexual allure: the girl's awakening to
the rewards her beauty will bring her is immediate, teasingly alert.
An added dimension has been given to this portrait by the rapport that has
evolved during the past season in partnership between Durante and
Mukhamedov. He is not only a wonderfully secure and sympathetic cavalier in
the mechanics of double-work, but his dramatic intelligence gives savour to
every least action. Their pas de deux throughout the evening were absolutely
attuned; they dared everything in emotional and physical response, and we
ecstatically believed. 'All for love' is their cry, and the tensions between
their passion and des Grieux' decency, the irresistible pull of Manon's
temperament and beauty, fuelled a magnificent joint interpretation. Both
artists also savour the choreography, delight in its nuances, and it is
especially rewarding to watch Mukhamedov exploring dances made for the very
different gifts of Anthony Dowell, and yet finding in them new power, and
eloquence. Cast against type, Mukhamedov's vast talent proves that there
need be no 'type' in casting.
We might suppose that neither Stephen Jefferies nor Derek Rencher would now
surprise us in roles which they wear with absolute assurance. But Jefferies'
Lescaut seems darker, more calculating, and more than ever a motive force of
the tale, and Rencher's portrayal of GM more suffused with lust. Grand
interpretations, beautifully judged. From the company no less authoritative
playing, with Fiona Chadwick most happily seen as Lescaut's mistress,
enduring the hazards of the drunken pas de deux with determined grace, as if
unflustered at the prospect of being dropped on her head.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly Poulenc is box-office. In the past few years, the posthumous
Poulenc wave has become a considerable groundswell. Public persons keep
emerging from the closet to confess to adoring his music. The excellent
house for Charles Dutoit's concert with the Philharmonia on Wednesday
(sponsored by NCR) was surely enhanced by the promise of Poulenc's piano
concerto; Dutoit and the pianist Pascal Roge are greatly admired musicians,
but not automatic sell-outs - and the rest of the programme was only Jacques
Ibert's once-popular Escales, post-Impressionist postcards, and Berlioz's
evergreen Symphonie fantastique.
Just why Poulenc's music - shamelessly appealing, innocent of theoretical
pretensions, more and more backward-looking as he went on (though almost
always from an ironic distance) - should strike such a chord with us now is
a topic for musical party-chat. He mined only a few special, expressive
veins, though intensively. Much of his inspired best is in his songs, for
which you need literate French to appreciate them at full value. (An odd
fact is that he was the nearest thing ever to a natural FT composer, being a
pampered scion of the 'Rhone-Poulenc' Poulencs.)
The 1949 piano concerto is not among his best works, no more than the
Sinfonietta that the BBC commissioned from him a bit earlier. The ageing
composer had become self-conscious about his uncertain grip on 'pure'
musical forms, when he hadn't a text or a scenario to set his course; the
Concerto and the Sinfonietta are studded with characteristic ideas, arranged
in hopefully 'symphonic' patterns. Roge rightly went for character. He is a
Poulenc-player with a fine, unsentimental command of the idiom - brisk,
sparkily extrovert, lucid - and Dutoit matched him. When the surface is so
well polished, the composed, wistful feeling speaks for itself.
In Dutoit's hands Ibert's fetching Escales went into Technicolor, with a
determined thrust that sacrificed some of their throwaway charm. (How simple
they sound now] - and yet there were hundreds of other composers who
exploited the same post-Impressionist manner to utterly negligible effect.)
With the Berlioz, one began to wonder whether Dutoit's famous adherence to
strict style hasn't been compromised by his newly international career.
Most of the symphony was loudly dramatic, even hectoring. Suspenseful
pianissimos, an essential Berlioz recourse, were all too rare. As always,
Dutoit set every salient musical idea in high relief (and the first movement
alone is chock-a-block with bolder ideas than any other music of its time,
though we've grown accustomed to them now). Yet the soulful, extra-musical
intimations that Berlioz meant them to capture remained stubbornly
inaudible: we heard nothing much beyond the notes flung at us ' which for a
Symphonie fantastique amounts to being short-changed.

<TEXT>
The first set of monthly figures produced in 1992 by Investment Property
Databank, a property research group, shows signs of a slight improvement,
following a shaky end to last year.
The total return for January was 0.3 per cent, which resulted in a
year-on-year total return of 0.4 per cent. This was the first positive
year-on-year return since July 1990 and an increase of 1.2 per cent on the
previous month.
The year-on-year figure for capital value growth also increased, from -7.9
per cent in December to -6.9 per cent.
The decline in rental value for the year to January was 4.2 per cent, a less
pronounced drop than in previous months.
A comparison between the sectors showed that industrial property mustered
the highest return in January, 0.9 per cent, followed by retails with 0.5
per cent and offices at -0.2 per cent.
Retail property made a poor showing in January with a fall in both rental
and capital growth to -0.1 per cent and a fall in total returns to 0.5 per
cent. Yields moved outwards by 0.11 percentage points to 8.8 per cent.
In January, the office sector registered a -0.9 per cent fall in capital
values and a total return of -0.2 per cent. Yields moved out to 'within a
whisker' of 10 per cent.
The industrial sector made a total return of 0.9 per cent for January,
giving a total return for the year to January of 8.0 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The blandishments of business park developers are at their most seductive on
wet, grimy days in London, when the trains are delayed and escalators on the
London Underground are out of action.
'When you look at our cities today, isn't it sensible to be on the outside
looking in, rather than on the inside struggling to get out?' says
Arlington, one of the largest business park developers in Britain and a
subsidiary of British Aerospace.
Glossy brochures depict well-groomed executives enjoying a sunlit world of
landscaped offices, 'trim trails' and recreation centres, free from the
hassles of conurbations.
With some 10m square feet of business park space let throughout the UK each
year, the message has clearly made its mark. However, the theory is often
better than the practice.
Debenham Tewson Research, a property adviser which has examined the joys and
woes of business park tenants, found that many missed the shopping, leisure
facilities and access to public transport to be found in cities.
Even Stockley Park near Heathrow, probably the best business park in the UK,
inspires mixed feelings. Its tenants wax lyrical about the park's proximity
to Heathrow, a mere 10 minutes away, and the peacefulness and architectural
splendour of the landscaped white pavilions in which they work.
However, the park has only a handful of shops. And driving to the high
streets of nearby Uxbridge or West Drayton is time-consuming and fraught
with parking difficulties. 'It makes it very difficult if you are trying to
run a home as well as work,' says an employee of BP Exploration which moved
to Stockley last summer.
Many business parks are relatively isolated and lack access to good public
transport. Tenants are therefore dependent on cars; this can be tiresome as
it commits people to using the surrounding network of motorways. Visitors to
isolated parks also encounter transport problems. They are frequently
stranded at the local railway station. Bus services are slow and it is often
difficult to catch a taxi. Visitors arriving at Heathrow airport find it
difficult to persuade taxi drivers to give up their place in the lengthy
taxi queue for a mere 10-minute journey to the park.
The environmental credentials of business parks are often exaggerated, say
critics. Business parks promote car use, are situated in pleasant
countryside and undermine the vitality of cities. The extra congestion
caused by business parks, particularly in the south-east, is prompting some
planning authorities consider restrictions on the parking provisions of the
parks.
The switch away from 'the great car society', the tightening of planning
rules and tenants' dissatisfaction with their relative isolation may change
the nature of business parks. A couple of urban parks that can plug into a
town's public transport system have been proposed. And developers are
talking about 'fourth generation parks' large enough to attract the
ancillary amenities needed to satisfy former city-based office workers.
The case against the present generation of business parks is one point that
emerges from a relocation survey carried out by the London Chamber of
Commerce and Industry for Markheath, a property developer. Most companies
that wished to relocate preferred town centres to out-of-town office parks,
primarily because of the availability of public transport.
Access to public transport was regarded as very important by 72 per cent of
respondents and only 2 per cent felt it was unimportant. Some 75 per cent of
respondents thought that an out-of-town office park location was not
important. 'The need to be on the public transport network and close to
shopping and leisure facilities would seem to be more important to firms
than an efficient and isolated business environment,' said the report.
But even if business parks appeal to a minority of companies, they take a
share of a very large market. The London Chamber of Commerce survey found
that 15 per cent of the capital's 1,000 largest companies were planning to
move out of central London within the next three years. The average
relocation involved about 200 employees, the report stated, meaning a
potential loss of some 29,000 jobs in London mostly within the next 18
months.
About two-thirds of the 145 companies intending to relocate want to stay
within the south-east and nearly half of them want to move within the M25
area. The south-east is preferred because of its pool of skilled labour,
easy access to the region, and the presence of other related businesses.
The most common reason for relocating was the inadequacy of companies'
existing premises. The need to rationalise their operations and bring staff
together from scattered buildings vied with the need to cut overheads - such
as rents and rates - as the next most common reason for relocation.
Only four companies cited the level of wages in London as a factor in
deciding to relocate. One telecommunications company said the rent it was
paying on premises in the City to accommodate 25 people was almost as much
as the amount paid for an outer London site housing 300 staff.
The relative unimportance of high London wages as a factor in relocating was
surprising, the survey stated. In fact, the impact of a London weighting of
Pounds 3,000 was equivalent to a cost difference of between Pounds 15 and
Pounds 20 per sq ft of office space.
Dissatisfaction with London - mainly its inefficient transport system,
overcrowding and, curiously, poor staff morale - was also cited as a reason
to move away.
Most of the relocations revealed by the survey were conceived at the height
of the property price boom in the late 1980s. Since then recession and the
fall in property prices have blunted the drive to move out of London, the
report states.
Copies of the report Moving Out are available for Pounds 10 from Markheath,
Markheath House, 31 St George Street, London W1R 9SA.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Management: Making it a game of skill, not of luck - The
training ball is in the government's court. Tony Blair calls for a national
policy / Training on Trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is to be a skills revolution in Britain, we need a national
training policy, not a series of initiatives that come and go with each
political whim.
The possibility is there. Both sides of industry are united on what is
required. It is now up to the government to define that consensus and give
effect to it.
The worst thing a Labour government could do would be to scrap everything
that has been achieved and start again. Labour will retain Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs), but will make them more broadly representative
of their local communities. They should include senior personnel from local
government and trade unions. This is not tokenism. Unless local industry
works with local employees, local education providers and other public
sector bodies, Tecs cannot succeed.
My main difference with the government is that I believe Tecs need to
operate within a clear national framework. This is not inconsistent with the
maximum flexibility in the delivery of training services.
The national policy framework would include the setting up of a national
training body - Skills UK - to help deliver the policy effectively. It will
involve government, employers, unions and others with an interest in
training.
Its work would include setting national targets for the upgrading of skills,
which would be binding on government as well as industry. Labour would give
a much higher priority to the development of the system of national
vocational qualifications (NVQs). The Council for NVQs is doing its best,
yet my impression is that NVQs are still not nearly visible enough, many
employers are confused about their scope and impact, and there are genuine
problems in their assessment and validity. There should be provision made
for the training of those with special training needs who have suffered in
the cuts from government support in the last two years.
Labour would conduct an urgent review of how to balance concern that the
large sums of public money spent by Tecs are properly accounted for; and
investigate the frustration felt by many Tecs at what they see as
over-regulation from central government. Simplifying procedures can make
them more efficient. We will consider sympathetically the call by Tecs for
three-year funding. These and matters such as the exchange and dissemination
of ideas and good practice among Tecs and the strengthening of sectoral
bodies in industry, are the role of national training policy.
We also do not believe a voluntary approach to training will work. We favour
legislation in two specific areas. Around 100,000 young people, possibly
many more, leave school every year and go into work without any structured
training. Five or six years later, they are in their 20s, unskilled and
without a serious career to contemplate.
Tens of thousands more receive training only of the most basic kind. This is
a waste of talent that neither the individuals nor the country can afford.
Labour has proposed legislation to prevent employers employing
school-leavers without a proper training contract.
Secondly, we believe all employers should make some minimum investment in
training their staff or make a payment to the local or national training
effort. No one wants to return to the old Industry Training Board grant-levy
system, though such a system was perhaps better than nothing. The problem
has always been to ensure that employers train, without bureaucracy
outweighing the benefits.
Labour's proposal is to establish a common standard definition of training
expenditure. Companies would disclose training expenditure in their
accounts. Those spending above a minimum level would pay nothing. Those
spending below it would pay the shortfall to their local Tec or national
body. A similar system has operated in France for more than 20 years with
considerable success. Some years ago, we set the minimum contribution at 0.5
per cent of payroll. This is probably too low, and should there be strong
support in industry for a higher target, we would respond favourably.
In no sense is the minimum contribution a penalty. It simply sets a minimum
responsibility and gives the company an option as how to fulfil it. Although
very small companies would be exempt, there may be others which would prefer
to make a payment to the Tec, which would be used to provide training
services for that company and others within the Tec area.
There would also be help for training those in work in our new fund, 'Skills
for the 90s', set out at the time of the last budget. This was aimed at two
areas: skill shortages and giving employed people the chance to acquire
basic skills. The fund would operate flexibly with Tecs and others bidding
for different programmes that would have different types of funding attached
to them.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology: Samsung in deal with HP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LETTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung Electronics, the South Korean company which rivals the leading
Japanese makers in memory chip technology, will later this year launch a
series of low-cost computers based on chip designs pioneered by Hewlett
Packard.
The new Samsung machines will be the result of a series of far-reaching
agreements signed between the two companies, according to Yong Moon Jung,
president of Samsung's telecommunications division.
The agreements will give Samsung access to HP's 'precision architecture'
designs, a form of reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology. Risc
technology, invented by International Business Machines, is becoming
increasingly popular for high-performance personal computers and network
servers.
Samsung will sell the new machines under its own name, but will also sell
versions of the processor to third parties.
The two companies have already collaborated to develop a single-chip version
of precision architecture; IBM, Apple and Motorola in the US have announced
a similar programme to produce a single-chip version of IBM's own Risc chip
set.
Although HP retains ownership of the technology, Samsung claims to have done
most of the work on the new chip and will make it in its South Korean
semiconductor plants for itself, HP and for third parties. It will be the
first time a Far Eastern manufacturer has been able to produce
high-specification microprocessor chips for the mass market.
The deal gives HP extra volume and market leverage to counter competition
from the US makers IBM, Sun Microsystems and Mips, all of which are
currently vying to set the standard for Risc in the 1990s.
Samsung already produces all the main components of PCs except the central
processing unit. Processing units for high-performance IBM-like PCs are
available only from Intel and AMD of the US.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do when the managing director asks you to look into some new
business sector or to solve a management problem? Many people would reply:
'The first thing I'd do would be to try to find a person who knew something
about it'.
Even with the growth of databases, many people prefer the personal approach.
But they may still be overlooking the many academics who study industries
and business subjects, and who have committed their findings to print.
The problem of tackling this source of expertise has now been eased by the
recent publication of a directory of research papers published by academics
at most British management schools and business colleges.
Called Brains,* it lists thousands of academic papers published in 1989 and
1990. It starts with an index under broad categories such as
'decision-making' or 'retailing'. These are then broken down into hundreds
of sub-headings (examples: Deadlines: effect of; or Newcastle Metro Centre:
consumer survey) with references to the individual research papers.
These are listed under the names of the colleges or business schools where
the author teaches, and grouped in geographical areas of the UK. This is so
that people consulting the papers can not only obtain them easily but may
even be able to meet the writer: each institution's telephone number is
listed.
Diana Griffiths, the publisher, points out that in addition to 'refereed'
papers, approved as genuinely original by two senior academics, Brains
contains details of many 'non-refereed' papers, which include articles from
less overtly intellectual journals such as Management Today. These papers
are often hard to find though academic databases.

<TEXT>
AN ELECTRONIC meter maid system, developed in South Africa, could soon find
its way on to streets around the world, alerting traffic wardens to
motorists who overstay their alloted welcome.
Developed by Telkor, of Johannesburg, each electronic meter monitors parking
in up to four carefully labelled parking bays. When the motorist inserts the
money into the appropriate slot, an electronic display shows the time
allotted. When that time expires the meter begins to flash, telling passing
traffic wardens that they need to write a ticket.
Alternatively, a loop in the road, which monitors parking in the four bays,
can be used to send the information to a central computer, so that a traffic
warden can be despatched to catch the culprit.

<TEXT>
THE digital networks that will distribute voice, data and video services
into homes of the future will need very fast chips to act like the silicon
equivalent of a traffic policeman, allowing connection to several selected
services, writes Paul Taylor.
IBM researchers, at Yorktown Heights, New York, have developed such an
ultra-fast switch chip that can handle data at the rate of 5bn bits per
second - more than double any previously reported rate - in each of 16
channels simultaneously. This gives the chip an overall data rate of 80bn
bits per second - equivalent to transferring the text from more that 18,000
average-sized novels in one second.
Other potential applications for the chip include acting as a central
high-speed data traffic controller in a multi-processor network system.
IBM researchers built the experimental chip around a unique three-device
cell - comprising two transistors and one resistor - which allows cells to
be packed much closer together. As a result the new chip offers higher speed
and lower-power consumption than today's chips which use cells with five
transistors each.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Brainwaves speak out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT may sound like something out of a science fiction film, but researchers
in Australia are developing ways of using the latest neural network computer
technology to analyse brainwaves in such a way that people who are unable to
talk or move can still communicate.
Richard Clark, a lecturer in psychology at Flinders University, in Adelaide,
is using the artificial intelligence technique to interpret the electrical
activity in the brain to give simple answers, such as 'yes' or 'no'.
Although it is relatively easy to measure electrical activity in the brain,
each person's brain waves are as individual as fingerprints. Neural
networks, however, learn the various brainwave patterns for each person, so
they can teach themselves to recognise the responses.
Patients wearing the specially devised electro-cap, containing devices to
measure brainwaves, are trained to think simple answers in response to a
series of questions. Having conquered a basic vocabulary, Clark is now
aiming to expand the lexicon.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): DIY computer architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY large corporate computer users have decided the time is right to
determine the architecture of their systems themselves, rather than allow
computer vendors to decide it for them. But how do you go about defining the
architecture that best suits the business?
In its recent report Managing Technical Architecture the Butler Cox
Foundation, a service provided by the CSC Index Group, says that defining an
architecture requires a staged approach.
To begin with the company should establish the corporate-level policies that
govern the organisation's IT, then it should identify categories of users
and support, and specify the IT platform requirements for each class of
support.
Once the most appropriate scenario is tested, a migration plan should be
developed and the architecture continually reviewed in the light of business
and technology changes.
The most difficult task, according to Butler Cox, is to work out the right
relationship between the architecture and the business's needs.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology: An uphill struggle - Raymond Snoddy asks if HDTV
programmes have any future in Europe's broadcasting industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Barsac is almost in love with high-definition television. He is not
an engineer drooling over the number of lines in the new high-technology
pictures nor a Eurocrat trying to devise an industrial strategy designed to
keep the Japanese and the Americans at bay. Barsac is a French television
director who has been making programmes in high-definition for the past
three years.
'I don't want to work in conventional television. High definition is a kind
of paradise. I don't want to come back to earth and be put into the jail of
the little box,' he says.
The paradise he is talking about is framed by wide screen, 16-by-9 ratio TV
pictures with four times the present resolution, and the jail is the normal
4-by-3 box-like shape of existing TV sets.
Barsac is part of a 350-strong multinational team which has been
broadcasting HDTV pictures from the recent Winter Olympics in Albertville,
France. It is the most extensive - and expensive - demonstration so far of
the European high-definition system based on 1,250 lines and 50 Hertz using
the HD-Mac standard.
Manufacturers Thomson and BTS, the Phillips-Bosch joint venture, delivered a
13-hour-a-day service to 50 sites around Europe using four satellites. The
pictures and compact disc-quality sound produced were spectacular by
conventional television standards.
Outside broadcasting equipment worth around Dollars 90m (Pounds 51m) was
brought together and a total of 35 high-definition cameras, including the
latest solid-state lightweight versions, were trained on everything from the
men's downhill event to ice hockey matches.
The French government, France Telecom and the European Commission combined
to pay for the two-week Olympic channel which cost approximately Pounds
8m-Pounds 9m.
The technology worked almost like a conventional outside broadcast. The real
challenge for the Olympic producers and cameramen was to learn a new
grammar. Because there is so much more to see in the picture everyone had to
exercise restraint and realise that there is less need for close-ups or
cutting rapidly from one shot to the next. 'The brain makes the close-ups,'
commented Barsac.
Chris Dingley, a senior cameraman from the Thames Television team at
Albertville working under French directors, said he has been converted to
HDTV.
He is working on The Return of Columbus, the official European Commission
high-definition film being made by Thames Television for the Seville Expo in
April.
Walther Fitz, a senior broadcasting engineer from ORF, the Austrian
broadcasting organisation, is equally enthusiastic. He was involved in the
coverage of the women's downhill event at Meribel and believes he was
getting more comprehensive and compelling coverage of the event with six
high-definition cameras than he would have done with 20 conventional
cameras.
But as the high-definition images from the Olympic closing ceremony at
Albertville faded at the weekend the real question is what happens next.
'We have demonstrated that it works. Someone has to pick up the ball and run
with it,' says Brian Scott, former head of engineering at Thames who is
deputy director general of Vision 1250, the EC supported group set up to
promote the high-definition system.
After the Seville Expo, where all the stands will be linked by a
high-definition service running at least 12 to 14 hours a day, Vision 1250
plans to move on to the summer Olympics in Barcelona and distribute the
pictures to 800 centres around Europe.
Despite the undoubted technical achievement, and the increasing enthusiasm
of producers for making programmes in the high-definition format, a large
number of difficult questions still need to be addressed.
Who will start broadcasting a high-definition channel in Europe and what
will it show? Will consumers be willing to pay Pounds 3,000, at least at the
outset, for bulky new television sets or will the future have to wait until
large but flat screens are developed?
And perhaps most fundamental of all, have the Europeans struggled to catch
the Japanese lead in high-definition only to be bypassed by the Americans?
The US high-definition system is fully digital whereas both the current
Japanese and European systems combine the old analogue with digital
technology.
EC money is clearly available to back European moves towards wide-screen
television using existing D2-Mac broadcasts.
Jean Dondelinger, EC commissioner responsible for audiovisual policy,
recently described wide-screen television as 'an essential part of the
evolution towards HDTV'. Sums of between Ecu 800m (Pounds 567m) and Ecu 1bn
are being talked about over five years to support such a venture.
An 'almost final' package on a satellite broadcasting standards directive
includes an insistence that only HD-Mac be used for non-digital HDTV
transmissions and that only D2-Mac be used for non-digital broadcasts for
conventional 625-line television in the wide screen 16:9 format.
Next month Ferguson, the UK Thomson subsidiary, will launch Britain's first
wide-screen television which can receive a range of standards including
D2-Mac. It will retail at Pounds 3,500.
British Sky Broadcasting is considering launching a wide-screen version of
one of its subscription film channels. This would involve a duplicate
transmission of the channel in D2-Mac.
The decision on whether or not to go ahead will depend on financial support
from the commission and a judgment on whether, say, 10 per cent of Sky's 1m
movie subscribers would be prepared to pay a premium to see the films in the
cinema-style format in which they were made.
In the US the perspective is different. Joe Flaherty, senior vice president
for technology at CBS, the US network, warned that Europe should not waste
time in planning transitions to the new technology but instead adopt an
all-digital HDTV satellite and cable transmission system immediately.
Many European engineers are, however, sceptical about how quickly the
American system can be turned into a real consumer product.
Fitz of ORF, which last year produced Mozart's Magic Flute and Requiem in
HDTV, hopes that he can complete a hat trick by helping to introduce the new
system before he retires in three years time. He was involved in the
launching of both black and white and colour television broadcasts in
Austria.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Budget '92): Lamont's first eight
hide from the spotlight - Peter Marsh on growing pressure for a shadowy team
of monetary experts to be more forthcoming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT of the sharpest minds in the Civil Service are advising Mr Norman
Lamont on the tricky and also politically charged question of whether to cut
interest rates on or near Budget day. As the chancellor comes under pressure
to stimulate the economy ahead of the election, he will be drawing heavily
on the collective thoughts of the eight - a joint committee of Treasury and
Bank of England officials assessing monetary policy.
It is also charged with considering how the tax cuts Mr Lamont may announce
in the Budget on March 10 would fit in with any relaxation in borrowing
rates.
The committee's meetings are unpublicised, and it has no formal name. The
details of the officials' advice to Mr Lamont remain secret, though some
private-sector economists believe that opening up the committee's
deliberations could help the financial markets judge UK economic policy,
strengthening the government's credibility.
The members of the committee meet monthly at the Treasury and confer less
formally whenever the need arises, sometimes over a secure telephone link
between the Treasury and the Bank.
For much of the past two months, they will almost certainly have been urging
caution over interest rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent since
early September. They will have argued that, with sterling trading well
below its DM2.95 central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System, a loosening in policy would risk the pound dropping below
its lower ERM limit.
The pound has steadied in the past 10 days, providing possible justification
for a rate cut which many argue is needed to hasten recovery from the
18-month recession.
The monthly meetings of the eight take place in the office of Sir Terry
Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury, who takes the chair. There are
three other Treasury officials - Professor Alan Budd, the government's chief
economic adviser, and Mr Michael Scholar and Mr Paul Gray, who work on
monetary policy.
The four from the Bank are Mr Tony Coleby, executive director in charge of
home finance; Mr Ian Plenderleith, the Bank's markets supremo; Professor
Mervyn King, economics director; and Mr John Townend, who has responsibility
for UK government bonds (gilts) and money markets. Other colleagues, such as
Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's international director, and more junior civil
servants sometimes attend.
The official view is that the topics discussed at the meetings must be
confidential. This means that the menu of options presented to the
chancellor can be kept as broad as possible, without the risk of sensitive
information leaking. Few in Whitehall like to talk about the gatherings; one
senior Treasury man says he has never heard of the committee. Yet it can be
assumed that their current mood is far from cheery.
Treasury officials in particular are smarting from their well-publicised
failure to foresee the length or depth of the recession.
At the meetings, both the Treasury and the Bank present their assessments of
the economy. After discussion, recommendations for monetary and fiscal
policy are presented at a later stage to Mr Lamont.
One person with close knowledge of the issues says both sides have been in
general agreement about the progress of the economy over the past 18 months.
But underlying tensions can surface. An economist who follows the meetings
says: 'The Bank and the Treasury feel they are in a power struggle, with
each side trying to prove itself at the expense of the other.'
Some outside economists think the Treasury and Bank could benefit by
releasing a precis of what is discussed at the meetings.
Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, the London stockbroker,
believes detailed statements would iron out ambiguities in messages about
policy which leak out via other channels.
Mr Giles Keating, director of economics at Credit Suisse First Boston, a
Swiss-owned bank, says: 'It would be a more healthy and open way of doing
things, which could increase confidence.'
However, those close to the meetings oppose that view. One says: 'If the
committee publicised its assessment, it would mean the markets took more
notice of the official view of the economy than was justified. Don't forget
that both the Treasury and the Bank can - and often do - get things
completely wrong.'
A monetary official says there is little hope of releasing more details
without a general move towards more openness by the government.
'You could envisage a system where the gist of what civil servants at the
Treasury and the Bank think about the economy is made public,' he says.
'But what if the chancellor disagreed? He wouldn't like it, and the
committee would end up looking silly.'

Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONIST and nationalist leaders succeeded yesterday in persuading the
government to hold a rare Commons' debate on Northern Ireland next Thursday
as part of efforts to encourage political dialogue in the province, Ralph
Atkins writes.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, and Mr
John Hume, of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, agreed to
ask for the debate jointly at a private meeting at Westminster.
They are to meet again today in Belfast to discuss how obstacles to formal
political negotiations can be overcome. Mr Molyneaux said the three leaders
were 'endeavouring diligently' to fulfil a call by Mr John Major for them to
find a way of restarting talks. There is no signs yet that any progress has
been made, however.
Northern Ireland debates are usually related to specific motions - for
instance on anti-terrorism measures or renewing powers for 'direct rule'.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Heseltine move to boost rural jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RURAL job creation schemes and new guidance on planning for rural
development were part of an Action for the Countryside package launched by
the government yesterday.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the package demonstrated a
new co-ordinated government approach to conservation and development. 'There
has to be development if our countryside is to survive in good heart into
the next century,' he said.
The package is a joint initiative by the environment department, the
agriculture ministry and three countryside organisations. Much of it is a
reshaping of existing schemes and finance, but Mr Heseltine said Pounds
31.5m of new money would be allocated over the next three years.
Schemes to boost rural economies will be run through the Rural Development
Commission. More money is to go into grants for the conversion of redundant
buildings in agricultural areas into tourist accommodation or shops.
Mr Heseltine said the government remained committed to strict planning
control in green belts. But it would promote a shift in emphasis from
retaining farmland to developing rural economies while protecting landscapes
and wildlife habitats.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Lib Dems defend remit of EC Social Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGISLATION from the European Community's Social Charter merely reflects
what good employers already do, and would affect only the less reputable, Mr
Jim Wallace, the Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, said yesterday.
Addressing a Sign the Social Charter meeting organised by the Trades Union
Congress, Mr Wallace stressed that his party rejected the government's
'opt-out' from the Social Charter in spite of some hostile comments made
about the charter by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader.
Ms Rhiannon Chapman, director of the Industrial Society, the independent
organisation that promotes good industrial relations, suggested an
exchange-rate-mechanism style banding for more controversial proposals in
the social field. A banding formula, allowing a multi-speed social Europe,
would widen support for proposals and increase the likelihood of compliance
by providing an 'interim stage on the way to full implementation', she said.
Ms Jill Andrew, chair of the social legislation committee of the London
Chamber of Commerce, said the implementation of the Social Charter in its
current form would result in increased job-shedding if companies were forced
to cut costs to accommodate directives.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Scotland's recession shallower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in Scotland is less severe than in the UK as a whole but
recovery north of the border is likely to be weaker, according to economists
from the Scottish Office writing in the latest Scottish Economic Bulletin.
Surveys of business and consumer confidence in the autumn and the fall in
unemployment for two successive months in that period, are cited as evidence
of the shallowness of the recession compared with the UK as a whole. This is
reinforced by evidence from production and construction indices to date,
showing the recession to be less severe than that of 1979-81.
Although the Scottish economy grew faster than that of the UK as a whole
between 1988 and last year, recovery will be weaker this year.
Job losses are likely to be lower in Scotland this year, but forecasters
expect sluggish employment growth in the medium term.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): First Tec trainee charter announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM Training and Enterprise Council will be the first of the 82 Tecs
in England and Wales to introduce a trainee charter. This will set out the
rights and obligations of those taking part in training programmes.
Organisations providing such programmes for the Birmingham Tec will find
that agreement to observe the charter is a contractual requirement, a Tec
official explained yesterday.
Drawing up the charter, the text of which is circulating in Birmingham
training circles, is part of a general effort to raise training standards in
the city.
It is also a response to specific complaints from trainees about standards.
This, last year, led Birmingham Tec to cancel contracts with Acafess and
Cobalt UK, two local training companies.
The text of the charter to be introduced by Birmingham explains that it has
been drawn up after talks with trainees.
It specifies that each trainee should have a personal training plan agreed
with the training organisation.
The charter sets out the right to continuous assessment and states that
details of the trainees' hours of work, holidays and payments should be
given in writing.
It makes clear that the training should be undertaken 'by experienced and
qualified staff' in 'a safe and properly equipped training and working
environment'.
In return the trainee, under the terms of the charter, agrees to regular
attendance and good timing and accepts the obligation to notify the training
organisation in advance of any absence, including that for job interviews.
The trainee is expected to show 'responsible behaviour'.
A complaints procedure is also built into the charter. First, a trainee
should take up any grievance with the training organisation.
If this is not met the trainee is advised to contact the Birmingham Tec.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Profits sighted as Nelson's silver sold: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAIR of candlesticks shaped like telescopes made in 1801 for Lord Nelson
sold for Pounds 22,000, double their estimate, at Sotheby's yesterday. They
are weighted at the bottom for use on board ship and carry the initials N
and B, for Lord Nelson and his other title, Duke of Bronte.
The candlesticks were part of an auction of silver which did extremely well,
totalling Pounds 864,479 in the morning session with 7 per cent unsold.
London dealers were particularly interested in about 100 lots of silver
acquired early in the 19th century by Thomas John, 2nd Baron Newborough, and
sold yesterday by his descendants. The auction totalled Pounds 640,629 with
nearly every item sold.
When, in 1823, Lord Newborough came of age, he went on a spending spree and
bought silver plate from London's finest goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge and
Rundell, and Green, Ward, Green and Ward. London dealer Koopman paid Pounds
79,200 for a pair of silver soup tureens, one made by Paul Storr and the
other by Benjamin Smith to designs supplied by Rundells. He also paid Pounds
60,500 for an oval silver-gilt tray from Rundells.
Meanwhile, in Monaco on Wednesday, Sotheby's held an exceptionally
successful auction of 18th century French furniture from the collection of
the Schlumberger family, best known for its oil-drilling interests. The sale
totalled FFr29.12m (Pounds 2.97m) with just 1 per cent unsold.
A pair of Louis XVI console tables - made by Jacques Dubois around 1770 and
originally sold to the Russian Count Stroganov - went for Pounds 906,585,
comfortably above forecast. The Soviet government had disposed of them in
1931 when it was raising money from arts sales.
A Louis XVI commode, the combined work of Weisweiler and Riesener, realised
Pounds 402,338, and a console table with a gilt bronze mask of Apollo, by
Riesener alone, doubled its estimate at Pounds 339,969.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Securities Institute launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROFESSIONAL body for the securities industry, modelled on institutes in
the accountancy and legal professions, has been launched.
The Securities Institute aims to attract members of the London Stock
Exchange as well as people working in related fields such as investment
analysis, corporate finance and investment management. The institute will
send applications to potential members at the weekend.
The creation of the body is in part a reaction to the Big Bang reforms of
six years ago, when control of the exchange passed from individual
stockbrokers to securities firms. Since then, many brokers have bemoaned the
passing of the old 'club' spirit with the demise of the trading floor, and
there have been complaints that the exchange has lost interest in its
individual members.
Mr Graham Ross Russell, chairman of the institute and a former deputy
chairman of the exchange, said he hoped that membership of the body would be
'useful for members' career prospects' and would give clients added
confidence in their advisers. The body will also introduce its own
examinations, and would re-create some of the exchange's old club
activities, he said.
Unlike other professional bodies, the institute will not play a large role
in regulating its members. Statutory regulation passed under the Financial
Services Act from the exchange to the Securities and Futures Authority
(formerly The Securities Association), and this will remain the main
regulator for the industry.
Individual brokers will continue to look mainly to satisfying the SFA's
requirements for 'registered representatives'. The institute, which has the
support of the SFA and the exchange, will administer the SFA's examinations.
Existing exchange members will be accepted automatically by the institute,
while others will have to pass the institute's examinations and have
references from two existing members.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Peace is one thing, cash another: The new world order is
pulling at United Nations' purse-strings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST FOUR weeks after President George Bush and leaders of a dozen other
nations gathered in New York to solemnly proclaim a central role for the
United Nations in 'the new world order', alarms are sounding over the cost
of their grand design.
Members always knew that sending UN troops into the field could be
expensive, but a shock wave ran through the Security Council when Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the new secretary-general, submitted his Dollars 633.5m
budget for a year-long operation in Yugoslavia.
Although he said that UN military intervention offered the best hope for
preventing renewal of the civil war, full deployment of the 14,000-person
force has had to be delayed. The US, Britain, France, Russia and China - the
five permanent members of the Security Council - want him to pare costs by
at least Dollars 100m.
These veto-wielding countries must pay the lion's share - 56.155 per cent -
of peacekeeping bills for the privilege of retaining their 'special
responsibilities' under the UN Charter.
This represents an international treaty binding on all members, yet few
states honour their obligations. When Mr Boutros Ghali took over from Mr
Javier Perez de Cuellar at the beginning of the year, only 25 out of 159
members (new admissions by next week will have increased the number to 175)
had paid all their assessments. That left a deficit of Dollars 816.5m, equal
to 45 per cent of the 1991 budget.
The biggest debtor by far was the US, which also has the highest assessment
 -25 per cent - based on a combination of factors including population and
gross national product (GNP). The US administration has promised to pay its
dues of more than Dollars 500m, but the US Congress still has not authorised
funding.
The world body soon will launch its most ambitious peacekeeping enterprise
ever: a massive, 16-month-long plan to democratise and rehabilitate
Cambodia. This is a country with virtually no infrastructure, and the UN
will have to bring in even the most basic of essentials. Mr Boutros Ghali
has put the total cost, to be paid by assessments, at Dollars 1.9bn. On top
of that, Dollars 800m is needed in voluntary contributions to resettle
350,000 Cambodian refugees, 170,000 internally displaced persons and 150,000
demobilised troops.
Critics again are shouting 'Too Much]', and the secretary-general's appeal
for a Dollars 200m down-payment to start the operation has gone unanswered.
UN costs for Yugoslavia and Cambodia together will come in at more than four
times the Dollars 700m that UN members were asked to pay last year for
peacekeeping. And there may be more expenses to come.
Projected UN peacekeeping in Spain's former territory of Western Sahara
during a referendum on its political future is expected to be budgeted at a
minimum of Dollars 177m.
A tenuous ceasefire in Somalia brokered by the UN has been hailed as Mr
Boutros Ghali's first diplomatic triumph, but a UN operation in Somalia
could be costly and dangerous. It might even be unpopular, if a miserly
response of only Dollars 20m donated so far to a Dollars 621m appeal for
voluntary humanitarian relief is any guide.
Including Cambodia, where an advance group of about 1,400 personnel is
already in place, there are 10 peacekeeping operations around the world
today, all running large deficits. Thirteen similar missions have been
disbanded since the first was begun in 1948. One is still going strong:
monitoring the Arab-Israel ceasefire.
Mr Boutros Ghali, a shrewd diplomat whose no-nonsense style has won critics
as well as admirers, foresaw that those euphoric participants at the UN
summit might sing another tune when they had to reckon with costs. He has
been mandated to produce by July 1 recommendations for a new, stronger UN in
a report that must also address the financial implications.
In the aftermath of the Gulf War, the UN is struggling to fulfil its mandate
to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, block President Saddam
Hussein's nuclear aspirations and ensure that Kuwaitis and others who
suffered under Iraqi occupation receive compensation. So far, a commission
set up to handle this has received a paltry Dollars 17m.
Iraq is supposed to foot most of the bill. But sanctions remain in force,
and Mr Saddam refuses even to sell the Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil that the
Security Council has agreed he may ship to meet urgent needs. Officials say
there is a real possibility that the Commission may have to close shop.
One of a number of top UN officials now crunching numbers observed: 'The
members want to buy a Boeing 747, but all they're willing to pay for is a
two-seater Piper Cub.'

THE US Food and Drug Administration has insufficient mechanisms for
approving and monitoring the safety of non-prescription drugs sold
over-the-counter, a Congressional report warned yesterday, writes Alan
Friedman from New York.
The report, by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found numerous examples of health hazards associated with widely
used over-the-counter drugs.
It stressed, however, that while the FDA has full authority to examine the
safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, this is not the case for
over-the-counter products.
Members of the House of Representatives small business committee, which
commissioned the GAO report, are seeking a more rigorous system under which
the FDA can review non-prescription drugs.
The over-the-counter drug market had Dollars 11.2bn of sales in 1990, with
more than 125,000 different products available, according to the GAO report.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Brazil and Argentina look towards June deal on foreign debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA's first and third most indebted countries are on track to
secure outline agreements with bank lenders before mid-year. These could
represent a significant step towards resolution of the foreign debt problems
that have plagued them for a decade, according to bankers.
Brazil and Argentina could secure the outline accords by early summer, ahead
of the 10th anniversary in August of the announcement by Mexico that it
could not meet its debts: a move which marked the start of the third world
debt crisis.
'I'm optimistic that we can get agreements in principle with both
governments by June,' said Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, the
US bank that leads the bank advisory committees to both countries.
Agreements in principle leave many details to be resolved, and acceptance by
almost all bank lenders is required before they take effect. This process
usually takes several months.
Bankers have long said that an Argentine deal should be easier to achieve
than one for Brazil. 'The Argentine deal should follow the text book more
closely. Brazil is improving, but it's more of a minefield,' said Mr Paul
Luke of Chartered WestLB, a London-based merchant bank and debt trader.
The 'text book' is provided by Mexico's debt restructuring completed in
March 1990, the first large deal to be completed under the initiative named
after the US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady.
The main difference between the two is the availability of the so-called
enhancements, guarantees for interest and capital payments on concessional
bonds that the governments will issue to banks in exchange for old bank
loans.
Argentina is well placed to cover the maximum Dollars 3bn in enhancements it
will need to restructure roughly Dollars 24bn of bank debt and Dollars 8bn
of interest arrears. Its expected three-year extended fund facility (EFF)
with the International Monetary Fund will trigger extra funds from Japan and
other sources for the enhancement pool.
Brazil, which announced late on Wednesday that it had secured agreement for
rescheduling part of its Dollars 24bn debt to government creditors of the
Paris Club, has a smaller Dollars 2bn pool available for enhancements on its
Dollars 40bn bank debt.
Its 18-month standby loan from the IMF attracts less money than an EFF, a
facility unavailable to Brazil until it has met its targets for the standby
loan. The lack of an EFF means there will be no funds from Japan, which is
supporting the Argentine programme, while the World Bank is holding back
money until it has had time to analyse the success of the IMF programme.
This shortage of funds will have a several consequences. The two sides will
have to agree - for the first time in any Brady-style deal - the phasing-in
of enhancements over time. Banks accepting concessional bonds will therefore
need confidence in Brazil's longer-term ability and willingness to top up
the pool of enhancements.
It also means that Brazil will have to encourage more banks to make further
loans rather than take concessional bonds, in part by asking them to put up
a smaller percentage of exposure in new loans (probably 16-17 per cent for
Brazil versus 25 per cent for Argentina). This will reduce the scale of debt
reduction achieved by Brazil.
That is not to suggest that Argentine negotiations will be problem-free.
There is concern about inflation - its current IMF standby programme assumes
7 per cent inflation for 1992, while retail prices will have risen by more
than 5 per cent in the first two months of the year.
There are significant differences too between the latest Argentine proposal
and the banks' response.
Mr Lawrence Brainard, an economist with Goldman Sachs and a former leading
economic adviser to several bank advisory committees, suggests that banks
will not gain any benefits if they push Argentina to make greater
concessions.
'The Argentine offer to the banks is even a bit generous leaving only modest
room, in our view, for further improvements,' said Mr Brainard, basing his
analysis on the government's fiscal position. If the banks push for too
much, they increase the likelihood that the deal will fail.
He has also pointed out that the economic boost obtained by Mexico following
its agreement with banks will probably not be seen in Argentina, in part
because the accord is already discounted by financial markets. A deal will
mean Argentina increasing interest payments to banks from the Dollars 60m a
month it is currently paying, rather than reducing them as in the case of
Mexico.

<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S army said yesterday it had found six soldiers guilty for last
November's massacre of civilians in East Timor and would court martial eight
others, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
General Edi Sudradjat, army chief of staff, announcing the findings of a
special military council investigating the November shooting, told reporters
that a further five soldiers were being investigated.
An earlier government- installed national commission said the troops killed
about 50 people, while witnesses say at least 100 people died when soldiers
fired into a crowd of East Timorese independence demonstrators attending a
funeral.
The report of the national commission put much of the blame on the security
forces and yesterday's announcement should help to appease Indonesia's major
aid donors, who have demanded that soldiers be punished for their role in
the shooting.
Those found guilty include two generals - the former East Timor military
commander and regional military commander - who were relieved of their posts
in late December.
Of the six, General Sudradjat said three had been dismissed from the
military, two had been removed from active duty but had been allowed to keep
their uniforms, and one was temporarily off active duty.
The eight soldiers being court-martialled include four junior officers,
three non-commissioned officers and one private.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA suffered its lowest rate of economic growth in a decade in the
financial year now ending, according to the government's economic survey
published yesterday.
The estimated 2.5 per cent growth in real gross domestic product - or a
little more than the growth in population - was the result of stagnant
agricultural output.
Growth in all industries turned negative after rising 10 per cent the
previous year (based on six-month figures), while manufacturing output
dropped by 2.5 per cent after climbing 11.4 per cent the year before.
The industrial recession - which is likely to continue into the new
financial year - was caused by the impact of high interest rates, curbs on
imports because of balance of payments pressures, and the sluggishness of
world markets. The survey shows that imports in dollar terms fell by 17 per
cent in 1991-1992 while exports fell by 6 per cent. As a result the trade
deficit narrowed to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 5.9bn in 1990-91.
One of the most encouraging signs in the survey is a build-up in foreign
exchange reserves which have climbed to Dollars 4.4bn from a low point of
Dollars 1.1bn (equivalent to two week's imports) at the end of June. Most of
the increase comes from fresh lending by multilateral institutions.
The survey shows how close India came to default on its external debt last
year. Unable to obtain fresh commercial borrowings abroad, it suffered a net
outflow of Dollars 952m between April and June from expatriate Indians
taking out their non-resident deposits. The survey says that the net outflow
of non-resident deposits only came to a stop in January.
The Finance Ministry's survey of the economy tracks its failure so far to
achieve a substantial reduction in the inflation rate which touched a peak
of 16.7 per cent in August but has fallen since then to 12 per cent.
Money supply growth (M3) for the year is likely to end up at 15 per cent
above the previous year, and two percentage points above target. This
reflects both continuingly high net government borrowing from the Central
Bank and the build-up of the foreign exchange reserves.

sales

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Pentagon official yesterday called on allies of the US to step up
pressure on China to curb ballistic missile exports and transfers of nuclear
technology.
Mr James Lilley, assistant secretary of defence for international security
affairs, said the task should not be left to the US alone.
He hoped Beijing would take the 'wise course' of curtailing deliveries in
keeping with its decision last year to adhere to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and comply with western guidelines on
missile-related sales.
Failure to do so would justify 'a very strong demarche' from the US and its
allies, he told a conference on Asia-Pacific defence.
His comments followed recent reports of Chinese sales of missile components
to Iran and other Middle East countries.
Mr Lilley said the west must also use economic leverage to persuade North
Korea to back down from developing nuclear weapons. Earlier this week, Mr
Robert Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told a
Congressional committee North Korea was between 'a few months' and 'a couple
of years' from making a nuclear bomb.
Mr Lilley said difficulties over ratifying and inspection agreements with
the International Atomic Energy Agency appeared to be a 'delaying tactic'
while Pyongyang proceeded with nuclear reprocessing facilities. He described
the latest evidence of North Korean activities as 'ominous.'
The US, which had already postponed the second phase of planned troop
withdrawals from South Korea, needed to maintain a military deterrent, Mr
Lilley said.
It had to be made clear to Pyongyang that it would be denied economic
assistance and international respectability as long as it pursued its
programme.
Mr Francois Heisbourg, the director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, warned that the issue could blow up into 'a massive
international crisis'.
However, these warnings were challenged by a prominent Chinese rocket
scientist and academic, Dr Hua Di, who said North Korea was incapable of
making nuclear weapons and was deceiving the west in order to improve its
bargaining power.

FT  28 FEB 92 / S Africa drought 'may hit economic growth figures'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE effects of widespread drought on grain production in South Africa could
negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the
year, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said
yesterday.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the
recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year. However, Mr van
Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer
rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could
be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.'
His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern
Africa could cause famine in much of the region.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry
conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal
harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on
the average.
It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the
area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food.
Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most
seriously affected.
The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for
southern Africa this year. Total food imports for the region could be as
high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year.
Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said,
with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal
imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail
wagons.
It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention
was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq
and the Horn of Africa.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Tokyo rejects China's claim over islands
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN HAS strongly condemned a formal claim by China to a group of disputed
islands in the East China Sea that Beijing now says could be defended with
force.
In a rare public criticism of Beijing by a Japanese leader, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, said yesterday that a new Chinese law
asserting control over the Senkaku islands is in breach of an understanding
reached between the two countries.
China refers to the five uninhabitated islands and three reefs as the
Diaoyutai group, and has complained that a beacon built on one island by a
right-wing Japanese group violates Beijing's 'ancient' authority over the
group.
The two countries generally maintain an uneasy silence over the ownership of
the islands in line with a pronouncement by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount
Chinese leader, that the issue should be settled by 'future generations.'
But Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan protested in late 1990 when
the Japanese government recognised that the beacon was legitimate, and sent
coast guard vessels to turn away a Taiwanese boat wanting to moor on the
islands, which are about 200km east of Taiwan and 300km west of Okinawa.
Mr Miyazawa said yesterday the dispute was 'closed,' implying that Japanese
sovereignty has already been asserted.
Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the Chinese claim was
'unacceptable.'
The new legislation, apparently introduced at the urging of the People's
Liberation Army, provides for China to evict 'trespassers' and asserts
Chinese control over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, which are
contested by Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines.
On Wednesday, the Japanese embassy in Beijing protested to the Chinese
government, while China's ambassador to Tokyo was yesterday called to the
Foreign Ministry to hear a formal complaint from the Japanese government.
Neither country wants to be drawn into more than exchanges of protests over
the islands, but they remain a potential source of conflict in the region.
Tokyo officials expressed dismay that the controversy comes as the two
governments are preparing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
normalisation of their relations.

A South African police captain who admits he sympathised with the mainly
Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party says he ordered attacks on anti-apartheid
activists in 1988, some of the most striking evidence yet of links between
the security forces and Inkatha.
Captain Brian Mitchell, on trial for the 1988 murder of 11 mourners at a
funeral vigil, said on Wednesday that he ordered subordinates to attack
members of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front (UDF) - a close ally
of the African National Congress (ANC) - and was shocked to discover that
they had instead ambushed a house filled with mourners.
Anti-apartheid organisations allege that police have often instigated unrest
and sided with Inkatha in township violence which has left over 10,000
people dead since 1985.
The celebrated Trust Feeds killings, for which Capt Mitchell is being tried,
increased tensions in the Natal township where supporters of the ANC and
Inkatha have waged war since the mid-1980s.
Prosecutors allege that Capt Mitchell, who is white, led the attack at the
request of a local Inkatha leader. He and another white captain on trial
have pleaded innocent.
Five black constables charged in the case also pleaded innocent.
Capt Mitchell said he regarded himself as a soldier engaged in a civil war
where the UDF were enemies of the state.

<TEXT>
MR Shin Kanemaru, the elder statesman of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, yesterday added his voice to demands for the Bank of Japan to cut
interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy.
He also strongly attacked the central bank's independence, saying it was Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who had the power to make decisions on
monetary policy, not Mr Ysushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor.
'They say the Bank of Japan governor has the authority on the official
discount rate but the prime minister is almighty,' said Mr Kanemaru at a
meeting of the LDP's largest faction, of which he is currently president.
Mr Kanemaru called for a further cut in the ODR of 0.5 percentage points to
4.5 per cent, saying that if the rate had been cut by 1 percentage point at
the time of the last reduction in December, instead of 0.5 percentage point,
the economy 'would not have declined so suddenly.'
Mr Mieno, speaking at a regular press conference, said he saw no need for a
further easing in monetary policy. He said the economy was slowing but there
was no risk of a sudden sharp downturn in growth.
As Mr Kanemaru's remarks show, politicians and businessmen are becoming
increasingly vociferous in their demands for further cuts. Recent economic
data indicate that the economy is slowing faster than the authorities
expected.
The central bank's independence is enshrined in law. But in practice it is
susceptible to influence from the government through the ministry of
finance, not least because the ministry traditionally has a voice in
appointing central bank governors.
Mr Mieno has said that de facto independence relied heavily on the central
bank maintaining a reputation for timely changes in policy. He said that
while he consulted government officials and businessmen, he kept his
distance from politicians.
Further evidence of the slowing of the economy came with publication of
figures showing household spending in December fell in real terms by 0.8 per
cent, the first decline in a year. For the year as a whole, household
spending rose by just 1.7 per cent in real terms, according to the
government's management and co-ordination agency.

PROVINCIAL politicians in Japan yesterday applauded the government's
decision to exclude rice from a list of food trade items to be liberalised,
and agriculture officials added barley, wheat and dairy products to the list
of exclusion.
Japan has decided not to propose a tariff schedule to replace its present
ban on rice imports in an agriculture trade package due to be presented
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
The exclusion of rice followed pressure from members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) who were concerned that a concession on the issue
would further undermine the party's already shaky popularity.
Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the decision to withhold a
tariff for rice reflected the continuing uncertainty over the course of farm
trade talks in the Uruguay Round. Japan is planning to offer tariff cuts of
between 15 and 30 per cent for a range of other agricultural products, and
will reduce its internal supports for some grains and dairy products by 20
per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S legislative assembly yesterday passed a bill to extend patent
coverage to pharmaceuticals, food, drinks, biotechnology and agricultural
machinery.
The new act largely complies with demands from Washington and should help
Thai exports avoid punitive action under 'Special 301' provisions of US
trade law.
The US trade representative, Mrs Carla Hills, is due to announce a decision
in mid-March. This will conclude a year-long investigation into whether
Thailand's failure to provide new pharmaceuticals with patents amounts to
unfair trading practice.
The complaints against Thailand were originally made by US companies.
However, last March Washington announced it was initiating its own
investigation. Similar investigations against India and China on
intellectual property rights were also launched.
Critics argue that the law yields too much to the US. They would prefer to
see a four-year grace period before pharmaceuticals can be patented. They
warn that acquiescence will encourage Washington to raise new issues with
Thailand unilaterally instead of working through the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
But Thai trade officials counter that the law was designed to comply with
the draft agreement on intellectual property rights currently on the table
in the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks and not with US demands.
Their emphasis is on strengthening Gatt rules in order to reduce unilateral
pressure from the US.
The law gives the government some power to deal with abuse of monopoly
power. If after four years the patent holder overcharges or withholds
supply, the government can force the patent-holder to issue production
licences to competitors.
In December, the US trade representative dropped an investigation into
copyright infringements in Thailand. Washington said it was satisfied that
Bangkok was taking action to clamp down on illicit copying of video and
music tapes and computer software. But the US said it would continue to

MRS Carla Hills, the US trade representative, has asked an interagency group
to 'develop options' for dealing with India's failure to provide 'adequate
and effective' patent protection.
While praising India for progress made in its efforts to provide copyright
and trademark protection, Mrs Hills said serious problems remain with its
lack of product patent protection for pharmaceuticals, its 'excessively
short-term protection and overly broad involuntary licensing provision'.
She is prepared to continue to work bilaterally and multilaterally with
India in hopes of avoiding US sanctions.
According to the trade representative, India has agreed to submit
legislation to its parliament to provide for rental rights for videos,
improve protection for sound recordings and tighten enforcement of
copyrights.
It has guaranteed national treatment to foreign owners of trademarks.
New legislation, to be submitted to the Indian parliament, will provide
statutory protection for service marks and make other improvements in the
law, she said.

The US and Mexico are close to agreement on a domestic content rule which
would pave the way for free trade in textiles and apparel to compete with
the giant Asian producers, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Meetings are to be held next week to offer a 'sweetener' to Canada. The
Canadians, who want to maintain a different rule worked out with the US in
their bilateral agreement, may be offered an exemption from the US-Mexican
pact. Under the current US-Canadian agreement, textile and apparel producers
can use foreign yarn but not foreign fabric to get duty-free treatment. The
US-Mexico rule would require that the yarn be produced in North America
along with the rest of the fabric or garment.

CANADIAN negotiators have told the US they think an accession clause setting
out the procedure for the admission of more members to the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) should be considered for inclusion in the Nafta
treaty.
Among the Latin American countries which have approached the US about
possible membership in an expanded Nafta are Chile and Colombia.
Earlier this week, Mr Guillermo Ford, Panama's vice president, said in Miami
that Panama was also interested in a future that might include Nafta. He
said he had discussed Panama and Nafta with the Canadian ambassador.
The US has told Latin American countries they would have to wait until the
Nafta treaty is nearer completion to find out what arrangements might be
made for their accession. At the same time, the US has told both Mexico and
Canada that signing Nafta would not preclude the US from concluding other
free trade agreements in the hemisphere.
The issue of widening Nafta is seen as politically problematical by the US.
A Nafta accession clause which allowed expansion of the bloc without
explicit Congressional approval is anathema to the Bush administration,
which is already facing criticism from some legislators and labour unions
for seeking to add Mexico to the existing US trade pact with Canada.
One way to accommodate the accession clause proposal while meeting US
political concerns might be to adopt a modified version of the procedure
used in admitting new members to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), according to a study by the Institute for International Economics.
Membership of Gatt requires countries to demonstrate they can fulfil
obligations set out in the Gatt. Prospective members are also required to
negotiate an accession protocol.
Individual members of Gatt are allowed unilaterally to invoke a
non-application clause which allows the member to deny the benefits of Gatt
to the new member. The US would be free to give Congress the right to invoke
the non-application clause.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR officials from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary yesterday welcomed
the Community's decision not to let last-minute difficulties over car quotas
and transit prevent trade provisions of their EC association accords coming
into effect on March 1.
But the officials told a conference here that the agreements might tip their
countries' expanded trade with the EC into deficit and might thus face some
difficulty in getting ratified in their parliaments.
The trade provisions, aimed at creating a free flow of industrial goods
between the Twelve and the three central European countries within the next
10 years, will apply from Sunday. But the full agreement, covering services,
labour, capital flows and political consultation, must await ratification by
all 15 national legislatures.
The new accords with central Europe cover:
Trade. The EC will remove most quotas at once, and tariffs over 2-5 years,
and the central Europeans will reciprocate more slowly by phasing out
tariffs and quotas over 4-10 years. To get duty-free entry into the EC,
central European goods must have at least 60 per cent local content.
Sensitive products. EC concessions on food, textile, steel and coal are
limited, but all curbs, except on agricultural goods, are to disappear.
Competition policy. The central European states are, within three years, to
start applying EC anti-trust law, but can give state aid to backward areas.
The EC will conduct anti-dumping inquiries. Capital. EC investors in central
Europe will be able to repatriate profits freely.
Services. In general, each side will allow the other's companies to
establish themselves on the same basis as its own companies. But the central
European countries need not let EC companies into their defence or financial
sectors.
Labour. The agreements do not allow more workers into the EC but those
already there will enjoy equal social benefits.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIA'S president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday demonstrated his
determination to remain in power by vowing to rule over a rump Yugoslavia
comprising Serbia and Montenegro.
In his first parliamentary address since last July, Mr Milosevic brushed
aside growing political opposition to the way in which the war in Croatia
was conducted and public discontent over the economy.
Instead, he insisted that Serbia had won the war because it had secured the
deployment of United Nations peacekeepers who would protect Serbs in
Croatia.
In a confident and defiant speech which never addressed how Serbia failed to
keep the Yugoslav federation together, Mr Milosevic dismissed charges from
the leaders of Krajina, a Serb enclave in Croatia, of betraying the
interests of the 2.5mn Serbs outside of Serbia.
'The arrival of UN troops means the beginning of the peaceful resolution of
the conflict - and an end to the violence against the Serbian people in
Krajina,' he said.
Mr Milosevic's claim that the fate of the 300,000 Serbs in Krajina may be
'settled' appeared to imply that he believes the despatch of UN forces there
means the enclave will no longer be part of Croatia. Croat leaders have
declared their intention of regaining all territory occupied by the federal
army.
In what amounts to a warning to the international community, Mr Milosevic
said that 'internal and foreign pressures to make Serbia a powerless Balkan
state unable even to take care of itself will not succeed.' But in what
appears to indicate some sensitivity about western criticism of Serbia's
dismal record on human rights for the 1.9m ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Mr
Milosevic said: 'Problems there will be solved according to international
standards.'

RATIFICATION of the Maastricht treaty in Ireland could create a
'constitutional nonsense' by overriding the Irish Supreme Court's decision
to allow a 14-year-old rape victim to terminate her pregnancy in Britain.
Mr Geoffrey Hoon, a UK Labour MEP, told the European Parliament's legal
affairs committee that Community legal experts should look into implications
of the special protocol attached to the treaty, which promises that EC law
will not affect the application of Ireland's constitutional 'right-to-life'
amendment.
The Irish Supreme Court has not yet given its reasons for setting aside a
High Court decision which would have prevented the pregnant girl from
travelling abroad. If the Court argues that this was a special case, some EC
lawyers are worried that the Maastricht protocol could prevent Irish women
appealing to the European Court of Justice against future restrictive court
decisions on the right to travel abroad for abortions.
Mr Willi Rothley, German Socialist MEP who called for the debate, said the
Irish High Court decision had threatened EC treaty provisions guaranteeing
free provision of services throughout the EC.
But Mr Pat Cooney, an Irish lawyer and Fine Gael MEP, condemned fellow
deputies. 'It isn't up to the EC to harmonise the cultures, the religious
practices and the philosophies of member states,' he said.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Ukraine to introduce special exchange rate for foreign

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE will introduce a special exchange rate for foreign investors wishing
to take advantage of its ambitious privatisation plans, Mr Volodymyr
Lanovyj, the republic's minister for property and entrepreneurship said in
London yesterday.
A new law on foreign investment will be approved by the Ukrainian parliament
next month, he said at the start of a visit to potential UK investors and
City institutions.
Foreigners will not initially be allowed to purchase land but will be able
to lease land for up to 90 years and have property rights over buildings and
fixtures. The right for foreigners to own property could be included in the
legislation within the next two or three years, he added.
Ukraine is being advised on privatisation by Hambros merchant bank, whose
executive director, Sir Michael Butler, has been advising the new government
on financial and economic affairs.
Ukraine hopes to privatise 65 per cent of its nearly 10,000 large and
medium-sized enterprises over the next five years.
It is adopting a Czechoslovak-style voucher privatisation scheme under which
all Ukrainians, including children, will be entitled to free vouchers
transferable into shares. Up to 40 per cent of assets will be disposed of in
this way. The state will hold the remaining 60 per cent of shares until they
can be sold to foreign or domestic investors.
The government hopes to privatise 250 large enterprises this year, during
which it also hopes to privatise 80 per cent of shops and small enterprises.
The complex nature of large-scale privatisation programmes has delayed
similar rapid privatisation plans in central Europe, however.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Court ruling imperils work of Commission
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission may have to make drastic changes in its bureaucratic
procedures and could face a rash of law suits following an unprecedented
European Court decision condemning the EC executive's internal
decision-making processes.
The Court of First Instance (CFI) - set up four years ago to help accelerate
the EC legal process - yesterday quashed fines of Ecu24m (Pounds 17m)
imposed on an alleged cartel of 14 Community manufacturers of
polyvinylchloride (PVC) in 1988, arguing that the Commission decision was
'non-existent'.
Commission legal experts are still poring over the 52-page ruling, but they
are almost certain to appeal to the full European Court.
This is the third time in a month that the courts have overturned an EC
competition decision on procedural grounds. Yesterday's judgment is by far
the most significant because it calls into question the daily workings of
the Commission, which handles thousands of decisions annually.
Ms Diana Good, a partner with Linklaters &amp; Paines, a law firm, in Brussels,
said yesterday: 'It seems to me that the opportunity is there for a great
many challenges (to other Commission decisions). I think the Commission has
got a big problem on its hands.'
Companies subject to a Commission fine normally have to appeal within two
months, but EC lawyers believe even older cases may now be unearthed on the
grounds that they never existed legally because of flawed bureaucratic
procedure.
The wider implications of the ruling will hinge on the CFI's ruling that all
the language versions of the Commission decision should have been signed by
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and Mr David Williamson, the
secretary general, as laid down in internal rules. In practice, the
Commission usually allows some of the many decisions to be signed in the
president's absence, a practice which the CFI decided was unacceptable.
The Commission was making no formal comment on the decision yesterday but
officials were understood to be both confused and astonished by the
judgment. One legal expert commented: 'This is a challenge to the whole way
the Commission has done its work for 25 years.'
But the European Court was adamant about the judgment. 'It strikes me as a
perfectly ordinary administrative proceeding,' said one official. 'If the
Commission doesn't break the law, it will have no trouble with the courts.'
Brussels' legal experts will now try to separate the specific factors in the
PVC cartel case from general criticisms of Commission procedure.

FT  28 FEB 92 / An English solution to an Irish problem: But Dublin must now
find its own answer to the abortion dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YOUNG women demonstrators who scuffled with police outside the Irish
parliament this week waved banners saying 'Get your rosaries off our
ovaries.'
The plight of the 14-year-old rape victim, who is finally to be allowed to
travel to Britain for an abortion following a Supreme Court ruling on
Wednesday, has produced a dramatic backlash against Ireland's strict
anti-abortion laws, to the point where a growing number of Irish politicians
may be ready to countenance legalising abortion in certain circumstances.
Ms Mary Harney, minister of state for the environment, said this week: 'If
it is all right for the 14-year-old girl to go to London, the logical
conclusion is that we should provide limited facilities (for abortion) in
this country. . . . A lot of people, including church people, accept she
should be allowed to go to Britain for an abortion. . . . If she can go to
London, we cannot avoid the hypocritical situation of saying it is an
English solution to an Irish problem.'
Mr Dick Spring, leader of the opposition Labour party, said: 'I think the
political courage is there for change.'
Underpinning this about-turn is the radical change in Irish society during
the past decade. While the law has become stricter, as a result of a 1983
constitutional amendment, the number of abortions has increased and the
numbers of unmarried and lone mothers has grown dramatically.
More than 4,000 Irish women obtained abortions in Britain last year,
according to figures based on those who gave Irish addresses, and this, says
Ms Valerie Richardson, a lecturer in social administration at University
College, Dublin, represents only 'a half to a third' of the true number.
If one assumes that others gave British addresses, then, on the basis of
about 53,000 live births a year in Ireland, the rate of terminated
pregnancies was probably 10 to 15 per cent. And, as the figure is growing
annually, it may be approaching the level in England and Wales - about 21
per cent, according to the British Family Planning Association.
While about 72 per cent of British women practice contraception, only 20 per
cent of Irish women do, according to research by Ms Richardson at Dublin's
main maternity hospital. This included 'natural' means such as the rhythm
method and withdrawal.
Government statistics say that more than 75 per cent of live births to women
in the under-24 age group last year were to unmarried mothers and that the
figure for the under-20 age group was nearly 90 per cent. Twenty-five per
cent of their children go for adoption.
The number of lone mothers in Ireland is officially estimated at 30,000, and
that, says Mr Tony McCashin of the National Economic and Social Council in
Dublin, 'is a significant underestimate'.
He says the real figure is difficult to obtain from official statistics,
'but what can be said very definitely is that, as a sub-group in the
population, they are growing very rapidly.'
The reason, says Ms Richardson, is that 'marriage as a solution for young
mothers has stopped being a way out for them.' Marriages have dropped from
almost 23,000 per year in the early 1970s to 17,500 in 1990.
Such social changes - driven by higher living standards, a growing number of
women in the workforce, emigration and Irish women looking at the greater
freedom of choice afforded their peers in other European Community countries
 -have been far more powerful than the Catholic church-supported laws
designed to contain them. Politicians are now being called upon to recognise
that fact.

A JOINT committee of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians met yesterday in
Kiev to discuss the introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency and the
division of the former Soviet Union's debts and assets, Chrystia Freeland
writes from Kiev.
Swimming against the current of the present troubled relationship between
Ukraine and Russia, the committee is expected to produce a joint communique
today outlining a mutually acceptable mechanism for the introduction of a
separate Ukrainian currency, due this summer.
Seeking to defuse Russian worries that the introduction of the new currency
will set off an inflationary wave of roubles into Russia, the Ukraine is
reportedly offering to withdraw roubles from circulation and hand them over
to Russia.
An agreement on the division of debts and assets may prove more elusive as
Russia's absence from a debt conference in Kiev earlier this week suggested.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Dutch say CSCE needs executive to act in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECISION-MAKING in the 48-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe must be streamlined if it is to act effectively in times of crisis,
foreign minister of the Netherlands, Mr Hans van den Broek, said yesterday.
In an address to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Mr
van den Broek endorsed a German-Czechoslovak proposal that the CSCE should
establish a steering committee which would serve as a form of executive on
behalf of the collective membership.
Such a committee could be modelled on the lines of the European Community's
Troika (past, present and future presidents of the EC Council of Ministers),
delegated to represent the Twelve in areas such as political co-operation.
But while the Dutch foreign minister favoured strengthening the operational
role of the CSCE, he was opposed to expanding the organisation's
institutions. 'We don't think dressing up the CSCE into some kind of
regional United Nations, including a Security Council with permanent
members, would be a very good idea,' he said.
Mr van den Broek also supported a proposal that Nato should perform
'operational and co-ordinating functions' in European peace-keeping
operations, at the specific request of the CSCE.
Turning to the EC, the minister said that the Community, in its present
form, might be strong enough to accommodate another two or three members.
But beyond that number, it was likely to run into 'institutional paralysis'.
Much more majority voting was required in the Council of Ministers, the
European Commission should be given increased powers of initiative and the
European Parliament's rights of control should be strengthened.
The problem of preventing the EC from collapsing under the weight of so many
new members, coupled with a watering down of the internal market, was much
more troubling than the question of whether the Commission might become too
powerful. 'Ever more European peoples should not be allowed to join at the
expense of ever closer union.
'After all, the new democracies of central and eastern Europe aspire to join
a strong Community, not a weak one.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / Eight former Soviet republics join UN: International
recognition cited as most important proof of independent statehood
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT former Soviet republics today take their seats at the United Nations,
sensitive to the fact that they have few other attributes of full statehood.
Bright republican flags - the most colourful symbol of statehood - were on
proud display at a Moscow hotel yesterday for a meeting of parliamentary
deputies from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Most delegates, speaking the fluent Russian which remains their lingua
franca, cited recognition by other countries as the most important proof of
their newly won independence.
'A process of independence has begun and through international recognition a
republic gains self confidence,' explained Mr Ashot Dzhazovian, from the
Armenian embassy in Moscow (few republics have embassies further afield).
Indeed, the eight - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - still share many of the features
of a unitary state. They have no formal borders, although they have lots of
informal trade barriers. They have no armies, although Armenia and
Azerbaijan are virtually at war over the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
Together with the other seven republics, they share a currency which carries
the name of an extinct country - the Soviet Union.
Although richer organisations such as the European Community see a common
currency as desirable, some of the former republics, led by Ukraine, see a
separate currency as the sine qua non of independence.
Others, such as Kazakhstan, are willing to give the rouble a chance, but are
taking steps to build up their currencies, gold reserves and central banks.
Some, such as Armenia, are too poor to establish their own financial
systems. Few can afford their own armies.
Ironically, the only state without a UN seat after today will be Georgia,
which, despite its strong national identity, has no legitimate government
following the overthrow of its dictatorial president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
The three republics which already have UN seats are among those with the
greatest problems in adjusting to statehood. Ukraine has been busily
promoting symbols of independence, but its haste in creating its own army
may yet split the commonwealth, while plans to issue its own banknotes may
trigger a currency war.
Belarus remains the least plausible of the independent states, simply
because it has no national tradition. Russia, with its centuries-old
history, is having trouble extracting a new identity from the ruins of the
Soviet Union, whose UN seat it now occupies.

FT  28 FEB 92 / European bank loans earmarked for CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will reallocate loans,
guarantees and equity investments following the decision to admit 11 former
republics of the Soviet Union as members.
Under recommendations made this week, 60 per cent of the bank's loans will
be earmarked for all the countries of eastern Europe and the three Baltic
States, while the remaining 40 per cent will be allocated to the 11
republics of the CIS.
Georgia is the only former Soviet republic which has not yet joined the
bank.
However, the EBRD has decided that the number of shares to be taken up by
republics in the CIS should not exceed the capital stock held by the former
USSR.
The USSR originally held 60,000 shares in the EBRD or 6 per cent of the
total. These shares have now been distributed among the 11 republics, with
the Russian Federation holding the largest share (40,000) and Turkmenistan
holding the smallest (100).
The republics are expected formally to join the bank in April, during its
first annual meeting in Budapest.
In a separate development, the EBRD unveiled its Energy Operations Policy,
which is closely tied to the bank's environmental brief.
The energy policy will be focused on four areas: repairing and
rehabilitating existing supply facilities; completing existing projects
which are urgently required; helping the countries of eastern Europe
diversify their energy supplies as a means of weakening their dependency on
the CIS for oil and gas supplies; and promoting private sector projects.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (1): A swathe through the investment
jungle - Foreword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS HAVE a tough battle when dealing with the financial services
sector.
All too often they are offered products that they do not understand by
people whose motives they have every right to suspect. It is often hard to
tell whether the investment on offer is designed to boost the wealth of the
consumer, or to line the pocket of the salesmen.
A classic example is the way in which consumers are sold life
assurance-based savings products, which may offer good value if held for 15
or 25 years but are highly inflexible. A Securities and Investments Board
study found that up to 45 per cent of such policies are abandoned in the
first two years, with resulting abysmal returns to the policyholder.
One reason why so many of these policies are sold is that they bring
substantial commission to salesmen. Even someone who is called an
'independent' financial adviser is not necessarily unbiased; he or she has a
natural incentive to recommend those products which pay the highest
commission.
In such circumstances, newspapers are often seen as a crucial source of
independent information for the saver. But it is impossible, in the space
available to a daily newspaper, to cover all the topics in which a financial
consumer may be interested. Inevitably, a reader must take pot luck each
week on whether his own field is covered.
This A-Z is designed to help fill that gap. Within these pages, there should
be several articles which will appeal to every consumer.
The jargon of the financial services world - from annuities to zero-coupon
shares - is explained. But as well as specialist topics, there are articles
of a more general interest. For example, how are the banks and building
societies competing against each other to attract customers? How can a
husband and wife most efficiently organise their finances? What is the
current state of the mortgage market?
As you work your way through the guide, you should find that one subject
will lead to another. Those who turn to F for fixed rate investments might
be intrigued to know more about G for gilts. Anyone who reads L for life
insurance may find their thoughts drifting to the issue of wills and
inheritance tax (a subject duly covered under W).
As befits what we know of Financial Times readers, there is a strong focus
on equity investments. We include a guide to the art of picking 'cheap'
shares, known in the jargon as value investing. Other articles focus on
yields, dividends, and unit and investment trusts.
Of course, even this guide cannot be comprehensive, but we hope it will be a
useful work of reference and information for the saver and investor.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (2): A bet on how long you'll live -
Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE START with the investment you usually make at the end of your career.
An annuity is one of the most disarmingly simple products offered by the
financial services industry, yet a series of distressing issues must be
faced when you buy one.
You pay a lump sum to a life insurance company, or friendly society, which
then guarantees to pay you a (normally fixed) annual income for the rest of
your life. The money is invested in gilts (see G for Gilts) to ensure that
there is no risk with the repayments.
The life office will not pay you any more than the fixed sum, unless you buy
a specialised contract, and all payments cease when you die. Your heirs will
not benefit.
So when you buy an annuity you are effectively placing a bet on how long you
will live. If you die soon afterwards, the annuity will turn out to have
been a bad investment. But if you live to be 100, the annuity effectively
spreads your life savings to keep you financially secure in a lengthy
retirement.
Two chief factors affect annuity rates: the gilts market and life
expectancy. The higher the yield on gilts when you buy your annuity, the
better the annuity rate will be. More important, the annuity rate will be
higher if your life expectancy is shorter. This means that, as a general
rule, you should wait as long as possible before buying an annuity.
There are three different times in life when you might want to buy an
annuity.
When you retire: The bulk of the proceeds of a personal or self-employed
pension plan must, by law, be put into an annuity when you retire; as must
all the money you have saved through making additional voluntary
contributions to a corporate pension scheme. If your company pension scheme
operates in terms of a fraction of your final salary, then you will not have
the opportunity to buy an annuity with these funds. However, if the company
has a 'money purchase' scheme, you need to buy an annuity (see R for
Retirement Planning).
These annuities are referred to as 'compulsory purchase'. You pay income tax
on the entire annuity payment, as it is assumed that this will be your prime
source of income.
An easy way to boost your annuity payment is to use the 'open market
option'. This allows you to shop around different insurers for the best
rate, rather than just take the annuity offered by the company which managed
your pension fund. To do this, you need an independent financial adviser,
who can find the best rate on offer on the market.
For example, best rates last month all came from Sun Alliance, according to
Baronworth Investment Services. For a down-payment of Pounds 100,000, best
fixed rates available were Pounds 12,778 for a 60-year-old man, and Pounds
14,149 for a 65-year-old. A 55-year-old woman could receive a best rate of
Pounds 10,796, while a 60-year-old woman would receive Pounds 11,479.
Inflation is the great enemy of your income when you retire. If you are
lucky enough to have a long retirement, the real spending power of your
fixed-rate annuity may be eroded.
A range of annuities can combat this problem, but they are expensive.
Insurance companies usually offer protection against inflation only in
return for paying you a substantially lower annuity in the early years. The
longer you think you are likely to live, the more appropriate an
inflation-proofed annuity will be.
Annuity contracts which afford some protection against price rises are:
Index-linked annuities which rise in line with the retail prices index;
Increasing annuities which rise by a fixed amount each year (normally 5 per
cent);
With-profits annuities which add on a bonus, provided investment performance
can sustain one, each year; and
Unit-linked annuities which have the disadvantage that they can go down, but
should in the long run provide a haven against inflation.
A final option to consider is an underwritten annuity. These make most sense
if you have strong reason to believe that you do not have long to live. For
example, if you already have a history of heart trouble it could be
possible, with medical evidence, to persuade a life office to give you a
bigger annuity.
Figures from Sun Life show how much difference underwriting can make. A
65-year-old man could normally buy an annuity of Pounds 11,953 with a fund
of Pounds 100,000.
If he had twice suffered coronary thrombosis, most recently two years ago,
Sun Life would be prepared to pay an annuity of Pounds 14,427.72. If the man
were still exhibiting moderately raised blood pressure, the annuity would be
Pounds 15,123.24.
Once your decision is made, you are stuck with it, so give your pension
annuity a lot of thought.
When you need to increase your income in retirement. If you need extra funds
to pay for medical care in your home, or in a residential home, an annuity
may be the best way to do it. As people who do this are normally much older
than when they retired, the annuity rates available are more generous.
The tax regime is also more generous. When buying an 'immediate' annuity, as
such annuities are called, you pay tax only on the income element of the
payments - the portion of the annuity which is counted as repayment of
capital is tax-free.
According to Baronworth, best rates last month, for a Pounds 100,000 lump
sum, were: for 75-year-olds, Pounds 17,825 for men and Pounds 15,287 for
women, from Co-operative; and for 80-year-olds, Pounds 21,488 for men and
Pounds 20,078 for women, from Standard Life.
You can also buy an annuity that is 'capital-protected'. Thus, if you are
nervous about your heirs, you can opt for a contract which guarantees to
repay the capital to your estate if you die within a certain period. The
insurance company will keep any investment profits.
As people live longer and medical care improves, it is becoming more common
to buy annuities late in retirement. A popular route involves mortgaging a
part or all of your house, and buying an annuity with the proceeds. For
people much over the age of 75, the annuity payment should outstrip the
mortgage repayment costs, but take professional advice before doing this.
When you are putting together a complex financial package. For this purpose
you will usually need a temporary annuity. These differ from other annuities
in that they pay out over a fixed term, and then stop. This makes them very
useful as income providers when placed 'back-to-back' with another
investment which provides growth.
Typical plans might involve buying a temporary annuity for 10 years, and
putting another lump sum into a with-profits bond, or a personal equity
plan. The annuity would provide a substantial income, while the growth
investment would grow enough to replace the money spent on the annuity after
10 years. The end result, if the plan works, is that you have enjoyed high
income for 10 years with no loss of capital.
Temporary annuities are also popular as an aid to school-fees planning.
Parents save up a lump sum until their child starts at senior school, for
example, and then buy a temporary annuity for six years. This pays the fees
at the beginning of each educational year.
Baronworth's best buys last month on temporary nine-year annuities, for a
Pounds 100,000 lump sum, were: for 40-year-olds, Pounds 16,710 for men and
Pounds 16,730 for women, from Sun Alliance; and for 80-year-olds (possibly
of use for long-term care), Pounds 23,300 for men, from Standard Life, and
Pounds 20,170 for women, from Sun Alliance.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (23): It's cheap but is it a
bargain? - Value investing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL principle of value investing is almost exactly 400 years old.
The secret of getting rich, wrote Thomas Lodge in 1595, is 'Buy cheape, sell
deare'. Value investing is the systematisation of that motto.
It is a disciplined, methodical approach to assessing when any particular
share is cheap and when it is expensive, rather than trying to judge whether
the stock market as a whole is over- or under-valued.
The phrase 'value investing' is an American one, and so is the best-known
treatise on the subject, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's book Security
Analysis, published in 1934. The authors set out a detailed set of rules for
assessing stocks against their intrinsic value. This was based on weighing
up a company's assets, calculating its future earning power, and deriving a
price to which the market was likely to gravitate over time, based on an
appropriate price/earnings ratio.
In Graham and Dodd's slightly ponderous prose: 'It is our thesis that the
stocks of companies with disappointing earnings usually sell lower than they
should, for the same basic reason that stocks as a whole sell too low during
periods of depression. The significance of the unfavourable conditions is
exaggerated.'
Since then, the basic techniques of value investing have not changed: find
cheap stocks and hold them - perhaps for a long time - until their intrinsic
value is recognised by the market. Since the 1930s, however, it has become
much harder to find shares that are grossly undervalued. And since then,
professional value investors have acquired computers, allowing them to
search rapidly through huge databases of corporate financial data. For the
private investor, similar effects can be achieved, more laboriously but much
more cheaply, by poring over the FT's share price listings.
If in late January you had asked the FT Analysis computer database for all
big UK companies selling at a discount to net asset value which also had a
modest price/earnings ratio and a healthy dividend yield, you would have
come up with a handful of answers. These include Asda, the stores group,
trading at a p/e ratio of 8 and a yield of 8 per cent; British Aerospace
(p/e of 3, yield of 12 per cent); British Steel (no earnings, but a historic
yield of 15 per cent); and Trafalgar House, (p/e of 10, yield of 19 per
cent), the shipping and construction group.
All of these have fallen out of favour with the stock market, often because
of problems suffered by the industries in which they do the bulk of their
business. Only more detailed analysis would suggest if all these companies
deserve their current cheapness.
How do you tell when a share is offering true value? The latest annual
report will give you useful information: the strength of the company's
balance sheet, the businesses from which it derives the bulk of its profits,
and its long-term record of growth in earnings and dividends. The detailed
FT-Actuaries All-Share indices, published in the FT every day, will give you
a sense of the typical p/e ratio for companies in that sector (in the case
of Asda, for example, food chains were selling at a 15 p/e ratio).
A word of warning: the reason why stocks are on high yields and low p/e
ratios is that the market perceives them to be risky. These perceptions
could be right. As a result, most value investors buy a spread of stocks,
hoping that the recovery of some will outweigh the losses on a few. Private
investors should beware of putting too much of their portfolio in one or two
risky stocks.
Just how risky apparently 'cheap' stocks can be is shown by three other
companies that were also thrown up by that database search: Polly Peck,
Maxwell Communication Corporation, and British and Commonwealth. All three
are currently in administration, with little prospect of a return for
shareholders. Yet by the crude yardstick used for the database search, they
looked cheap. Moral: cheapness is not the same as good value.
There is one other trap. When the market is selling at historically high
price/earnings multiples - as Wall Street has been doing recently  - there
is a risk of picking up stocks which are relatively cheap but absolutely
dear. Graham and Dodd put it neatly: 'Beware of 'bargains' when most stocks
seem very high', they wrote - and it's as true now as it was in 1934.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (24): Don't leave your heir on a
shoestring - Wills &amp; inheritance tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MAY hate the idea of writing a will. But if you do not, the state will
write it for you. And you may not like what it says. British intestacy rules
may be fine by you, but you should check.
English, Scottish and Northern Irish law vary on the precise arrangements if
you die without writing a will. In England, if you leave a spouse behind
you, they will receive your entire estate if it is less than Pounds 75,000.
If it comes to more than this, things get baffling.
If you have no children, your spouse receives the house, its contents and
any personal effects. After that, the spouse will receive the first Pounds
125,000 of the estate, and then half of the residue beyond this. If you have
surviving direct relatives - parents, brothers and sisters  - then the
remainder is shared between them. If you have children, the spouse only
receives Pounds 75,000, plus a life interest in half of the residue. The
other half of the residue is split between the children, once they reach the
age of 18.
If these rules do not suit you, call a solicitor and write a will.
This is only the first step towards guaranteeing your heirs a healthy
inheritance. If you are wealthy, it may pay to enter the labyrinthine world
of estate planning.
The future for inheritance tax (IHT) is more uncertain than for any other
form of taxation. Conservatives have hinted that the Budget will see radical
reform, possibly the doubling of the threshold before tax is payable.
A Labour government would make similarly radical changes, in the opposite
direction. It wants to change IHT into a recipient-based tax, related to the
amount received by individuals, rather than the total amount eft in the
estate - thus encouraging people to distribute wealth more widely in their
wills.
While politicians are making up their minds, it is best to look at the
current regime and work from there. The main points to bear in mind are:
There is a threshold of Pounds 140,000 before any IHT is payable. Amounts
above this level are taxed at a single tax rate of 40 per cent.
Money left to a spouse is tax-free. The Pounds 140,000 threshold can be
given in addition to this exempt bequest.
You can make a gift of up to Pounds 3,000 each year, exempt from all IHT in
addition to all other reliefs. You can carry forward unused exemption for
one year, but you must use up all of your current year's exemption before
using any exemption carried forward.
'Small gifts' of up to Pounds 250 can be made to any number of individuals
in a year without affecting your overall allowance for the year. Thus, if
you gave the maximum to 12 people you would have given away Pounds 3,000,
without eating into the additional Pounds 3,000 annual exemption.
Regular gifts out of income, which can be proved to the Revenue not to
affect seriously your standard of living, are exempt.
Bequests to charities, political parties and various other non-profit-making
organisations are exempt.
Gifts to individuals or to various trusts can be exempt, if they are made
more than seven years before death. These are 'potentially exempt
transfers', because they lose some, or possibly all, of their exemption if
the donor dies within seven years of making the gift. Tax on gifts of above
the threshold allowance is subject to 'tapering relief' - the longer the
donor survives, the less tax will be applied. There are so many loopholes
here that some accountants call IHT a 'voluntary tax'. How you go about
minimising it depends on how much you are prepared to give away.
The three main weapons at your disposal are trusts, whole-of-life policies,
and back-to-back schemes. All have advantages, but carry costs:
Whole-of-life policies are best if you do not want to give anything away. A
couple can take out a joint whole-of-life policy with a sum assured, equal
to the amount they expect to have to pay in inheritance tax on the estate.
When the second parent dies, this policy automatically pays the children's
inheritance tax for them (see also L for life assurance).
Life policies for the elderly are not cheap - a couple in their late fifties
could expect to pay annual premiums of around Pounds 7,000 to cover a
liability of Pounds 250,000. You should also beware of high commissions and
costs. But the approach has the benefit of simplicity.
Trusts are subtler, and potentially more useful, if more expensive. They
come in bewildering varieties, but the basic idea is that money gifted to a
trust, over which you may be able to exert a certain level of control, can
count as having left your estate for IHT purposes, provided you cannot
benefit from the money yourself.
A typical IHT plan buys an insurance bond and puts it in trust. You can also
use an insurance bond as a package for an existing portfolio, which will be
preferable in many cases.
Back-to-back policies are commission-rich. You buy an annuity, automatically
slashing the value of your estate. You then use the annuity both for income,
and to fund (you guessed it) a whole-of-life policy. This pays out to your
heirs, when their IHT liability has already been slashed by the annuity.
Take advice from solicitors, accountants or other fee-charging advisers
before taking any action. This is a deeply emotive topic, and you should not
be rushed into doing anything you do not want to do.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (10): A good deal even if RPI should
fall - Inflation-proofing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION IS the great enemy of savers. Even an annual rate of 5 per cent,
modest by modern standards, halves the value of money in 15 years.
A generation of German savers was ruined by hyperinflation in the 1920s, and
British savers had a pretty rough time of it in the 1970s.
In the 1980s, by contrast, high real interest rates, lower direct taxes and
lower inflation helped savers to prosper. But this prosperity may have
lowered savers' defences. It has been simple and secure to deposit one's
cash in the building societies and enjoy the interest.
It is difficult to imagine the same conditions prevailing through the 1990s.
There will not be much UK economic growth if base rates remain at 10.5 per
cent and inflation at 4.5 per cent - a real rate of 6 per cent. According to
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the historic average for real returns on gilts
(1919-91) is 1.2 per cent and for Treasury bills (1946-91) 0.5 per cent. The
likelihood is, therefore, that either inflation will rise, or interest rates
will fall, to narrow the current gap.
In either case, savers will suffer. The nominal value of their income may
fall; the real value certainly will.
Index-linked investments offer security against these dangers. There are two
main types: gilt and National Savings (see letters G and N). Each guarantees
to keep pace with inflation, with a cushion on top.
The gilts are the more complex of the two. They will be repaid at a level
that depends on the increase in the retail price index between the issue and
maturity. So if the RPI on issue is 100, and at maturity is 200, the gilt
will be repaid at double its issue price.
That sounds simple enough. Complications start with the fact that the gilts
also pay a small income, 2 to 2 1/2 per cent, which is also index-linked.
The second complexity is that the actual RPIs used for indexation purposes
are the ones eight months before issue and maturity. This means that the
buyer is at risk from inflation in the last eight months of the life of the
gilt.
The result of this is that, when one buys an index-linked gilt, one cannot
be sure of the nominal, or even the real, return to redemption. The
convention is to quote the real yield on two assumptions - 5 and 10 per cent
inflation.
In late January, the real yield on the longest dated gilt (which matures in
2024) would have been 4.2 per cent (if inflation till maturity averages 5
per cent) and 4.1 per cent (if inflation is 10 per cent).
These real yields are very attractive in historical terms, especially since
the bulk of the return will come in the form of tax-free capital gains.
If one expects inflation to be 5 per cent, then the long-term nominal return
on index-linked would be 9.2 per cent. That translates to around 8.7 per
cent net for the basic rate taxpayer and 8 per cent net for those on the top
rate. For a building society to match these net returns, it would have to
offer gross returns of around 11.6 and 13.3 per cent respectively. The
former level might be available in the short term, but would be highly
unlikely over the longer term.
Equities (see letter E) are often touted as a hedge against inflation; and
indeed, over the long term, BZW figures show they have produced gross real
returns well in excess of those currently available from index-linked gilts.
There are snags, however. The first is tax. BZW shows that the real return
on equities between 1960 and 1991 has been 5.3 per cent per annum, with
gross income reinvested; but for the investor on the top rate of tax, the
real return has been just 1.2 per cent. Admittedly, top tax rates were very
high during part of that period.
The second snag is that the BZW figures are based on the equity indices, and
there is no guarantee that the portfolios of private investors will match
those indices.
So index-linked gilts could offer a very attractive long-term alternative to
equities for private investors, especially those who pay top rate tax.
A shorter-term alternative is index-linked National Savings. The current
issue of certificates offers a return of inflation plus 4.5 per cent
tax-free, if held for five years (the returns are significantly lower if
cashed in early).
Again, this return is highly attractive. Those who bought an earlier issue
of these certificates in January 1987 would have achieved a return of 64.6
per cent. That beat the average unit and investment trust, and a top-rate
building society account, over the same period.
The disadvantage with these certificates is that they do not provide any
income. The low coupon on the index-linked gilts is also a problem for
income-seeking investors.
But do not dismiss index-linked investment just because you think inflation
is going to fall. If you do believe in the depressed, low-inflation 1990s,
just look at the US. Thanks to attempts to revive the economy, US savers are
receiving rates of only 4 per cent. Even if US inflation were expected to
average 2 per cent, a real yield of 4.5 per cent would be pretty attractive
to them.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (21): Tessa and other T-era
treasures - Tax-efficient savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AVOIDANCE IS not a dirty word when it comes to tax. The Conservative
governments of Mrs Margaret Thatcher brought in or bolstered a number of
measures to encourage savings and investments through the sweetener of
waiving or reducing tax.
Tessas: Tax-Exempt Special Savings Accounts were introduced by John Major as
chancellor in 1990, to encourage a savings mentality through a simple
risk-free scheme available at high street banks and building societies.
Individuals can save a total of Pounds 9,000 over five years in a Tessa, and
earn the interest tax-free if the capital is not withdrawn.
Tessas were launched on January 1, 1991. The maximum deposit for the first
year is Pounds 3,000. A further Pounds 1,800 can be paid in on the
anniversary of the account for each of the subsequent years, subject to the
Pounds 9,000 maximum. The total return for the investor depends on interest
rates over the five years, but for the first year the average rate of
interest has been 12.9 per cent. This means a return of around Pounds 387,
with the saver keeping the Pounds 96.75 that would normally be paid in tax
so long as the capital is kept in the Tessa for the full five years.
Investors can remove all net interest without penalty during the life of the
Tessa.
National Savings: There is no income or capital gains tax to pay on
index-linked and variable rate certificates, nor on the Yearly Plan (See N
for National Savings).
Pensions: Your pension is one of the most tax-efficient forms of savings,
because your contributions and those of your employer normally enjoy tax
relief, as do additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). The fund into which
they are paid is exempt from income or capital gains tax, so the return on
investments should be higher than on other savings schemes.
There are limits on the amounts of contributions qualifying for relief in
any one year.
If you decide to receive some of your pension as a lump sum on retirement,
this will be paid to you tax-free, and the pension itself is taxed as earned
income, not investment income.
Employer's schemes: If the scheme is contributory, you get tax relief at
your highest rate of tax on your contributions.
Personal pension plans: Tax limits on contributions depend on the time you
took out the plan. If it was before July 1, 1988, you make gross payments
and get basic rate and higher rate tax relief through the PAYE system, a
rebate or a lower tax bill (See R for Retirement planning).
Life insurance: There is no tax to pay on the proceeds of a life insurance
policy if you are a basic rate taxpayer. Higher-rate taxpayers may have to
pay on gains made, but not if they have kept the proceeds of a qualifying
policy for at least three-quarters of the term of the policy, or 10 years,
whichever is shorter. (See Q for Qualifying policies).
The amount of tax you might pay on a non-qualifying policy, if you are a
higher-rate taxpayer, depends on the gain, calculated as the amount you get
when the policy comes to an end, less the total premiums paid - unless the
policy is cashed early. (See S for Single-premium investment bonds, and L
for Life insurance ).
Baby bonds: These are offered by friendly societies (similar to life
offices) and provide a way of sheltering gifts from parents to children. The
funds of friendly societies are tax-exempt, which should lead to better
performance compared with similar savings schemes. However, Money
Management, the magazine for professional advisers, recently found that
charges on a friendly society policy 'virtually wipe out the tax-free boost
given to its fund performance'.
The maximum contribution into the baby bond is only Pounds 200 a year or
Pounds 18 a month. Premiums can be paid annually or monthly, maturing either
at the end of a fixed period or on a selected birthday. You must hold the
bond for at least 10 years to obtain the tax exemption.
Personal equity plans: Peps were another Tory innovation to encourage wider
share ownership. A personal equity plan is a way of holding equities which
which offers shelter from both income and capital gains tax. You can hold a
general Pep with Pounds 6,000 of equities in any one tax year and a further
Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep (See P for Peps).
Business Expansion Scheme: The BES will appeal to top-rate tax payers as a
means of sheltering tax, but it is risky.
Its least risky form is the 'buy back' scheme. A BES company buys
accommodation on behalf of a third party - usually a college or a housing
association - and receives in return a covenant to buy back the property at
a fixed price after five years.
Provided the third party does not go bankrupt in the meantime, and can raise
the money, risk is minimised. You can invest up to Pounds 40,000 in
companies which qualify for investments under the BES by submitting a BES3
form (sent to you by the company) to the Inland Revenue. The total value of
your investment is then deducted from your total taxable income. Thus, if
you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, you will receive a rebate of 40 per cent of
the amount you invested. So you ultimately part with only Pounds 24,000 to
invest Pounds 40,000.
You have to maintain the investment for five years to gain the tax benefits.
Enterprise Zones: EZs are government-selected run-down regions which need
investment. Like the BES, tax relief is the incentive. Top-rate taxpayers
get a rebate of 40 per cent on the value of their investment. The tax breaks
are potentially great, because there is no maximum limit on investment, but
they are only allowed for non-residential property, and investors must
usually commit themselves to a 25-year term.
Enterprise Zone Trusts buy properties and split them into units, allowing
investors to buy a share of a building which might otherwise be too
expensive. The minimum for most schemes is Pounds 5,000.
EZTs aim for a yield of more than 7 per cent of the initial investment per
year from rental income. Combined with the capital gains you could obtain
once the property is sold, the tax advantages could be substantial but have
to be measured against the risk.
Trusts: These are a useful tool in reducing inheritance tax. There are many
types of trust, but the accumulation and maintenance trust is one that
everyone, and not simply the very wealthy, can consider.
Income made by the trust is kept in it (accumulated), although some income
can be drawn if it is for the 'maintenance, education or benefit' of the
children. The trust comes to an end, once the child is between 18 and 25
years old and the estate is given over (See W for wills).

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (18): A savings plan built on
bonuses - Qualifying policies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DO qualifying endowment policies qualify for?
This piece of life-insurance jargon refers to the tax relief on final
pay-outs from an endowment. Provided the policy 'qualifies', the fund in
which the life company invests the money pays tax only at the basic rate.
And no tax is payable at all on the lump sum that you receive at the end of
the policy's term (its 'maturity').
This makes endowments a potentially valuable tax shelter for top-rate
taxpayers. The conditions are that you pay regular monthly premiums into the
policy for a term of at least 10 years.
Note that these tax concessions are not as generous as those available on a
number of other important investments mentioned elsewhere, such as pensions
and personal equity plans, which invest in untaxed funds.
So how do endowments work? Essentially they are savings plans, which have
been encumbered with many unnecessary complications as they have evolved
from life policies.
Contributions, or 'premiums', are usually paid monthly, and must be
maintained to qualify for tax relief.
Premiums must continue for a fixed term, decided when you start. An
endowment is inflexible. Common terms are 10 years - the minimum - and 25
years, the term of a mortgage. You only receive a worthwhile return if you
hold an endowment until its maturity.
When you fix a term, you also fix a 'sum assured'. This is the minimum you
will be paid at maturity, and may not exceed the total of the premiums you
pay in.
Fortunately, you should receive much more than this, because bonuses are
added to reflect the profits made by the fund managers - hence the label
'with-profits' which these policies carry.
There are usually two forms of bonus:
Reversionary bonuses, which can also be called 'annual' or 'irrevocable'.
They are added on to the sum assured at the end of each year, and cannot be
taken away, provided you keep the policy to maturity.
Terminal bonuses, which are paid out once the policy has matured. These tend
to vary according to market conditions in the final years of the policy.
It is rarely as simple as this. Reversionary bonuses can be paid as a
proportion of the sum assured, or as a proportion of the sum assured plus
all the bonuses which have already accrued. Some offices have two
reversionary bonuses, one of which is added to the sum assured, while the
other is added to the reversionary bonuses already accrued.
This is not easy to understand, but the annual bonuses do make with-profits
policies more secure than the unit-linked alternative. However, the fund
managers must put money into gilts to cover for bonuses they have declared,
so 'with-profits' can also blunt the total benefits you receive.
A final unrelated factor is the surrender value. Reversionary bonuses are
paid only if you hold the policy until the end of its term. If you stop the
premiums early, or 'surrender' the policy, the amount you receive bears no
relation to the amount of bonuses which have accrued.
All the costs of running the policy - including administration, and
commissions to intermediaries - are borne over the first few years. So if
you surrender within five years of starting a 25-year policy, you will
receive much less than you have paid in total premiums.
A new breed of 'unitised' with-profits policies is easier to understand,
although it does not offer better value. This does away with the sum
assured, and instead each premium payment buys units, on to which bonuses
are added in the standard with-profits fashion. These policies are much
cheaper for the life insurers to operate.
Unitised with-profits contracts are not to be confused with unit-linked
endowments. With the latter, the units your premiums buy fluctuate with the
market in the same way as unit trusts. This should bring both greater risks
and greater potential rewards.
Again, however, costs and commissions are front-end loaded, so the surrender
value you could receive in early years bears little relation to the
performance of the units you have already bought.
Endowments used to be much more tax-efficient than they are now - their
funds were taxed more favourably, and there was tax relief on the premiums
as you paid them in. Now, their attractions are much reduced. Many companies
have had to cut their pay-outs this year, and newer tax-efficient vehicles
look better.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (11): Be flexible, know your
allowances - Joint investments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BERNARD SHAW once described the popularity of marriage in terms of maximum
opportunities. He did not have joint investments in mind, but having a
spouse does give you greater flexibility in organising your financial
affairs to the benefit of your wealth.
This flexibility was aided by the introduction of independent taxation for
married couples last year. Both husband and wife now keep separate tax-free
allowances, at present Pounds 3,295 each, and receive a married couple's
allowance of Pounds 1,720 as well. If you were 64 before the beginning of
the tax year, you qualify for a higher personal allowance of up to Pounds
4,020 for the 1991-2 tax year, depending on your total income. The married
couple's allowance also increases if either partner was 64 before the start
of the tax year.
The trick is to use these allowances to the maximum, and to minimise the
payment of higher rate tax by availing yourselves of both basic rate tax
bands.
If your investments or savings are in joint names, the rule is that you will
be taxed equally on any income, because it will be assumed that the income
is split evenly between you. However, you can elect to hold the assets in
unequal proportions, and the income will be taxed accordingly. You will have
to let the Inland Revenue know about this by making a joint written
declaration (Form 17 from tax offices) laying out the proportions in which
the investments and the subsequent income have been divided.
However, in many cases, it will be more tax-efficient to keep your
investments in separate names rather than holding them jointly.
Deposits. If one partner is not working, their personal allowance is being
wasted. Savings should be transferred to the non-working partner, who will
receive interest, for example on a building society account, at gross rates.
The same is true for shares or unit trusts, where interest on dividends can
be reclaimed.
If one of the two is a higher-rate taxpayer and the other a basic-rate
taxpayer, deposits should be made in the name of the lower tax payer so that
interest is taxed at the basic rate.
There is one clear advantage to holding a joint bank account, highlighted by
the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Under the
UK's deposit protection scheme, sterling depositors can claim 75 per cent of
their money up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. This applies to individuals
not the number of accounts. In the case of a joint account, each individual
would be eligible for compensation.
Mortgages. When one partner is a taxpayer and the other is not, it is
possible to apportion interest between the couple, so that the former
assumes the interest payments and gets the maximum tax relief.
If you really want an endowment mortgage, Fiona Price, managing director of
Fiona Price and partners, the independent financial advisers, suggests
taking out two single endowment policies for half the loan each, topped up
with term assurance to cover 100 per cent of the liability in each case.
This will protect each individual from the trauma of what to do with the
joint policy if they separate.
National Savings certificates. Individuals are limited to Pounds 10,000
worth of certificates, but a husband can hold a further Pounds 10,000 in
trust for his wife and vice versa, making a total of Pounds 40,000 worth of
certificates between the two. The same is true for the Yearly Plan. (You
should take legal advice on this - see also letter N).
Insurance. Life policies are often taken out in the name of the husband, but
if you have children it might be better to take out two separate
term-assurance policies - even though this will mean paying out more - in
order to give greater protection for the family should a death or permanent
disability occur.
Single-premium or guaranteed income bonds. Income-paying bonds should be
assigned to the non- or low-earning spouse for maximum tax relief.
There is, however, one clear advantage to holding insurance bonds in joint
names, according to James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe, the fee-based
advisers. If a bond is owned by husband or wife but is in the name of the
other spouse as well, the bond does not need to be encashed should the
holder die. Any income can be drawn tax-free by the surviving spouse, in the
tax year following the death, because the Inland Revenue will seek to tax
the owner of the bond and not the person receiving the money.
Pensions. This is something that women tend to ignore; but if the marriage
ends in divorce, the wife loses all entitlement to her husband's pension if
he is in a private or company pension scheme. Many women forget, too, that
time taken out of work to have children will result in a lower pension being
paid.
Capital gains and inheritance tax. Each spouse has an annual capital gains
tax exemption of Pounds 5,500, which should be used to the full. This can be
done by holding assets in joint names. For example, if you sell a second
property held in joint names, the full Pounds 11,000 of CGT allowance
becomes available.
Once you die, inheritance tax comes into play (see W for Wills). There is no
IHT to pay on money left to one's spouse.
Most married couples own the family home under a joint-tenancy arrangement,
so that the death of one spouse means that the other inherits the property
automatically. The surviving spouse does not then have to pay IHT. But once
both spouses have died, their children will have to pay it, and the first
parent's nil rate band of Pounds 140,000 will not have been used.
So it is more tax-efficient to leave Pounds 140,000 to the children and the
balance to the spouse by the tenants-in-common arrangement under which a
husband and wife own a half share of the home absolutely. When one partner
dies, half the property is inherited by the children, who can use the
deceased parent's nil rate band. But only do this if you trust your children
not to force the surviving parent to sell.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (16): Tax may be postponed, not
avoided - Offshore and overseas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TERMS 'offshore' and 'overseas investment' seem to conjure up a wealthy
investor lounging in a deckchair and sipping cocktails on a sun-soaked sandy
beach. However, offshore and overseas investment are not, as the layman
might assume, the same thing.
The difference lies in where the institution that handles the money is
based. If you buy units in a Taiwanese fund run by a London-based unit trust
company, that is overseas investment; if you put pounds into a sterling
currency account run by a Jersey-based company, you are investing offshore.
Offshore investment will be forever associated in the public mind with tax
evasion, and there is little doubt that many people do park their money in
various specialist centres for that purpose.
The prospect of a Labour government may tempt more Britons to follow that
path. But they should know that UK citizens are liable to be taxed on their
worldwide income, wherever it arises. Sticking your money in a Jersey
account and not declaring the income is simply breaking the law.
There are exceptions, however. British expatriates only have to pay UK tax
on income arising within the UK. There are thus advantages in them holding
funds in an offshore account which pays interest gross.
It is also possible to postpone, rather than avoid, tax via an offshore
roll-up fund. If income is allowed to roll up within the fund, it will be
taxed only when repatriated. So the investor who knows that he or she will
shortly move into a lower tax bracket may find advantages in such a system.
This could be especially true if Labour were to impose its 9 per cent
investment income surcharge. The surcharge would not apply to those above
the state pension age, so someone under 65 (60 for women) with savings might
find a roll-up fund attractive.
The old attraction of offshore deposit accounts to UK investors - that they
can pay interest gross - has disappeared now that onshore banks and building
societies can offer the same facility. Nevertheless, the sheer range of
offshore currency and bond funds gives the investor who wants gross income
more options. Those who believe sterling is set to fall, for example, might
invest in one of the overseas currency funds; those who believe interest
rates will drop could opt for a bond fund.
Remember the dangers, however. Although some offshore operations are run by
highly respectable companies, offshore centres often have less rigorous
regulatory systems, and some lack compensation schemes.
Overseas, rather than offshore, investment has very few tax implications.
The main reason for investing overseas is to gain a higher return than is
available from the UK.
Those who favour overseas investment argue that Britain is only a small part
of the world economy, so that it makes sense to diversify. Other countries'
economies can be surging ahead while Britain stays in recession.
Certainly, there have been times when those who ventured into Japan or the
US achieved superior returns. And there is a good case for arguing that, as
Britain integrates with Europe, UK investors should increase their holdings
of European equities and bonds.
But there are counter-arguments for staying in the UK. One is that many
British companies have overseas operations and thus provide automatic
diversification for the domestic investor.
Another is that assets should match liabilities. An investor who will spend
money in sterling needs to invest in sterling; to do otherwise is to expose
himself to an unnecessary currency risk.
Even if investors do decide to venture overseas, buying shares directly can
be expensive. You will normally have to pay a handling charge for doing so,
because the shares are in bearer form and need to be safeguarded. In
addition, the nominal price of some overseas shares can run into thousands
of pounds, making it difficult to invest small amounts.
For most who invest overseas, a unit or investment trust (see letter U) is
likely to be the best vehicle. It is much easier for professional managers
to monitor these markets and obtain the necessary spread of shares to reduce
risk.
Even here, caution is needed. A fund which specialises in an individual
market, say Taiwan, is likely to be much more volatile than one which covers
a wide geographical area. The broadest portfolio can obviously be provided
by an international unit or investment trust, but those interested in
specific areas can have the choice of funds covering the whole of Europe or
the Pacific region. Those attracted by the high economic growth in some
smaller economies can achieve a spread by investing in one of the general
emerging-markets funds.
Investors should realise that overseas companies do not tend to pay such
high dividends as those in the UK and that, at least, in the initial years,
they may have to suffer a lower income when they invest abroad.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (20): Mind the tax trap if you take
income - Single-premium bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGLE-premium bond is the life industry's answer to the unit trust  -
with a small amount of life assurance as the icing on the cake.
Each insurance company selling investment bonds sets its own minimum for the
level of one-off lump sum or single premium to be accepted, generally in a
range from Pounds 250 to Pounds 2,500. Charges are similar to those for unit
trusts - an initial 5 per cent plus an annual 1 per cent for management.
Investment bonds come in three main varieties:
With-profits bonds: Last year, investors took a 'safety-first' attitude and
poured into with-profits bonds, which add on non-reversible bonuses each
year, in a manner similar to with-profits endowments. For example, Norwich
Union took Pounds 700m into its with-profits bond, three times the 1990
total, straining its liquidity and threatening future pay-outs to
policyholders.
The company reacted by pulling down the shutters on future business in the
bonds from independent financial advisers, or brokers - in effect a 95 per
cent cutback, although NU's tied agents are still allowed to sell the bonds.
Unit-linked bonds allow investment in a selection of specialised funds
holding gilts, international equities, money-market instruments or property.
They offer the facility to switch between funds without incurring entry
charges - an advantage over unit trusts. Decisions about switching among the
funds may be taken by the investors themselves or turned over to the
insurance company or to a broker for a fee.
This led to 'broker bonds', carrying the name of the broker making the
investment decisions rather than the insurance company holding the money.
These were investigated by the Securities and Investments Board, which at
first seemed intent on a total ban but then settled for imposing tighter
regulations.
Unit-linked bonds are commission-heavy. Investors choosing between unit
trusts and bonds should realise that, on a Pounds 10,000 investment, this is
eqivalent to choosing between an investment paying Pounds 300 in commission
(unit trusts) and one paying possibly Pounds 600 (bonds).
You are unlikely to be told this. Instead, arguments presented to investors
emphasise features such as tax treatment and the costs of switching
underlying investments, often ignoring a potentially damaging tax trap.
Guaranteed income bonds provide a fixed rate of return for a set number of
years, paying back the original capital at the end of the term.
A guaranteed growth bond will repay the original capital after a set term
plus a specified return on the capital - for example, matching any increase
in the FTSE-100 index. But guarantees are always paid for by the investor.
Such a guarantee is only a pledge to follow the changes in share prices,
taking no account of dividends, which will be pocketed by the insurance
company.
Interest rate levels have also boosted sales of guaranteed income bonds,
with 10 per cent seen as the 'magic' rate, sure to attract large numbers of
investors.
Brokers are increasingly competing on guaranteed bond rates by using the
commission they receive to augment the rate offered by the insurance
company. They have plenty of scope to do so. Commission on a Pounds 10,000
guaranteed-income bond could be up to Pounds 150, while some brokers
estimate that selling a bond on an 'execution only' basis, without advising
an investor costs only about Pounds 10 in form-filling time.
The tax position: A basic-rate taxpayer has no income or capital gains taxes
to pay on part or complete withdrawals from a bond.
Higher-rate taxpayers may be charged 15 per cent tax (the difference between
the 40 per cent higher rate and 25 per cent) when a with-profits or
unit-linked bond is fully surrendered or cashed in on the death of the
holder - the charge would be only on the part of the proceeds exceeding the
original premium.
But, thanks to the rules on partial withdrawals, even millionaires can
remove themselves from the higher-rate tax bracket with the help of
investment bonds. Investors can withdraw up to 5 per cent a year of the
amount originally invested without having to pay higher-rate tax. This can
continue for up to 20 years, when all of the original value has been used
up.
Although higher-rate tax is due when the bond is finally cashed in,
investors are able to claim top-slicing relief on any profit they have made.
This works by averaging the profit over the number of years the bond has
been in place and adding the result to the investor's income, to arrive at
any higher rate tax due. For example, a profit of Pounds 10,000 on a bond
fully cashed in 10 years after the original investment, amounts to an
average profit of Pounds 1,000 to be added to the investor's income for that
final year. The higher-rate tax figure arrived at in this way would be
multiplied by 10 to produce the tax bill.
The serious catch with investment bonds is that investors who exceed the 5
per cent annual withdrawal can find themselves paying 15 per cent tax on a
gain when their bond is showing a loss.
An investor who put Pounds 20,000 into a bond before October 1987 could have
been left with units worth considerably less three years later. Under the 5
per cent rule, he would have been able to withdraw up to 15 per cent, or
Pounds 3,000, from the bond without any immediate tax penalty. But a
withdrawal of Pounds 10,000 would land him with a bill for 15 per cent
(Pounds 1,050) on his Pounds 7,000 'gain'. Theoretically the tax treatment
would even out in succeeding years, though this seems unlikely, given the
dent made in the investment.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (6): An inflation hedge if you buy
wisely - Equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES ARE the siren voice of the investment market. Private investors are
conscious of the allure; everyone knows someone who has made a killing,
either on a privatisation or a small company stock.
But many investors are also aware of the rocks on which the sirens sit. The
recent corporate collapses of Maxwell and Polly Peck have illustrated how
quickly the value of equity investments can evaporate.
Fear is normally stronger than greed. All too often, a roaring bull market
is required before investors can be persuaded to leave the safety of their
building society for the excitement of equities. Of course, they then buy at
exactly the wrong moment, and are then disillusioned for another decade when
share prices inevitably fall.
The danger with keeping money for long periods in the building society is of
a fall in the real (after inflation) rather than the nominal value of
capital. Over the period 1946-91, figures from Barclays de Zoete Wedd show
that the average* annual real return on equities was 6.14 per cent; the real
return on Treasury bills (a rough equivalent to building society returns)
over the same period was just 0.53 per cent per year.
From these figures, equities seem to be the obvious inflation hedge, but
there are snags. BZW's indices do not reflect costs and, of course, there is
no guarantee that the stocks selected by private investors will match the
performance of the indices.
At the moment, the risk and tax-free returns provided by National Savings (a
real 4.5 per cent if held for five years) look very attractive compared with
BZW's figures for equities.
National Savings (see letter N) do not provide income, however, and
investors should not forget the ability of shares to pay a rising income in
the form of dividends. BZW's equity income index show that dividends
increased almost tenfold in nominal terms between 1970 and 1991, and rose 40
per cent in real terms over the same period.
So there is a strong long-term case for investing in equities. What strategy
ought you to follow? To get a properly diversified portfolio of individual
shares, you probably need to invest around Pounds 50,000. For most small
investors, the risk of picking the wrong stocks is so high that it is best
for them to gain access to equities via the vehicle of a unit or investment
trust (see letter U).
Those who have enough money to invest directly in shares will still probably
need the advice and help of a stockbroker. The difficulty of finding the
right broker is what dissuades many people from investing in shares. Brokers
have a snooty image, and the man in the street often assumes that his meagre
portfolio will not be worthy of attention.
In fact, after some rather lean years for their industry, brokers are a lot
more welcoming than they used to be.
What sort of broker you need depends on how much you know about the market.
If you haven't a clue about shares, then you probably need the services of a
discretionary broker. He or she will manage the portfolio on your behalf,
and sort out such matters as the collection of dividends and the efficient
use of your capital gains tax allowance.
These days, such brokers will often charge a fee, based on the size of your
portfolio. They have therefore every incentive to see that your investments
perform, because their fee will rise in proportion.
An advisory, or dealing-only, broker will be more suitable for those who
know their way round the stock market and which stocks to select. Such
brokers may be available for a quick chat on the lines of 'what do you think
of ICI shares?' but mainly they will leave the decisions up to you.
They will be paid in terms of commission on each trade they make on your
behalf, and the rates they charge will be one of the most important factors
in your choice. Small investors should particularly look for the minimum
commission per deal.
A directory of brokers can be obtained by writing to the Stock Exchange in
London. Alternatively, there is a full list in the back of Beginners' Guide
to Investment, by Bernard Gray, published by Business Books Limited at
Pounds 8.95, which also contains a lot of useful information on owning
shares.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (4): A suitable case for treatment -
Capital gains tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RULES that determine capital gains tax, the tax you pay on profits from
investments, are complicated and frequently illogical.
CGT can apply to profits made from the sale of such investments or
possessions as: shares of all forms, unit trusts, valuable items such as
antiques, and property (other than your main residence).
You do not pay anything unless your net gain for the tax year exceeds a
threshold of Pounds 5,500, which excludes most people. Nor can you be taxed
until you have sold your investment and realised a capital gain. So you do
not pay CGT if your shares have had a great year but you are still holding
on to them.
Nor are you taxed on any investments which have not kept track with
inflation. You are taxed only on the amount by which your investment has
beaten the retail prices index (RPI). This is known as the indexation
allowance. Its calculation is complicated, but each month the Inland Revenue
releases new tables that show how much RPI has risen for every month since
March 1982. These are published monthly in the Weekend FT.
An example will illustrate the process. Assume that you had bought shares at
a total cost of Pounds 5,000 in September 1984. The indexation value in
December 1991 was 1.506 - in other words, prices had increased by around 50
per cent since 1984. You would therefore multiply Pounds 5,000 by 1.506 to
find your indexed cost if you had sold. This would have come to Pounds
7,530.
Had you sold your shares in December, whether you made a taxable gain or a
loss would have depended on whether the proceeds were above or below Pounds
7,530. If you made no other capital gains during the current tax year, then
the proceeds could have been as much as Pounds 13,030 (the indexation
allowance of Pounds 7,530, plus the threshold of Pounds 5,500) before you
needed to pay any CGT. Broking and dealing costs can be taken into account
in calculating your CGT base costs and sale proceeds.
Gains can be offset against losses elsewhere in your portfolio. Shares which
have risen in value since you bought them can still count as losses after
indexation. If, after indexation, gains outweigh losses in your portfolio by
less than Pounds 5,500 for a year, you pay no CGT.
CGT does not affect income from investments - such as the dividend on
shares, or the rent from second houses. These are taxed as income. But your
top income tax rate (and the size of your income if you are a basic-rate
taxpayer) determines the rate of CGT you have to pay.
How can you minimise CGT? One of the most important techniques is the 'bed &amp;
breakfast' deal, where you sell shares one afternoon and buy them back the
following morning. The transaction costs involved are not negligible, so you
should take the advice of brokers and accountants before doing this.
B&amp;B deals are most useful when you have already made gains in the current
tax year which take you over the threshold. A B&amp;B deal to establish a loss
elsewhere in your portfolio can save you a specific amount of tax, which you
know you would otherwise have had to pay.
You can also use B&amp;B deals to take your gains for the year up to the
threshold. This is more speculative. It may save you tax in the future, but
it may not; so look carefully at the brokers' fees and the likely overnight
price spread before going to market.
Some gilt unit trusts, which hold a proportion of international bonds,
provide CGT-efficient investments. They invest in bonds which pay out high
interest but are unlikely to grow in value. This can provide you with a high
income, and also establish a loss for CGT purposes to be offset against
gains elsewhere in your portfolio.
A final irritating point to note: as the result of an attempt to simplify
the tax, all gains and losses on investments bought before April 6, 1982
have now been rebased to March 31, 1982. In theory, any gains made on
investments before that date have effectively been written off. In practice,
this move has added many new complexities. If you are holding on to shares
from a long time back, you should take the advice of an accountant about
rebasing.
CGT is so unpopular at present that Labour's plans have not caused much
political controversy, but it is as well to note that the rules might change
if there were a change of government. The threshold would come down by
Pounds 1,000 or more, and there might also be an increase in the rate
charged.
Labour wants a reform to encourage long-termism - the rate of tax paid would
grow less, the longer the investment were held. Thus, short-term stock
market 'stagging' would be penalised.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (22): Two routes that help to cut
the risk - Unit and investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT corporate collapses of Polly Peck and Maxwell Communications have
illustrated the risks of share-picking for small investors.
One way to reduce those risks is to buy into unit or investment trusts. Each
invests in a wide portfolio of shares, so that even a collapse such as
Maxwell's will have only a small effect on the overall value of the fund.
Their different names reflect different structures. Unit trusts are what is
called open-ended funds, which means that the fund can increase or decrease
in size depending on investor demand. If the fund is worth Pounds 100m and
investors buy another Pounds 10m worth of units, then the fund manager will
have to buy a further Pounds 10m of shares to increase the size of the
portfolio to Pounds 110m. If sales of Pounds 20m are then made, the manager
will have to sell Pounds 20m worth of shares.
As a consequence, the value of the units is always directly related to the
value of the fund. If the fund is worth Pounds 100m, and there are 100m
units, then each unit should be worth 100p (ignoring, for the moment, the
bid-offer spread).
Investment trusts, in contrast, are closed-end funds. They are companies
quoted on the stock exchange with a set number of shares, which is rarely
changed. Investors buy and sell the shares from each other, instead of, in
the case of unit trusts, directly from the manager.
The price of investment trust shares, while broadly related to the value of
the portfolio, is also governed by supply and demand. If more investors want
to sell than buy shares, the share price will fall, regardless of whether or
not the value of the portfolio has fallen.
It is thus unlikely that the share price of an investment trust with Pounds
100m of assets and 100m shares would be exactly 100p. Normally, the trust's
shares would stand at a discount to asset value at, say, 90p.
This factor creates an extra risk for those who back investment trusts. If
they buy when the discount is narrow and it then widens, they will have lost
money, even if the value of the portfolio is unchanged. Of course, the
opposite is true; if the discount narrows, then the investor gains, even if
the value of the portfolio has not risen.
A narrowing of discounts has occurred over the last few years, with the
result that the performance of investment trusts has been far better than
that of their unit trust rivals. The average investment trust made a gain of
50.5 per cent over the five years to January 1, compared with a rise of just
30.1 per cent in the average unit trust.
Investment trusts have revived demand for their shares among private
investors, partly through monthly savings schemes, partly through ingenious
tax-efficient share structures, and partly through paying commissions to
intermediaries to sell them.
This last factor, in particular, has started to erode one of the perceived
advantages of investment trusts over unit trusts - their lower costs.
Typically, unit trust investors pay an initial charge of between 5 and 6 per
cent - of which around half normally goes to the salesman - and 1 to 1.5 per
cent in management fees.
Annual management fees on investment trusts tend to be below 1 per cent, and
the initial spread depends on the liquidity of the trust's shares. In
January, for example, the spread on shares in the largest trust, Foreign &amp;
Colonial, was just over 1 per cent; while the spread on the small Capital
Gearing trust was 10 per cent.
Lower costs have been another factor behind the outperformance of investment
trusts. But the cost structure of M&amp;G's Income Investment Trust, launched
last year, was almost bang in line with unit trust industry standards.
This factor, together with the proliferation of investment trust launches in
1991 and 1992, could mean that unit trusts will bounce back in the 1990s. If
investment trust managers swamp demand with new issues, discounts will
widen; and the share price performance will suffer.
But arguments about the relative merits of the two kinds of trust should not
blind investors to the very real advantages that each can offer.
Better-off private investors may be able to build up a UK share portfolio of
their own. But for most people, the only sensible way to get access to
overseas shares is via a unit or investment trust.
The industry has gone out of its way to provide for every conceivable
investor interest - from East Germany to Latin America, and from Spain to
New Zealand.
And via split-capital investment trusts, an investor can pick and choose the
nature of his investment - from shares that pay a high yield but incur a
capital loss, via zeros which offer no yield but steady capital growth, to
warrants which grant the investor a way of gambling on a sharp upward move
in the market.
All this is accessible, through a savings scheme, for as little as Pounds 25
a month, making unit and investment trusts the obvious starting point for
anyone interested in the stock market.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (5): Vehicles for insurance or a
gamble - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVEL TO the Cannonbridge building, near Cannon Street station, in London,
and you witness the bizarre sight of dozens of young men and women in
brightly coloured jackets, gesticulating as wildly as bookies at a
racecourse.
They are participating in one of the most arcane corners of the financial
service industry - the derivatives market. Derivatives is the name given to
the 'risk management' family of financial instruments, such as futures and
options.
These instruments have two functions - as a means for investors to insure
the value of their holdings, and as a vehicle for speculation.
Futures involve a commitment to buy or sell a commodity at a future date.
The market grew out of the sharp fluctuations in commodity prices which can
ruin many a farmer or manufacturer.
In the 1970s, the techniques that had been applied to commodity futures
trading were translated to the financial markets. Suppose a fund manager
owned a large portfolio of US stocks and was worried that the US stock
market was about to fall, but could not sell his portfolio without moving
prices substantially against him.
The existence of stock index futures, which will move roughly in line with
the underlying market, gives him an alternative. He can sell the stock index
future and benefit from any fall in the value of the market. Similarly, if
he thought the market was about to rise, he could buy the future.
What makes this doubly attractive is that he does not have to put up the
full value of the contract, but a small proportion, known as the margin.
The margin system also offers scope to the speculator. If one can purchase,
say, a Pounds 100,000 contract with margin of only Pounds 6,000, then a 6
per cent increase in the value of the contract would represent a 100 per
cent profit on the investment.
The risk is that a small fall in the value of the contract would wipe out
the original investment.
Private investors rarely take a direct involvement in the futures market,
but there is plenty of scope for them to buy and sell options.
Options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy and sell a
given commodity at a given price over a given time. In return for this
right, the purchaser pays a fee, known as a premium.
A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy a commodity at a given
price within a set period; a put option gives him the right to sell.
The most practical use of options for a private investor is in the stock
market. Take the insurance aspect first. An investor with a holding in, say,
ICI, might be worried about a short-term fall in the price, but not want to
sell the shares. In late January, he could have bought a put option, giving
him the right to sell shares in April at the 'strike price' of 1250p. This
would have cost him 54.5p.
If, by late March, the shares have fallen to 1000p, then the shareholder has
two courses of action. The option will have increased in value - to at least
250p - so the shareholder can sell the option and retain the shares. The
profit on the option will offset the loss on the shares.
Alternatively, the shareholder can exercise the option and sell the shares.
He has saved himself from a large chunk of the fall in ICI's share price.
Options also offer a speculative side. The premium is just a fraction of the
share price. Those who are convinced that a share is going to move sharply
will have the greatest profits if they buy an option.
The April 1250p call price of ICI at the end of January was 48.5p. Someone
gambling on a bid for the company at, say, 1500p would have a chance of
quintupling his money by buying the option. If he bought the shares, his
profit potential would be merely 20 per cent.
The flipside of the higher reward is higher risk. If a bid did not occur,
the speculator might find that the option expired worthless; whereas if he
had bought the shares directly, he might break even.
Options are therefore best used by sophisticated investors who understand
the risks. This is particularly true of those who plan to sell (write in the
jargon) options to others. If you sell a put option without owning the
shares involved, your risks are enormous.
Say you sold a put option which gave someone the right to sell you 10,000
shares at 100p, in return for a premium of 6p per share or Pounds 600. If
the shares collapsed to 5p, the optionholder would exercise his option, and
you would have to pay him Pounds 10,000 for shares worth Pounds 500 in the
market, a loss of Pounds 9,500.
Those who find futures and options exciting, but too complicated to get
involved in directly, can now buy special unit trusts called futures and
option funds (Fofs). These have caused some controversy in the unit trust
industry, because of the fear that a spectacular collapse might tarnish the
name of the sector. As a result, by end January, only Legal &amp; General and
John Govett had entered the field.
Such funds need not necessarily be excessively risky - much will depend on
how conservatively they are run. But investors may be tempted to hold back
until they see a performance record established.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (12): VAT helps to rob gold of its
magic - Krugerrands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KRUGERRANDS HAVE not received any promotion or advertising support for seven
years. Yet there can be very few readers who do not recognise their name.
They are the coins launched by South Africa in 1967 to provide investors
with the opportunity to buy gold in small quantities. As the world's biggest
gold producer, South Africa had a vested interest in this attempt to turn
small investors into big 'gold bugs'.
During the following 18 years, Krugerrands dominated the gold coin market.
More than 44m troy ounces of gold was used to make them (about 1,400
tonnes), and sales spurted to a peak of more than 6m ounces, or 170 tonnes,
in 1978.
But demand had dropped to 1m ounces by 1985, the year sanctions were imposed
against South Africa by the US and the European Community.
Sanctions recently have been removed - the EC's as recently as January 28
this year - and the South Africans have been working on a detailed marketing
strategy to re-launch the Krugerrand. But they won't say when.
Their reluctance is understandable. Many private investors have lost all
interest in gold, and this is an exceptionally difficult time in the gold
coin market. Demand is at the lowest level for many years, and forecasts
suggest that the combined sales of the five best-selling coins last year
reached only about half the 2.4m ounces sold in 1990.
The position is even more disastrous in the UK, because since 1982 investors
have had to pay value added tax, currently 17.5 per cent, to take delivery
at home (this cannot be reclaimed when the gold is sold).
The imposition of VAT virtually killed off investment by private individuals
in physical gold in the UK, even though the tax can be avoided if the metal
is delivered offshore. Today, a UK private investor has tremendous
difficulty trying to find someone to deal with if gold bars or coins are on
the shopping list. All the big bullion houses have dropped out of the
business, and will only look after long-standing private customers.
There are other deterrents, apart from VAT, to investment in physical gold:
no interest is paid on the cash invested; there are storage and extra
insurance costs; there is a currency risk, because gold's price is
denominated in dollars. Gains on its price will often be offset by losses on
the dollar.
But the main reason gold has fallen out of favour with private investors is
that it simply has not lived up to its reputation of being 'a store of
value' over time. The price has been falling steadily for more than three
years. Over the past 10 years, gold has given up about 70 per cent of its
value in real terms.
Gold bought 10 years ago at Dollars 459.25 an ounce should now be valued at
Dollars 823 just to match an investment netting a modest compound 6 per cent
rate of interest. Last year gold's price averaged Dollars 362, and many
analysts suggest that it may manage Dollars 400 or thereabouts in 1992.
There are signs that the market's structure has changed. In the past 10
years, a host of gold-backed financial instruments, such as gold options,
has eroded the importance of the physical gold market and helped to curb the
price volatility which used to attract short-term speculators.
Moreover, the market is being dampened by the behaviour of the gold
producers themselves, who seem to have little faith that the price will
recover substantially. Every time the price rallies there is a rush by
producers to sell forward - that is, to fix future delivery at a determined
price and 'lock in' a profit.
Edwin Arnold, a vice-president and metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group, says the vast bulk of private and institutional
money that would have gone into gold or gold futures 10 years ago now goes
into financial futures or derivative gold option products instead.
He adds: 'Gold is not some magical store of value. There is nothing mystical
about gold. It is really nothing more than a high-priced industrial metal.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (26): A measure of value but also of
risk - Yield
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS vital for any investor who wants to buy shares or bonds to understand
the principle of yield. Put simply, the yield on an investment is the rate
of return that the investor can expect. It may come in the form of income
(interest or dividends) or capital growth.
Yield is calculated by dividing the return (in whatever form) by the price
of the investment returned. This leads to the golden rule that, as prices
rise, yields fall - and vice versa.
Consequently markets use yields as a measure of the value of shares and
bonds. If a share or bond has a higher than average yield, this may be a
sign that it is attractive; that the price is set to rise (and the yield to
fall).
On the other hand, a share or bond may be trading at a higher than average
yield because the market perceives it to be risky. Investors may fear that
dividends will not be paid, or interest payments met. The price of such a
bond or share falls to a point where the yield is deemed sufficiently
attractive to compensate investors for the higher risk.
Some believe that these higher-yielding shares and bonds offer rewards that
more than compensate investors for risk. In the US, the now imprisoned
Michael Milken, of Drexel Burnham, persuaded many investors to buy so-called
'junk bonds' with very high yields, which he argued would bring above-normal
returns.
In the UK, a number of fund managers have prospered by investing in
high-yielding equities. UK equity income unit trusts proved to be the second
best sector over 10 years to January 1 1992, with an average rise of 405.2
per cent. But the recession in the UK has caused many companies cash-flow
difficulties, and a number are considering cutting their dividend, a move
which would result in a fall in the share price. This would badly affect
equity income trusts.
Yield on bonds: The rate of return on a bond is not the same as its coupon -
the slip of paper which the investor presents for payment of the interest or
dividend on the due date - because the bond is bought at its prevailing
price and not at its redemption price. The yield on a bond can be calculated
in two ways:
Current yield: This measures the income that an investor receives from
holding a bond over the next year. The calculation involves dividing the
bond's coupon by its price and multiplying the result by 100 to obtain a
percentage.
Redemption yield: Also known as the yield-to-maturity, this is a more
accurate, but complicated, way of calculating the yield. It takes into
account the fact that, as well as earning interest, a capital gain or loss
may be made by owning a bond until its redemption date. The calculation is
made and published in the Financial Times tables of British funds (see G for
gilts).
Yield curve: Another important aspect of yields is the different returns on
offer for short- and long-term investments. These can be plotted on a graph
and shown as the 'yield curve'.
In the late 1980s, short-term interest rates were pushed to very high
levels, above the returns offered by gilts. This was, in the jargon, a
backward-sloping yield curve. But short-term rates have fallen, and the
yield curve has flattened. This means in practical terms that private
investors can earn returns on gilts that match, and sometimes beat, those
available from building societies.
Dividend yield: This is the measure of yield for shares, calculated by the
relationship of the gross dividend to the share price. It can be a very
useful way to decide the cheapness or expensiveness of shares in general.
The historical average dividend yield is 5 per cent. As a rule of thumb,
when the market yields substantially more than this, shares look cheap; when
they yield less, shares are relatively dear.
As an example, in the black days of 1974, yields rose to 12 per cent, just
before the great bull market; and in the summer of 1987, yields fell below 3
per cent, just before the crash.
Earnings yield: This is another way of examining the 'value' of share prices
(see V for value investing). It relates a company's profits to its share
price. In essence, it is the inverse of that oft-quoted measure of share
value, the price-earnings ratio: a share with a p/e ratio of 10 would have
an earnings yield of 1/10 - ie, 10 per cent.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (13): The choice is wide but value
varies - Life assurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE ASSURANCE is a misnomer. A more accurate description might be 'death
insurance'.
In its simplest form, family breadwinners buy an insurance policy, paying
premiums in the same way as for more general insurance. It protects
dependants from the financial consequences of losing their breadwinner.
But the life industry has sprawled beyond this, and now accounts for the
lion's share of Britain's long-term savings.
The reasons for this are historical. Unlike general insurance, life insurers
do not need to worry about 'moral hazard' - there is rarely much dispute
over whether someone has indeed died - and mortality tables allow them to
plan their commitments with a strong degree of certainty.
Thus, life funds were soon able to move into more ambitious investments.
They made profits. Then they started returning the profits to investors.
Hence the 'with-profits' policy.
So 'life insurance' now includes a number of products that are competitive
as investments, but do not offer good value life cover in themselves (see Q
for Qualifying endowment policy, and S for Single-premium investment bonds).
The remaining products in the life companies' arsenal make sense for those
who merely want to protect their families. They come in two variants:
Term assurance insures your life for a fixed period. If you die before that
period has elapsed, your family receives the pay-out. If you live out the
term, the company keeps all your premiums. (Endowments are conceptually
similar to term assurance, but guarantee a payment at the end of the term,
even if the policyholder has survived. They should not be regarded as
protection policies, but mainly as investments.)
Whole-of-life assurance, as its name implies, offers a pay-out throughout
your life. Even if you live to be 100, the insurance company will pay out
when you die.
Which of the two protection policies will make the most sense?
As ever with insurance, a lot depends on you. If you have cash-flow
difficulties at the time you first have children, it makes sense to go for
the cheapest option, even though this could work out more expensive in the
long run. If not, then it might be better to aim for the longer term.
But one principle is definite - use an independent broker, preferably one
who charges fees or at least splits commission. Different insurers choose to
aim for business from specific groups. Thus, the company with the 'best buy'
for a 29-year-old man may not provide the best value for a 39-year-old
woman. Some may make flexible versions of their contracts particularly
attractive.
So generalisations about which offices offer the best and worst value are
impossible. But if you go to a tied agent, you will be limited to one
company, which may not offer a competitive deal for someone like you. An
independent adviser can shop around for the best rate to suit your
requirements.
A lot depends on your attitude to undergoing a medical examination. Some
companies will set a maximum level for the cover you can receive without
submitting to a medical, although this is often very high - Pounds 200,000
or more. Other medical criteria can vary - smokers, for example, are
unlikely to get good value from a company which offers a discount to
non-smokers.
Much has been changed by Aids, which has smashed through many actuarial
assumptions on mortality rates. While the chance of a full-blown Aids
epidemic among the UK's younger population remains, life insurance deals
will probably remain more expensive, and less flexible, than they were.
Aids has effectively finished off some of the better-value ways to take out
cheap term assurance. However, term assurance is always the cheaper option.
When you have children, it is often good value to take out insurance on a
'joint life, first death' basis - in other words, it pays out after the
first partner of the couple dies.
The premiums for term assurance depend on your age when you start the
policy, and the length of the term - the older you are and the longer the
term, the more you pay.
You can thus save money by starting with a short term, such as five years.
This will be very cheap. But be warned. If, during the five years, you have
a heart attack or anything else which would show up on the standard
questionnaire and render you uninsurable, you would not be able to buy a
further term. Another term would, in any case, be more expensive, because
you would be older.
This leads to a number of complex contracts, which begin to merge term
assurance with whole-of-life:
Renewable term guarantees that you can re-insure yourself at the end of the
first term, even if you have fallen seriously ill in the meantime. You would
still have to pay a higher premium on the second term, based on your age.
Convertible term is the same, but also allows you to convert to a
whole-of-life policy, even if you have fallen ill.
Increasing term allows you to increase the amount of cover automatically
during the term.
You can short-circuit the problem of reinsuring yourself by buying a
whole-of-life policy. This also carries the benefit that you can receive a
'surrender value' - in other words, if you decide you do not want to
continue the policy at some point, you will receive some money back. Many
policies allow you to link a whole-of-life policy to a choice of funds.
Whole-of-life policies do not stand up as investments in their own right.
But the ability to derive a surrender value, once you have no dependants and
no need for life insurance, does go a long way towards justifying the extra
cost when you start the policy.
There can be no hard or fast rules - if you are strapped for cash, look at
one of the renewable or convertible term policies; or if you are confident
you can afford it, a whole-of-life policy. Whatever you do, go to a broker.
You might also want to look at a new breed of policies. Changing
demographics have forced life offices to offer protection against
contracting a serious illness and surviving it, or living into an
over-lengthy retirement. This has led to critical-illness and long-term care
policies (see H for health insurance). Some offer good value and others do
not.
But they have not rendered basic life protection obsolete. Term insurance is
cheaper than it was, and if you have children, or have taken out a mortgage,
it would be the gravest folly not to buy cover.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (25): Four dates that govern
entitlement - Ex-dividend/Ex-rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIPT of dividends is one of the most important privileges of being a
shareholder. Consequently there are strict rules about when, and to whom, a
dividend should be paid.
Most companies pay dividends twice a year, announcing them with their
half-yearly (interim) and annual (preliminary) results. But the dividends
are not actually paid until some time after the results announcement.
Between the announcement of the dividend and its actual payment, many shares
are bought and sold. A system has been established to settle the question of
whether the buyers or the sellers of such shares are entitled to the
subsequent payment.
According to Mark Powell, chief executive of broker Laurence Keen, there are
four significant dates: the day dividends are announced; the day they go
ex-dividend (or xd); the day the company closes the shareholder register for
dividend payments; and the date of payment itself.
If you buy a share after a dividend has been announced but before it has
gone ex-dividend, you are entitled to the dividend payment. In the jargon,
you have bought the shares cum-dividend.
It is possible, however, that your name will not appear on the register
before the company closes its books, usually about a month before the
dividend is actually paid. In that case, says Mr Powell, your broker will
automatically claim back the dividend for you.
If you buy a share after it has gone ex-dividend, then you are not entitled
to receive the payment.
Sellers should remember that they will not receive a dividend, even if it
has been announced, if they sell before the ex-dividend date. If they want
to receive the payment, they have to wait and sell the shares after they
have gone ex-dividend. However, there is unlikely to be an advantage in
doing so, because shares normally fall in price as soon as they go xd.
A rights issue (when a company raises money by issuing new shares) follows
the same pattern, though the process will normally be quicker. A share will
go ex-rights a matter of days after the issue has been announced.
Consequently, if you sell your shares just before a rights issue is
announced, it is possible that you will still be on the shareholders'
register when the company sends out the allotment letters. If that happens,
you should return the allotment letter.
Those who sell the shares after they have gone ex-rights will be entitled to
take up the new shares in the rights issue. If you do not want to do so, you
can sell what is called the nil-paid rights in the market. Alternatively,
you can wait until the issue closes; the company will then try to place the
shares in the market, and pass the proceeds on to you.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (14): First decide if you really
need to buy - Mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MORTGAGE is the biggest financial transaction of most people's lives.
Banks and insurance companies are aware of this: people buying houses are
usually in the market for other financial services at the same time,
especially insurance.
So the financial services industry sees each mortgage customer as a
lucrative sales opportunity.
Mortgage lenders also chase would-be customers hard these days: the era when
you had to build up substantial savings and wait in a queue to become
eligible for a mortgage ended in the early 1980s.
If you are prepared to make the effort, there is no need to rely on a
'finder' when choosing a mortgage. If your needs are complex, it may be
sensible to consult a mortgage broker who, for a fixed fee, can find you the
most suitable mortgage on the market. But do not lean for advice on an
insurance salesman or your bank manager.
Another point to consider at the outset is whether you should be taking out
a mortgage at all. Might it be wiser to live in rented accommodation and put
your cash somewhere else?
The answer depends partly on your motivation. Are you primarily looking for
a home to live in? Or are you seeking an investment which will perform well
in the years ahead? In decades when house prices climbed steadily, there was
never much doubt about the answer to the second question.
If you bought a house in the 1980s, and even more so in the 1970s, you would
have seen the value of your deposit for the mortgage grow much faster than
most other investments, sometimes by as much as 75 per cent in three years.
This is no longer the case. Since 1988, the market has changed dramatically
and perhaps for ever.
Mortgage interest relief on income tax is being whittled away. House prices
have fallen steadily during the past two years, and a recovery in the market
looks some way off. Even when it comes, prices will grow slowly: the
foreseeable future is unlikely to see windfall gains made from home
ownership, as happened in the 1980s Lawson boom.
But if you do decide to buy rather than rent, the next question is what kind
of mortgage you should have: repayment, endowment, personal equity plan, or
interest-only?
The oldest type is the repayment mortgage, in which your monthly payments
include interest and repayment of capital.
About three-quarters of mortgages sold these days are endowment mortgages.
These yield high commissions for insurance salesmen; but they lock customers
into a 25-year savings scheme - and only one customer in eight completes the
full period. Those who surrender their policies early do badly.
This may be an important consideration when you next move house and perhaps
switch to another lender. Though they are not supposed to, some lenders try
to tie the sale of an insurance policy to a new mortgage.
There may be other risks. With-profits endowment policies work by paying an
annual bonus and a final bonus at the end of 25 years. Last year, one large
insurer (Norwich Union) cut its annual bonus, though not by an amount which
immediately affects policy-holders. But if conditions remain as tough for
the insurance industry as in the last two years, it is conceivable that
endowment policy holders may find themselves asked to increase their
payments.
More exotic repayment vehicles, such as Peps, are available. They may be
less expensive than the endowment mortgage, but can they be expected to last
for 25 years?
It is also possible to have a mortgage without a repayment vehicle at all.
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society was the first lender to offer
interest-only mortgages. These are likely to suit two sorts of people: those
who already have a payment vehicle (such as an endowment policy), and those
who cannot afford to enter the mortgage market in any other way and hope to
sell at a profit in a few years.
Some people will presumably not move during the 25-year life of an
interest-only policy; in which case they could find themselves with problems
when its term is up and they have no way of repaying it other than by
selling their home, especially if by then they are advanced in years.
Foreign-currency mortgages require even more cautious examination. A
mortgage denominated in US dollars or Japanese yen is fine if you are
earning your salary in that currency. But if your income is in sterling, you
will find your debt and your monthly outgoings increasing sharply when the
pound falls against the currency of your mortgage.
There are other points which anyone taking out a mortgage should consider.
One important question is what penalties you will face if you pay off your
mortgage early, as most borrowers do. This particularly applies to
fixed-rate mortgages, where you often face penalties of between three and
six months. Fixed rates offer the attraction of certainty, but investors may
feel foolish if interest rates then fall.
Most lenders now offer reduced rates to customers with large mortgages, and
also to first-time buyers. This is fine, but check to see how long the
discount will last.
Even more caution is needed with 'low start' mortgages, where you pay less
at the start of the mortgage, but only because unpaid interest is added to
your debt. Borrowers may find that, after three years, their monthly
payments rise by more than they can afford.
Finally, the question that is probably uppermost in the minds of all
would-be borrowers: which lender should they turn to? Efficient
administration, an understanding attitude to borrowers in temporary
difficulties, and a long-term commitment to stay in the market are qualities
you should seek, though you will obviously also want a lender who keeps
interest rates as low as possible.
If you take out a mortgage from a lender who later wants to withdraw from
the UK market, you may find yourself paying a higher rate than the market
standard. The clearing banks have a good reputation for efficiency, and few
of their mortgage customers seem to come unstuck. Building societies have
generally offered slightly cheaper interest rates than banks.
Those who have fared worst have been the customers of the specialist
mortgage companies, set up in the 1980s, who in some cases seem to be stuck
with higher interest rates and poor service.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (9): Longer lives incur more
ailments - Health insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH IS a hot political topic. Whichever party you believe about the state
of the National Health Service, the explosion of interest in private health
insurance over the last few years cannot be denied.
Political questions aside, one simple factor has boosted the health
insurance industry - people are living longer, and so suffering more
ailments before they die. It now seems more important to protect yourself
against the financial consequences of surviving a serious illness than it
does to protect your family against the risks of your dying from it.
The term 'health insurance' covers a number of products with differing
objectives:
Private medical insurance is probably the closest to what most people would
understand by the term. You insure yourself against the need for treatment,
and the insurer pays the bills, subject to a maximum.
This is best regarded as an attractive luxury for those who can afford it.
It allows choice over the timing of your treatment, which can be in a
private nursing home if you wish.
Policies fall into two categories. Those over 60 can take advantage of
basic-rate income tax relief, paid at source to the insurer in a similar
system to the Miras arrangement for tax relief on mortgage loans. Plans
specially designed for the elderly exclude obviously inappropriate
conditions, such as childish ailments or maternity, and can be good value.
Such plans will exclude extra 'frills' such as extra cash sums while you
have the treatment, and will usually only provide cover if NHS treatment is
not available within a fixed period, of about six weeks.
Without the tax relief - something of a political hot potato - private
medical insurance is less obviously a good deal, and premiums are rising.
However, many groups offer special budget policies, for a small number of
common ailments, and it is worth considering these if you think that private
care would be better for you.
Critical illness insurance, also known as 'dread disease' cover, is a
variant on life insurance. It pays you a lump sum as soon as you fall victim
to a 'critical illness', defined in the first instance by the insurer and
then assessed by a doctor. Normally it covers cancers, heart diseases and
strokes, though many policies branch into other conditions.
A critical-illness policy stands or falls on the list of illnesses covered,
on which there is no agreed industry standard as yet. Be careful, for
example, to avoid policies which cover double, but not single, heart-bypass
operations.
Also, do not take out excessive life insurance. Most policies pay out on
death as well as on diagnosis of a critical illness, so you can easily find
yourself paying for life cover you do not need. If your life is already
covered, take out a 'stand alone' dread-disease policy.
But the premiums you pay for stand-alone cover and cover including death
benefits reflect the market for this form of insurance. Skandia Life charges
a 30-year-old man a monthly premium of Pounds 18.71 for stand-alone cover of
Pounds 100,000, and Pounds 23.41 for life cover as well. This demonstrates
just how high the chances are that you will have a critical illness at some
point before you die.
Permanent health insurance is a misnomer - a more accurate name would be
'income replacement insurance'. It insures you against loss of income
through taking time off work for health reasons.
This is of most use to those who are effectively 'self-employed', such as
solicitors and chartered accountants. Check with your employer to see if you
already have cover through a group scheme before buying PHI for yourself.
Unlike dread disease, PHI pays an income, not a lump sum. Diagnostic
restrictions are more relaxed - if you are too ill to work, then you qualify
for a pay-out. If you have non-life threatening ailments such as a nervous
breakdown or repetitive strain injury, for example, PHI should provide an
income.
The price you pay varies according to the length of time you are prepared to
spend off work before the insurance is triggered. If you can wait 13 weeks,
cover will normally be a lot cheaper than if you want your income to start
four weeks after falling ill. Also, as an industry standard, you can only
take out cover for 75 per cent of your normal income, to ensure that you
have an incentive to return to work.
PHI can be a vital safety net, particularly for professionals. But check the
previous claims record of the company before buying cover. Claims in this
area can be contentious, so avoid companies with a bad record.
Long-term care insurance is in its infancy, but could yet become a central
part of everyone's financial plan. It defies generalisation, because no two
plans on the market are identical.
Some life insurers offer easy-payment packages, to be taken out just before
an elderly person goes into care. These combine a growth investment, such as
a personal equity plan or a with-profits bond, with an annuity to help pay
the care fees while protecting the initial capital investment.
More ground-breaking policies, from Aetna, Commercial Union, MGI and PPP,
aim to provide insurance against the need for care, long in advance of your
actually needing it. You pay regular premiums through your middle age. With
little claims history to go on, it is difficult to know how good the deals
are, but as medical science allows more people to enjoy an extended old age,
the market for cover is likely to increase.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (19): Will your pension be enough? -
Retirement planning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PENSION fund is a person's most important asset, generally exceeding the
value of the family home.
Despite this fact, few understand fully how their pensions are calculated;
yet without this knowledge it is impossible to plan future contributions and
make good any shortfall in provision.
There are three main sources of pension: state, occupational and personal.
Most people will have pensions from at least two of these sources, and often
all three.
The state pension is split in two: the basic 'old age' pension and the
earnings-related element, known as Serps (State Earnings-related Pension
Scheme). The right to a benefit under both of these will depend on an
person's National Insurance Contribution (NIC) record.
National Insurance for most people is levied at 9 per cent on 'band
earnings' - earnings between Pounds 52 and Pounds 390 per week for the
current tax year. Provided employees pay the full rate of NIC for most of
their working lives, they should be entitled to the full basic state
pension, currently Pounds 52 per week; while, at the other end of the scale,
a minimum of 10 complete years of NICs provides a weekly pension of just
Pounds 13.
Women, in particular, often have a poor record of NICs if they have spent
years at home looking after young children or elderly relatives. Wives can
claim a Category B pension, currently worth Pounds 31.25 a week, through
their husbands' contributions, but this is not paid until their husband is
65 and may be lost if a woman changes her marital status.
Entitlement to Serps builds up from day one. The scheme was introduced by a
Labour government in 1978, to provide employees with 25 per cent of average
band earnings over the best 20 years of their working lives. But the value
of this benefit was reduced by the present government in 1988, to 20 per
cent of earnings over the whole working career.
The Department of Social Security (DSS) would be the first to admit that
calculation of state pensions is complex, but it now offers a pensions
forecast service. If you are interested in this service, complete form BR19
available from any DSS office.
Occupational schemes are the second main source of pensions. They represent
arguably the most tax-efficient form of retirement saving. Since employee
and employer contributions attract full tax relief, the fund grows free of
all UK taxes and the employee can take a lump sum tax-free on retirement.
Occupational schemes also provide the employee with valuable death and
disability benefits.
More than half the 23m employees in the UK are in occupational schemes, with
the majority, including public sector employees, in what are known as
'final-salary' schemes.
Under a final-salary scheme, the employee pays contributions, usually around
6 per cent of earnings, and builds up a pension benefit typically worth
1/60th of final salary for each year of service. The maximum pension
permitted by the Inland Revenue is two-thirds of final salary, which can be
achieved after 40 years in the type of scheme described above.
But a growing number of schemes are set up on a 'money-purchase' basis.
Under this type of arrangement, employee and employer contributions are
invested to provide a fund at retirement which is used to buy an annuity
plus the tax-free lump sum. Annuities (see letter A), which are purchased
from life offices, offer an income for life in return for a lump-sum
investment. Under a money-purchase scheme, the final pension is dependent on
the level of contributions and the performance of the fund.
Most occupational schemes in the UK are 'contracted out' of Serps - that is,
they agree to provide an equivalent or better benefit than Serps in return
for a reduced rate of NICs. Where there is no company scheme, or the scheme
is not contracted out, the employee is automatically in Serps.
Few employees achieve a full two-thirds pension under the main scheme, but
it is possible to top up by paying into the company's additional voluntary
contribution (AVC) scheme.
AVCs are individual money-purchase plans that build up a fund, rather like a
group money-purchase scheme, which the individual takes in the form of extra
pension at retirement. The maximum annual contributions an employee can pay
to an occupational pension scheme is 15 per cent of salary. Given that most
employees contribute about 6 per cent to the main scheme, this leaves plenty
of scope for AVCs.
While AVCs provide the most cost-effective form of top-up provision,
employees looking for wider investment choice might consider free-standing
AVCs (FSAVCs), available mainly from the life offices.
For employees who intend to remain with one employer for many years,
final-salary occupational schemes represent good value and a secure
retirement income, because the pension is linked to a known quantity, namely
the employee's salary at retirement.
But problems often arise for employees who change jobs. If an employee
leaves within two years of joining a scheme, he or she is entitled to a
rebate of contributions less certain taxes and back payments into Serps.
After two years, leavers are entitled to a 'transfer value" which can be
invested in an individual personal pension plan or transferred into the new
employer's schemes. Due to the way transfers are calculated, they can give a
poor return on contributions, especially for young people.
Until recently, membership of occupational schemes was a condition of
joining a company, but since 1988 these schemes have been voluntary. At the
same time, the government introduced 'appropriate' personal pension plans,
which allowed employees to opt out of Serps on an individual basis for the
first time in return for a rebate of NICs.
Over 4.5m employees have taken advantage of the generous rebate terms
offered by the government worth almost Pounds 1,500 this year to those
earning over Pounds 20,300. This rebate of NICs is sent by the DSS direct to
the personal pension provider.
Personal pensions, which replaced the old-style self-employed retirement
annuity contracts, are available from life offices, banks, building
societies, unit trust groups and friendly societies.
The choice of pension provider should be made with the help of an
independent adviser, who can select the most competitive product and advise
on the most suitable type of fund.
In addition to the rebate plan, holders can contribute up to 17.5 per cent
of relevant earnings each year (more for older age groups) and get full tax
relief on these payments.
Like group money-purchase schemes, personal pensions provide a fund at
retirement, used to buy an annuity, and a tax-free cash sum of up to 25 per
cent of the total fund value.
Finally, since the 1989 Budget, there has been a cap on the maximum earnings
to which pension contributions relate. The pensions cap, which applies to
all personal pensions as well as certain occupational pensions, is Pounds
71,400 for the current tax year. In the case of occupational schemes, the
cap affects employees who joined an existing company scheme after June 1,
1989, or a new scheme set up after March 14, 1989.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (3): If you want to switch, be
cautious - Banks and building societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HATE THEM or love them, there is no way most of us can do without banks. Few
people in Britain are without a bank account, and the number with more than
one current account is growing.
The linchpin of any bank-customer relationship is the chequebook current
account. These are no longer exclusively the preserve of banks: since 1987,
when Nationwide launched FlexAccount, a number of building societies have
offered them.
Transferring your account from one bank to another can be troublesome,
particularly if you have a lot of standing orders and direct debits. There
are also some advantages for credit reference purposes in having a
long-standing relationship with a bank.
If you want to shift your current account, it may therefore be a good idea
to open a second one on an experimental basis, and see how it works for a
few months before transferring your salary into it.
If you feel that you are not getting good service in the high street, there
are alternatives: those with a lot of assets can go to a private bank, where
they will have an account executive to manage their account.
Such private banking arms may have a different name from their parent:
Coutts (for NatWest), Child &amp; Co (Royal Bank of Scotland) and Samuel Montagu
(Midland). Some are ancient banks that were bought by the clearers but still
have relative autonomy. One bank, Hoare &amp; Co, in Fleet Street, London, has
remained independent, and preserves the flavour of banking services in
Britain's days of greatness.
Lloyds, one of the main players in the private-banking market, has just
reorganised its UK private banking operation.
The snag is that these banks expect customers to have substantial assets
before they will take them on - say, Pounds 75,000. And it is worth checking
that a private banking service really is what it says it is. One of the
clearers is running what it calls a private banking service for customers
with Pounds 40,000, which is little more than a thinly-disguised bid to sort
out upper-income customers who might be in the market for insurance or other
savings products.
International private banking, from the US to Switzerland and Japan, is a
further step up the banking ladder for the very rich. Account executives may
manage customers' personal affairs, as well as their finances, from theatre
tickets to children's holidays.
If you are not in the right income bracket for private banking, there are
some attractive alternatives: technology buffs may fancy HOBS, the
screen-based bank account offered by Bank of Scotland. FirstDirect, the
telephone bank launched two years ago by Midland Bank, is open for business
24 hours a day and all through the year. It has relatively few customers but
already has a name for good service.
Building societies have traditionally had a much sunnier relationship with
their customers than the high street banks. Unlike banks, building societies
are owned not by shareholders but by their customers - or at least by those
with savings and borrowing accounts.
In the late 1980s, building societies shed much of their Victorian mutualist
ethos and started talking about profits and customers. Now, the pressures of
the recession may finally be putting paid to their 'nice guy' image. Last
month, the Halifax announced that it was introducing charges for
instant-access customers who do not keep at least Pounds 50 in their
accounts. Does this spell the end of free current accounts, one of the most
radical financial services innovations of the 1980s?
Smaller societies are under considerable pressure from the market, and
several societies which lent to the wrong sort of people during the 1980s
housing boom have been hit by bad debts and forced to merge with stronger
societies.
Does this mean that building societies in 1992 are not the safe homes for
personal savings that they once were? Probably not. Since they are so
important as a receptacle for savings, building societies are much more
tightly regulated than banks.
The moment trouble appears on the horizon - for instance, in the form of bad
debts - the industry watchdog, the Building Societies Commission, will step
in. Building society deposits are more protected than those of banks: 90 per
cent of Pounds 20,000 is guaranteed by the deposit protection scheme,
compared with only 75 per cent for bank deposits. (Incidentally, deposit
protection runs at a rate of Pounds 20,000 per individual, and not per
account - a point that should interest married couples).
Despite this, the banks have vamped up their savings products in recent
years and are much more attractive to savers than they once were. During
1992, they may become even more attractive as building societies hold their
mortgage rates down in an effort to revive the UK housing market and so are
forced to lower their savings rates.
Last year, after many months of talks, banks, building societies and
consumers' groups agreed a code of conduct, to establish some basic rights
for their customers. It is frankly a very limited document, and was branded
a triumph of miserliness by the Consumers' Association. But it does
introduce a maximum liability of Pounds 50 for customers when plastic
payment cards go missing. There are stricter rules on confidentiality; basic
account charges are to be published; and some abuses have been ironed out.
The Code of Conduct does little to tackle the chronic problems of staff
inefficiency in branches, about which customers seem to complain most. In
retail financial services, a lot of money is made out of mistakes. If an
investor incurs an unauthorised overdraft, the bank will almost always
charge them heavily for it. But if a bank makes a mistake, it is most
unlikely to offer any compensation.
TSB Bank recently launched a campaign to improve service quality. It
believes that nearly a quarter of branch staff time is taken up in
correcting mistakes, and this is in nobody's interests.
If a customer has a serious complaint about a bank or building society, he
should refer it to the Banking Ombudsman or the Building Societies
Ombudsmen. It may be possible to arrange an agreed settlement between bank
and customer. If it isn't, the ombudsmen will adjudicate.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (7): Investments that carry a
guarantee - Fixed-rate savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE YOU had your fill of variable investments? Are you fed up with leaving
the level of return to the vagaries of market force and government whim? Do
not despair. There are a variety of financial instruments to which you can
turn for a guaranteed return.
The thorny problem is to know the best time to lock in. When the government
took sterling into the European exchange rate mechanism in 1990, the idea
was that the ERM's discipline would help both interest rates and inflation
to fall over the longer term.
Both have indeed been falling, but sterling's weakness within the mechanism
means that there is more than a chance that interest rates will go up again.
The range of instruments to consider are:
National Savings: NS products that offer fixed interest are: savings
certificates, the Yearly Plan and Capital Bonds. The 36th issue of savings
certificates, for example, pays 8.5 per cent if held for five years. Each
unit costs Pounds 25. There is no income or capital gains tax to pay (see N
for National Savings).
Gilts: Conventional British government stocks provide a fixed rate of
interest over a specified period, paid at half-yearly intervals. There are
several issues, paying different interest rates with different redemption
dates. The government repays them at their face value on maturity. When you
buy them, you are certain of their return, provided you are able to hold
them till redemption. This return, called the gross redemption yield, varied
between 9.5 and 10 per cent in late January.
If you think base rates will fall and the price of gilts will go up, then
you could buy gilts in the hope of making a short-term capital gain. There
is no capital gains tax on gilts, though you pay income tax on the interest
(see G for Gilts).
Guaranteed income bonds: By investing your money with an insurance company
for a fixed period of time, you are paid a fixed interest rate during that
period. The company guarantees to repay you the capital when the bond
matures. Payment of income is usually made annually, though some insurers
will pay on a monthly basis.
The returns are paid net of basic rate income tax, which cannot be
reclaimed. This means they are unlikely to be suitable for non-taxpayers.
Higher-rate taxpayers will face a further charge when the bonds are cashed
in: this should be slightly less than they would have paid had they held the
money in a conventional building society account.
Some security is provided by the fact that these bonds are covered by the
Policyholders Protection scheme, which will repay 90 per cent of the amount
invested.
Annuities: You pay an insurance company a lump sum in exchange for a fixed
amount of money which is paid to you at regular intervals. The annuity will
pay you a high return, sometimes over a specified period (a temporary
annuity) or, more usually, until death. A large part of the return is,
therefore, the repayment of your capital. This has some tax advantages, but
when you die your estate will have lost the value of the initial annuity
investment.
The nature of annuities means that the insurance company does badly out of
those who live a long time. As a consequence, the older you are when you buy
an annuity, the higher the income an insurance company is prepared to pay.
In general, these are not good investments for people under 70.
Rates on annuities vary, so it is important to look around the insurance
companies for the best deals (See A for Annuities).
Debentures and Convertibles: This is a riskier way of fixing your income
than the suggestions mentioned above. Debentures are issued by companies
that want to raise money, and are secured on an asset (usually property).
They operate in a similar way to gilts, in that they pay a fixed rate of
interest and are repaid at the end of a specified term.
Convertible bonds can be exchanged into shares of a company at a future
date. This potential for profit means that the bonds tend to carry a lower
interest rate than conventional bonds, and the price is more volatile. There
are accordingly two risks. If the share price of the company never reaches a
level that makes conversion worthwhile, you would almost certainly have been
better off investing in gilts. And if the company goes bankrupt, you are
likely to lose your investment completely. This is an area where it is
important to get good advice.
Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs): These are shares issued by
building societies as a way of raising capital. After approval from the
Building Societies Commission, the first Pibs were issued by the Leeds
Permanent in June last year.
The shares are undated, so they can never be cashed. They are quoted on the
stock exchange and can be bought and sold like other stock.
The first issues of Pibs were aimed at the institutional market, but Bristol
&amp; West and Britannia have issued Pibs in denominations of Pounds 1,000. The
coupon on Bristol and West is 13 3/8 per cent, and on Britannia 13 per cent.
In early February, the current yield on Bristol &amp; West was 12.74 per cent
and for Britannia 12.65 per cent, paid net of basic-rate tax twice yearly.
These rates are higher than for gilts, reflecting the increased risk of
buying shares backed by a building society rather than the government.
The interest can be waived or reduced if payment would lead the society to
have insufficient capital under the new capital adequacy rules. Pibs are
deeply subordinated, which means that in the event of a wind-up, you would
be behind depositors in the queue for compensation.
But if you believe that the building society will not go under and that
interest rates will fall over the next decade, these can be considered as a
long-term investment in a diversified portfolio.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (17): Mainly for higher-rate
taxpayers - PEPs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL EQUITY plans are a way for investors to buy shares in companies,
and in unit and investment trusts, without paying tax on dividends or
capital gains. Like all equity-based investments, they should be regarded as
a long-term commitment.
Private individuals who invest in shares usually face a big tax burden. They
pay income tax at 25 or 40 per cent on dividends, and capital gains tax
(also at up to 40 per cent) on any realised gains of over Pounds 5,500 in
any single tax year.
Peps were introduced by Nigel Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, at
the beginning of 1987 as part of the drive towards popular capitalism, which
also involved incentives for small investors to buy shares in privatised
companies. They have slowly caught on, the value of funds in Peps having
increased from Pounds 480m in 1987 to Pounds 1.6bn in the 1990-91 tax year.
Peps appeal primarily to two sets of people:
First, those looking for income. A high-yielding Pep can offer an attractive
and growing tax-free income. M&amp;G Income, the investment trust launched last
year, offered a 6.55 per cent yield, equivalent to 11 per cent gross for a
higher-rate taxpayer.
Second, wealthier investors who use up their annual Pounds 5,500 capital
gains tax exemption. Putting a large sum into a Pep each year allows the
investor to build up considerable tax-free gains.
However, those looking for either income or capital gains will find that Pep
charges mean that it can be several years before they make any real net
savings in tax.
At present, the tax advantages are marginal for most people. Although the
income tax relief is worth, say, 2 per cent in extra dividend yield to a
higher-rate taxpayer, Pep charges will cancel out at least half of this.
Standard-rate payers probably do not benefit at all, compared with holding
shares directly. Peps should be most attractive to higher-rate taxpayers who
have already made full use of their CGT allowance of Pounds 5,500 per annum.
If you already have a portfolio of shares, you cannot Pep them without first
selling them and buying them back - an activity known as
'bed-and-breakfasting' shares.
The limit on investments into a Pep in any one tax year is Pounds 6,000,
although plans which invest only in unit trusts or investment trusts are
normally limited to Pounds 3,000. An exception to the rules is new
investment trust issues. A full Pounds 6,000 of a new issue can be placed in
a Pep within 42 days of the day of dealing, a provision which has helped the
investment trust industry. New trusts have been marketed on the basis of
this allowance.
There is now a fair range of Peps:
Single-company Peps: Until January 1 this year, individuals could only hold
one Pep. Now they can also hold a further Pounds 3,000 in a single-company
Pep, so that a husband and wife can open Pounds 18,000-worth of Peps a year.
The single-company Pep is most suitable for employees of the company. They
are permitted a direct share transfer, provided the shares come from an
Inland Revenue-approved all-employee share scheme. This saves the expense of
bed-and-breakfasting the shares. A number of companies - including BP, ICI,
Glaxo and BAT Industries - sponsor their own Peps, and charges for these are
likely to be lower than those provided by outside plan mangers.
Other investors attracted to single-company Peps will be those who already
have a large diversified portfolio of shares, and thus can put Pounds 3,000
into the shares of one company without taking an excessive risk.
Unit or investment trust Peps: The annual limit on investment in these is
Pounds 3,000, unless it is a new investment trust issue, as mentioned above.
You will achieve a much better spread through one of these funds than with
other types of Pep, particularly if the amount you have to invest is
limited.
Many unit and investment trusts will Pep your savings (subject to a minimum)
at little or no extra cost. For example, most investment trusts will Pep
savings as low as Pounds 100 a month.
Managed Peps are run by a manager who chooses the shares on your behalf.
Some managed Peps mix unit or investment trusts with individual shares.
Managed Peps are likely to have the highest charges, with an initial charge
of anything from 1 to 6 per cent and an annual management charge of roughly
1-1.5 per cent. There are further charges for every share deal, which makes
this sort of Pep uneconomical for the investor who pays basic-rate tax and
is unlikely to use up his CGT allowance.
Self-select Peps: Here you choose the shares yourself and decide when to buy
and sell them. The Pep still has to be operated by an authorised plan
manager. However, self-select Peps should be much cheaper than managed Peps,
particularly if the shares that are Pepped are chosen on the basis of good
long-term investments, minimising dealing charges. These Peps are
particularly good for investors who already have a diversified portfolio of
shares, though they will have to bed-and-breakfast existing shares in order
to Pep them.
Corporate Peps are the old version of single-company Peps, and a full Pounds
6,000 can be invested. Many companies see corporate Peps as a way of
widening their shareholder base, and as a service to their small
shareholders. Corporate Peps are also useful aids to profit-sharing and
employee share-ownership schemes.
You can have either a Pounds 6,000 corporate Pep or a general Pep, in
addition to a Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep, but not all three.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (15): Simple and safe with a good
return - National Savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERITS of National Savings are often ignored by the salesmen and
financial advisers who recommend investments. NS products are completely
safe, and they offer some very attractive returns - but they do not pay
commission to those who sell them.
Application forms of certificates and other products are available over the
post office counter.
Broadly speaking, there are two types of National Savings investment:
accounts, which offer variable interest, paid gross but which are subject to
tax; and certificates or bonds, which pay fixed returns if held for five
years.
Savings Certificates offer returns which are either fixed or index-linked,
and are sold in units of Pounds 25. The present 36th fixed issue pays 8.5
per cent tax free per annum, equivalent to 14.17 per cent gross for a
higher-rate taxpayer. The maximum holding per person is Pounds 10,000, so a
married couple can hold Pounds 20,000. You can hold a further Pounds 10,000
in trust for your spouse, but you should consult a solicitor about the best
way to do so.
The index-linked certificates pay 4.5 per cent per annum above the rate of
inflation, measured by the Retail Prices Index. You can hold a maximum of
Pounds 10,000, and returns are tax-free (see also letter I).
How should you decide between the fixed interest and index-linked
certificates? This depends on how high you think inflation will rise during
the next five years. If you feel it will be above 4 per cent per annum, then
index-linked certificates are going to be the more attractive.
If you should die before your certificates mature, they can be transferred
to your heir, regardless of the number of NS certificates they may hold.
Yearly Plan: This is a scheme for saving once a month for a year, in order
to buy a Savings Certificate at the end of that year. Savers pay a fixed
amount (between Pounds 20 and Pounds 200) by monthly standing order. This
means that the maximum value Savings Certificate that you can obtain through
the Yearly Plan is Pounds 2,400.
The certificate must be held for a further four years to earn the average
current return of 8.5 per cent tax-free per annum. This means a total return
of Pounds 3,479.55 if the maximum amounts are paid in. Since payments in the
first year are staggered, the total return will be lower than if the
investor had placed Pounds 2,400 in the 36th issue certificates at the
outset, in which case the return would be Pounds 3,608.78. Savers can hold
Pounds 10,000 in the 36th issue and have the Yearly Plan as well.
Capital Bonds: These also offer a guaranteed return if held for five years,
but are subject to tax. Non-taxpayers will have the benefit of receiving
interest gross, because the tax is not deducted on the interest payment. The
bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 100, to a maximum of Pounds 100,000.
After five years, the original investment is repaid with interest of 11.5
per cent gross per annum on the current issue. You will get a lower rate of
return if you cash in early, and no interest at all if you cash the bond in
during the first year. Three months' notice is needed for a withdrawal.
Basic-rate taxpayers should be better off buying the bonds than the 36th
issue certificates, because even after deducting 25 per cent tax, the return
will still be 8.625 per cent per annum.
Disadvantages: There are two main problems with National Savings
certificates and bonds. The first is that they do not pay an income: all of
the return comes from the increase in value on maturity. The second is that
the best returns are only achieved if you hold them for exactly five years.
If you sell them beforehand, the returns are reduced; if you forget to
redeem them on maturity, the certificates start to earn the general
extension rate, a miserly 5.01 per cent.
Children's Bonus Bond: NS's newest product went on sale in July 1991, as a
way of encouraging savings for children. Issue A offers a guaranteed
tax-exempt return equivalent to 11.84 per cent compound per annum over the
first five years. This includes a large bonus earned on the fifth
anniversary. The return is in two parts: a flat 5 per cent annual compound
interest rate for five years, and a bonus after five years of 47.36 per cent
of the purchase price. The bond can only be bought for children under the
age of 16. NS will announce new rates of interest for each five-year period,
but the bond does not have to be encashed until the holder's 21st birthday.
Some National Savings products do pay a regular income.
Income Bonds: Interest is taxable but, because it is paid gross, these bonds
have some appeal to non-taxpayers - although less so now that building
societies can also pay interest gross.
The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000, and subsequent income bonds are sold
in multiples of Pounds 1,000. The maximum holding an investor can have is
Pounds 25,000.
Interest is variable, and was 10.25 per cent in January. It is is earned on
a daily basis and is paid monthly, though you will have to wait six weeks
for the initial payment when you first invest. You also need to give three
months notice when you want to cash in one of the bonds. However, if you try
to cash it within the first year of purchase, you will only get half the
rate of interest.
Investment Account: A minimum of Pounds 25 opens the account, to a limit of
Pounds 25,000. Subsequent deposits must be of at least Pounds 5. Interest is
added to the account on December 31, and is taxable. However, the interest
is paid gross. The rate of interest on the account is variable, but was 9.5
per cent in January.
And of course those with a gambling streak can opt for:
Premium Bonds, sold in multiples of Pounds 10, after an initial purchase of
Pounds 100. Instead of interest, you have the chance to win prizes, ranging
from the jackpot of Pounds 250,000 (monthly) down to Pounds 50. The money
for the prizes currently represents a return on the fund of 6.5 per cent.
You must hold the bond for three months to be eligible for the prizes. You
can cash in your premium bonds by giving eight working days' notice.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (27): Think hard before you lock it
away - Zero-coupon securities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ZERO-COUPON securities is a complicated description of a fairly simple
concept.
The term is a throw-back to the days when bonds came with interest coupons
attached. Every six months or so, when interest was due, you clipped one off
and posted it to the paying agent to receive your cash.
Thus, a zero-coupon security has zero coupons and earns you zero cash during
its lifetime.
Instead, you get capital appreciation. This has two implications. The first
is that, on zero-coupon equities, you have no tax liability until maturity.
The second is that they shield investors against the so-called reinvestment
risk when interest rates are falling. That means that you will not have to
search fruitlessly for a high-yielding home for your investment cash flow in
the middle of a recession. However, when interest rates are rising, the
re-sale value of a zero-coupon bond will fall more sharply than those of
other interest-paying securities.
While they have their charms, zero-coupon securities are not without risks
for the retail buyer. Indeed, the nature of these securities requires
greater caution perhaps than other, simpler products. This is because it may
not be obvious to the purchaser exactly what rate of return he can expect to
earn; nor may it be obvious what charges are incurred in the purchase.
Retail investors who purchase securities in the secondary market must be
aware that the rate of return in the offering document may not be the one
they receive. It can be higher or lower, depending on the price paid, and
investors are at the mercy of their stockbrokers to calculate this
accurately for them. Also, investors must ask whether the quoted yield to
maturity is inclusive of transaction costs. Sales charges reduce yield to
maturity by about 0.5 per cent a year.
Zero-coupon bonds - typically, UK government gilts with the income stream
removed - have been around for some time. The essence of a zero-coupon issue
requires it to be sold at a deep discount to its face value, appreciating in
value each year until its maturity date when it will be worth 100p in the
pound to the holder.
But according to Roderick Crawford, investment trust analyst at County
NatWest Wood MacKenzie: 'You would have to be mad to buy one as a retail
investor.' That is because holders must pay tax each year on the implied
gain in the price of the bond, even though they have received no cash from
it. Typically, only tax-exempt pension funds purchase these securities.
Instead, retail investors who like the concept can pick and choose among a
large number of so-called split-capital investment trusts, which offer
zero-coupon preference shares as one class of security. 'These are taxed as
equities, and there is considerable equity risk to them,' explains Roger
Adams, analyst with SG Warburg Securities.
Investors incur tax only when the shares are sold or when they mature, and
then they are taxed as capital gains. Also, Mr Crawford points out,
investors may 'index' the returns to inflation.
Zero-coupon preference shares carry the chief characteristic of bonds - a
fixed rate of return to maturity. Often, they are the highest ranking
security, with investors having first claim on the investment trusts' assets
in the event of failure. However, purchasers are warned to read the small
print, to learn where they would stand in the creditors queue.
Preference shares, says Mr Adams, offer returns of around 11 per cent
annually, net of tax. But he warns that it is not enough for investors to
look at yield to maturity: they must also look at 'cover', and gauge the
ability of the fund manager to produce returns that grow sufficiently
quickly. If cover is insufficient upon maturity, investors will get back
less than was promised on issue.
Among zero-coupon preference shares with the worst cover are those of Olim
Convertible Trust, which in early February yielded 12.73 per cent to
maturity, while its assets were only sufficient to cover 71 per cent of the
preference shares' face value at maturity. The fund manager must earn
returns of 4 per cent a year to cover preference shareholders, Mr Adams
notes.
At the other end of the scale, River Plate and General, was offering a yield
to maturity in 1996 of 9.4 per cent, but the redemption value was covered
2.15 times by the assets of the trust.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Poles reject idea of shares gift from state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST Poles would prefer to pay for shares in newly privatised state
enterprises than receive them free, according to an official Polish survey.
The survey, commissioned by the Polish Privatisation Ministry, also showed
that a majority intend to treat their allocation of shares from Poland's
impending mass privatisation scheme as a long-term investment rather than
than a vehicle for quick profit.
A year ago, during the presidential election campaign, Mr Lech Walesa told
Poles that privatisation would give every Pole free shares in former
state-owned companies that would be worth 100m zloties - about Dollars 1,000
each. It was a vastly over-inflated figure which made bankers and economists
wince and provoked general disbelief. It did little for Mr Walesa's
reputation as an economist, but was widely discounted as political hyperbole
and did not prevent his eventual election.
The latest confirmation of Polish realism virtually ensures that when final
details of Poland's mass privatisation scheme are revealed within the next
few weeks the original plan of free shares for every adult Pole will not be
on offer. Instead Poles will be offered 'participation certificates' for a
fee of between 10 and 20 per cent of the presumed value of the shares in
more than 200 medium- to large-sized enterprises. The shares themselves will
be managed by new investment funds whose key personnel are expected to be
foreign specialists on contract.
But the survey also revealed suspicion of the foreign element in the new
investment funds, provoking the Privatisation Ministry to propose setting up
a panel of senior Polish professionals to keep watch over the foreign
merchant bankers and investment specialists who have applied to manage the
10 to 20 proposed closed-end funds. The reaction of the would-be foreign
managers to such surveillance remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, close observers of Czechoslovakia's proposed 'voucher
privatisation' believe that implementation of the scheme could provide
unexpectedly cheap, and possibly politically sensitive, bargains for
aggressive foreign investors. A recent analysis by Mr Jan Vanous, of the
Washington based Planecon research unit concluded that 'flaws in the voucher
privatisation scheme virtually guarantee that Czechoslovakia will be a place
with a large number of investment bargains for anyone willing to incur some
risk'.
This follows the sudden surge in popularity of the privatisation vouchers
which have now been bought by over 8.5m Czech and Slovak citizens.

stage
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTER controversy surrounding the Vienna Burgtheater, Austria's leading
theatre, has pitted the country's cultural establishment against the
chancellor and one of his ministers.
The leaders of the actors' council at the theatre resigned this week to
protest against the decision by Mr Rudolf Scholten, the minister of
education and cultural affairs, to renew the contract of Mr Claus Peymann,
the theatre's controversial director.
The actors, including Klaus Maria Brandauer, accused Mr Peymann of
mismanagement, falling attendance, cost overruns and general neglect of the
actors' interests.
'This enterprise is not being managed,' said Mr Franz Morak, the chairman of
the actors' council. 'The situation at the Burg is one big scandal.'
Mr Peymann's foes are backed by most of the country's conservative
newspapers and the OVP Christian Democratic party, junior partner in the
governing coalition.
The row has added to the tensions in the fragile coalition. Leading OVP
politicians immediately denounced Mr Scholten's decision, while Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, a Social Democrat, is backing his former personal
assistant.
Clashes over cultural issues in Austria serve as surrogate battle for
deep-seated political conflicts. The criticism against Peymann is filled
with anti-German and wider xenophobic sentiments, echoing the emotions that
helped elect Mr Kurt Waldheim as president in 1986 despite damaging
revelations about his war record.
Not surprisingly, Mr Peymann has been in the forefront of the anti-Waldheim
movement, staging a number of plays critical of Austrians' role during the
Nazi period.
The 55-year-old Mr Peymann has been at the centre of controversy since
moving from the German town of Bochum to Vienna to assume his prestigious
post in 1986.
Theatre critics praise him for his innovative style which has helped to turn
the venerable and often stodgy theatre into the most creative stage in the
German-speaking world.
But Viennese audiences have been less excited about Peymann's ideas  -
especially the actors he brought with him from Germany and who have driven
away many of the local favourites of the stage.
The attacks against Peymann reached a climax in recent weeks as his contract
came up for renewal.
While Peymann seems set to win the latest clash with his actors and stay on
as director, he is on the losing end on a more symbolic issue. Unable to
block Peymann's reappointment, the OVP has been holding up his application
for Austrian citizenship.

NATIONAL Bank of Canada, the smallest of the Big Six, yesterday reported
first-quarter net profit of CDollars 49.8m (USDollars 41.8m), or 32 cents a
share, down 9 per cent from CDollars 55.3m, or 36 cents, a year earlier.
The bank attributed the decline to the long recession, continuing high
loan-loss provisions and higher non-interest expenses due to systems
expansion.
These factors were partly offset by the benefits of declining interest rates
and good results from the investment banking and brokerage subsidiary.
Return on equity was 11.3 per cent, against 13.4 per cent, and return on
average assets 0.53 per cent, compared with 0.60 per cent. Total assets at
January 31 were CDollars 37bn, against CDollars 36bn a year earlier.
National Bank, which operates mainly in Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes,
said signs of economic recovery were still meagre, but it is confident the
worst is over.

FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (8): An ill wind may pump up prices
 -Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLDEN rule to remember when it comes to investing in gilts
or any fixed-interest securities - is that gilt prices rise when interest
rates fall, and vice versa. So wise investors should buy gilts when it looks
as though there is going to be a reduction in interest rates, because that
way they will benefit from the gain in gilt prices.
Gilts - or gilt-edged securities, to give them their full name - are UK
government bonds. When you buy a gilt, the government is borrowing money
from you. In return, it pays you interest (known as the coupon) every six
months until the bond reaches its redemption date, which is the date on
which the investor is repaid the face value of the gilt.
Like share prices, gilt prices move up or down under the influence of a wide
variety of factors; however, the main influences are economic. Since gilt
prices rise when interest rates fall, any economic news that is likely to
have a bearing on interest rates may move gilt prices.
It is often suggested that bond dealers have sick minds, because bond prices
tend to rise on announcements which most other people would regard as bad
news. Hence a sharp rise in the number of unemployed people, or the
announcement of weak producer prices, often prompts a rise in gilt prices,
because investors believe the government will come under pressure to reduce
interest rates in order to kick-start the economy.
On the other hand, any news which indicates that interest rates will remain
high is generally bad for gilt prices. For example, high inflation figures
or high average earnings figures limit the scope for interest-rate cuts, as
does any weakness in sterling.
In the approach to a general election, political concerns are also likely to
influence gilts. In recent months, gilt prices have tended to react
positively whenever an opinion poll has shown the Conservative party ahead
of Labour. This is because the market is concerned that the election of a
Labour government would result in higher public spending, forcing the
government to fund heavily in the gilt market. The worry is that gilt prices
would then be depressed by an abundance of new issues - in other words, that
supply would exceed demand.
In fact, even under the Conservative government there have been worries
about the level of funding necessary in the gilt market. The Bank of England
started to issue gilts again in 1991 (after an absence of three years) in
order to fund the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), and is
expected to continue to issue between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn of gilts a
month in the 1992-93 tax year, according to some economists' estimates.
Gilts come in a range of maturities, and with a range of coupons. The coupon
payment counts as income and may be subject to income tax, depending on your
total income. Investors on a low annual income may therefore find it more
attractive to buy high-coupon gilts; while higher-rate taxpayers are often
advised to invest in gilts with a very low coupon, so as to minimise their
liability to income tax. Although it is important to look for the
appropriate coupon, what most investors are really interested in is the
yield (see letter Y).
For example, if you buy Pounds 100 nominal stock for Pounds 90 in the market
and it has a coupon of 9 per cent, the running yield on your investment is
10 per cent (9/90 x 100).
Provided you hold your gilt investments until maturity, you will be repaid
the nominal value of the bonds. If you make a gain on the price of the gilt,
it counts as a capital gain and will be taxed accordingly. Where you need to
be careful is if you decide to sell your gilts before the maturity date,
given that gilt prices can fluctuate considerably.
You can buy and sell gilt-edged stock either through a broker or from the
Post Office.
Many small investors find it more attractive to buy and sell through the
Post Office: it has the advantage of being convenient, and the income from
gilts bought in this way is paid gross. However, there are certain
disadvantages: not all of the available gilt issues can be bought and sold
at the Post Office, and the transaction usually takes a few days to
complete, so that investors cannot be certain of the price at which the deal
is done.

FT  27 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity sector recovers its confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOPE of a generous Budget speech on March 10, probably accompanied by a
cut in base rates, pushed the UK stock market ahead yesterday. With
unfavourable developments on both corporate and political fronts apparently
discounted for the present, the market resumed its advance towards the top
of its latest trading range, gaining 18.2 on the FT-SE Index scale.
Trading volume picked up after a slow start and strengthened significantly
towards the close when US buyers appeared in force for BP, continuing the
transatlantic tug-of-war in the share price.
Equities opened uneasily after the latest UK opinion polls had indicated a
three-point lead for the opposition Labour party. However, shares quickly
turned higher, helped again by a strong opening in the stock index futures.
At the day's best, the Footsie was more than 24 points ahead at just over
2,571. The pace in London slackened, however, when Wall Street made a slow
start to the new session.
At the close of trading, the FT-SE Index was 18.2 ahead at 2,565. Barclays
de Zoete Wedd yesterday reiterated its view that the London market has
established itself in a trading range of FT-SE 2,450 to 2,600 ahead of the
UK general election, which is widely expected to be held early in April.
Confidence in the prospect of a cut in base rates appeared to strengthen,
and there were widespread gains among the interest rate-orientated stocks.
Across the broader range, the market continued to take potentially upsetting
company results in its stride, with analysts pointing out that the bad news
from the financial sector, which has dominated this week, had been fully
expected.
Shares in Barclays Bank fell smartly on disclosure of Pounds 1.7bn
write-offs last year and a warning of further substantial provisions ahead.
The rest of the UK clearing banks, however, remained firm and apparently
undismayed as the sector awaited news today on dividend plans at Midland
Bank. Commercial Union brushed aside news of a Pounds 68.6m loss for the
year.
The picture was a little less confident among the merchant bank and
securities house shares after SG Warburg issued a bearish trading statement
and Kleinwort Benson reported profits below market expectations.
Heavy turnover in Barclays, and also in BP after Wall Street opened, was
reflected in an increased Seaq trading total for the day of 548.6m shares,
against 511m on Tuesday. Trading in the blue chip leaders was expected to
boost volume of customer, or retail, business yesterday; on Tuesday, retail
business in equities totalled Pounds 970.8m, a return towards the improved
business levels of the previous week.
Some equity strategists expressed surprise at the resilience of the stock
market yesterday, commenting that a half-point cut in base rates must now be
fully discounted in share prices.
While the market may have been fully braced for this week's bad news from
the financial sectors, there could still be shocks ahead as Britain's
industrial companies report trading progress. The first test could come
today when ICI and British Gas report. With Midland Bank's dividend decision
also likely to provide a test of investment confidence, market analysts were
wary of sounding over-confident last night.

FT  27 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in stock index futures fell sharply as leading securities houses
remained on the sidelines for most of the session with little in the way of
economic features on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the March contract opened at 2,566, which proved to be the low of
the day, with sizeable two-way business conducted mainly by independent
dealers.
Light selling was seen at midsession, but the positive showing on Wall
Street following a slow start, boosted by better than anticipated US durable
goods figures for January, generated buying interest for March from a number
of leading securities houses.
This developed into a squeeze late in the session, sending the contract
forward to reach 2,587, the high of the day, before light selling in the
dying minutes saw it rel-inquish some of the gain.
Turnover reached a poor 3,365 contracts, with March ending at 2,584, some 7
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6.
Dealers reported a more lively session in traded options, where turnover
rose to 30,827 lots. Barclays, which released figures, was the busiest stock
option, trading 1,869 contracts with the September 360 calls particularly
active.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Pleasing durable goods orders
help to lift Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices climbed to set a record Dow high yesterday, buoyed by a
bigger than expected rise in January durable goods orders, positive comments
about lower interest rates from the US Treasury Secretary and a sharp fall
in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.49 at 3,283.32,
slightly above the previous all-time peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed
4.90 to 415.35, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, which
has taken a beating from profit-takers in recent sessions, roared back with
a gain of 11.00 to 632.40. Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 241m
shares.
The morning report that durable goods orders rose 1.5 per cent in January
provided a firm foundation for the market at the opening. Analysts had
forecast an increase of only 1 per cent. Although the difference was not
huge, any sign of economic progress is eagerly welcomed by the market in its
current uncertain mood.
Comments from Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, that real interest
rates should be lower aided sentiment, as did a sharp cut in bond yields.
Wal-Mart advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 after the world's biggest
retailer announced a 34 per cent increase in sales and a 25 per cent rise in
profits to Dollars 1.6bn in 1991.
ITT jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 65 in turnover of 1.8m shares in the wake of
a Financial Times report that included hints from the chairman about
possible strategic moves by the company.
Glenfed dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 7 1/8 in heavy trading after the
Florida-based savings and insurance group restated its fiscal second-quarter
profits downwards and warned that its third-quarter profitability was in
question.
Harley-Davidson rose Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 56 1/2 after Ms Jill Krutick,
analyst at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, raised her rating on the
stock to 'outperform'. The upgrade follows a recent meeting between analysts
and the company, which persuaded the analyst that capacity problems at the
motorcycle maker would soon be sorted out, leading to earnings for the year
that should exceed market estimates.
Telefonos de Mexico, one of the biggest stars of 1991, gained Dollars 3 1/8
to Dollars 57 7/8 after the recently privatised Mexican telecommunications
giant said that net income last year rose by almost 80 per cent.
There was strong demand for the initial public offering of Dollars 16m of
shares in Musicland Stores. Floated at Dollars 14 1/2 , it closed at Dollars
16 on 4.18m traded.
On the over-the-counter market, Microsoft forged ahead Dollars 6 1/4 to
Dollars 122 in active trading after Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the
broking house, reinstated its 'buy' recommendation on the stock.
Amgen climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 on news that the company will
repurchase up to Dollars 50m of its own common stock.
Autotrol plunged Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 9 1/2 after the company, which
manufactures water treatment control systems, announced that talks leading
to a possible takeover by the utility group Wicor (up Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 25 7/8 ) had been terminated.
Canada
TORONTO recorded its sharpest gain since mid-January after Tuesday's release
of the Federal Budget relinquished pent-up demand. Better than expected
results from two leading Canadian banks helped the banking sector score the
largest advance.
Hefty gains in the US and Canadian bond markets, after US Federal Reserve
chairman Mr Alan Greenspan said long-term rates are too high, lent support
to the stock market.
The composite index ended 35.5 up at 3,580.5. Rises led declines by 352 to
234 after volume of 26.8m shares.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to meet promise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar closed slightly below expectations yesterday in London after a
volatile late session which saw it see-saw in a 1 1/2 -pfennig range.
Some encouraging, if unexciting, January figures for US durable goods early
in the afternoon sent the dollar through the DM1.66 barrier to DM1.6630, but
optimism waned later in the day and it slipped back to DM1.6490 at one
stage. It recovered slightly to end at DM1.6520/30, compared with DM1.6395
the day before.
This was below what some traders had expected after the dollar's surprising
rebound in the New York session on Tuesday in the face of gloomy US consumer
confidence figures.
Traders said that while the 1.5 per cent increase in US durable goods orders
(and 3.6 per cent rise in non-defence orders) initially appeared encouraging
it came from a low base the month before, and was tempered by the fifth
successive decrease in the unfilled orders figures.
Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, said: 'The market has an
underlying bullish sentiment towards the dollar, but was presented with
unexciting economic figures for the second day running.'
In New York, the dollar at midday was weaker than opening levels, although
it stayed above DM1.6500. Earlier the dollar probed resistance above DM1.66
then slipped lower. By the New York close it had dipped to DM1.6458.
The US unit stayed steady against the yen. In early Tokyo trade, it had
briefly touched the Y130 barrier for the first time since December, but
profit-taking knocked it lower to close at Y129.73. It moved in a narrow
range in European trading, also reaching Y130 before closing at Y129.65.
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's blueprint for economic recovery got
a mixed reception from the markets. The Australian dollar fell  1/2 US cent
amid fears that his Budget might boost inflation, now at a 27-year low of
1.5 per cent, and doubts over whether forecasts for economic growth and a
return to a budget surplus could be achieved. The US currency rose to
ADollars 1.3355 from Tuesday's ADollars 1.3310.
The market viewed the Canadian Budget, announced late on Tuesday, more
positively, and the US dollar declined to CDollars 1.1810 from a previous
London close of CDollars 1.1855.
The unexpected rebound in the dollar on Tuesday in New York left the D-Mark
slightly weaker against other EMS currencies.
Tuesday's 0.25 per cent cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate failed
to knock the peseta off its pedestal in the EMS, and it remained near its
ceiling against sterling. Traders said that as long as the strain between
the peseta and sterling existed, room for the UK to make any cut in base
rates would be very limited.
Sterling opened at DM2.8820, up slightly from its previous close of
DM2.8800. It then traded within a narrow band, firming to end at DM2.8850.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate hopes recede
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK MONEY market was quiet yesterday as most players resigned themselves
to the belief that a UK base rate cut is unlikely to come before the Budget
on March 10.
Sterling interbank rates ended marginally firmer as lingering hopes of an
imminent cut in base rates faded. Most traders now believe there will be a
rate cut around Budget Day, or just after, in the 'window' before a general
election is officially announced.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange opened firmly as rate cut expectations remained intact. But
it ended down four basis points on a moderate volume of trading at 89.86.
The three months interbank rate was  1/32 higher at 10 9/32 -10 7/32 .
Overnight money traded at close to 11 per cent during the day in the face of
a substantial liquidity shortage, but finished lower at 10-10 9/16 .
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the session.
The main factors draining funds from the market were maturing treasury bills
and assistance totalling Pounds 704m and Pounds 711m of bills for repurchase
by the market. It acted early to relieve much of the shortfall, buying bills
totalling Pounds 540m for resale to the market in equal amounts on March 17
and 18 at 10 7/16 per cent.
The shortfall was later revised downwards to Pounds 900m, while in further
operations the bank bought Pounds 149m of band one bank bills outright at 10
3/8 per cent and another Pounds 20m of bills for resale to the market in
equal amounts on March 17 and 18 at 10 7/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the forecast was raised once more to Pounds 1bn, and the
Bank purchased a further Pounds 179m band one bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and
provided around Pounds 60m of late, unspecified assistance, bringing total
liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 948m.
Traders saw the three-week maturity of the repurchases as another sign that
interest rates are unlikely to be cut, since rates are less likely to be
reduced while a repo remains outstanding.
German call money rates were slightly firmer after the Bundesbank drained a
net DM3.7bn from the money market in its latest round of securities
repurchase operations. Traders quoted overnight rates at 9.45/55 per cent,
up slightly from 9.40/50 per cent on Tuesday, but unchanged from Monday's
levels.

possible Gatt failure
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS are bracing themselves for failure to reach agreement in the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by June 30 with
plans for 'hand-to-hand combat' with the European Community and pouring an
extra Dollars 1.5bn in subsidised agricultural exports on to the world
market.
In testimony before the House of Representatives' Agriculture Committee on
Tuesday, Mr Julius Katz, the deputy US trade representative, said the Bush
administration was planning to reduce the already-low (5 per cent) wheat
set-aside to encourage all-out production.
As required by 1990 farm legislation, an additional Dollars 1bn will be
spent on export promotion - loans, guarantees subsidies and marketing.
Clearly not optimistic that the Gatt negotiators will meet their mid-April
deadline for settlement, Mr Katz dismissed suggestions that a meeting of
heads of government could bring the round to a conclusion.
Mr Richard Crowder, assistant secretary of agriculture, said if it was
accepted, the Dunkel draft - offered by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt
director-general, as a settlement for the round - would push up American
farm incomes by Dollars 1bn in 1988. Exports would climb by as much as
Dollars 5bn, and government outlays would fall by Dollars 2.5bn.
Democrat congressman Mr Ronald Coleman said the draft provided little
reform. It was time, he said to 'do some hand-to-hand combat, getting back
our markets.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Price war rages over soft
commissions - A practice which is no longer restricted to a few specialist
houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's large integra-ted securities houses last year received 13 per cent
of their commission income through 'soft commission' arrangements, a rise
from 8 per cent during 1990 and confirmation that this form of investment
business is no longer largely restricted to a few specialist houses in
London.
The figures, revealed in a London Stock Exchange report on the soft
commission business, show it is no longer an under-used area of the market.
Research last year by Greenwich Associates, the US research company,
revealed more than 80 per cent of investment and unit trusts had soft
commission arrangements, while the proportion of investment advisers had
risen to around two-thirds. Less than half of insurance companies have
similar arrangements.
Soft commission agreements involve a fund manager agreeing to give a fixed
proportion of business to a broker in return for services, such as the
provision of data base services or specialist research provided by an
independent research house. The rapid growth of the practice in the UK in
the past two years, since it was judged an acceptable practice by the
Securities and Investments Board, the chief UK investment regulator, has
prompted a price war, as well as fears that the arrangements work against
the interests of fund managers' clients.
In its latest quarterly review of the UK market, the London Stock Exchange
reports the practice of 'softing' is likely to become more prevalent.
Traditional brokers, which have not actively sought soft commission business
before, have already seen their reliance on this type of income jump from 1
per cent to 4 per cent in the past year. The proportion is expected to rise
further as a result of cost pressures and the desire of brokers to maintain
their share of commission income.
The exchange concludes regulatory concerns about soft commissions continue -
the SIB recently started a consultation exercise to see if further changes
were needed to the regulatory arrangements.
Soft commission deals give rise to four concerns:
They provide a way for brokers to pay fund managers inducements to place
business with them. This concern has largely been resolved, the exchange
says. Rules in force in the UK limit the services that can be provided to
those which 'assist in the provision of investment services'. The services
most commonly covered by such agreements include performance measurement,
on-line stock quotation services and corporate databases, according to
Greenwich.
They could lead to excessive charging by fund managers. This is because fund
managers charge a fee for their services and also pass on brokerage
commission charges to their customers. If the commissions cover some of the
managers' costs, which are normally reflected in the fee, then the customer
could end up effectively paying twice for the same service.
Fund managers could be tempted to 'churn' a portfolio.
These two concerns could be resolved if trustees which employ fund managers
are aware of the dangers, and information is provided about what is actually
taking place. The exchange warns that even the well-informed trustee finds
it difficult to tell the difference between 'good business practice and
outright exploitation by the fund manager.' Fund managers may not always be
achieving best execution for their clients. This is a concern particular to
the UK, whose integrated houses are in theory able to subsidise low
commission rates with the spread they make by acting as market-makers.
Here, again, regulatory responses are difficult the exchange says. Moves
suggested so far 'are incompatible with market practices and thus
unenforceable,' it warns.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soar on demand for five-year
note auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a quiet morning, US Treasury prices soared yesterday afternoon in the
wake of exceptionally strong retail demand for the five-year note auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 1/4 at 101
13/16 , yielding 7.835 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32
at 100, yielding 5.359 per cent.
In the morning, the news that durable goods orders rose 1.5 per cent last
month - a bigger rise than expected - was brushed aside amid speculation the
Fed would cut interest rates again soon. Prices did not take off until after
it became clear there was big demand from retail investors at the five-year
auction. In a most unusual conclusion, the auction was completed with no
'tail', or no difference between the average yield and the highest yield
accepted, which were both 6.75 per cent.
Sentiment was given an additional boost by reports that Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, told a Congressional hearing the Fed was considering
purchases of more long-term Treasury bonds as a means of bringing down
stubbornly high long-term interest rates.
EUROPEAN government bond markets continued to advance almost in unison
yesterday as investors digested Tuesday's news from the US of weak consumer
confidence.
In the German market, bund futures broke through the 88.00 ceiling against
which they had pushed without success the day before, triggering a round of
technical buying. There were also reports of buying from domestic retail
investors, continuing a trend of position-building which has been notable
for much of the past fortnight.
The continued buying was notable in medium-term maturities, where much of
the recent interest has been.
The result, in a busy day on the futures markets, was a move out of the
recent trading range, with the Liffe contract trading up at around 88.29 at
the close.
UK government bonds also rose on the general swell of positive sentiment,
though the market continued to look in vain for any hints of an early cut in
interest rates.
The March gilt futures contract advanced close to a level at which it could
have triggered a release of the Bank of England's tap stock.
However, it later fell slightly to around 98.06.
The tap level has not been touched for two weeks, and with an estimated
Pounds 500m still on the Bank's books, the stock is still seen as placing a
ceiling on the upward movement of the market.
The benchmark gilt maturing 2003/07 closed at around 116 3/4 , for a yield
of 9.27 per cent, while the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed up  3/16 of
a point to 99 13/32 , a yield of 9.06 per cent.

GE CAPITAL, the main financial services arm of General Electric, yesterday
reinforced its expansion in Europe with an agreement in principle to buy the
vehicle leasing and fleet management business of Avis Europe, the car rental
company.
The business being sold is Avis Lease, and GE Capital will acquire the right
to use this name. The operation has assets of around Dollars 900m and some
120,000 vehicles in 14 European countries. GE Capital yesterday declined to
say how much it was paying.
Explaining the decision to sell, Mr Alun Cathcart, chairman of Avis Europe,
said its leasing business had seen significant growth rates over the past
five years and was expected to enjoy similar expansion over the next several
years. However, a company of Avis Europe's size could not handle its likely
requirements for future asset finance.
Avis Europe, the continent's market leader in car rental, is a private
business owned 65 per cent by Lease International Belgium, 26 per cent by
General Motors of the US and 11 per cent by Avis Inc of the US.
GE Capital, the second largest non-bank financial services company in the
US, has been gradually expanding into Europe - primarily the UK - over the
past two years via acquisitions. It has bought private label credit card
businesses from Burton and House of Fraser and a consumer car finance
business from Barclays Bank.
However, this is the first European venture by GE Capital Fleet Services,
the largest corporate fleet management business in North America, with more
than 500,000 vehicles under lease or service management.
Ms Teresa LeGrand, president of GE Capital Fleet Services, said the
combination of the two companies would create the foundation for a global
vehicle leasing network.
Avis Europe was floated off from Avis Inc, its US parent, in a public
offering in London in 1986 but was taken private again in 1989.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: US court rules against tax claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court has quashed corporate America's hopes of getting tax
deductions for the investment banking and legal fees companies incur during
a friendly takeover.
Its ruling could also embolden the Internal Revenue Service, which
apparently wants to make it much harder for companies to deduct from taxes
the cost of defending hostile bids - a move which could mean large tax bills
for many companies involved in the 1980s takeover wave.
The Supreme Court's decision involved the friendly 1978 takeover of
Indopoco, formerly called National Starch, by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products giant.
National Starch subsequently claimed tax deductions as ordinary business
expenses for Dollars 2.9m in fees paid to its investment bankers and
lawyers.
The IRS disputed the claim, arguing the costs should not be deductible
because they produce a significant long-term benefit for the company. The
tax court and a federal appeals court both ruled in the IRS's favour and
yesterday the Supreme Court added its weight as well.
Last autumn, the IRS sought to extend the 'long-term benefit' argument to a
company involved in a contested takeover, an action widely interpreted by
tax lawyers as part of a move to clamp down on hostile bid deductions
generally.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart beats trend with 24%
profits rise

WAL-MART Stores, the Arkansas-based discount stores chain which is now the
world's largest retailer in sales terms, yesterday disclosed a 34.6 per cent
jump in turnover last year to Dollars 43.9bn and a 24.6 per cent increase in
net profits to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 1.29bn.
At the earnings per share level, Wal-Mart reported a 22.8 per cent
improvement, to Dollars 1.40.
Wal-Mart's figures contrast sharply with those delivered by many US
retailers - in particular, the traditional department stores - who have been
badly affected by the grim economic climate and the general slump in
consumer spending.
Growth during the fourth quarter was roughly in line with that for the year.
Sales in the three months to end-January totalled Dollars 13.6bn, up from
Dollars 10.4bn in the same period a year earlier.
Net profits rose 25 per cent to Dollars 602.4m and earnings per share rose
to 52 cents from 42 cents.
In part, Wal-Mart's sales growth stems from a ferocious store expansion
programme. In the fourth quarter, for example, it opened 68 new Wal-Mart
stores, which sell low-priced general merchandise, and 15 Sam's Clubs.
Sam's Clubs are warehouse club operations, sited in out-of-town 'barns' and
selling a limited range of goods at deeply-discounted prices to a membership
customer base. Wal-Mart is the biggest operator in this fast-growing market
niche.
However, for much of last year, the group also posted double-digit
'same-store' sales growth.
The results for 1991-2 were scored after interest charges of Dollars 113.3m,
more than double the Dollars 42.7m in 1990-91. The increase in total costs
and expenses also slightly exceeded sales growth - rising by 35.4 per cent
to Dollars 41.7bn.
The results were much as analysts had expected, however, and shares in
Wal-Mart - which has grown from one 'five and dime' store 40 years ago to
overtake Kmart and Sears Roebuck as the nation's largest retailer - rose
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8.

<TEXT>
THE Official Creditors Committee of bankrupt First Capital Holdings said it
had filed a Dollars 300m lawsuit on First Capital's behalf against Shearson
Lehman Brothers, the US securities house, and others alleging breaches of
fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement and manipulation, Reuter reports from
Los Angeles.
Shearson, a unit of American Express, is First Capital's controlling
shareholder.
The suit also charges Shearson with liability for the fraudulent transfer of
hundreds of millions of dollars of cash and assets.
Also named in the suit are Mr Robert Weingarten, former chief executive of
First Capital, Mr Peter Cohen, former chief executive of Shearson, and
others.
Shearson Lehman said it believed that the lawsuit was 'without merit'.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: AHP faces Dollars 1bn jobs
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A Dollars 1bn lawsuit concerning the alleged transfer of nearly 1,400
factory jobs from the US mainland to Puerto Rico was filed yesterday by
trade union representatives against American Home Products (AHP), the US
pharmaceuticals company.
An unusual aspect of the lawsuit, which also names the governor of Puerto
Rico as a defendant, is that it is has been filed under the controversial
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), a law which
provides for the tripling of damages in the case of a court victory.
The main allegation is that AHP, which opened plant in Puerto Rico in 1983
and 1987, made use of US and Puerto Rican tax credits connected to the
sheltering of profits earned from the Puerto Rican factories and that
development grants and training subsidies were obtained to 'illegally
destroy mainland jobs by creating duplicate capacity in Puerto Rico'.
The lawsuit says nearly 1,400 jobs were lost in AHP plants in Indiana and
Pennsylvania as a result of the opening of the Puerto Rican plants, which
make Anacin, Advil and other over-the-counter and prescription drugs.
It claims AHP used a provision of US tax law that grants US companies 100
per cent tax credits on profits made by Puerto Rico subsidiaries.
The suit alleges the governor and other officials of Puerto Rico ignored
their duty to thoroughly explore the adverse potential impact on US mainland
employment resulting from the opening of the new AHP plants.
It seeks damages of Dollars 1bn and to void a further Dollars 500m of
estimated AHP accrued tax benefits since 1985.
The case could create a precedent suggesting that US companies might be
liable for job losses related to the transfer of production facilities
outside the US.
AHP said it could not comment on the lawsuit, which it had not yet received.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer Management Group, a privately-held computing services company with
strengths in financial services and public utilities, last year shrugged off
the UK recession to record improved sales and profits.
Turnover for 1991 rose by 7 per cent to to Pounds 103m (Pounds 96.2m) while
pre-tax profits advanced by 6 per cent to Pounds 9.1m.
Earnings per share were 39.8p (37p), and a dividend of 13.1p (12.7p) is
recommended.
UK sales were flat at Pounds 39m but cost cutting measures ensured that the
UK activities made a profit of Pounds 600,000 last year compared with a loss
of Pounds 1m in 1990.

Results for the six months to December 31 at Merlin International
Properties, whose shares were suspended last April, showed a sharp reduction
in pre-tax losses from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 2.69m. Losses per share were

reinstatement of its share quotation.
A new holding company, Merlin International Holdings, is to be formed; it
will offer to exchange its shares for existing MIP shares on the basis of
one MIH new ordinary for each MIP share and two MIH ordinary for each MIP
preference. MIH shares are to be listed, replacing the present MIP listing.
In addition, the company will offer existing and certain new shareholders
the right to subscribe for up to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 9.3m net) of new
ordinary shares at a price to be determined by the company's brokers.

SHARES OF Dublin-based Ryan Hotels yesterday fell 7 1/2 p to 24 1/2 p on
news of a sharp fall in profits for the year to end-October.
The fall, from IPounds 2.82m to IPounds 975,085 (Pounds 902,000) pre-tax,
was blamed on the recession, the Gulf war and sharply higher interest
charges.
The final dividend is cut to 0.5p (1.25p) making a 1p (1.75p) total.
Earnings emerged at 1.11p (4.32p).
Turnover declined from IPounds 20.1m to IPounds 19.4m and profits at the
trading level emerged at IPounds 2.77m (IPounds 3.31m). Interest charges
accounted for IPounds 1.72m (IPounds 863,813) and exceptional provisions for
IPounds 82,000 (credits IPounds 370,000).
Costs associated with the sale of three hotels were taken as a IPounds
990,075 extraordinary item.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Barclays cedes top spot in profits league -
The reasons behind the bank's downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS remains the UK's biggest bank, measured in terms of both the market
value of its shares and the value of its assets.
But yesterday it ceded the title of the UK's most profitable bank to Lloyds.
In 1991, Barclays made pre-tax profits of Pounds 533m - 30 per cent down on
the previous year - compared with the Pounds 645m disclosed earlier this
week by Lloyds.
Part of the reason for Lloyds surpassing Barclays was that Barclays' control
of costs in 1991 was less rigorous than its peers. Both Lloyds and National
Westminster reduced the ratio of their costs to income during the year.
But for the second year in succession, Barclays' cost-income ratio rose. In
1989, the ratio was 64 per cent. It rose to 65.7 per cent the following year
and was 67.8 per cent last year.
A direct comparison with Lloyds' ratio, of 61.8 per cent, is not altogether
fair on Barclays', because the two banks consist of very different
businesses. But Sir John Quinton, Barclays' chairman, said that the trend at
his bank was 'disappointing'.
Part of the reason for the rise at Barclays was that two overseas banks
which have been recently acquired - Merck Finck in Germany and Europeene de
banque of France - were included in the figures for a full year for the
first time. Both of these banks have significant running costs, but their
income levels are not yet substantial enough - though Sir John stressed that
they were both profitable and that he was optimistic about their prospects.
However, he conceded that even without a range of 'special factors', the
cost income ratio would still have risen. Part of the reason was that
Barclays made a far higher pay award to staff last year than Lloyds did. Mr
Peter Wood, finance director, said that the result of this was that costs of
running the UK network of branches rose 11 per cent in the year.
Sir John said that the staff salary increase in the current year was only 3
per cent, less than Lloyds. He was therefore hopeful that the cost income
ratio would improve.
Having been the most expansionist of the UK's biggest banks in the past few
years, Barclays is now putting a renewed emphasis on cost-control and
profitability.
Mr Andrew Buxton, managing director, stressed that businesses incapable of
making a satisfactory return would be closed or sold. He said that about
Pounds 100m of capital would be released as the bank reorganised its finance
company division, called the Mercantile group of companies. He said
Mercantile would withdraw from providing loans which are marketed by other
organisations - third party loans - and from financing purchases of
equipment by small companies. He also said that in the US the bank was
moving to 'become a wholesale bank (providing services to big companies) and
out of the middle market and the retail market'.
It is understood that the bank is therefore keen to sell one of its US
operations, Barclays Bank New York, which has capital of some Pounds 100m.
Mr Wood said he was working on a project to improve the bank's management
control systems, so that the bank has an improved grasp of the true
profitability of individual services and products. Such management controls
have to date eluded most of the big UK banks.
Nonetheless, Sir John applauded the progress of some divisions during the
year. The financial services division, which includes life insurance
operations, pushed up profits from Pounds 181m to Pounds 214m. Profits of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank, rose from Pounds 5m to Pounds
61m.
There was also a recovery at the Barclaycard operation, Central Retail
Services, which returned a profit of Pounds 46m compared with a loss of
Pounds 4m, thanks to the introduction of charges for credit card holders.
These profits were, however, less than half what the division has made in
the past.
On the other hand, losses on loans took their toll of three divisions.
Profits of the UK banking operations fell from Pounds 324m to Pounds 119m.
The Mercantile companies made a loss of Pounds 126m, compared with profits
of Pounds 2m. The US operations lost Pounds 217m, down from a Pounds 20m
profit.
As a result the group's earnings per share fell from 24.7p to 15.2p.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 158m repaid to parent by O&amp;Y Canary
Wharf Hldgs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
O&amp;Y CANARY Wharf Hold-ings, the developer of the Pounds 3bn office complex
in London's Docklands, repaid Pounds 158m of its share capital to its
Canadian parent in November 1990, according to newly published accounts.
The repayment was the main cause of the net assets fall to Pounds 571.7m
(Pounds 751m) in the year to October 1991.
O&amp;Y did not comment on the repayment, other than saying that money was
transferred back and forth to the parent company as required.
A City banker said that it was O&amp;Y's practice to fund the early phases of a
development from its own resources before raising long-term debt and
repaying some of the parent company's equity. There are also tax advantages
in transferring equity rather than debt between a parent company and a
subsidiary.
O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings made a Pounds 21.1m loss in the year. O&amp;Y said
that the loss for the year was 'wholly attributable' to its accounting
policy of charging interest to the profit and loss account, rather than
capitalising it.
Interest costs of Pounds 123.7m and administrative costs of Pounds 16.6m
were offset by interest receivable of Pounds 67.1m and gross profits of
Pounds 52.1m. The profits were due to Pounds 1.6m of rental income and a
Pounds 54.5m sale and leaseback deal with Credit Suisse First Boston.
O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings' gearing stood at 132 per cent at the year-end.
During the year, O&amp;Y refinanced nearly Pounds 1bn of short-term debt. It
arranged Pounds 501m of bank loans which are repayable within two to five
years and Pounds 90m of loans repayable after five years. Some Pounds 100m
of loans are unsecured but all the loans are guaranteed by the ultimate
parent company. Its cash balance was reduced from Pounds 921m to Pounds
54.1m during the year.
The position of O&amp;Y's parent company remains unclear, as its finances are
kept entirely private. However, it has been affected by the downturn in
North American property markets and the difficulty of obtaining bank
financing for projects, as well as the demands of Canary Wharf.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Tiny Rowland sets the City a puzzle: What Lonrho's annual
report says about its profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past four months, Lonrho's share price has halved. Part of the drop
stems, perhaps unfairly, from the prominence of Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's
chief executive, at a time when tycoons are out of fashion. Part of the
shares' weakness, however, can be traced to the poor preliminary results
announced in late January.
There was more bad news in the company's annual report, published yesterday.
It showed that the group's pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 1991
 -which fell to Pounds 207m from the Pounds 273m recorded a year before -
would have been lower still without the Pounds 33m gained from disposals of
property. Without these gains Lonrho's overall pre-tax profits would have
fallen to Pounds 174m instead of Pounds 207m. In 1990, pre-tax profits
included just Pounds 4m of property disposals.
Profits in 1991 were also boosted by Pounds 27m (Pounds 13m) of interest
capitalised primarily from its hotel building programme.
Lonrho's shares fell against the market trend yesterday, to close at 121p,
down 9p. The drop in the share price was also influenced by what the annual
report did not say. There seemed, to analysts and shareholders poring over
the pages yesterday, to be no clear, easy-to-grasp answers to the questions
they have been asking since the preliminary results were published: what
caused the fall in pre-tax profits; and why did the group slash its
dividend, when there was no pressure on it to do so from the banks?
Lonrho is surprised that the questions are asked at all. Is it remarkable,
say its directors, that its profits were hit by one of the worst recessions
since the 1930s? And why the attention given to its decision to cut the
final dividend by 3p to 5p per share? After all, last year Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said companies should not
pay dividends that they could not afford.
In short, Lonrho cannot understand what all the fuss is about. For its part,
the City does not understand Mr Rowland's explanation of the poor 1991
performance. In the annual report he says the fall in precious metals
accounted for nearly half the reduction in profits in the second half of the
financial year.
During the 1991 financial year as a whole, the average price of gold and
platinum fell from Dollars 386 per ounce to Dollars 365 and from Dollars 492
per ounce to Dollars 391 respectively. But this was more than offset by the
increase in the average price of rhodium, which rose from Dollars 2,857 per
ounce to Dollars 4,486. Mining also increased. Output of platinum metals
rose from 486,000 oz to 625,000 oz; gold from 693,000 oz to 841,000 oz; and
rhodium from 30,000 oz to 38,000 oz.
Mr Mike Smith, conglomerate analyst at Fleming Securities, says: 'On the
basis of these figures I would have expected Lonrho to have maintained its
pre-tax profits if not increased them; something is very strange.'
The annual report simply shows mineral extraction and refining profits
before interest and taxation fell from Pounds 123m to Pounds 106m. But when
pressed, Lonrho points out that it takes nine months for the metal to emerge
as sales after it is extracted at Western Platinum's South African mines.
The time-lag makes it hard to draw conclusions from the price of the metal
over the year, especially since there is a monthly swing in the price of
rhodium.
Overall, however, the drop in mining profits only explains a quarter of the
profits decline. A more significant contribution to lower profits - not
highlighted in Mr Rowland's introduction - comes from the group's businesses
in the UK.
The figures in the annual report reveal the weakness of the UK businesses,
which include newspapers, steel manufacturing, hotels, property and car
distribution. The UK, which represents 40 per cent of group revenues, was
the worst hit geographical segment. Profits before tax and interest fell by
Pounds 37m to Pounds 53m. East, Central and West Africa, which together
provide 11 per cent of turnover, saw profits rise from Pounds 112m to Pounds
123m.
The extent of the 1991 decline can be seen from the fact that 1990 pre-tax
profits from VAG, Lonrho's Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution
operations in the UK, were Pounds 20m. Yet in 1991 the whole of the UK's
pre-tax profits (after subtracting interest) were just Pounds 19m. Lonrho's
problems in the UK also help to explain its decision to cut its dividend for
the first time since 1981.
The company does not make enough UK profits to offset against the advanced
corporation tax payable on its dividends. The annual report shows a
contingent ACT liability of Pounds 78m. So, though the poor performance of
the UK businesses only explains part of the overall drop in profits, it goes
some way towards explaining the dividend decision.
Not everything in the annual report was greeted with gloom. One big
shareholder pointed to the Pounds 6m reduction in working capital as a
pointer to tight management controls. But some shareholders were left
unhappy by Lonrho's contacts with them last month, which stressed that it is
a difficult business to understand. 'That doesn't mean it shouldn't try
harder to explain what is going on', said one institutional shareholder.
To try to offset the tycoon factor, Mr Rowland, who is 74, has decided to
take a leaf out of Hanson's book. Last month Lord Hanson attempted to stamp
out speculation about his successor by showing shareholders the depth of the
company's management. Lonrho is planning a similar move at its AGM next
month.
The number of associate directors has been doubled to 20. The message at
Lonrho's AGM will be that it too could find a successor to its chief
executive from a number of strong internal candidates.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Smiths poised for US avionics deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS Industries, the UK defence and aerospace components group, is about
to sign a partnership agreement with the Collins Avionics division of
Rockwell International of the US.
The venture will create a third force in the commercial aircraft avionics
sector competing against Honeywell, the market leader, and the French
Sextant avionics group.
It will also rationalise the commercial aircraft avionics business along the
same lines as the other main sectors of the commercial aerospace industry
dominated by three airframe manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell
Douglas) and three engine makers (Pratt &amp; Whitney, General Electric and
Rolls-Royce).
Mr Graham Thornton, marketing director of Smiths Industries' defence and
aerospace activities, said yesterday agreement between the two companies was
close. He said there was only room in the market for three groups to provide
the avionic systems for the flight decks of commercial airliners.
The venture is not expected to involve a cross-equity agreement at this
stage.
The agreement is expected to form a joint marketing company with the two
groups retaining their design and manufacturing activities. The two
companies will bid as a partnership for future avionics contracts on
airliner projects.
The partnership is also expected to focus on winning business on US Boeing
aircraft which make up about 55 per cent of the world airliner market.
Honeywell, the biggest US avionics supplier with about 35 per cent of the
world market, is dominant on McDonnell Douglas aircraft.
The French Sextant group, formed by the merger of Aerospatiale's and Thomson
CSF's avionics interests to rationalise this sector of the French
state-controlled aerospace industry, is the main avionics supplier of
European Airbus airliners.
The idea of the partnership followed an earlier unsuccessful attempt by the
two companies to bid jointly for the aircraft information management system
(AIMS) of Boeing's new 777 widebody airliner two years ago.
Although the AIMS contract was ultimately won by Honeywell, Smiths
Industries and Collins felt there were strong synergies between the two
companies and decided to discuss a broader alliance, Mr Thornton said.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Denmark asks EC to look at Glaxo pricing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, the UK pharmaceuticals group, is being challenged over its European
drug pricing strategy. The Danish office of fair trading has asked the
European Commission to investigate whether the company is abusing a dominant
market position by charging excessively high prices for its drugs.
Glaxo's strategy of commanding premium prices for innovative products could
be severely undermined if the Danish move is successful. The group needs to
generate substantial revenues from new pharmaceutical products over the next
few years if it is to compensate for an expected fall in sales of Zantac,
its best-selling ulcer drug.
The Danish authorities have complained about the price of three recently
introduced products: Imigran, a migraine drug; Serevent, an asthma product;
and Zofran, an anti-cancer pharmaceutical. All three drugs have been
described by analysts as possible 'blockbusters' with potential sales of
more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) a year. Analysts forecast Imigran will
generate revenues of more than Dollars 2bn a year by 1997.
In order to prove that Glaxo is abusing a dominant position, the Commission
will have to show that it charges excessive prices by conducting an analysis
of the cost of producing the drug.
The European Court of Justice has ruled in the past that prices are
excessive when they have no reasonable relation to 'the economic value' of
the product.
Glaxo said last night it was studying the Danish complaint. The company said
its drug prices reflected the benefit of each product to society and the
patient, as well as the cost of research and development. It expects to
spend Pounds 600m on R&amp;D this year.
Mr Robin Gilbert, an analyst at James Capel, said the Danish move was
unprecedented. He said the complaint was unlikely to have much effect on
sales in the short term, but that it could be significant in the long term
if it made other governments question Glaxo's pricing policy. 'Pricing is
becoming a hot subject. This is an unpleasant straw in the wind,' he added.
The Danish announcement, just before the London stock market closed, led to
a 10p fall in Glaxo's price. The stock closed up 1p on the day at 794p.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Australia stakes ADollars 2.3bn on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CANBERRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday staked its future on a ADollars 2.3bn
(Pounds 980m) spending programme intended to speed up economic recovery and
bring unemployment below 10 per cent before the next election scheduled to
take place by mid-1993.
The success of the package will determine the government's chances of
overhauling the conservative opposition, made up of the Liberal and National
parties, which has a substantial lead in most opinion polls and is widely
expected to win the election.
Mr Keating said the spending programme would form the first stage of a
four-year 'strategy for growth' which would create 800,000 jobs and lay the
groundwork for a decade of prosperity. Longer-term structural economic
reforms include further deregulation of aviation, relaxation of controls on
foreign banks and simpler planning procedures for big mining projects.
The government also announced reforms to the corporate tax system, including
accelerated depreciation allowances, more generous treatment of banks' bad
debt provisions and changes to capital gains tax.
Ministers hope the tax changes will help accelerate growth by encouraging
private sector investment and giving banks an incentive to allow problem
borrowers to trade their way out of trouble.
Mr Keating was unable to find room for cuts in income tax before the
election. However, he promised cuts worth more than ADollars 8bn by 1996,
sufficient to reduce the top rate of tax to 30 per cent for three-quarters
of taxpayers.
Mr Keating promised during his leadership campaign to produce an economic
statement calculated to 'get Australia moving again' after two years of flat
or negative growth which have seen unemployment rise to 10.3 per cent.
Most of the ADollars 2.3bn earmarked for pump priming will be spent on
infrastructure projects to upgrade Australia's inefficient roads and
railways and ease congestion at crowded airports, notably in Melbourne and
Sydney.
The government resisted strong pressure from trade unions and some employers
for a slowdown in its 10-year tariff reduction programme.
The package was welcomed by business leaders. Mr Frank Conroy, managing
director of Westpac Banking Corporation, said the growth projections were
high, but he forecast that the package would not unsettle the financial
markets.
Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberal/National opposition, said it was 'one
of the most irresponsible packages I have seen contemplated in Australia'.
It was largely based on over-optimistic growth estimates which could not be
achieved, he charged.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Heseltine warns of dearer motoring: Pressure on road use may
lead to increase in petrol duty after general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, warned yesterday that the cost
of using a car in Britain may have to rise.
In a speech signalling an increased government concern at the pressure on
road use, Mr Heseltine raised speculation that after the general election he
would push for increases in petrol duty to curb growth in car use.
'Public transport will be central to any approach,' Mr Heseltine said. 'We
simply cannot provide for growing numbers of cars within our urban areas.'
Speaking to a seminar in London organised by five professional institutions
interested in transport, Mr Heseltine marked a further significant switch
away from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's defence of 'the great car society', saying
that traffic growth had reached a point where it was no longer possible to
provide new roads into urban centres.
The demand for car travel in the south east would simply mean new road space
would be quickly filled, he said.
His comments came amid pressure on the Treasury from some Tory backbenchers
for increases in petrol duty in the March 10 Budget to help fund the
expected income tax cuts.
However, an equally vociferous lobby of Conservative MPs, particularly from
crucial Midlands marginals, are calling for extra help for Britain's
depressed car industry.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, marked the shift in Tory thinking
last May when he declared himself in favour of switching more passenger and
freight traffic from road to rail.
But the fact that Mr Heseltine has thrown his formidable political weight
behind the new policy just weeks before a general election gives it fresh
impetus.
Mr John Major yesterday chaired a cabinet committee set up to resolve
clashes between government departments over the pace at which
pollution-cutting measures, including those for carbon dioxide emissions,
could be introduced.
On Monday, Mr Heseltine will use a speech in New York to urge other
countries to consider June's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as a starting
point for further progress towards cutting emissions of greenhouse gases and
reducing the risk of global warming.
In his speech yesterday, Mr Heseltine emphasised the debit side of motoring.
The car was a major contributor to pollutant emissions and caused deaths and
injuries and disruption due to congestion. 'More and better public transport
will come,' he said.
Recent budgets, he said, had increased vehicle fuel duties ahead of
inflation and substantially reduced tax incentives for company cars. 'All
told, we should certainly not be banking on cheaper motoring costs for the
future.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / S Dakota vote deals blow to Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's re-election campaign showed signs of growing
disarray yesterday as a weak vote in Tuesday's South Dakota primary
reinforced signals of dissent among Republicans.
Mr Bush's campaign advisers seem at a loss over how to reverse their
candidate's plunging popularity. Unless they can stem the tide, many
rightwing Republicans fear that their party could lose the presidency to the
Democrats for the first time since 1976.
While the president, the sole candidate on the ballot paper, won 69 per cent
of the Republican primary vote in South Dakota, the remaining 31 per cent of
Republican voters entered a protest vote against Mr Bush by casting their
ballots for uncommitted delegates to the party's national convention, which
chooses the presidential candidate.
'It shows a terrible endemic weakness of the George Bush candidacy,' said Mr
Patrick Buchanan, the rightwing television commentator and former Nixon
speechwriter who won 37 per cent of Republican votes in New Hampshire's
primary last week. Mr Buchanan was excluded from the South Dakota ballot by
the prairie state's party leadership.
Mr Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst, described South Dakota's
uncommitted Republican delegates as an 'anybody-but-Bush ticket.'
While the Bush campaign could dismiss Mr Buchanan's vote in
recession-scarred New Hampshire as a 'primal scream,' South Dakota, which
has been hurt much less, showed that the president has so far failed to
convince voters that he knows how to help the economy.
This could damage him in other states with struggling economies such as
Florida, which votes on March 10.
One of Mr Bush's campaign co-chairmen in Florida, Senator Connie Mack, has
made it plain he does not believe the president has taken the measure of the
recession, and yesterday renewed his attack ecretary.
Some conservative Republicans feel that Mr Bush himself has lost all
credibility as a bulwark against higher taxes by breaking his 1988 campaign
pledge of 'No new taxes' and argue that he needs a new, conservative
treasury secretary to regain this credibility.
Mr Bush's less than exuberant victory in South Dakota's Republican primary
showed the dilemma for his campaign: he faces no serious obstacles to
winning his party's nomination - indeed, he is likely to win every single
state - but every weak victory will be chalked up as a loss.
Bush campaign officials have been irked by a Washington Post report that
former president Ronald Reagan had told friends Mr Bush was in political
trouble because 'he doesn't seem to stand for anything.'
However, after a 20 minute meeting with the president last night, Mr Reagan
said he supported Mr Bush's candidacy 'to the fullest'.
Among the Democrats, South Dakota's primary shed little light on the
eventual outcome; all four major candidates still need to prove themselves
with a strong victory in a neutral state in order to translate regional
strength into national support. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who won with
40 per cent of the vote, badly needed this strong score to revive his
flagging campaign.
Mr Kerrey intends to take on Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who came
third in South Dakota with 19 per cent, in Georgia on March 3, but his best
chance of a victory may be in Colorado, on the same day.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, second with 26 per cent, would have liked a
stronger performance, but has the funds and to compete in Maryland and
Minnesota on March 3.

FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: S G Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an element of hysteria about yesterday's fall of more than 6 per
cent in S G Warburg's shares. The merchant bank admitted that second-half
pre-tax profits would not match the Pounds 89m recorded in the first half,
but the total would still be above the Pounds 66m for the equivalent period
of 1990-91. That suggests the British Telecom issue was not quite the
bonanza it should have been.
Since Warburg's fiscal year started on October 1, the FT-SE has fallen by
about 100 points and equity turnover has dwindled. Corporate finance
business has become scarcer as decisions have been deferred because of the
recession and the election.
The pace of business could quicken after the election, especially if a Tory
victory lifts the equity market out of its present torpor, allowing a
revival of both capital raising and bid activity.
In the meantime, a floor of Pounds 66m for second-half profits does not
exactly constitute a collapse, although it is a far cry from 1989-90 when
the bank notched up Pounds 187.5m in the full year.

FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's report and accounts will have done little to reassure investors
alarmed by the dismal profits fall announced last month. Hence the further 7
per cent slide in the shares yesterday. The extra detail strengthens the
impression of a group failing to hold its far-flung empire together.
Even the declared Pounds 207m of pre-tax profit was flattered to the tune of
Pounds 43m by property disposals and capitalised interest, so the underlying
fall was significantly worse than previously disclosed. Lonrho's bankers,
who have advanced the group more than Pounds 800m of unsecured loans, might
be regretting their generosity.
The main explanation for the poor trading performance appears to lie in the
UK, where profits collapsed from Pounds 55m to Pounds 19m before tax. Given
that the VAG motor distribution business made Pounds 20m pre-tax in 1990,
the performance of Lonrho's other UK operations must have been dire indeed.
If that continues, Lonrho will certainly face an Advance Corporation Tax
problem. Nor is there much hope to be gleaned from the fact that the group's
losses from foreign exchange adjustments last year fell by three-quarters to
Pounds 40m. It will be asking a lot for exchange rates to be so favourable
this time round.
In structural terms, the group's main problem was its inadequate cash
generation. A generous reading suggests a cash inflow of a mere Pounds 35m
before tax and dividends, though it remains tantalisingly obscure over how
this came about.
Granted, capital expenditure should fall sharply this year and there might
be a boost from asset disposals. But given the poor quality of its earnings,
Lonrho must be wondering whether it can keep up even its reduced 13p
dividend. The yield case for buying the shares looks ever more suspect.

FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt it is unintentional, but CU seems to have perfected the art of
embarrassing its rivals. A year ago the company's wafer thin profits stood
out in a sea of red ink. Yesterday it was the dividend announcement - a 3
per cent increase in spite of nearly Pounds 70m of pre-tax losses for 1991 -
which looks likely to distinguish CU from the pack once the latest reporting
season is over.
Given that CU shares underperformed the market by 20 per cent in the last 12
months, the real question for investors is not so much the company's
relative position as the prospects for the whole sector.
Nothing that CU said yesterday, however, encourages the view that the much
anticipated re-rating of the composites is at hand, which is why
expectations that the CU's losses can be kept to a relatively respectable
Pounds 40m in 1992 are arguably of little comfort. The outlook for non-life
insurance markets remains spotty: improving in the UK on the personal side,
to be sure, but little sign of any hardening of commercial rates or of
recovery in the London market. Motor claims at CU rose a remarkably modest
2.4 per cent in 1991, but theft and arson remain a nightmare for the whole
industry.
The plus points about CU are its solid management and the absence of
exposure to big unknowns like mortgage guarantee losses and the direction of
the US dollar. But while its weak balance sheet kept the company out of
mischief in the late 1980s while others lost their heads, the lack of
significant financial muscle can now be seen as a handicap. A solvency
margin estimated as in the low 40s might be envied elsewhere - but it
provides little scope to chase market share or turn acquisitive. CU may want
none of this - but the opportunities are there as better capitalised
continental companies have proved.

FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A costly year at Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,565 (+18.2)
It is just as well that South Africa has regained some international
respectability. Otherwise Barclays Bank would not have been able to release
a full Pounds 100m of South African provisions, and its pre-tax profits
would have fallen by even more than the reported 30 per cent to Pounds 533m.
Even with that sort of flattery, however, there is no disguising a dismal
underlying performance. It has produced operating income of Pounds 2.03bn -
only Pounds 6m more than that of National Westminster - even though total
assets are 13 per cent higher.
This would matter less if Barclays' steeply rising overheads really were
largely the product of investment spending for the future. Strip out the
Pounds 90m of extra costs from the acquisitions in France and Germany and
around Pounds 45m of restructuring charges (which are carried as an
exceptional by NatWest), and overall costs still rose by 10 per cent. That
suggests some pretty deep-rooted pressures which will be hard for a
juggernaut like Barclays to slow.
Unlike National Westminster, Barclays cannot expect to benefit from falling
provisions this year. If anything its UK provisions of Pounds 1.31bn look a
little on the low side. Certainly they will be high again this year. It is
thus not surprising that its shares fell 5 per cent to 374p. The chances are
that the bank will have little scope for increasing its dividend in 1992. In
profit terms its recovery potential looks the least attractive of the three
large clearers which have reported to date.

THE European Parliament will press ahead with a debate on Ireland's abortion

The parliament's legal affairs committee will debate the issue on the
grounds that it has raised important issues of principle for the European

Mr Willi Rothley, the German socialist MEP who called for the debate last
week, said that the supreme court's decision was 'only an individual
solution'.
Mr Geoffrey Hoon, the British Labour MEP and a member of the committee,
added: 'I hope the court has decided the case on the principle that it
cannot interfere with the right of Irish citizens to travel freely to other
parts of the Community'.
Mr Gerhard Schmid, a German socialist MEP, was emphatic. 'We must redefine
conditions for EC membership. I propose that only states which have
experienced the Age of Enlightenment could be members of the Community. I
doubt whether in fact Ireland can stay in the Community'.
Ireland's Supreme Court registrar said the injunction against the girl had
been set aside but the legal reasoning would not be given for several days,
leaving open the possibility that the controversy may be far from over.
The decision was cautiously welcomed by Irish politicians. The Irish
government is paying the estimated Pounds 50,000 cost of the family's appeal
and Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said last night that the
decision 'may have other implications and I want to examine the judgment in
detail before commenting on it. But if the appeal has been allowed, then
this case is now out of the way.'
Mr Reynolds, visiting London for Anglo-Irish summit talks with Mr John
Major, added that it was up to the rape victim and her family to make up
their minds what to do next.
There is concern within the EC that ratification of the Maastricht treaty
could be in jeopardy, because of the special protocol excluding Ireland from
EC law in cases where it contradicts Ireland's constitutional ban on
abortion.
Mr Alan Shatter, the opposition Fine Gael justice spokesman, argued this
week that if the Maastricht treaty was ratified with the protocol included
in its present form, it could put the controversy back to square one,
despite yesterday's Supreme Court ruling.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Search for a cure to economic chill: How BP plans to recover
after lean times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The marble reception hall of British Petroleum's newly refurbished
headquarters in the City of London has only one problem. There is no
heating. As a result the management of one of the world's largest oil
companies has had to install a number of small gas stoves to beat back the
cold.
This temporary unsightliness might be a parallel for BP's recently
well-publicised difficulties: a blue-chip company undergoing what its
management claims is a spell of seasonal difficulty, the chill being
provided by recession in its principal markets rather than the weather.
The company's poor results for the final quarter of last year, when profits
fell 85 per cent and the dividend was unchanged (increasing 4.7 per cent for
the year as a whole), drove home to the stock market how vulnerable BP was
to the prevailing economic climate. But oil being a business with long lead
times, where investments only pay off after several years, the deeper
question is whether BP can spring back when conditions improve.
Some industry observers are doubtful. They point to the company's heavy load
of debt, its exposure to depressed oil prices, and its modest presence in
the Far Eastern market, which represents one of the few areas of oil
industry growth. BP's executives accept that there is something to these
concerns, although they maintain that the market has exaggerated their
importance.
The City has focused its concern on the company's long-term debt burden. Its
debt to equity ratio, an important measure of corporate indebtedness, rose
to 69 per cent at the end of last year, compared with a modest 11 per cent
at Shell, the rival integrated oil company. The company would like to try to
stop it growing above this level, but has ruled out a rights issue in the
medium term to raise cash to pay off some of the debt.
'I'm not greatly concerned about our debt levels, but my gut reaction is
that we're at a prudent limit,' says Mr Bob Horton, BP's chairman. 'We need
to adjust our capital expenditure and accelerate cost-cutting to stay within
that level.'
The need to rein in debt means that BP must set careful priorities in
allocating financial resources. The company needs to balance capital
expenditure, which is vital for future growth in the oil industry, with cash
needed for debt reduction. It can buy itself some leeway by paring operating
costs extensively: it is planning to save Pounds 750m by cost-cutting at its
three main business divisions by 1994.
There is currently a gap in funding of about Pounds 1.5bn. BP generated
Pounds 4.2bn in cash from its operations last year and spent about Pounds
2bn on interest payments, tax and dividends. This leaves a shortfall, since
it is committed to capital expenditure of about Pounds 3.5bn this year.
But the current funding difficulties cast some doubt on BP's ability to
continue growth in oil production and consequently profits in the long term.
The company spent Pounds 4bn on capital expenditure projects last year which
include payment for developing oilfields and investment in upgrading
refineries. But Mr Horton has said it will cut this to about Pounds 3.6bn
this year and the City is expecting further cuts of about Pounds 200m to
Pounds 300m if the oil price continues to languish at its current level of
Dollars 17.50 a barrel.
At the same time, BP is under pressure to maintain its programme of spending
on oilfield development. The need for new discoveries is ever more pressing
because its two principal production areas, Alaska and the North Sea, are
reaching maturity and are unlikely to see increases in production.
Since Mr John Browne took over as managing director of the exploration
division five years ago, he has tried to focus on areas of the world which
offer growth. At the same time he has decided to pull the company out of
areas where it is failing to build a 'critical mass', which he defines as a
project with a market value of more than Dollars 1bn. The company's recent
decision to withdraw from the Qatar gas project was an example of this.
The strategy has seen BP focus its exploration efforts on Colombia, the Gulf
of Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. Mr Browne says:
'By the mid-1990s we should have new cashflow coming from places like the
Gulf of Mexico and Colombia and I hope we'll have opened up a third
potential profit centre.' Part of the company's spending on oilfield
development will have to be constrained by the need to control its debt, but
Mr Browne says the timing of some of these investment decisions can afford
to wait. 'Sometimes the longer we sit on things, the better they seem
because new technology means we can better exploit them.'
However, the timing of investment in BP's refining and marketing division is
more critical. The company is taking a similar approach to its downstream
operations as to oil exploration, and focusing its activities on
geographical regions where BP is a 'major brand'.
Mr Russell Seal, head of refining and marketing, explains that for BP to
consider itself a leading brand it must have a 15 per cent market share for
its petrol in a given area. As part of its strategy of geographical
concentration, the company is cutting its European operations from 200
regional centres to 150 and including them under central management from
Brussels.
But the most important issue for the future profitability of the downstream
section will be the amount the company is forced to spend on environmental
measures. This is particularly important in the US, where the Clean Air Act
could cost the oil industry as much as Dollars 45bn over the next seven
years. This will be spent on minimising emissions such as sulphur dioxide
from refineries as well as upgrading facilities for the production of new
'cleaner' fuels such as reformulated gasoline. Mr Seal says that the
refining and marketing division's share of the capital expenditure budget
amounts to some Dollars 1.8bn a year, out of which Dollars 400m is spent on
environmental measures.
Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett, believes BP can ill afford the
immense expenditure required to maintain production in the US in view of the
Clean Air Act and given the current cut-throat competition in the market.
'If 15 per cent of the refineries can't afford to make the investment and
close, that means margins will be higher for those remaining, but BP is
perhaps not in the best position to take that gamble.'
Industry observers believe that BP has more refining capacity than it needs
in the US and will scale it down in future. But given the competitive nature
and low returns offered by the US market at present, the environment is not
right for divesting assets.
BP, however, is pursuing a policy of divestment worldwide in all of its
divisions to give it more focus. Mr Horton has classified the company's
nutrition division as a 'non-core asset', a move interpreted by many
observers as a prelude to a sale. BP says it will not necessarily sell, but
it will cease to invest in nutrition.
Mr Horton's move to distance the group from its nutrition interests leaves
the company in two businesses that are highly dependent on world economic
growth: chemicals, and refining and marketing; and in oil exploration, which
is dependent on the oil price.
BP is more exposed to the oil price than many of its rivals, as it does not
have such an extensive network of refineries as, say, Shell. In addition,
its oil price forecasts have tended to be more optimistic than many of the
other majors'. Mr Horton insists that all projects are tested against an oil
price of Dollars 18 a barrel and are found to be 'robust'. But the oil price
remains stubbornly low at Dollars 17.50 a barrel.
At the same time, BP's long-term plans are based on projections of revenues
which require a rise in the price to about Dollars 25 a barrel by the second
half of the 1990s. Much of BP's growth estimates for the whole company are
based on an oil price above Dollars 20 after 1995.
'If the oil price continues at a level below Dollars 20 a barrel for a
sustained period, BP will probably shrink in size,' says Mr Antill. This is
because the company is unlikely to be able to invest enough to maintain and
increase its oil production.
Mr Horton explains: 'In one sense, BP is a growth company, but it doesn't
necessarily mean growth in volume or in asset size, but it does mean growth
in shareholder value: in earnings.
'We have absolutely no ambition to be the size of Shell of Exxon for the
sake of it,' he adds. 'The challenge we must meet is to get our overheads
down and operate at a lower cost. That is why technology is vital: we need
to operate more efficiently and offer a better service to customers.'

Hardly a week goes by, it seems, without news of another woman scaling a
bastion of Britain's male-dominated establishment. On Monday, Lady Shirley
Littler was given the chairmanship of the Gaming Board. Yesterday, J
Sainsbury, the well-connected grocers to the middle classes, proudly put on
display its first female finance director - 40-year-old Rosemary Thorne.
Now if the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street Bank was ever to allow a younger

If Manchester wins the Olympic Games in the year 2000, Bob Scott, the
theatrical impresario, will deserve more than the standard knighthood. He
has done more than any textile magnate to put the City on the map again, and
he is not even a local.
To help build bridges with the International Olympic Committee he has both a
former British high commissioner and an erstwhile British ambassador on the
Manchester team. The latter is named simply in the team's bumph as David
Scott and is described as having represented Britain in 'several African
countries'.
Very diplomatic, since this is Sir David Scott, ambassador to South Africa
in 1976-79 and Bob Scott's dad. Fortunately, South African connections are
no longer an Olympic kiss of death.

Graham Mather, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, has
found a novel way of rebuffing those who accuse him of getting too cosy with
the Tory party. He will today host a joint seminar at the Cafe Royal with
Demos, a new left-leaning think-tank, on the future relationship between the
public and private sectors. Demos, to be formally launched in the autumn,
unites a diverse group of movers and shakers who say they are fed up with
the narrow limits of traditional political debate.
The event, which is fully booked, has certainly attracted a wide range of
speakers. The gathering includes Sir Len Peach, director of personnel at
IBM, Marianne Neville Rolfe, chief executive of the Civil Service College,
Sir Peter Kemp, architect of the Whitehall Next Steps initiative, Sir
Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel and Elizabeth Symons,
high-flying general secretary of the FDA, the top civil servants' union.
Still, political demarcation lines have yet to erode sufficiently to allow
talk of a merger between the two tanks to creep onto the agenda.

'Internationalisation' has been a wildly popular word in Japan these last
few years - particularly among leading companies which have been keen to
appoint a vice-president for dealing with all things and people foreign.
Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house at the centre of the Mitsubishi
group, yesterday went one better, choosing a Harvard-educated
'internationalist', Minoru Makihara, 62, as its president.
Makihara, who joined Mitsubishi's marine products division in 1956, worked
in London for eight years and, more recently and probably more importantly
for a Japanese trading house, has spent the past few years in the US,
serving as resident senior managing director.
Having headed a Japanese chamber of commerce in New York, Makihara has a
proven record as a man with whom US companies can deal. And while Japanese
executives are often reluctant to voice opinions on matters of international
controversy, there will clearly be an important role for a corporate
spokesman whose sometimes ironic thoughts will not need translation for
Washington's benefit.

It is hard to quibble with Sir Ralf Dahrendorf's appointment as chairman of
Newspaper Publishing, the owners of The Independent. Currently warden of St
Antony's College, Oxford, he has been variously a German politician,
European Commissioner and director of the London School of Economics. He
even sits on the board of Glaxo, Britain's biggest company.
A member of the great and the good, Dahrendorf is a fine figure head and his
northern European temperament should help balance the boardroom
contributions from La Repubblica and El Pais, the Indy's two important Latin
shareholders. However, whether an Anglo-German sociologist is the best man
to have at the helm of a newspaper if there were to be a financial crisis is
debatable. Meanwhile, the equally important issue of splitting Andreas
Whittam-Smith's role as chief executive and editor still needs resolving.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Observer: Barclays' German catch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Britain's biggest bank a little too impressed with blue blood? When
Barclays purchased the exclusive Munich private bank Merck Finck in 1990,
German financiers were fascinated to see how the Brits would fare; the
former proprietor, Baron von Finck, was no longer a shareholder, and Adi
Kracht, who really ran the bank, left shortly after.
Now Barclays is delighted to have landed Michael von Brentano as Merck
Finck's fifth partner and overall head of investment banking, including the
BZW operation, in Germany. The former head of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets
in London, von Brentano comes from a suitably well-known German family -
uncle Heinrich was foreign secretary under Adenauer.
Before his 17 years at Deutsche, he spent a decade as director of private
bank Berliner Handels Gesellschaft (now BHF Bank). He is also a confirmed
anglophile - irritating intensely other German bankers during his
chairmanship of IPMA, the Euromarkets trade association, for his relentless
defence of London and its interests. And he is an old friend of BZW chief
executive David Band from the latter's time at JP Morgan.
The trouble is, he is aloof and very difficult to work with, and there is
the fact that, at 57, he surprised other bankers by taking early retirement
from Deutsche Bank. 'He may open some doors, but he is no longer at the
cutting edge,' is the assessment of one prominent German banker.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Arts: Kiri te Kanawa/Maxim Vengerov - Barbican Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Barbican is busying itself with a celebration of its 10th anniversary,
and has launched a glossy series of recitals and concerts to mark the
occasion. The festivities began on Monday with an appearance by Kiri te
Kanawa - a mixed bag of a recital that stretched from Purcell to Walton via
many points in between. It was not, in truth, the kind of a festive event
the occasion and the audience of adoring fans expected. The singer's
determination to leave the platform for extended intervals between the
smallest groups of songs broke what little continuity there was in the first
half, which hardly gained any sense of focus until the final groups of
songs, by Mozart and Liszt, were gratefully reached.
The opening had been dutiful rather than involved; in Purcell's 'The Blessed
Virgin's Expostulation' and arias by Gluck (from Paride ed Elene), Scarlatti
and Piccinni, te Kanawa found little sense of line or focus, and adjusted
only slowly to the size of the hall (never the best for a song recital). But
Mozart's 'An Chloe', 'Un moto di gioia' and especially 'Abendemfindung'
brought much more security, as she smoothed out her phrasing and began to
introduce nuance and colour; the Liszt selection then, highlighted by
'Freudvoll und Leidvoll', was poised and positively succulent.
Duparc shared the second half with Walton. While it is hard to breathe much
more life into the three spin-offs from Facade with which Kiri te Kanawa
ended, her Duparc selection of brought the finest moments of the evening.
There is more sensuousness and ambiguity to be woven into 'L'Invitation au
voyage', but 'Extase' and 'Phidyle' had the kind of rapt coherence and
easeful phrasing one hoped all of the evening would have offered more
generously.
In the Duparc too Roger Vignoles came finally into his own; after his
labours in the ill-fitting accompaniments to the baroque and classical
arias, he was able to get to grips with these meaty, rewarding piano parts
in a genuinely perceptive way.
                            *      *      *
On Tuesday, when the young Siberian-born violinist Maxim Vengerov appeared
with the English Chamber Orchestra, there were a few unsold seats at the
furthest edges of the Barbican Hall. That seems worth recording, since it
may never happen again. Followers of the Carl Flesch Competition have known
about Vengerov since he won it - at 16 - in 1990, and those of us who heard
his Wigmore hall debut last May came away astounded and deeply impressed.
He seems a phenomenon of nature, though there is nothing wild about his
native wood-notes. On the contrary, his readings are classically faithful,
without a hint of performer's self-indulgence (except when that is part of
the text, as in his sensational 'Carmen' Fantasy at the Wigmore). He just
happens to play the violin like someone congenitally meant for it.
Discussing 'technique' and 'control' would seem out of place: no doubt
Vengerov has learnt things since he first took the instrument up, but it
must have been like learning to walk and talk. His violin speaks as directly
and effortlessly in 'difficult' passages as in plain melodies; his big,
forthright tone carries all the expressive precision of a human voice.
His Mendelssohn Concerto, ably supported by the ECO under Yan Pascal
Tortelier, was a model of brilliant simplicity. Everything in his part
sounded, and always to a lucid purpose - the weightless virtuoso flights,
the heartfelt double-stopping, the sweetly radiant line of the Andante. No
touch of Schmalz there, though a few passionate curves reminded us that
Vengerov is Russian; he traced the idyll with rapt, selfless attention. His
tempo for the finale was a clear notch above what most violinists will risk,
and yet the music danced easily. Better still, he gave full, intrepid value
to Mendelssohn's 'Presto' for the first-movement coda: it made perfect
structural sense and a dazzling sound.

<TEXT>
That a saxophonist should still be gigging into his 73rd year is not
remarkable. Contrary to popular perception, jazz musicians often wear well
despite the rigours of a peripatetic life. Trumpet players Harry 'Sweets'
Edison, Doc Cheatham and Yank Lawson, for example, appear indestructible.
What is remarkable is that a Brummie tenorist should find popular acclaim -
and a record deal - so late in a long career. Perhaps things would have been
different had this gentle leader and composer not confined himself to the
Midlands, and The Bear pub, Bearwood, Birmingham, in particular, for the
last 40 years.
However, since the much vaunted release last year of the star studded
'Silvershine' album - special guests include pop singer Mick Hucknall as
well as top young London based jazzers - the rest of the country has been
exposed to the mellow tones and romantic history of Andy Hamilton.
Born in North Jamaica he left home in his teens to find labouring work on
the US East coast and supplemented his income with big band playing.
Returning to the West Indies in the Forties he signed up as resident
bandleader aboard the yacht Zaka and wrote the tune 'Silvershine' for its
owner, Errol Flynn.
In 1949 he came to the UK, intending to return to the States, but settled in
Birmingham where he has stayed, and played, ever since.
Although he has chosen not to travel far he has kept good company and
regularly plays alongside visiting names such as Edison as well as his own
Blue Notes.
In West London for two nights he retained precocious pianist Jason Rebello,
Mark Mondesir on a drumkit twice his size and percussionist Nana Tsiboe from
the album line-up, supplemented by Trevor Lines on string bass.
A long absence since those recording dates could be to blame, but they made
a wobbly start to a set consisting of common and uncommon standards as well
as Hamilton's own calypso-soaked compositions.
But Hamilton is an uncomplicated, soulful player and he gradually rounded
the edges off his accompanists' eager clatter with long (all things
considered), warm solos spaced out by absent-minded study of the playlist.
Ben Webster was a major influence in his learning and the old man's ballad
playing has a similar considered, mellow burr. It is laid back further by
the irresistible sounds of the Caribbean which creep into even the most
North American of tunes - 'Take the 'A' Train' and 'Juggernaut'.
But the ballads see Hamilton at his soothing and breathy best and
'Silvershine', revisited on the album after a 40 year absence from his
repertoire, sums up a life's work.

<TEXT>
THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE (15) Curzon Mayfair
THE LAST BOY SCOUT (18) MGM Trocadero
THE MAN IN THE MOON (PG) Cannon Trocadero
CROSS MY HEART (PG) Curzon Phoenix
I have no evidence to put before a court of law, but I believe we are being
hypnotised in Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Double Life Of Veronique. How else
explain the ability of a French-Polish film with a nonsensical plot premise
 -a girl from Kracow has an exact double in Clermont Ferrand and dies
leaving her a legacy of new awarenesses and sensitivities - to enthrall and
enchant us like no European film in recent memory?
Hypnotists, we know, often use objects to fascinate and transfix their
patients. Likewise Kieslowski. As in earlier films - Camera Buff, No End, A
Short Film About Killing - the screen is a mystical assault-course of the
ordinary made extraordinary. A lightbulb, a glass bauble, a tea-bag floating
in hot water: the inanimate world glows as mysteriously as the animate.
Through these deceiving sensory spaces, in which rain patterns on a wall
seem as tactile as real rain on the face or in which an 'innocent' puppet
show prophesies or recapitulates real events, Weronica and Veronique (both
played by Cannes Best Actress Irene Jacob) step into self-realisation.
Yes, but what is it all about? Neither heroine knows her Doppelganger and
they glimpse each other only once, in a demonstration-torn Polish square.
Yet like twins they have near-symbiotic tastes, feelings and skills. (Both
are gifted classical singers.) They also share a heart ailment which kills
Polish Weronica in mid-concert, bequeathing to French Veronique an instant,
bewildering sense of loss. The death also precipitates a series of trysts
with a young writer and puppet showman (Philippe Volter) who may be a
conduit between the dead girl and the living.
Political metaphor-seekers will no doubt spy a fable in which the Eastern
bloc's demise arouses a belated sense of kinship in the West, with the
artist as mage or mediator. But the film's magic is belittled by pat
equations. Kieslowski offers something larger: a vision of the world as an
evolving miracle of the imagination, a floating interchange between past,
present and future whose panhuman perspective allows each individual tragedy
to be redeemed by kindred lives facing kindred challenges.
But even above and beyond such larger decodings, this beautiful film is its
own enigma: as cryptic and glittering as the glass ball in Citizen Kane
(which has a twin here) and endowed with a soaring human radiance, both in
repose and in response, by Irene Jacob.
Meanwhile, back in Hollywood. You too, like screenwriter Shane Black who
sold his script of The Last Boy Scout for a record-breaking Dollars 1.75m,
could earn large sums by submitting seemingly simple action ideas to
Hollywood. Just follow Mr Black's guidelines. Whenever anyone is rude to his
film's hero - battered, wisecracking detective Bruce Willis - make sure he
is punched in the nose. Whenever anyone tries to 'fix' an American football
game, make sure he is punched in the nose. Whenever anyone is unkind to
animals or fails to help an old lady cross a street, make sure he is punched
in the nose.
We have never seen so many people punched in the nose. British director Tony
Scott, who has become a Hollywood multi-millionaire by directing expensive
tripe (Beverly Hills Cop 2, Days Of Thunder), gives The Last Boy Scout his
usual high-gloss visuals. Los Angeles throbs with burnished glamour as Mr
Willis and his adopted sidekick Daman Wayans, a black ex-footballer
threatened by a cartel of villains, proceed through town bashing and being
bashed.
Nose-pokings are supplemented by hand-stabbings, knee-bashings and electric
cattle-proddings. And whenever a car is stepped into, we know it will be
written off at the end of the sequence. One of our hero's proud past
achievements - we see it in flashback - is to have saved Jimmy Carter's
life. He was once a presidential bodyguard, it seems, who threw himself
between JC and a passing bullet. This indication that a man of Willis's
timbre once worked for the Democratic Party may be the best campaign
advertisement the Republicans have yet had.
The week's paper-handkerchief franchise is fought over by America's The Man
In The Moon and France's Cross My Heart. In each film a loved one dies,
leaving the hero or heroine(s) to cope with that Great Emotional Beyond
called bereavement.
The Man In The Moon, I must confess, left me feeling in an alarmingly mushy
state. Only the presence of my colleagues prevented me from extracting my
own handkerchief at the end and blowing loudly into it. Deep in Louisiana,
Sam Waterston and Tess Harper watch their two teenage daughters (Reese
Witherspoon and Emily Warfield) grow up and fall competitively in love with
the boy next door (Jason London). Then they have to cope with the trauma of
a tractor accident.
No narrative manoeuvre is spared to elicit our tears: subplots include a
near-miscarriage (Miss Harper's) and the heartbreak rivalry of the sisters.
But Robert Mulligan (Summer Of '42, Bloodbrothers) directs as if knowing how
to throw us into the deep end without water-wings and cameraman Freddie
Francis stands by to paint the gorgeous backcloth of a Southern summer.
My handkerchief remained unused in Jacques Fansten's Cross My Heart,
although I might have taken it out to wave in surrender as the film keeps
firing the same trite story ammunition at us. When Martin (Sylvain Copans),
a fatherless 12-year-old, loses his mother, he tries to conceal her death to
avoid being sent to an orphanage. His schoolfriends - what are copains for?
 -gallantly assist the cover-up by arranging lies, alibis and a secret, DIY
funeral using an old grandfather clock as coffin.
Amid all these mildly diverting logistics we are never actually told what
Martin is feeling. Is he upset by Mum's demise? Indifferent? Pleased? And
how he has kept her body for two days in the house without it smelling or
developing rigor mortis? (He has no problem dressing her for internment in
her best frock).
Steven Spielberg, who reportedly wept profusely on first seeing the film,
has persuaded Universal to buy the story rights for an American remake. We
tremble in anticipation. Even if Mr S irons out the inconsistencies, he is
still left with a plot in which plaintive pathos is the main if not only
keynote.
A final wave to the 1992 Berlin Film Festival, now departing into history.
We who were there will remember the fine movies, the mixed weather (snow,
sleet, a hint of sun, more sleet) and the sense of Berlin's own history
playfully processing itself into a souvenir culture. Did you know you can
now buy wooden Russian dolls on the Ku'damm pavements which bear the faces
of Gorbachev and Yeltsin? Inside each Russian leader is a series of smaller
ones trying to get out.
Lawrence Kasdan's ambitious, likable fresco of LA life Grand Canyon, noted
in my last report, won the Golden Bear for Best Film. Istvan Szabo's Dear
Emma, Dear Bobe, likewise noted, gained the runner-up Special Jury Prize. No
major honour, I rue, for the best film of the final days, Georgia's The
Beloved. Mikhail Kalatoschwili - whose grandfather directed the famous The
Cranes Are Flying - creates a caustic, brilliant pageant out of the Red
Army's invasion of Georgia after the October Revolution.
The cruelty of war is conveyed not by rhetoric but by a harrowing
understatement. Casual executions, passionless carnage, shamefaced
betrayals; and the numbed meting out of rough justice by a father who
executes his own son after the youngster has betrayed a friend.
A bouquet too, in default of a Bear, for Paul Schrader's Light Sleeper.
Willem Dafoe and Susan Sarandon star in this lissome thriller from the
director of American Gigolo and The Comfort Of Strangers. The movie turns
New York into a city of the mind much as Taxi Driver, scripted by Schrader,
did 15 years ago. It opens here on March 13: more then.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Misunderstandings that can lead to share
fluctuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT BEGAN with the first public reprimands from the Financial Reporting
Review Panel in late January. It continued with circulars on accounting
matters from a growing number of city stockbrokers. It may soon affect a
company near you.
None of the events of the last few weeks has involved the revelation of new
financial information. Yet they have triggered fluctuations in the share
prices of many of the companies concerned. That raises interesting questions
about the way the stock market reacts to accounting-related information.
On January 28 this year the review panel publicly criticised Williams
Holdings for transgressing accounting standards by excluding exceptional
items from its earnings per share calculation. The share price fell 20p,
before recovering slightly to close down 11p on the day.
A few days later, a circular was issued by Williams de Broe called 'Bringing
the engineers to account', which dealt with the accounting practices of five
companies in the engineering sector. The comment appears to have helped
depress the share price of TI Group, the most heavily criticised of the
companies, which was dubbed 'fundamentally overvalued'. The shares fell by
11p to 597p on the day, and by a further 17p the following Monday.
The next day, County NatWest issued a response entitled 'All above board'
which declared that the company's accounting policies did, in fact, 'stand
comparison with its peers'. TI's share price climbed 19p to 599p.
Attention soon switched elsewhere. On February 6, details of a draft report
prepared by Barclays de Zoete Wedd leaked to the media.
The BZW report discussed the work programme of new accounting standards
being prepared by the Accounting Standards Board. It argued that the changes
would most affect companies with: cash absorption; substantial profits from
acquisitions and disposals; large non-recurring costs; the presence of
hybrid capital instruments on the balance sheet under equity or minorities;
significant off-balance sheet finance; creative acquisition accounting;
large amounts of unprovided deferred tax; and substantial losses from
foreign currency translation taken through reserves.
The BZW report also analysed the effects of the changes on five companies:
British Airways, P&amp;O, Cable &amp; Wireless, Fisons and Ladbroke. It stressed
that the companies were obeying existing accounting standards, but that
their results would be shown in a less favourable light under the new
standards.
The short-term effect was clearly evident. Shares in P&amp;O fell by 1p, in
British Airways by 4p, and in Fisons by 6p. They slumped 13p in Cable &amp;
Wireless. Only Ladbroke's shares closed unchanged.
Irate phone calls and letters soon followed from some of the finance
directors of the companies named. BZW was forced to recall drafts of the
report and have them shredded. The next week, it made a public announcement
that the report was to be withdrawn following 'misinterpretation' of its
contents.
An anaemic 'legitimate son' of the draft report was released at the start of
this week. Every reference to examples of real companies had been stripped
out. It even substituted the phrase 'characteristics sensitive to the
proposed changes' for the original 'companies with the following
characteristics are likely to be vulnerable' to preface the list given
above.
It would be dangerous to argue that all these share price movements were
driven by the accounting-related events described. The true reasons for
fluctuations are probably never entirely explicable. In fact, the fall in
the Cable &amp; Wireless share price was at least partly due to a profits
downgrading issued by BZW on the same day as reports of the leaked draft
appeared. (It insisted the downgrading was unconnected with the draft.)
The accounting analysis itself may not always be the central issue. Market
rumours about the BZW report gave the impression that it was going to
criticise the existing earnings of the companies named, and not simply make
hypothetical projections.
The effect on the share prices of the companies concerned has since
dissipated. Other factors have helped change the price, and most have risen
again. It is unclear what the longer term effect of the accounting events
has been.
Nevertheless, it would seem that the market is adjusting to information that
it ought to have already known. BZW and Williams de Broe took figures which
are readily available in the annual reports of the companies concerned, and
simply re-arranged them. County NatWest added nothing new.
Williams Holdings was criticised by the review panel for its treatment of
exceptional items. But the divergence from accounting standards was clearly
flagged in its accounts, and the alternative method stipulated was published
directly underneath.
'In many ways the (share price) moves are surprising,' says Mr David
Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board. 'The information is
there already.'
Some suggest that whenever accounting is mentioned in public at the moment,
it is a word tainted with scandal and suspicion. Others argue that the
markets are always unpredictable in the short-term, particularly with the
current political and economic uncertainties of the UK.
In either case, the instinctive reaction of many market makers may be to
mark the stock down first when there is accounting-related news, and then
look at the information in more detail later. If the news is then judged
irrelevant or less critical than anticipated, the share price will bounce
back again.
However, these movements do seem to call into doubt the so-called 'efficient
market theory', for which there is considerable academic support. It argues
that any information once publicly available will be rapidly reflected in
the share price of a company. Hence any rearrangement of existing accounting
information should have no effect.
Goldman Sachs produced some research last May which put forward tentative
evidence for an alternative approach, known as the 'functional fixation
theory'. Decision makers, it seems, are fixated by reported earnings
figures. They associate any changes in a company's earnings with differences
in its economic performance, even when it is solely brought about by changes
in accounting practice.
There is one other possible and unpleasant factor which observers will
concede in private, shaking their heads sadly: that the quality of analysis
conducted by many of the 'City scribblers' employed by stockbrokers is not,
ahem, as good as it might be.
'You're putting me a bit in a corner,' says Mr Michael Garner, finance
director of TI. 'I have always been brought up never to criticise the
market.'
Professor Paul Marsh from the London Business School admits he is a little
puzzled by these recent share price movements, but maintains that most
evidence still points to the efficient market theory. He argues that as long
as one or two analysts fully understand the accounts, that ought to be
reflected in the share price. But he adds: 'Maybe the notes to the accounts
have a readership of six. It makes you worry.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bitter battle at the
Carnival - Rival Brazilian brewers' plans to get ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a thousand drummers start beating out the samba rhythm on Sunday,
opening Rio's Carnival parade, there will be more at stake than the usual
struggle for supremacy between samba schools in choreography, costume and
song.
This year's Carnival has become the glitter-clad battleground for a
marketing war between Brazil's two largest beer producers.
Brazil's 6bn litre annual beer market is hotly contested by two companies -
Antarctica and Brahma - each of which claims to produce the best-selling
brand. Brahma, Brazil's largest brewer, is currently ahead with 35.4 per
cent of the market for its main seller, Brahma Chopp, but Antarctica's Blue
Label is hot on its heels with 33 per cent.
Both companies are gearing up to take advantage of the five days of
extravaganza in which economic woes are forgotten, men dress up as women and
women wear very little indeed.
Brahma was the first to spot the potential of Carnival. One of its factories
lies alongside the Sambadrome where the official parades take place. When
the stadium was built in 1984, the company was given one of the best boxes
in exchange for part of its land.
Last year its marketing director decided to exploit this, inviting
personalities and ensuring that the box - and of course the brand name  -
was the focus of attention of the television cameras beaming the scene live
to 40m viewers.
'Carnival means happiness and parties, when everyone forgets recession and
misery and has a good time. That's what we want our beer to be associated
with,' explains Inga Ostrovsky, Brahma's marketing director.
But the idea proved such a success that Antarctica is copying it. Nizan
Guanaes from the company's advertising agency says: 'We've gone for the
Japanese philosophy - copy it and improve it'. He heads a team hard at work
in a flat in Ipanema, plotting how best to capitalise on the five days in
which the whole of Brazil lets its hair down.
Over the next two weeks the two companies will spend nearly Dollars 1m
(Pounds 575,000) sponsoring rival samba schools, street bands and Carnival
balls. They have also rented boxes in the Sambadrome to which they have
invited international stars to watch the 50,000 people parading.
Brazil's beer industry had traditionally kept a fairly low profile
attracting little investment until a year ago. Then, after a takeover by
Banco Garantia, Brahma announced investment plans to increase production to
4.3bn litres a year by 1993 and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.
Brahma is now one of Brazil's biggest spenders on advertising with an annual
budget of Dollars 25m, recruiting leading singer-songwriter Tom Jobim and
splashing its slogan 'Number One Beer' across buses, billboards and
magazines.
Not to be outdone, Antarctica is increasing production by 48 per cent this
year and has upped its advertising spending to Dollars 25m, running a
campaign under the slogan 'Antarctica, the Best and the First and there is
nothing more to be said'.
The battle hotted up last October when the government freed beer prices
after years of controls.
Sales fell 10 per cent last month because of recession and both companies
have fixed their sights on Carnival to boost their market-share. Each has an
eye, too, on the international potential and are hoping tourists visiting
Rio will remember the beer they drank when they return to their homes.
This year, for the two days of parades, Brahma's 'Number One' box will play
host to 350 politicians, film stars and leading society figures.
Little more than 200 metres away, Antarctica's boxes will offer a night-long
banquet followed by breakfast, with sleeping areas available for those who
cannot take the pace.
While Brahma is reticent about the names of its VIPs (though dropping
rumours of the presence of Kevin Costner and Richard Gere), Antarctica
confirms it will be playing host to singer Liza Minelli, film-Canadian model
Linda Evangelista. However, hopes that this will draw the television cameras
have been foiled. The two leading channels have agreed not to show the brand
names and they plan to give plain white T-shirts to anyone they interview.
Both brewers feel they have already had value for money. Brahma is spending
Dollars 300,000 and Antarctica Dollars 500,000 and Guanaes says: 'The idea
was to create an event the whole city is talking about and we've certainly
done that even before Carnival'.
Ostrovsky agrees: 'It's not really a war - it's a show like everything else
in Carnival and one that we're both capitalising on'.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories attack plan for regional
bodies - Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES yesterday sought to take the initiative and widen the debate
about representation in the UK regions with an attack on Labour's plans for
English regional assemblies.
They also warned that in proposing a Scottish parliament the opposition was
'playing with fire'.
While Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, defended the Tories' commitment
to the union and said Labour would 'fracture the integrity of the United
Kingdom', Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, went on the
offensive by asking the Opposition whether it would impose English regional
assemblies 'against the wishes of local people'.
Mr Heseltine said that in a later stage of Labour's plans for regional
assemblies the bodies would be allowed to vary local taxation. This was, he
claimed, 'tantamount to introducing a regional tax'.
Describing the Tories' approach as a commitment to 'good government not more
government', Mr Heseltine said Labour's proposals would create an
unnecessary and remote tier of government.
Mr Lang elaborated on Mr John Major's comments on Tuesday that in taking
stock after the general election, he would look for ways of strengthening
the union. Mr Lang said it would be strengthened by developing the UK
economy, keeping tax rates low, keeping inflation low and managing the
economy in a prudent and sensible way.
But Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused Mr Major of 'blindness' on
the issue, and denied that home rule would jeopardise the union. In a BBC
radio interview he said it was wrong to believe that the union could be
'frozen'.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, said the government had brought
'unprecedented' devolution of power to Wales, with policies such as local
management of schools and National Health Service trust hospitals.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wistful sign-off for SDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT Social Democrats have always said is that people are much more
important than politics,' Mr John Cartwright, Social Democrat MP for
Woolwich, concluded yesterday in a faintly wistful party political broadcast
last night.
Appropriately, it is only if their constituents share that 'people rather
than politics' attitude that Mr Cartwright and Mrs Rosie Barnes, the Social
Democrat MP for neighbouring Greenwich, stand any chance of re-election.
The precedents for MPs prospering without parties are not encouraging.
The SDP itself was broken in the mould of British politics, formally winding
itself up in June 1990. Its survivors, however, remain entitled to a
broadcast on the basis of the party's performance in the 1987 election.
The product of one day's facilities from the BBC and the assistance of Mr
Mike Thomas, a former SDP MP, this final appeal to the common sense of the
ordinary voter came poignantly five years almost to the day after Mrs
Barnes' by-election victory in Greenwich.
But because it is not an election broadcast, it could not urge people
explicitly to vote for the two MPs, nor even say where they are standing.
Instead, Mr Cartwright said it was made 'because we want to make it clear to
people that the ideas of social democracy are still there, still alive, and
they're still extremely relevant to Britain at the present point.'
In a quick-fire duet on the SDP's approach, the two MPs offered a serving of
the party's familiar brand of compassion and efficiency.
Of its most famous incarnation, Dr David Owen, the party's former leader who
is standing down at the election, there was no mention.
He had used a party broadcast during the Liberal Democrat conference last
autumn to call for an anti-federalist crusade.
Mr Cartwright concluded: 'A handful of Social Democrats in the House of
Commons would clearly be part of that bridgehead for common sense which most
people want to see between the two big parties.'
With just two candidates, both of whom are defending majorities of about
2,000 in London constituencies against strong Labour challenges, belief in
their ability to achieve even this is hard to square with the classic SDP
mix of heart and head.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over ERM and
inflation - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE charges that a Labour election victory would cast doubt on
sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism and lead to
higher inflation were angrily disputed in the Commons last night.
The row overshadowed predictions by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
that if the Conservatives secured a further period of office, any tax cuts
made in the budget on March 10 would be quickly cancelled out.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, warned that with a Labour
government in office Britain's annual rate of inflation would double from
the current 4.1 per cent.
He also contended that interest rates would be higher than would be
necessary under a Conservative government.
Mr Nick Brown, a Labour treasury spokesman, insisted that a Labour
government would play its 'full part' in the exchange rate mechanism.
To Labour cheers, he said: 'It is not necessary to spell out precisely which
mechanism, at which point of time, a Labour chancellor would need to use in
order to preserve our position'.
Earlier Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's shadow chief secretary, was fiercely
criticised by Conservative MPs for her response to repeated challenges to
confirm that, if necessary, a Labour government would raise interest rates
to defend sterling's position in the ERM.
She stated: 'We have long expressed the view that if the exchange rate is
properly managed there is no need to raise interest rates'.
This was dubbed a 'most extraordinary cop-out' by Mr Mellor.
Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, urged Mrs
Beckett to explain how a Labour government would tackle rising inflation
when the British economy began to recover from recession.
Mrs Beckett told him: 'You should know better than to cast doubt on the
willingness of a prospective government to maintain the exchange rate'.
A Labour attempt to condemn ministers for the the business failures, and
soaring unemployment arising from the measures needed to reduce inflation
from the high level caused by the government was defeated by 136 votes
(324-188).
At a Westminster press conference, Mr Smith likened Conservative claims that
the objective of a balanced budget was not inconsistent with increased
borrowing to finance tax cuts to a 'three card trick'.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock says party 'ready to win' -
Labour National Executive Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership yesterday defied the government to call off an April 9
general election, claiming the voters' would not forgive the Tories if they
failed to announce the ballot by the end of Budget week - a fateful Friday
March 13.
In an upbeat farewell to his national executive committee at what Labour is
certain was its last meeting before a poll, Mr Neil Kinnock claimed that the
party had never been more prepared for an election.
He went on to warn that any postponement of the election would be read by
voters as evidence of the desperation of a government that had run out of
ideas.
In a rallying call as much for the media as his colleagues, the Labour
leader told the executive: 'We are ready to run, ready to win and ready to
serve.'
Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, reiterated the warning that
the Tories would damage themselves if they delayed until later in the year.
Mr David Hill, Labour's communications director, added that in the event of
a postponment the whole focus of the pre-election campaign would switch to
the reasons behind the delay.
In the interim, Labour is planning to convene its specially constituted
joint shadow cabinet-executive group, known as the Clause Five committee,
immediately after the dissolution to approve the manifesto. The document
will then be published within the first week of the campaign.
The party's parliamentary planners are expected not to attempt to disrupt
the Budget, preferring instead to use the televised proceedings of
parliament to make its case for public expenditure in place of tax cuts.
Labour's own detailed tax and spending proposals, including a decision on
whether the removal of the ceiling on national insurance contributions will
be phased in or done at once, will only be revealed in the week after the
Budget.
An aide to Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said Labour would need some
time to analyse the Budget figures and did not want to make its announcement
when press attention was focused on rallies launching the start of the
election campaign proper.
Party officials expressed confidence that when the real campaign does get
under way, the pressure will be on Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
not Mr Kinnock whose greater experience on the hustings as a party leader
would give him a natural advantage.
The executive cleared the decks of party business yesterday by approving
candidates, recently elected by local parties, to contest a number of
hitherto vacant seats.
They included candidates for Wallasey and Nottingham East and replacements
for Mr Terry Fields, MP for Liverpool Broadgreen, and Mr Dave Nellist, MP
for Coventry South East, who were expelled from the party for their alleged
links with the proscribed Militant group.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Supergun report 'before election' -
Trade And Industry Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR protested yesterday that the government was blocking a Commons'
investigation into the Iraqi supergun affair by telling witnesses they need
not answer all MPs questions.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, wrote to the prime
minister complaining about the advice given to some witnesses by the office
of Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons.
Earlier, the cross-party trade and industry committee promised to report its
findings on the affair ahead of the general election.
Mr Kenneth Warren, Tory chairman of the committee, announced its decision
after some members had voiced fears that they would be unable to publish
their findings because of a lack of parliamentary time.
The committee, which has been investigating the affair for several months,
plans to publish a report before the dissolution of parliament. Mr Alan
Clark, the defence minister, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, the trade minister are
due to give evidence at the committee's final session today.
Downing Street Officials rejected Mr Brown's comments, saying some witnesses
had asked for guidance but had not been told what to do.
The committee accused Customs and Excise yesterday of hiding behind advice
by Sir Patrick Mayhew, attorney-general, when it refused to discuss evidence
in the supergun case.
Sir Patrick told the committee that his endorsement of the decision was made
under a convention observed with Customs and Excise although it was not
under his jurisdiction. He denied that Customs was hiding behind his advice.
Sir Brian Unwin, Customs and Excise chairman, confirmed it was his decision
to drop prosecutions in the case after the attorney-general had been
consulted. When pressed by MPs he refused to give details about evidence
that led to the decision.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Political Notebook: The silence of the Labour lambs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every tourist guide to parliament regales visitors to the Commons' with the
ancient story of the greenhorn MP voicing joy at the prospect of at last
confronting his enemies across the floor of the House.
''Eee lad,' warns a wiser colleague (this is, of course, the Labour
version), 'those across the chamber aren't your enemies, they are your
opponents.
'Your enemies are behind you.'
For month after arid month, media sensation-seekers have searched in vain
for one of Mr Neil Kinnock's enemies taking a potshot at him from Labour's
backbenches. Instead, they have encountered not the snarling jackals of old,
but the silence of Labour lambs.
There have been some tiny clearings of throats, of course.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, was reportedly not overly pleased with
his leader's indiscretions on national insurance in a Covent Garden
restaurant.
That aside, almost since the Gulf war, when a few peace-crazed firebrands
like Mr Tony Banks and Ms Clare Short resigned from their junior frontbench
jobs, all has been quiet. The longest-serving opposition leader this century
has undergone the longest period of publicly uncriticised leadership,
arguably, on record.
But is it genuine and can it last? The short answers are: 'Yes' and 'At
best, until not long after the election'.
As the contest has neared, Mr Kinnock's ruthless success at dragging his
party back to electability has created its own virtuous circle. As Labour's
opinion poll ratings have risen, so has dissent fallen to a rare mutter.
The reasons lie, in part, in the collapse of the hitherto stout party of
Labour's hard left. The Campaign group, once the bulwark of undiluted
socialism, is now a rump. Its regular Wednesday meetings attract fewer than
than two dozen backbenchers and even these are divided - if not bitterly -
over Europe, state ownership and proportional representation.
With the younger bloods largely in favour of PR and Brussels, and older
hands like Mr Bob Cryer disagreeing, there is no coherent hard left agenda.
Should Mr Kinnock form a government, the real pressure will come from the
so-called soft left, many of whose faces grace his front bench.
A minority government or a tiny majority would largely dictate a programme
that the Liberal Democrats would have the most difficulty in voting down.
For that very reason Labour is stressing its commitment to legislation for a
Scottish parliament and Freedom of Information in the first session.
Yet some articulate and influential figures on and off Labour's front bench
believe that some highly controversial matters must be confronted
immediately. One is the UK's exchange rate weighting in the Exchange Rate
Mechanism; another the way the Treasury calculates the public sector
borrowing requirement.
Mr Smith has told both the press and the City that he would resign before
tinkering with sterling's DM2.95 mean exchange rate and that devaluation
through a realignment is out of the question.
If he said anything else the shadow chancellor would risk dangerous exchange
rate turbulence even before he stepped through the door of Number 11. There
is every reason to believe him.
The problem is that some on his own side and even in the shadow cabinet will
want him to change his mind. When confronted with Smithian obduracy they
reply, in the words of Mandy Rice-Davies: 'Well, he would say that, wouldn't
he?'
On the PSBR, Mr Smith is merely silent. Earlier this month Mr Clive Soley,
Labour's housing spokesman, was firmly slapped down for suggesting that
local authorities should be able to spend some of their capital from council
house sales without public spending repercussions.
Similar views are understood to be held by the champions of local authority
bonds.
An unofficial grouping of influential figures are now determined to press
for thorough-going reform of PSBR accounting, modelled on less stringent
European practice, just as soon as Labour takes office.
With an election still to be won, Mr Kinnock must be praying that he may
soon be forced to confront such problems. But he might also care to chew
over another old political adage: 'Do not worry about your enemies, but
beware of your friends.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Beith warning on minority rule -
Liberal Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats have stepped up their attempts to force a coalition
government in the event of a hung parliament by warning of the economic
damage a minority government would inflict on Britain.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, yesterday said a Labour
or Tory government, unable to command a parliamentary majority and
struggling to survive before calling a second general election, was 'a
recipe for economic chaos and damage'.
A coalition government, with an agreed programme of government, could help
stabilise prices, Mr Beith said. During the pact between the Liberal and
Labour parties in 1977-78, inflation fell from 21 per cent to 7 per cent, he
added.
Liberal Democrats know the two main parties will not willingly agree a
post-election deal - largely because of insistence on electoral reform as a
pre-condition for support. So they are anxious to increase the moral
pressure on Labour and the Tories to form a coalition.
The party has been encouraged by a report by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
securities house, which said that the worst outcome of the election would be
'a lame minority government which, eschewing formal pacts, limped along in a
policy vacuum'.
P &amp; D praised the Liberal Democrat economic policies as the 'most logically
argued and the most sensibly radical'.
It added: 'For economic performance, the better outcome would involve power
sharing in which the Liberal Democrats pressed home their economic programme
 -bringing out the best features of the Conservatives' policies or limiting
the possible damage of Labour's'
The Liberal Democrats will emphasise at a defence policy launch today that
their past target of a 50 per cent cut in defence spending by 2000 is only
an aspiration, and depends on a thorough review of the UK's defence needs.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Leeds Tec cuts training places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCTIONS of up to 22 per cent in the number of training places for the
long-term unemployed are being made by Leeds Training and Enterprise
Council, Lisa Wood writes.
The cuts, at a time of rising long-term unemployment in the area, are
because of government reductions in funding for Employment Training (ET),
the main scheme for the long-term jobless. In 1992-93 total ET funding is
being cut by Pounds 60m in real terms.
Tecs have been engaged in tough negotiations with the Department of
Employment over their budgets for both ET and Youth Training, the scheme for
people aged 16 to 18. Leeds is one of the first Tecs to announce the results
of its negotiations.
Mr John Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Tec, said he had bid for 2,400
places this year and the Employment Department had made a final offer of
1,880. His Tec was concerned by both the cut in numbers and the government
tying payment to the achievement of a high number of qualifications.
The department said the difference between the number of places Leeds Tec
wanted and the number it received was not typical of Tecs at large.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Poll tax 'to rise 11.7%'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE poll tax for England next year will rise 11.7 per cent from
Pounds 251 to Pounds 280, according to a survey today.
The study, carried out for BBC radio by the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, also found that the average bill in England and
Wales would include Pounds 20 in 'other adjustments' arising largely from
non-collection of the charge in 1991-92.
Most district councils and about half the metropolitan authorities and
London boroughs have set recommended poll tax levels, but not all of those
recommended have been approved by councils.
Labour said last night the Tories would pay a heavy price at the election
for their poll tax 'incompetence', but the government said the average
figure for England would exceed the target poll tax of Pounds 257 by only a
small margin.
The poll tax in Wales is due to increase by 24 per cent from Pounds 121 to
Pounds 150.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Low bidder dropped from BTG contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has ruled out one of the three short-listed bidders for
British Technology Group, the state-owned technology transfer organisation.
It may make a provisional choice between the two remaining consortia today,
though an announcement is unlikely until next week.
Technology Marketing Corporation, a company formed to bid for BTG by
Strategy International, a London-based consultancy, was told yesterday that
its bid was too low. It is believed to have offered only about Pounds 13m.
The two consortia still in the contest - one led by BTG management and the
other by Research Corporation Technologies of the US with Mr John Ashworth,
director of the London School of Economics - are understood to have
submitted bids well below the Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m valuation
unofficially put on BTG when the controversial privatisation process started
last year.
Price Waterhouse, the government's financial adviser, was locked in
negotiations with both groups yesterday. The final composition of the
winning consortium is unlikely to be settled until the last moment.

FT  27 FEB 92 / FT Conference (International Banking): Wave of European
mergers forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAVE of mergers is likely to sweep the banking and insurance sectors of
several European countries with the onset of the single European market, a
conference in London on international banking was told yesterday.
Mr Jurgen Lemmer, deputy member of the board of managing directors of
Commerzbank, said mergers in Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia
had already changed the list of the biggest banks in those countries.
'Up to now the banking industry has not produced any institutions with a
prominent position through Europe as a whole. The market share of the
largest, Credit Agricole or Deutsche Bank, is barely more than 2 per cent.
By contrast the largest carmakers, Volkswagen and Fiat, each account for
about 15 per cent of the western European market,' Mr Lemmer said.
Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of BZW, the securities and investment arm of
Barclays Bank, said he believed that the rules and system of regulation
governing investment banking were adequate.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): TUC estimates membership is down by
only 5 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERSHIP of unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress fell by between
5 per cent and 5.5 per cent last year, according to a confidential survey
carried out by Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary.
The estimate, disclosed to members of the TUC general council yesterday,
suggests that the recession has had a less serious impact on membership than
was previously believed.
Nonetheless the decline, and continued losses expected this year, was severe
enough to persuade the general council to agree proposals for a 20 per cent
cut in the TUC wage bill and a rationalisation of departments. A reduction
of 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in 1991 would be similar to the fall of 1990
when membership fell from 8.65m to 8.19m. It would mean a further reduction
of 400,000 members to about 7.8m. That compares with 12.12m in 1979.
Two unions - the AEU engineers and the FTAT furniture workers' union - have
recently reported a 10 per cent decline in membership. Some public service
unions, however, including Nalgo, have in-creased membership.
The general council was told that without remedial action the 5 per cent
decline would lead to a loss of Pounds 250,000 this year and Pounds 1m next.
Mr Willis won support for a 20 per cent cut in the wage bill, or Pounds 1m
in the full year, with changes in top staff posts and a cut in the number of
departments and regional offices.
The TUC superannuation management committee has already agreed an early
retirement package for people aged 50 and over. It also has plans for a
Pounds 500,000 voluntary severance scheme that would provide one month's pay
for each year of service.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Abbey launches Pounds 60m mortgage rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the retail banking group which is the UK's second largest
mortgage lender, has launched a Pounds 60m mortgage rescue scheme aimed at
saving 1,000 of its customers from eviction.
The scheme will operate through a new company called Homesave, which Abbey
National has set up. It will buy the homes of customers who have jobs but
are substantially in arrears with mortgage payments.
Home owners will remain in the property and become tenants of Abbey
National. This will be on a short tenancy basis, initially for six months
and a day. The scheme is being operated throughout England and Wales.
Rent will be set at market levels.
Before entering the scheme likely candidates will be visited by Abbey
National branch staff. They will also have to obtain independent legal
advice, for which Abbey National will advance up to Pounds 150 where
neces-sary.
The bank will start a review of arrears cases before contacting those for
whom the scheme may be suitable.
The review should be complete by the end of next month.

FT  27 FEB 92 / London's voluntary groups see funds fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL financial support for London's voluntary sector has declined at a
time of growing need, research conducted for the capital's statutory
grant-making body has concluded, Alan Pike writes.
A survey of 27 of the 33 London borough councils showed funding for
voluntary groups fell from Pounds 141m in 1990-91 to Pounds 127m in 1991-92.
Only seven boroughs maintained their financial support in real terms. In
inner London - where many of the capital's social problems are concentrated
 -reductions in spending were more than twice as great as in outer boroughs.
The research was conducted by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry on
behalf of the London Boroughs Grants Committee, which makes grants to
voluntary organisations operating in more than one borough.
Mr Serge Lourie, a Liberal Democrat councillor who chairs the committee,
said the research showed a 'critical' situation in which funding could not
keep up with needs.
He said: 'Our concern is that the disintegration of our social fabric
threatens London's future prosperity.'
The research is the latest in a series of studies showing that, in spite of
government pressure for voluntary organisations to take on additional
duties, the sector's financial difficulties are worsening.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Assumptions about debt challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VIEW that personal financial difficulties are caused by high-spending
and reckless borrowing is challenged by a Policy Studies Institute study.
Ms Elaine Kempson, who produced the report with Mr Richard Berthoud, said
the main causes of difficulties with debt were changes in circumstances such
as divorce, unemployment or the failure of a small business.
The survey found that age, numbers of children and income all related to a
household's debt risk and any combination of two of these factors raised the
risk to a high level. Young people with children and low incomes had the
greatest tendency to be in difficulties.
The report said: 'Low income led to indebtedness through the week-to-week
budgeting problems it caused, rather than because poor people persisted in
buying goods they could not afford.'
The authors called for financial assistance for poorer families and for much
greater advice and information for borrowers.
Ms Kempson also urged creditors to take a more flexible line in times of
difficulties. 'There is the assumption that people will pay up if you lean
on them hard enough,' she said.
The survey, conducted in 1989, does not reflect the recession. It shows
that, at that time, one in eight households had difficulties with debts,
with 150,000 having a 'very serious problem'. Consumer debt then totalled
Pounds 50bn.
The researchers estimated that the number of people owing money to three or
more creditors increased from 130,000 in 1981 to 530,000 in 1989. Those in
the north-west and south-east of England and Northern Ireland were more
likely to be in debt than those in other parts of the UK.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Civil servants plan to challenge pay
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PERFORMANCE pay system for top civil servants could face a legal challenge
which, if successful, would affect the way performance pay is introduced for
the rest of the Civil Service.
The government wants performance pay to be a part of this year's annual pay
review for all 500,000 non-industrial civil servants.
The FDA civil servants' union plans a legal challenge to the performance pay
system for the top 24,000 civil servants on grounds of sex discrimination.
This scheme has operated since 1988 and elements of it are likely to be
copied for the rest of the Civil Service.
The union, with support from the Equal Opportunities Commission, is seeking
legal advice on whether the pay system is in breach of European law.
The union says the fact that 42 per cent of men and only 24 per cent of
women received performance awards shows that the system is discriminatory.
It blames the importance of seniority in the performance system and says
that women, who often break their careers to have children, do not stand a
fair chance of getting performance awards.
The FDA, which may claim extra pay for the women who are said to have been
discriminated against, is basing its argument on the Nimz case before the
European Court. It was argued in that case that employers had to justify the
use of seniority in performance pay or they could be in contravention of the
equal pay aspects of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome.
The Treasury, which oversees Civil Service pay, is also understood to be
seeking legal advice. It said yesterday it believed the pay system to be
working well and was confident that it breached neither UK nor European law.
The FDA is also unhappy about the extent of management discretion in the
performance system.
Bifu, the financial services union, is urging members at Barclays Bank to
vote for industrial action over a pay offer.
It wants its members in the bank to stage a series of one-day strikes over
the bank's proposed package, which would add between 2.5 per cent and 4 per
cent to the salaries of non-managerial staff.
The Barclays talks are likely to influence pay talks in many other financial
services companies.

FT  27 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: Good vibrations in Birmingham, but who
will help Rhondda? - Michael Cassell travels westwards on his pre-election
trip around the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS stream from the Peugeot-Talbot works at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, where the
god of higher productivity has just demanded shorter tea-breaks, to hear
their car radios announce that Britain has the lowest strike rate in Europe.
'Hardly surprising, given the state the country's in,' retorts Duncan
Simpson, divisional organiser for the AEU engineering union.
A former convener at the Coventry plant when Chrysler was the boss and a
show of hands emptied the place faster than the fire alarm, Simpson does not
praise the Tories for the nation's strike performance. 'What workers are
going to stick their necks out now? It doesn't mean it's all sweetness and
light.'
The truce, however, is not just because of the long shadow of unemployment.
There is an underlying consensus in the modern world of industrial
relations, where corners are still hard fought but where studied realism
takes precedence over gut reaction.
Simpson concedes some ground: 'I don't want to see pre-strike ballots go.
They were intended to help the employer but have often strengthened our
negotiating position as well. We think more strategically. The law made us.
'The days of wildcat strikes and wildcat management have gone. There is a
more disciplined approach to labour relations and better communications all
round. That's welcome.'
But while Simpson still sees the last decade as generally harmful for a
unionised workforce down from 12m to 8m, Tom Cannon praises a decade which
put trade unions in their place.
Cannon is managing director of BSG Group, selling everything from cars to
aircraft lavatory cubicles from its headquarters at Yardley, close to
Birmingham's centre.
Like many of the city's businessmen, the 1980s were kind to him. He earns a
high salary which Labour intends to cut, and lives in desirable Dorridge, a
seriously wealthy neighbourhood sprinkled with incongruous Brummie accents.
To Cannon, Mrs Thatcher and her labour laws were unalloyed good news. 'She
displayed an extraordinary, single-minded determination to break the power
of organised labour. She handed back to management the right to manage. She
also read the riot act to management, much of which was feudalistic and
asked for trouble.'
Cannon also believes people's pride in their own abilities has been
restored. 'They realise the only way to get money is by working for it and
not by queuing up at the post office counter.'
He says there was far too much easy credit in the 1980s. 'Lots got their
fingers burned but they've learned the lesson and won't repeat the same
mistakes again.'
Some never succumbed to the seductive blandishments of the money-lenders,
says Amrik Sahota, chairman of the Institute of Asian Businesses. 'My
members' attitudes towards debt have not changed. Few ever contemplate
spending more than they can afford.'
Sahota says the 1980s were good for Asian entrepreneurs but he is irritated
that the advances made by the Asian business community are underestimated.
'People still think of us as just running the corner shop but we have member
companies in steel and construction with annual turnovers above Pounds 25m.'
The Punjabi Paradise in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, a shabby, unchanging part
of Birmingham overlooked by the commercial and artistic renaissance at its
core, will need to shift a lot of baltis with black-eyed beans to compete
with that.
Don Harriman, an electrician from nearby Shirley - 'home of Mandy Rice
Davies' - is buying Friday-night dinner for his family. 'Eating out is part
of our life now, even if it's cheap and cheerful,' he says.
Harriman says his family have 'moved on and up' and he won't be voting
Labour because he suspects they might stop him going any further.
A lot of people like the Harrimans are doing things they never dreamed about
a decade ago. Shirley Hamilton runs her own high-tech business on Aston
Science Park. A former Midlands Businesswoman of the Year, she bit the
entrepreneurial bullet in 1984 and set up Tech-ni-Plant, a surface treatment
specialist with customers worldwide.
She has eight staff, a fast, red sports saloon and has already made it to a
Downing Street reception. 'I always expected to be an employee. But
conditions were created which made it easier for businesses to start.
British industry remains, however, very half-hearted in its attitude to
innovation and new technology.'
Dr Carl Chinn, two years on the dole before picking up his Pounds 40-a-week
enterprise allowance as a self-employed historian, says many people made a
great deal of headway in the 1980s.
With his broad, Black Country twang and matey warmth, he is now Birmingham
University's community historian. A chirpy Chinn dismisses talk of the
'selfish' decade: 'If you want to think of owning your own home and car and
treating your family to holidays and meals out as selfish, then you can. But
it was really a period in which many working-class people achieved what had
previously been denied them.'
He recognises there were many losers. 'The 1980s will be compared to the
30s. For people in work they were good, but those at the bottom suffered.'
Some of that suffering, heightened rather than healed during the last
decade, is most obvious a couple of hours' drive away, beyond the Brecon
Beacons. In the Welsh valleys a sense of alienation thrives. Antagonism
towards Westminster and the priorities and policies it spawns still runs as
deep as the old Lewis Merthyr pit.
'Mrs Thatcher did for south Wales what Stalin did for Russia,' says Graham
Davies, a Welsh coalfields community campaigner not prone to understatement.
The pits which once warmed the world and employed more than a  1/4 m men
have all but gone. The last lump of coal from the last pit in the Rhondda
Valley was mined more than a year ago and mines like Maerdy and Ynysybwl are
props in a heritage industry employing more people than there are miners.
The Treforest School of Mines has changed its rather pointless name.
Davies says the people of the valleys had their jobs, pride and confidence
removed by 'market forces which had no interest in providing something in
their place'. The sense of waste, he stresses, is destructive.
Canon Bill Morgan, Merthyr Tydfil's new rector, takes time off from
arranging Amanda Kelleher's wedding to suggest his job at least is secure.
'I'm all right. Priests are a scarce commodity and there's no shortage of
work in places like this.'
He likens the position of local people to families suffering a bereavement.
'There are high levels of unhappiness, tension, frustration and anger. If I
failed to take a bereavement seriously, I would be shown the door. The
government can expect the same fate.'
Morgan says that, faced with traumatic change, local authorities had
demonstrated all the ingenuity, inventiveness and courageousness which Mrs
Thatcher so admired 'but she was hell-bent on clobbering them'. Since Mr
Major's arrival, he says, the plight of south Wales has deteriorated
further.
But there is rebirth as well as death. Scarred hillsides are going and the
'black diamond' of the Rhondda is again turning green, courtesy of the Welsh
Development Agency, which last year helped to attract Pounds 860m of inward
investment to the country.
Even so, valley towns like Merthyr Tydfil, where Keir Hardie cut his teeth
as the first Labour MP, find it hard to attract the sexy, Japanese investors
moving in along the coast.
Through Treherbert, Treorchy and Tonypandy, settlements of miners' cottages,
nonconformist chapels and workmen's institutes fight to keep up with change.
Here at least, the battle between old and new Britain seems like an unequal
struggle.
At the Treherbert discount furniture centre, Alun Parry, a former miner who
now drives daily to work in Cardiff, wants to replace the bed he was born in
52 years ago. 'The bottom fell out. Bit like this place really. I can buy
another bed but can anyone get this place moving again?'

FT  27 FEB 92 / National Institute Economic Review: Productivity 22% below
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN manufacturing productivity was about 22 per cent higher than that in
the UK in 1987, considerably less than previous estimates of a 40 per cent
productivity gap, according to a National Institute study of British and
German productivity between 1968 and 1987.
The productivity gap widened sharply in the 1970s, reaching a peak of 50 per
cent in 1980, but narrowed rapidly so that by 1987 the productivity gap was
slightly lower than in the late 1960s. The much greater capital intensity of
German industry accounts for 'a significant proportion' of the gap.
The German productivity advantage was most pronounced in non-electrical
engineering, vehicles and metals, and highest in paper and board. The
British performance was better in food, drink, tobacco and textiles.
Productivity levels were about equal in chemicals and electrical
engineering.
The main cause of the UK gain in the 1980s was the shedding many jobs.
'German manufacturing increased its output by about 40 per cent but
decreased its employment by 600,000 workers, or 7 per cent, between 1968 and
1987 the institute said. On the other hand, UK manufacturing output
increased by a little over 10 per cent, but the reduction in employment was
3m workers, or 37 per cent, over the same period.'
Restrictive practices in both the sale of goods and the labour market help
explain why Britain failed to even begin gaining on German productivity
levels in the 1970s.
One of the underlying causes of the continued gap is the fact that the ratio
of capital to labour was 38 per cent higher in German manufacturing in 1987.
In 1990 and last year the productivity gap with Germany widened slightly. In
the longer run, the institute concludes, reducing the disparity in levels of
capital is crucial.

FT  27 FEB 92 / National Institute Economic Review: Further 300,000 job
losses forecast by 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK faces more than 300,000 further job losses in the next 22 months, the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research says.
The institute, a leading economic think-tank, forecasts in its quarterly
review published yesterday that the jobless total will increase to 2.92m by
the end of next year and stay around 2m for the rest of the decade.
A more cheerful conclusion is that a limited recovery from the recession is
likely in the second half of this year, with gross domestic product set to
increase 1.3 per cent after a 2.6 per cent fall last year. The institute
expects growth of 2.7 per cent next year.
In its assessment of options in the March 10 Budget the institute advises Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to put a boost for investment ahead of
proposals to cut income tax.
Support for companies' capital-spending plans would help UK productivity to
catch up with levels overseas. A tax cut would act mainly to stimulate
consumer spending, which the institute says would be 'not ideal' as a method
of speeding up the recovery.
The economic revival is likely to be held back by a further fall in
investment this year, and by an upturn in the housing market that will be
limited.
The institute believes Mr Lamont will inject Pounds 2bn into the economy by
taking 1p off the standard income-tax rate. A stimulus of this kind would
push the public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 22.2bn in 1992-93,
and Pounds 21.6bn the following year. In both cases this amounts to about
3.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
The institute warns that any effort beyond such a relatively modest cut in
personal taxation to boost spending by consumers could increase inflation.
In spite of a slowdown in the past year, inflation is still not 'safely in
line' with levels in France and Germany. As a result 'Britain cannot afford
a really rapid recovery'.
The institute says the retail prices index will continue to show only small
year-on-year changes for some time. It reckons this will be 3.4 per cent at
the end of this year and 3.5 per cent at the end of next year.
Among the main factors increasing UK growth this year will be the Pounds
11bn additional pubic spending for 1992-93 announced by the Treasury last
November. The UK's ability to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy
will be limited, however, by the need to keep sterling in its band in the
European exchange rate mechanism. That will restrict annual growth and keep
unemployment high.
The institute reckons the jobless total will climb to 2.83m by the end of
this year from 2.6m in January. The figure has risen by about 1m since March
1990.
The institute hints that the UK monetary authorities should take action to
damp erratic movements in credit to consumers and industry. Loans to these
groups jumped in the mid to late 1980s, fuelling the 1986-88 boom, and have
contracted sharply during the recession.
'A more cautious lending policy by the banking system can be expected in the
light of recent experiences - and should be welcomed as more conducive to
macroeconomic stability,' it says.
Exports are expected to grow by 2.8 per cent this year compared with 1 per
cent in 1991, helping the UK's growth prospects. The good performance by
exporters may be partly because of a recovery in world trade, which is
likely to grow by 4.4 per cent this year after 1.1 per cent last year.
Any larger increase in world trade will be prevented by relatively slow
expansion in the world economy. Growth in gross domestic product in the
seven biggest industrialised economies - the US, Japan, Germany, Italy,
France, Canada and Britain - will be 1.9 per cent in this year, after 0.9
per cent last year and 2.4 per cent in 1990.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Rival to BT and Mercury seeks licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL NETWORK, the private UK telecommunications operator, has applied
for a full international and domestic telecommunications licence in
competition with BT and Mercury Communications.
The group, which offers a telephone service over the Post Office's internal
network, is one of about 20 companies which have lodged licence applications
with the Department of Trade and Industry following last year's white paper
liberalising the market.
The variety of services the applicants propose to provide seems to support
the government's contention that its policy has unleashed innovation. Apart
from National Network and a similar application from Sprint, the US group,
applicants are avoiding a head-on clash with BT and Mercury and focusing on
niche markets instead.
Mr Michael Davies, National Network's chairman and majority shareholder,
said the DTI was in 'a very advanced stage of drafting' his company's
domestic licence.
The application for an international licence is likely to be more
controversial, as the government has made clear that it is not encouraging
full international network competition with BT and Mercury at this stage.
Similar considerations are holding up Sprint's international licence
application.
Mr Davies said National Network planned to form strategic alliances with
other groups to raise funds to build a network. Initially it would
concentrate on business customers, linking their premises to a backbone
national network with microwave or other radio links.
The government has recently awarded licences to British Aerospace
Communications and US-based Alpha Lyracom to provide international satellite
services; to Ionica, a private UK group, to provide residential phone
services over radio links; and to four groups to supply data communications
services by radio.
Other companies which have applied for licences include Millicom, World
Communications and ACC, all of which are north American groups.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Impressionists perk up at modest prices: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET for Impressionist and Modern art priced below Dollars 500,000
seems to have turned the corner. Both Sotheby's and Christie's held
successful auctions in New York on Tuesday, with Sotheby's bringing in
Dollars 3.1m (Pounds 1.77m) with just 12 per cent unsold and Christie's
Dollars 2.6m with 10 per cent unsold.
The auction houses had persuaded sellers to put realistically modest
reserves on the works and bidding, particularly from private buyers, was
brisk.
The top price was Dollars 286,000 (slightly below estimate) which secured
Chagall's 'Bouquet de Bleuets' at Sotheby's. In the same rooms 'Vue de
Montmartre' by Soutine sold for Dollars 275,000 while a Montmartre scene by
Utrillo realised Dollars 187,000.
At Christie's a bronze head of a bull by Picasso, cast in 1950 as one of an
edition of two, doubled its estimate at Dollars 231,000 and 'Cavallini',
ghost-like horses by Zoran Music, made Dollars 115,000.
The firmer market was also shown in London, where Christie's held its most
successful auction of watercolours and pictures of birds since this sale
category was started in 1989. 'Clearing After Rain: Red Grouse among the
Heather' by Archibald Thorburn sold for Pounds 44,000 to a private buyer.
All the seven top lots were by Thorburn, with three going to Italian
collectors. The auction totalled Pounds 507,551 with 21 per cent unsold.
An auction record price for a block of stamps from the Transvaal was paid at
Christie's when a group of 6d ultramarine, printed in 1870, sold for Pounds
13,200. One stamp had been inadvertently printed upside-down. Only five such
examples are known and the other four are in museum collections, including
that of the Queen.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Scargill allegation is denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday denied allegations by the National Union of
Mineworkers that it was planning to suspend payments into its pension fund.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the union, said the money saved from such a
'holiday' would make British Coal's accounts look artificially good.
He said in a letter to Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social
security committee, that he believed British Coal would use the large
surplus in its pension fund to pay for a 'holiday', during which it would
make no more contributions to miners' pensions.
Mr Scargill added that British Coal had taken such a 'holiday' in 1989.
According to Mr Scargill the fund now has an actuarial surplus of Pounds
1,450m.
He told Mr Field: 'We have now been informed that British Coal is insisting
on a substantial slice of this surplus in the form of another contribution
holiday.
'If it is allowed to take it, this means that British Coal will have paid no
contributions at all over the 10-year period from 1989 to 1999, while miners
continue to pay their contributions.'
British Coal said it had not yet received the actuarial report on the
miners' pension fund. It had not decided how any surplus should be used.
The European Commission has approved a Pounds 124.2m aid package for
Britain's coal-mining areas. The package had been blocked by the commission
pending government guarantees that the cash was being properly used.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Paternoster developers baffled by Heseltine's 'new
initiative': The latest twist to one of London's longest and most sensitive
planning controversies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER CHAPTER has been opened in one of London's longest and most
sensitive planning controversies.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, took planners and developers by
surprise on Tuesday when he announced a 'new initiative' for the square
beside St Paul's Cathedral. He described the square as 'one of the nation's
most important sites'.
It is the latest twist in an argument that has raged for more than five
years about what should replace the bleak, windswept 1950s office blocks.
A modernist design for the square was proposed in 1987 but was shelved after
the Prince of Wales described the competition that produced it as 'deeply
depressing' and 'demoralising'.
Mr Heseltine has called in planning applications by Paternoster Associates,
the consortium developing Paternoster Square, and Nuclear Electric, which is
developing the adjacent Sudbury House. This suggests that the future of the
square will be the subject of a public inquiry at the end of the summer. He
has also called for a master plan covering the area north of St Paul's to
guide development.
Mr Heseltine's announcement hinted at his dissatisfaction with the proposed
neo-classical design. The plans for 630,000 sq ft of office space and more
than 80 shops and restaurants attempt to restore the pattern of streets and
lanes that existed before the area was destroyed in the blitz.
He warned that the applications would be judged 'against the high standards
I consider to be appropriate for this site and the need for the area to be
developed coherently'.
His decision to intervene in the planning process baffled the developers and
the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City. All believed
that negotiations over planning permission were close to agreement.
One observer said: 'Why should a government facing an election want to take
on a battle that is already resolved?'
The corporation barely concealed its annoyance. Mr Tom Jackson, chairman of
the planning and communications committee, hoped that 'this already lengthy
process will not be unduly prolonged by the decision to call in these
applications, nor by an enforced return to an empty drawing board'.
The request for a master plan was also greeted without enthusiasm by the
corporation, which believes that agreement is more likely to be reached if
developers take the initiative.
Speculation about the reasons behind Mr Heseltine's decision included that
he mistakenly believed negotiations over planning permission had become
bogged down after the corporation lodged 22 objections to the plan in
December. His decision to ask for a master plan could be interpreted as an
attempt to find a consensus, said one of those involved in the development.
A more common view is that Mr Heseltine wishes to see a more ambitious,
modernist scheme on the site. His decision to intervene in the planning
process, which followed an informal visit to the site a week ago, was
described by the Department of the Environment as 'genuinely personal'.
The suggestion that his decision was a matter of architectural taste is
controversial. 'No one, whether an official or an elected representative has
a right to impose their taste on the planning process,' said a planning
expert.
If Mr Heseltine has taken a dislike to the proposed scheme, he is not alone.
Its neo-classical style was panned by many critics who disliked the bulk of
the buildings and their design, which they said was reminiscent of dolls'
houses. But the plans were warmly received by the public.
Gallup, the research company, reported 'an exceptionally positive response
among the public to the proposed scheme'.
Support for the proposals and the progress made by the developers in meeting
the objections of the City planners raise the possibility of a public
inquiry finding in favour of the proposals. But it is possible that the
developers will withdraw their plans in the hope of a change of leadership
at the Department of the Environment after the election.
The uncertainties surrounding the site are exacerbated by the depressed
state of the property market. The market has turned down sharply since
November 1989 when Paternoster Associates, a partnership between Greycoat, a
UK developer, Park Tower Group of New York and an affiliate of Mitsubishi
Estate Company of Japan, paid Pounds 160m for the site. Until the market
recovers, the scheme is not viable.
Greycoat has already written off its stake in the project. It is hard to
rule out the possibility that Mitsubishi Estates, the main financial backer,
could pull out. The unloved concrete slabs on the site could yet receive a
new lease of life.

FT  27 FEB 92 / BTR chief attacks attitude of institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England and the Institutional Shareholders' Committee were
'doing a disservice to investors by encouraging them to think of themselves
as owners' Sir Owen Green, chairman of the conglomerate BTR, said yesterday,
Barry Riley writes.
Speaking at the annual investment conference of the National Association of
Pension Funds in Eastbourne, he robustly attacked institutional investors'
attitudes to corporate governance.
Debating with Mr Mike Sandland, committee chairman, he denounced concepts
such as audit committees and independent non-executive directors. 'The word
independence sticks in my gullet,' said Sir Owen. 'I don't think there is
very much wrong with corporate governance as it stands.' There might be a
problem with institutional investors growing so large that they could not
easily sell investments in companies they did not like. But that was a
fiscal problem rather than one of corporate governance.
Mr Sandland, an investment manager with Norwich Union, said shareholders
should assume the responsibilities of ownership. Institutional investors
should show their commitment by playing a full role as active shareholders.
Sir Owen said shareholders would be better regarded as freeholder landlords
than owners of public companies. 'It is different in concept from the
ownership of goods and chattels,' he insisted.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Water sector to spend Pounds 30bn over 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WATER industry is expected to spend Pounds 30bn in the next 10 years
providing construction companies, civil engineers and process plant
manufacturers with their biggest bonanza since the development of North Sea
Oil, according to a report published today by the National Economic
Development Council.
The water industry is one of the few areas of construction where investment
is increasing, according to contractors which are suffering badly as a
result of falling demand for commercial, industrial and residential
property.
The council said the recession in other areas of the construction market
meant that contractors' prices had fallen, enabling water companies to get
better value for money and complete investment programmes below targeted
prices. It urged water companies to bring projects forward to take advantage
of lower prices.
The report by the council's construction industry sector group said spending
by water companies in England and Wales had risen by 40 per cent in 1990-91
to Pounds 2.48bn and was expected to have increased to Pounds 2.78bn in
1991-92.
It said that contrary to some opinions the large spenders, the water
services companies, were on target to meet their projected expenditure
programmes and that suppliers and contractors were meeting demands with few
bottlenecks.
Privatisation of the industry in England and Wales meant it was no longer
fettered by public sector spending restrictions.
The report said European Community requirements to improve water quality
meant companies would not be able to delay investment programmes for which
finance was already largely assured.
It criticised companies, however, for failing to invest sufficient funds in
research and development compared with competitors.
Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez of France spent Pounds 20m on research and
development in 1990-91, almost equal to the total amount spent by the 10
privatised water services companies and nearly five times that of the
largest investor, Thames Water Utilities.
There was also a danger of imports being sucked in, particularly from the
Far East, as lead times and prices for some products increased.
The report said the water supply industry, its contractors and manufacturers
should use the UK as a spring-board to break into world markets.
Capital spending on water by OECD and some Middle Eastern countries was
estimated at Dollars 74bn in 1989 compared with Dollars 3bn in England and
Wales over about the same period.
Pressure to improve water services in developed countries was growing. New
water regulations in the US included 38 new drinking water standards. This
had led US utilities to increase prices to fund necessary capital
invest-ment.
The report said that large integrated French companies previously had been
particularly successful at breaking into export markets.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Premiers urge resumption of Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British and Irish prime ministers sought last night to smooth over any
differences between the two governments on the future of Northern Ireland
and urged the early resumption of 'round-table' talks in the province.
Mr John Major said he hoped talks would start 'as speedily as possible'  -
in spite of the proximity of the UK general election.
Although Unionist and nationalist leaders are expected to meet today or
tomorrow, there has been no sign so far that they are any closer to
overcoming the obstacles that have blocked the resumption of talks which
collapsed last July.
Mr Major's comments came after talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the new Irish
prime minister, in Downing Street.
Mr Major promised to use 'every legitimate means' to end the 'carnage' of
Northern Ireland.
Mr Reynolds suggested that a review of the act which led to the partition of
the island should be part of any formal negotiations.
That would balance Unionist demands for removal of the republic's
constitutional claim on the north, but has already been attacked by the Rev
Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party.
Mr Major said the two leaders had 'touched on many sensitive matters like
that'.
Both leaders reiterated their commitment to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,
which states that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a
majority of its population so wishes.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Civil servants alarmed by tendering drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT and speed of a review of prospects for putting more Civil Service
work out to competitive tender, and the possibility of conflicts of
interests on the part of management consultants carrying it out, is worrying
Whitehall.
The FDA senior civil servants' union said its members were 'seriously
worried' about the use of consultants.
It was concerned at the procedures for hiring them and that the timescale
was too hasty.
A white paper last November revealed the government's intention to identify
more opportunities for putting work out to competitive tender. Departments
and executive agencies were to be set annual 'market testing' targets,
starting this year.
The Treasury unit responsible for the targets is believed to have urged
departments to use private firms and consultants to investigate the
potential for market testing. It has given them until the end of next month
 -a week before the most likely election date - to report, so that targets
can be set.
An internal Department of Social Security memorandum states: 'Departments
are required to use private firms or consultants to look at work being
performed by their staff.'
The DSS has appointed Price Waterhouse to evaluate areas of its work to be
put out to tender.
It is not known how many companies have been engaged, but about half of all
government departments are understood to have appointed management
consultants to draw up targets for market testing. Other departments have
asked private sector procurement experts to advise them, or plan to put
their own proposals for market testing to private sector panels.
It was also feared that consultants engaged to advise government departments
might have private sector clients capable of bidding for the work, causing
potential conflict of interest.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, FDA general secretary, said: 'It is extraordinary for a
government to be acting in this way only days before a general election. We
know nothing of safeguards against a conflict of interest.'
The work will generate welcome additional fee income for hard-pressed
consultancies, but is unlikely to provide a bonanza. Most will have only
five or six weeks to complete the initial work of helping to decide which
departmental services might be suitable for market testing.
Nevertheless the management consultants could be offered additional work
once it was decided to put services out to competitive tender. This could
include writing the terms and conditions of an invitation to tender,
evaluating tenders and perhaps helping internal candidates prepare their
bids.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY RAMSDEN, former chairman of Glen International, an investment firm
which collapsed in 1987 with losses of Pounds 142m, has been granted legal
aid for his defence against criminal charges.
City of London magistrates yesterday said a contribution by Mr Ramsden of
Pounds 25,000, assessed by the court's legal aid officer, would not become
payable until the end of the criminal proceedings.
Mr Ramsden was remanded on Pounds 150,000 bail until April 29. Mr Michael
Drury, for the Serious Fraud Office, told the magistrates that by this time
proceedings for transfer of the case to the crown court would have taken
place. The magistrates altered Mr Ramsden's bail conditions to allow him to
report to Fulham police once a week instead of daily.
A condition that he must have no contact with a list of people was amended
to permit contact through his solicitors.
It was Mr Ramsden's second court appearance since his voluntary return to
the UK two weeks ago after waiving his right to contest proceedings for his
extradition from the US.
The 22 charges against him include allegations of fraudulent trading,
obtaining property by deception, dishonestly inducing creditors to wait for
payment, false accounting and making deceptive statements to investors.

THE GOVERNMENT was accused yesterday of selling the taxpayer short in the
flotation of the water companies two years ago, and of over-paying its
advisers 'in what amounted to quite a gravy train'.
Sir Terence Heiser, permanent secretary at the environment department, faced
angry accusations from Labour members of the Commons public accounts
committee of indulging in a headlong rush to sell off the 10 water
authorities and of raising Pounds 2bn less than expected.
The MPs based their aggressive questioning on a recent report of the
National Audit Office, Parliament's spending watchdog, which recommended
that state sell-offs should be planned more carefully.
Sir Terence, at times shaken by the fierceness of the criticism, said that
in his view the flotation had been a success, and more time would not
necessarily have produced higher receipts. Criticism centred on the final
value raised from the flotation of Pounds 3.6bn compared with an initial
expectation of Pounds 5.7bn. In addition, the scale of the remuneration of
City advisers upset many MPs.
Shroeders, the main merchant bank adviser, collected Pounds 7m in fees plus
a Pounds 2m bonus for the 'unprecedented' amount of work involved, and Dewe
Rogerson, the marketing adviser, received Pounds 3m in fees plus a special
bonus of Pounds 200,000 after the successful flotation.
Sir Terence explained that the size of the fees was because of the
complexity of the flotation, as all 10 authorities had to be sold
simultaneously.
Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, said the taxpayers had written
off Pounds 5bn owed to them and then given the water companies Pounds 1.5bn
in cash plus Pounds 7.7bn in tax allowances.
He said: 'All I can say is there are some countries in the world where
ministers would be put before the courts.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Fear of action by Labour prompted scrapping of coal terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that a Labour government would ban or limit coal imports to protect
British Coal prompted PowerGen, the electricity generator, to seek the delay
in developing Britain's biggest coal terminal which led to the unexpected
cancellation of the project.
The terminal, at Immingham on the Humber, would have been capable of
handling 12m tonnes of foreign coal a year, threatening the jobs of miners
in the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire coalfields.
Associated British Ports (ABP), which was leading the project, said it had
cancelled the scheme because PowerGen had already delayed for too long. The
other partner in the project was the generator National Power.
PowerGen said the project's collapse opened the way for British Coal to
compete with imports and offer the electricity industry cheap coal. 'In
their own hands lies the future of British pits and miners' jobs,' said Mr
Ed Wallis, PowerGen's chief executive.
He said he was surprised by ABP's 'precipitous' decision, but believed
PowerGen had made the right choice in holding back until after the election.
'We took a totally commercial view. If we couldn't put coal through the
terminal, we would have been wasting shareholders' money.'
Labour could restrict coal imports, under the EC's coal and steel treaty
which overrides other EC legislation.
Mr Wallis played down the importance of the Immingham project, which he said
was far less attractive to the two generators than other projects at
Bristol, Liverpool, Hull and on Teesside. 'We are in a very strong
position,' he said. 'We only want to burn 19m tonnes of imports, and we can
already import half of that with existing projects.'
PowerGen was unlikely to commit itself to another coal terminal project
before the election, he said, but he insisted that it would not pay the
existing premium of Pounds 20 per tonne for UK coal. If British Coal prices
did not fall, it would seek alternative supplies.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said the cancellation of Immingham
was encouraging for the corporation. But the UK's rush to invest in
gas-fired power stations was a much more serious threat to the company than
coal imports.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Starting price for TV sponsorship set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will have to bid at least Pounds 950,000 to secure exclusive
sponsorship rights to UK commercial television coverage of the European
Football Championship.
The sponsorship committee of the Independent Television Association is
announcing the decision today as an experiment in changing the manner of
attracting TV sponsors.
The ITV network is providing 26 hours of coverage of the championship, which
takes place in Sweden between June 10 and 26. The BBC is also covering the
event.
The association arranged Sony's sponsorship of November's Rugby World Cup
Championship for an estimated fee of Pounds 1.25m. TV audience figures for
the final of that event were 14.6m, with 36 per cent of all UK males in the
advertising categories ABC1 viewing at the peak.
The European football championship is of less worldwide interest, hence the
lower starting price.
As part of the package for this summer's event, the association is also
appointing an outside agency, Roar Marketing and Promotions, to assist the
exclusive sponsor in developing wider commercial spin-offs.
Roar will provide the sponsor with ideas and strategies for such additional
marketing devices as in-store promotions and merchandising of products
connecting the sponsoring company with the event.
Sponsorship in the UK last year amounted to about Pounds 350m, with Pounds
250m of that accounted for by sponsorship of sports events. Although
broadcasting sponsorship accounted for only Pounds 15m last year, that was
twice 1990's figure.
Mr Alan Chilton, head of the association's sponsorship committee, believes
that figure will grow to Pounds 40m annually by 1996.
According to figures from the association, Sony had reason to be pleased
with its rugby sponsorship; spontaneous brand awareness of Sony apparently
rose by 8 points to 61 per cent among viewers of the event.
The association emphasises the value of sponsorship by pointing to some
unforeseen advertising benefits gained by Sony in its sponsorship of the
Rugby World Cup.
Although Sony was only a sponsor of the ITV coverage, the association
discovered that many viewers thought Sony had directly sponsored the event.
To the chagrin of those companies which had directly sponsored it -
including Heinz UK, Ricoh UK and Societe Generale - 39 per cent of ITV's
viewers believed they had seen Sony's advertising boards around the ground,
although no such boards existed.

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL has signed an agreement on rescheduling debt with the Paris Club of
creditor nations, Brazilian economy minister Marcilio Marquez Moreira said
last night, agencies report from Brasilia.
The announcement came after some hard negotiating between Brazilian
officials and creditor nation representatives in Paris.
The Brazilian team had to work on new proposals after German and Japanese
representatives apparently refused to accept the original Brazilian
proposals.
At a press briefing in Brasilia, the economy minister said that under an
accord reached late last night Brazil would pay Dollars 4.1bn over 1992-93.
This amount is a portion of a Dollars 13.5bn total that was due and that
Brazil owed in arrears until 1993.
Mr Moreira said the agreement included the rescheduling of another Dollars
11bn over a 14-year period and a three-year grace period.
The minister put Brazil's total debt at Dollars 24bn, whereas ministry
officials previously said Brazil's Paris Club debt was Dollars 21bn.
The Brazilian announcement came just hours after the economy minister had
told reporters that talks would be broken off for a week, contradicting
earlier reports that negotiations were again going smoothly.
The main sticking point in the Paris negotiations has been Brazil's
insistence on including debt in the rescheduling that was rescheduled in the
last accord in 1988.
Mr Francisco Gros, Brazil's central bank governor, said last week that this
accord had created an excessive concentration of repayments over the next
two years.
Only in exceptional circumstances does the Paris Club agree to reschedule
already rescheduled debt and Brazil's non-payment of interest for the last
three years has not endeared it to official creditors.
They complain that they have been receiving worse treatment than the
commercial banks to which Brazil started paying 30 per cent of due interest
last year.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Rise in US orders fails to lift gloom on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US DURABLE goods orders rebounded last month, but the recovery was not
enough to eclipse December's sharp plunge and failed to convince financial
markets that any sustained economic recovery was under way.
The Department of Commerce said durable goods orders rose 1.5 per cent in
January to Dollars 119.6bn, following a 5.1 per cent drop in December.
New orders for industrial machinery and equipment gained strongly, climbing
6.3 per cent to Dollars 21.1bn.
Orders for transportation equipment rose by 1.2 per cent to Dollars 29.4bn -
helped especially by the aircraft sector - while electrical and electronic
goods orders fell 4.9 per cent to Dollars 17.4bn, after four consecutive
months on the rise.
The rebound in durable goods orders exceeded private sector economists'
forecasts. However, in conjunction with the previous month's marked decline
it provided no conclusive evidence of an economic upturn.
Meanwhile, markets remained dazed by Tuesday's dramatic plunge in consumer
confidence.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business consultancy, announced then
that its consumer confidence index had fallen for the fifth month in
succession - to its lowest level since 1974.
However, Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, said yesterday that the drop
in consumer confidence was driven by politics, and that he saw signs of an
economic upturn.
If the volatile defence sector is excluded, durable goods orders showed a
stronger gain in January, rising 3.6 per cent.
However, economists noted that the backlog of unfilled orders fell by 0.3
per cent in January to a level 3.7 per cent lower than a year ago. This
undermined hopes of a recovery spurred by industrial orders in the pipeline.
A Senate committee yesterday voted to give Mr Alan Greenspan a second term
as chairman of the Federal Reserve, despite criticism that he has not done
enough to stimulate the economy, Reuter reports from Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru yesterday called for a shift in US policy
on drugs, claiming that repressive measures had been counter-productive and
a waste of aid.
The Peruvian president, speaking at a drugs summit attended by President
George Bush and five Latin American presidents, said his government had to
avoid an open 'Vietnam-style' war against the nation's 250,000 coca farmers.
Instead, he suggested, US aid should be targeted at persuading them to
produce other crops.
Mr Fujimori acknowledged that there was corruption in Peru, but he claimed
'there is corruption at all levels, even in the US Drug Enforcement Agency',
in a barbed reference that is unlikely to endear him to the US authorities.
The Peruvian president made specific requests for US aid to buy helicopters,
aircraft and radar and criticised the US Congress for cutting aid last year
to just Dollars 9m. 'The assistance we need is not for Peru but the world,'
he said.
The US yesterday announced that it had stopped supplies of military hardware
to the Colombian army, after years of criticism that the army was using the
anti-drug aid to fight leftist rebels, Reuter reports from Bogota.
Instead, the Dollars 38m destined for the Colombian army this year, will be
transferred to Colombia's special narcotics police, the marines, the air
force and the navy.

FT  27 FEB 92 / US leads the charge as allies fight for Kuwaiti contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE victors go the spoils of war: at least, this was the hope of US,
British and French companies which rushed to liberated Kuwait last year for
shares of what promised to be a Dollars 100bn (Pounds 57bn) harvest of
rebuilding contracts.
A year on, though, it is clear that the rebuilding bill will be only about a
fifth of the earliest estimates. It also appears that companies from only
one of the Gulf war allies, the US, is winning anything like victors'
spoils.
'We're doing well,' said one US official. 'Kuwait is certainly favouring US
companies.'
US groups have won at least Dollars 2bn worth of contracts and export orders
in Kuwait since last March. Moreover, US exporters have increased market
share in Kuwait, notably for cars and foods. Officials expect pre-war export
levels of around Dollars 800m a year will rise to average more than Dollars
1bn for the next few years.
US companies should also do well out of contracts still to be let. Of a
likely bill for reconstruction of around Dollars 20bn over the next two or
three years, at least half will be spent on restoring the oil industry,
while this year's budget set aside Dollars 9bn for defence spending. US
groups are leading contenders in both fields.
Bechtel, the private Californian group, has been in Kuwait since liberation
with an open-ended deal as the services contractor for restoring the oil
industry. No one will put a figure on the deal, but it is certain to be
worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Three US groups, Brown &amp; Root, Fluor Daniel and Foster Wheeler, are also the
leading contenders to win the management contract for repairing Kuwait's
three oil refineries - a task expected to cost Dollars 2bn overall. 'We're
pretty optimistic it will go our way,' said a US diplomat.
In defence, the US is already providing the first of 40 F-18 jets under a
Dollars 1.6bn deal signed in 1988. It also has an Dollars 81m agreement
under which two US groups have begun Dollars 42.5m worth of work repairing
the country's two air bases. Kuwait is also considering buying up to 200
Abrams M1A2 tanks.
AT &amp; T is fighting hard to enter Kuwait's telecommunications market, largely
at the expense of Ericsson of Sweden, which built most of the existing
network. The US company hopes to win contracts worth up to Dollars 200m.
British and, particularly, French officials are disappointed. 'The overall
picture here of awarding contracts is gloomy,' said a French diplomat, who
reckoned French groups had tendered for Dollars 1.5bn worth of contracts but
won just Dollars 500m worth since liberation. Most of this represents the
French share of Kuwait's postwar Dollars 2bn order for 15 Airbus airliners.
However, General Electric of the US is involved in the supply of the Airbus'
engines (through CFM, a joint venture with France's Snecma) while Boeing is
to supply three 747 jets.
French officials are also piqued that none of their bidders won any
significant share of the effort to control Kuwait's oil fires or of
subsequent oilfield recovery work - a situation they attribute to lobbying
by Bechtel.
British companies have fared slightly better. Officials in Kuwait estimate
that the UK has won nearly Dollars 1bn of trade and contracts since
liberation, though this includes a Dollars 200m share of the Airbus
contract.
Among the main British successes, the Kuwait British Group, a consortium of
Wimpey, AMEC and Taylor Woodrow has a contract worth nearly Dollars 200m to
restore output from the northern oilfields; Morrison has secured Dollars 40m
worth of work repairing the water system; and Royal Ordnance, a subsidiary
of British Aerospace, has mine and ordnance clearance contracts worth around
Dollars 100m.
Britain's main hope for further large contracts lies in defence, where the
Challenger 2 tank is competing against the US Abrams. But UK officials say
few other big contracts appear likely to go Britain's way, and Kuwait's
appeal to contractors has suffered accordingly. 'The level of interest in
this market shown by British companies has just dropped off,' said a UK
official.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, saw his political authority
severely undermined yesterday when he was forced to disclose to parliament
the conditions of a Dollars 500m (Pounds 285.7m) structural adjustment loan
from the World Bank agreed in November.
Dr Singh was forced by the Speaker to disclose the text of the letter
setting out the terms of the loan, after two days' battering from the
opposition. MPs accused the finance minister of a breach of parliamentary
privilege in disclosing to the bank budget policy details that should have
first been presented to parliament.
The attack on Dr Singh came on the eve of the budget, due to be go before
parliament on Saturday. It raised doubts about his long-term political
future and ability to steer his budget through without substantial
amendments.
The opposition is likely to seek Dr Singh's resignation on the grounds the
letter was 'dictated' by the World Bank and the IMF and discussed with them
before being presented to the cabinet and MPs.
Mr Chandra Shekhar, the former Prime Minister who himself sought help from
the IMF last year, said the letter compromised India's dignity and
sovereignty. 'The government has no right to continue,' he declared. The
Indian Express, which leaked details of the letter, was last night set to
publish other alleged correspondence between Dr Singh and the institutions.
Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, was expected to back his finance
minister. But Mr Rao's position is difficult because of strong opposition to
structural change and cuts in government spending within his Congress party.
The letter follows the standard pattern of declarations of policy intent by
governments seeking structural adjustment loans. But it spells out more
clearly than the government has cared to say so far its policy on issues
such as tariff reduction, public sector closures and privatisation.
The letter says the government intends over the next five years to bring
down tariffs - India has one of the world's highest tariff regimes - 'to
rates comparable to other industrialising developing countries'. This
exercise is expected to begin in this week's budget.
It makes clear that at least 47 public sector companies making losses and
employing 310,000 people face closure.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A GROUP of eight international banks, led by Credit Lyonnais, yesterday
completed a Dollars 1.5bn commercial bank credit for Algeria after four
months of hard negotiations with some of their 130 peers.
The proceeds of this roll-over deal will help ease the repayment over five
to eight years of commercial bank loans which carry no guarantees from
western governments and which fall due up to March 31, 1993.
The initial agreement with the eight 'core' banks reached last October has
allowed Algerian banks to defer about Dollars 350m worth of principal
repayments owed to commercial banks in last quarter, 1991.
The accord also opens the way for a smaller disbursement of an Ecu400m
(Dollars 510m) loan guarantee agreed by the European Community in autumn. It
underlines lenders' willingness to do business with Algeria after
cancellation of the second round of the country's first multi-party
elections.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Brussels tries to save Morocco fisheries agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community was yesterday trying to patch up a diplomatic breach
with Morocco in time to save a fisheries accord which runs out on Saturday.
The difference was caused by January's decision by the European Parliament
to vote against Ecu463m (Pounds 328m) in loans and grants because of
Moroccan human rights abuses and its failure to comply with the United
Nations peace plan for Western Sahara.
The fishing agreement, mainly of interest to 700 Spanish and a few
Portuguese vessels, had worked smoothly. But after the parliament's veto,
Rabat was sufficiently enraged to call into question both the fisheries
accord and the co-operation agreement with the EC under which the loan and
aid programme was agreed last summer.
Efforts by the European Commission and Council of Ministers to persuade
parliament to reconsider failed to get the Moroccan finance package on the
agenda at this month's plenary session.
Foreign ministers, acting on Spain and Portugal's suggestion, then decided
last week in Lisbon to explore the possibility of a free trade agreement
with Morocco. Mr Vitor Martins, secretary of state for Europe of Portugal,
which currently holds the EC presidency, met Mr Abdellatif Filali, the
Moroccan foreign minister, yesterday to try to prolong the fisheries deal
for at least three months, officials in Brussels said.
The free trade carrot has two tactical virtues to recommend it. First, the
suggestion has gone down well in Rabat, officials in Brussels say, where
King Hassan has seized on it as a move towards the special relationship he
has sought with the EC ever since his application for Community membership
in 1987 was rebuffed. Second, by going the free trade route, the Commission
and the Council largely circumvent the parliament.
Co-operation agreements must reach a high bar of 260 votes at Strasbourg to
get through. But a free trade agreement, although much wider in scope, would
at the moment reduce parliament to an advisory role.
But some officials regard the free trade idea as little more than a gesture
to get the EC over the fisheries accord hurdle by signalling Community
willingness to explore a closer relationship with Morocco. Much of the trade
between the EC and Morocco is already free anyway, with the conspicuous
exception of agriculture, which has about nil chance of becoming so.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Keating plays for make or break: Kevin Brown assesses the
Australian PM's economic statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL Keating, the Australian prime minister, was in buoyant form in
parliament yesterday as he delivered an economic statement which, on his own
admission, will make or break his government.
For the first time since December, when he defeated Mr Bob Hawke in a bitter
battle for the Labor leadership, Mr Keating showed the fighting spirit which
won him the job.
Throwing caution to the wind, he unveiled a wide-ranging package which he
claimed would boost growth in gross domestic product from zero this year to
nearly 5 per cent in 1992-93.
In typical Keating style, the package offers ADollars 8.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn)
in personal tax cuts from 1994, showing that it is aimed not only at
resuscitating Labor's fading hopes of winning the next election in 1993, but
at laying the groundwork for a further win in 1996.
Roars of support from Labor's back benches showed that Mr Keating had
achieved his first objective - to heal the wounds of the leadership battle
and unify the divided party around his leadership.
Early reactions from outside parliament also suggested that the statement
had succeeded in generating hope of relief from the recession which has
battered the economy for the last two years.
However, the prime minister knows that he will have to do much more if he is
to close a yawning opinion poll gap between Labor and the opposition
Liberal/National Party coalition before July 1993, the last possible date
for the election.
What is most important, he must convince the financial markets and overseas
investors that the statement is not, as some economists fear, a pro-cyclical
stimulus which will overheat the economy.
Over the longer term, he will also need to convince the electorate that the
statement contains a vision for Australia's future which builds on the more
open society Labor has created since the party returned to power in 1983.
The key element of the statement is a ADollars 2.3bn injection of public
money into the economy over the next 16 months in an attempt to promote
business activity and pull down the unemployment rate from 10.3 per cent.
Much of the injection will come in the form of badly needed infrastructure
spending on inefficient roads, railways, airport facilities and a major
expansion of vocational training. However, the biggest headlines will
probably be generated by a one-off payment of ADollars 300m to consumers
through the family allowance system, combined with a cut in the price of new
cars.
The initiatives are intended to give an immediate fillip to the economy, but
critics said they looked suspiciously like a pay-off to families hit by the
recession Mr Keating once promised would never happen.
If the strategy works, the government calculates that GDP will recover from
stagnation in the current year to 4.75 per cent in 1992-93, which it hopes
will reduce unemployment to 9.5 per cent.
The strain would be taken by the federal government budget deficit, which
would increase from a projected ADollars 6.8bn this year to ADollars 8bn;
the current account deficit, forecast to rise from 3.75 cent of GDP to 4.25
per cent; and inflation, forecast to rise from 1.5 per cent to 4 per cent.
Much will depend on the reliability of the Treasury forecasters, who have
generally painted a woefully inaccurate picture of the economy over the past
two years. The opposition was already claiming last night that many of the
assumptions in the statement were over-optimistic.
The government is also laying great stress on a renewed deal with the
Australian Council of Trade Unions, which has pledged to restrain pay claims
to a level which would keep inflation in line with Australia's main trading
partners.
Mr Keating, a close political associate of Mr Bill Kelty, the ACTU
secretary, was confident that the unions would keep their part of the
bargain, in spite of pressure from rank-and-file members for real increases
in wages after several years of restraint. However, the government is also
proposing to restructure the industrial relations system to encourage
workplace bargaining, which will increase the difficulty of maintaining
central control over wage outcomes.
In the longer term, Mr Keating promises cuts in personal taxes worth
ADollars 3.4bn in 1994-95 and ADollars 5.2bn in 1995-96, together with a
package of measures designed to increase private sector investment.
These include provisions for accelerated depreciation, tax-free bonds for
infrastructure projects, fast tracking of environmental and Aboriginal
heritage planning procedures for the mining industry, and more generous tax
treatment of bad debt provisions to encourage banks to allow businesses to
trade through their problems.
Public sector infrastructure investment will include the establishment of a
Brisbane-to-Perth standard-gauge railway link, upgrading of several East
Coast highways, and common-user terminals at several overcrowded airports.
The statement also sets out to increase the efficiency of the economy by
relaxing restrictions on foreign investment, completing the deregulation of
the aviation market, and allowing more foreign banks to enter Australia.
The statement says the package will stimulate average GDP growth of 4 per
cent in the next four years, cutting unemployment to 7.75 per cent by
mid-1996, when inflation and the current account deficit are forecast to
decline.
However, economists said the longer-term projections were little more than
guesswork based on the hope that imports would not increase in line with
exports. Some said it was hard to understand the government's contention
that the budget finances will be transformed from a deficit of ADollars 8bn
next year to a surplus of ADollars 2bn in 1995-96.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Aerospatiale seeks Russian role in Airbus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN aircraft manufacturers including Tupolev and Ilyushin have been
approached by Aerospatiale of France to consider possible collaboration in
the development of a new 600-seat jumbo airline with the European Airbus
consortium.
Mr Henri Martre, the chairman of the French state-controlled aerospace
company which owns a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus, said at the Singapore
Air Show yesterday that Aerospatiale was trying to introduce former Soviet
as well as Asian co-operation in future Airbus plans to build an ultra-large
aircraft.
He said Aerospatiale had established links two years ago with the Soviet
aircraft industry which were growing rapidly.
Apart from the new jumbo project, Aerospatiale is considering joint
development of a new light civil helicopter with Russian partners and is
discussing Russian participation in the long-term possible development of a
second generation supersonic aircraft.
Airbus said yesterday it has so far not had any direct contact with Russian
aircraft manufacturers over its proposals to develop a 600-seat jumbo. But
it added that under the Airbus system, each partner in the consortium was
free to subcontract work and development to other companies.
Mr Martre said the huge costs of developing a new 600-seat aircraft would
require wider co-operation than under the current Airbus partnership. The
Commonwealth of Independent States had a powerful aeronautical and space
industry and could become an important partner, he added.
Airbus is also expected to start delivering soon the first of five A310
wide-body aircraft worth about Dollars 400m (Pounds 228.5m) ordered by
Aeroflot. Deliveries of the aircraft have been delayed because financing had
to be renegotiated.
Mr Martre remained cautious about the eventual timing of the launch of a
600-seat aircraft programme.
Preliminary studies to define the aircraft were likely to take at least five
years. Mr Martre added that the market for such an aircraft was not at
present sufficiently large to launch a programme.
The former Soviet aircraft industry is desperate for western partners and
investment, writes Anthony Robinson. In return it offers a combination of
high-quality design skills, long experience in rugged airframe design and
construction and a cheap, highly qualified labour force.
The industry faces a difficult future following the big cutback in military
orders and long delays in bringing new civilian projects like the Ilyushin
IL-96, replacement of the long-range IL-62 and the medium-range Tupolev
Tu-204, into mass production.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad catches the free-market bug - UN
body seeks to assist rich and poor in an open trade system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST all the odds, the UN Conference on Trade and Development appears to
have accomplished what it set out to do at its eighth conference in
Cartagena, Colombia: restructure itself so it can play a bigger part in
influencing world trade and development.
The future of this UN organisation, which has functioned since its founding
in 1964 primarily as a trade and development watchdog on behalf of the
developing world, depends on finding new ways to benefit countries - from
the very poor to the very rich - that endorse free-market policies.
With so many developing countries already carrying out market-oriented
reforms and accepting the liberalisation of trade as part of a growth
strategy, dialogue has become easier.
Few significant conflicts surfaced at Unctad VIII, and, to most delegates'
relief, ideology barely intruded. The desperation to keep up 'the spirit of
consensus' was such that the final political declaration dissolved into a
few platitudes - but the document on revamping Unctad is solid.
The organisation's existing committees have been scrapped, and four new ones
named. Although the subjects covered - commodities, poverty alleviation,
service sectors and economic co-operation among developing countries - are
not new, their terms of reference will be redrawn to fit changing
circumstances.
'This will have to be done rapidly because the countries clearly intend it
should be,' said Mr Carlos Fortin, deputy to the secretary-general, Mr
Kenneth Dadzie.
Mr Fortin sees Unctad's main function as providing an overall vision of
trade and development related issues, and extending this to analysing
problems that need international action. For example, all nations wanted to
increase trade, so competition was a special concern.
'What kind of competition do we really want? What economic and other
obstacles are there for competition? Unctad can do global studies of this
nature and be a pioneer in getting agreements going,' said Mr Fortin.
Competition surfaced in several guises and is one of the reasons developing
countries have come to endorse the negotiations under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Until recently Gatt was seen as a rich man's
club (with Unctad known as the poor man's Gatt), but now that poorer
countries are more interested in trade they want the protection afforded by
clear multilateral rules. As a result, there were repeated calls for a
successful conclusion to the Uruguay round.
Both poverty and the environment were taken up by the conference:
'sustainable' development was the byword, with the proposal that Unctad
could be one of the organisations to follow up the Rio Earth Summit in June
and help create a new environmental order.
Trade-related environmental questions, especially where commodities are
involved, are already being tackled by Unctad. The conference gave a high
priority to alleviating poverty with support for programmes designed to deal
with the problem of the 47 least developed countries, particularly in the
context of depressed commodity prices.
But Unctad has invested enormous efforts in commodity questions 'to
remarkably little effect', as one African delegate said. And Colombia's
proposal for a world commodity conference received only tepid backing
because few members believed it could succeed where, for instance, coffee
pact negotiations have so far failed.
The volume of world exports grew by an average of 6.5 per cent a year from
1985 to 1990, with the market-oriented industrialised countries accounting
for about 70 per cent of the total. Although developing countries increased
their exports by 9 per cent a year in the same period, this figure was
largely due to the performance of south-east Asian countries. By contrast,
African and Latin American countries depending mainly on commodities had
lower export growth by volume, and lost purchasing power.
Developing countries are particularly enthusiastic about Unctad's concept of
'trade efficiency' which proved its practical worth in a newly installed
'Trade Point', a trade information technology centre, in Cartagena. 'We've
shown here that we can cut the cost of transactions by 40 per cent, even in
a small city. It's not highly sophisticated technology, it only costs
Dollars 20,000 to install,' said Mr Jean Gurunlian, chief of Unctad's trade
facilitation. 'The main aim is to eliminate obstacles and corruption, and
move goods faster. What it does require is a change of attitude.'
Delegates were so impressed by the possibilities of savings in time and
costs that they agreed on a Trade Efficiency Symposium in 1994.
Unctad's role as the main UN development forum is still a diffused one, with
the important decisions being made by the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund and Gatt. At a time when Unctad, is under pressure to be more
useful and look for ways of alleviating poverty, the efficiency concept is
thus especially relevant.
At the end of the conference, Mr Dadzie, whose term was extended for another
year, said the meeting marked a turning point and reflected 'a remarkable
unity of purpose' which would 'command the adherence of everyone'.
There are a lot of inconsistencies to be ironed out back at Unctad
headquarters in Geneva, and the organisation's role as a catalyst will only
be assured when the new committees and working groups have proved their
effectiveness. But, as the Brazilian delegates commented: 'This is the first
time Unctad has even come up with a proper set of priorities. And with the
reforms in place we can tackle the substance.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / IAEA acts to tighten checks for N-weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Atomic Energy Agency is to extend its powers to check for
clandestine nuclear weapons development, including inspection of undeclared
sites and gathering foreign intelligence.
The new measures agreed in Vienna yesterday by the policy-making board of
the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, amount to a fairly modest
tightening of safeguards against nuclear proliferation. Critics say the IAEA
needs much stronger powers if it is to avoid repeating its failure to detect
Iraq's secret development of a nuclear bomb.
The 35-nation board affirmed the right of its 200 inspectors to visit any
site they chose in countries which have signed the agency's safeguards
agreements. They will also be able to consult foreign intelligence sources
for clues about secret weapons projects.
The board also agreed that member states should submit in advance any design
for new installations or changes to existing nuclear sites.
'The board further reaffirmed the agency's rights to obtain and have access
to additional information and locations,' Mr Hans Blix, IAEA
director-general, said.
But a proposal to compile a central IAEA database of imports and exports of
sensitive equipment and nuclear materials was not accepted. Several western
industrialised countries said the information would be too laborious and
costly to collect.
'The intention is to build up a picture of who is importing equipment that
is incongruous with the scale of its known nuclear programme,' said Mr David
Kyd, IAEA information director. 'It will mean a lot of work but unless
someone does this, it is going to be a critical weakness in the system.'
IAEA officials said the tightening of controls would only apply to members
which had signed full safeguards agreements. Countries with agreements to
inspect only specific reactors, such as Algeria, would not be obliged to
open other sites for inspection.
The next IAEA board meeting in June will resume the discussion of stronger
safeguards, including the proposed database of materials and equipment. It
will also have to tackle the impending financial crisis, following the loss
of the Soviet Union's contribution to the agency. The IAEA's Dollars 75m a
year inspection budget has been cut by 18 per cent at a time when its
existing workload is increasing.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Kohl sidesteps Sudeten Germans row
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S treaty of friendship and good neighbourliness with Czechoslovakia
will be signed today in Prague by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President
Vaclav Havel, to the considerable relief of both parties.
In spite of the desire of the two governments to lay the basis for close
co-operation, the treaty has reopened deep historical wounds, and caused
political ructions in both countries: from the left in Czechoslovakia, and
from the right in Germany.
On the positive side, the treaty recognises the inviolability of their
border, thus providing some reassurance for Czechoslovak sensibilities. And
it underpins Germany's considerable investment - at least two-thirds of the
estimated Dollars 850m in foreign capital which has flowed into the country
over the past two years - with assurances of inter-governmental co-operation
in a range of fields from the economy to culture and the environment.
But anxieties have been aroused by what the treaty leaves out.
Mr Kohl and his Foreign Minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, have had to
face down the opposition of their coalition allies from the Bavarian-based,
and distinctly conservative, Christian Social Union (CSU), to get the treaty
signed. The CSU wanted the treaty to include some support for the property
claims of up to 2.5m Sudeten Germans, expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945
after the defeated German troops withdrew, most of whom now live in Bavaria.
Since the collapse of communism in Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten Germans have
lobbied aggressively to regain their former properties. Under the current
Czechoslovak restitution law, properties confiscated before the communist
takeover in 1948 cannot be given back to former owners.
The Czechoslovak government has refused to include any provision in the
treaty for outstanding property claims. Bowing to German pressure would have
undermined its position in coming elections.
Mr Kohl has overcome his political problems with fast footwork, made to look
like confusion. He promised the CSU a parliamentary debate and resolution to
back up the case of the Sudeten Germans. But the three coalition partners
failed to agree on any text, and the debate has been postponed until after
the signing.
Mr Havel, meanwhile, has faced growing demands from the left-wing political
parties in Prague to include a declaration in the treaty that the Munich
agreement signed by Hitler in 1938, and used as the basis for the German
occupation of the Sudetenland, was 'null and void.'
The German government has refused to declare the accord null and void, on
the grounds that such an action would make illegal everything which occurred
in the Sudetenland between 1938 and 1945, including the registration of
births and marriages, and property transactions, too.
Instead, the treaty refers to 'the continuation of the Czechoslovak state
since 1918.' This has only served to infuriate Slovak deputies, because it
does not refer to the four years during the Second World War when Slovakia
was a pro-Nazi independent state. Slovak as well as Czech deputies have to
ratify the treaty in the next few months.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Growing regional divisions threaten Italy's two main
parties: Socialists and Christian Democrats face erosion of support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MILANESE what he understands by a 'model 740' and the reply is: 'A tax
form, of course.' Ask a Roman and the reply is: 'A Volvo.' Ask a Neapolitan
and he says quizzically: 'You mean twenty minutes to eight?' Ask a Sicilian
and he replies: 'I've never heard of that calibre before]'
Though a Milanese joke, this stereotyping of Italians encapsulates the
enormous distance in perceptions which northerners see separating them from
both the government in Rome, and the rest of the country in the south. At
its simplest the north works and generates the money which is spent
frivolously by Rome: the Neapolitans can scarcely get up in the morning to
do an honest day's work, while the Sicilians are locked in a time warp of
crime.
Despite a blanket of prosperity now covering Italy, and despite the huge
sums of money pumped into the south to redistribute income in the post-war
period, the north-south gap is growing. This divide promises to be a central
element in the campaign which has just begun for general elections on April
5.
Northern political frustrations have found a voice and a movement in the
form of the populist Lombard League. The League's platform is a return to
'clean government', tighter controls on state spending, more money
channelled to the north, and a social policy that tightens controls on
immigration. Its base is the industrial heartland of cities in Lombardy such
as Brescia and Bergamo; but its appeal has spread across into Piedmont, the
Veneto, parts of Liguria and even further south in Emilia Romagna and
Tuscany.
The emergence of the League into national politics over the past five years,
operating on a loose structure of regional 'leagues', might have been
contained but for two factors. First, the appeal of the two main government
parties, the Christian Democrats (DC) and the Socialists (PSI) is declining.
Second, the disappearance of the Communist party last year and its
replacement by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has created a void for
the once-powerful opposition vote of the left. As a result these elections
are likely to rewrite the political geography of Italy.
In the absence of reliable opinion polls, the best gauge of the success of
the League is the party's performance in municipal elections last November
in Brescia, one of the richest cities in Italy and long run by the DC. The
League obtained the largest single share of the vote - 24.4 per cent against
the DC's 24.3 per cent and 10.3 per cent for the Socialists.
The swing in vote when seen against the last general elections of 1987 was
enormous. Then, the League had only managed to win 1.6 per cent of the vote
and the DC 32 per cent. Another element to the Brescia poll was the collapse
of the Communist vote in the period since the 1987 general election. From
being the second-largest party four years ago with 21 per cent of the vote,
the newly-formed PDS gathered less than 10 per cent.
With the northern business community and parts of the Catholic hierarchy
strongly behind the League, the pattern of Brescia results could be repeated
across a swathe of northern Italy. The Christian Democrat vote, and that of
the Socialists and former Communists, is also likely to be eroded by protest
votes going to the Greens and well-organised minority groups such as the
Pensioners Party.
Nationwide, the former Communist vote, the second-largest in 1987 with 26
per cent, is expected to be slashed. The PDS itself accepts its share of the
vote will fall sharply in all areas save the traditional 'red' belt in
Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria. And the PDS has to contend with the
hardliners among the former Communists who have formed the Reconstituted
Communist Party which could account for 15 per cent of its former vote.
The decline of support for the DC and the PSI may well be limited to the
north and centre of the country. Especially in the south, which has more
than 35 per cent of the electorate, these two parties still hold the purse
strings and control patronage, all important when the state is the motor of
the economy.
They also enjoy many dubious links with organised crime whose political
influence cannot be ignored in these parts. In poor regions such as
Baslicata, the DC held 46 per cent of the vote in 1987 and marginally
increased this share in regional elections two years ago. The PSI also
improved its share of the vote in the 1990 regional elections in the south
by almost 5 per cent.
This pattern was confirmed last year in Sicily's regional elections, which
saw the DC increase their support from 39 to 43 per cent. The increase was
despite the emergence of a new party of clean government, La Rete (The Net)
backed former Christian Democrats, ex-Communists and members of the Catholic
church, with 8 per cent of the vote.
If these trends are repeated in the general elections against a background
of frustration with a political system in need of change, voters may be
tempted to flirt more with small parties that appeal to specific interests -
such as regional parties in Sardinia and Alto Adige or the Greens.
At the same time the Christian Democrats and Socialists could come become
'meridionalised' parties, identified with their strongholds in the south out
of touch with the aspirations of the north.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Manchester's Olympic bid wins Pounds 55m government cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to give Pounds 55m towards Manchester's bid to stage the
Olympic Games in the year 2000. If the bid succeeds, the government will
provide up to Pounds 360m over the next eight years to underpin a Pounds 1bn
building programme.
The International Olympic Committee will choose the 2000 host in September
next year. Manchester's competition is expected to come from Brasilia,
Sydney, Beijing, Milan and Berlin.
Manchester would have had little chance without strong government support, a
lesson learned from its bid for the 1996 games, when the government was
half-hearted and Manchester came fifth out of six contenders. Atlanta won.
Yesterday's decision represents a significant change in government policy
towards sport.
This has been helped by the fact that Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
several Cabinet colleagues are sports fans, but the presence in north-west
England of more than 20 Conservative marginal parliamentary seats has almost
certainly been a factor.
Mr Major said last night: 'We propose to make every effort to make sure we
win this prize for Manchester, the north-west and the country as a whole.'
The benefit of staging the games has already been estimated by independent
economists at about Pounds 2bn.
The decision followed months of lobbying by a team led by the Duke of
Westminster; Mr Bob Scott, the Manchester theatrical impresario; and Mr
Graham Stringer, Labour leader of Manchester city council.
Government efforts will be led by Mr Michael Heseltine, environment
secretary, who will also investigate putting up to Pounds 60m of extra urban
funding into Manchester to improve areas near the main facilities.
Mr Scott said Manchester would now be competing for the games on an equal
footing with other contenders, all of which were backed by their
governments. Manchester needed not only Pounds 2m to help fund the Pounds 5m
bid, but Pounds 53m more to make a start on a national velodrome for cycling
events and to prepare the site of an Olympic stadium.
The public sector commitment is for about a third of eventual total capital
costs. Mr Scott believes this will be enough to diminish long-term risks
sufficiently to get the rest from the private sector.
If Manchester wins the games, the biggest single sporting element would be a
Pounds 170m Olympic stadium.
Both would help to regenerate east Manchester where new housing - the
long-term use for the village - would be needed eventually.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Berlusconi to bid for Britain's Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, has decided to make a bid
for the new Channel 5 commercial television franchise in the UK designed to
compete directly with ITV.
The controversial Italian entrepreneur, who owns supermarket chains and
publishing houses as well as the AC Milan football club, would, if
successful, be the first foreigner to operate a British television channel.
Mr Berlusconi is the dominant figure in Italian commercial television after
creating a national network out of linked local stations which show
videotaped programmes delivered by motorcycle. He also has stakes in German,
French and Spanish television. A move into the UK has been planned for some
time.
Mr Berlusconi's main group, Fininvest, will lead a consortium to bid for the
channel which is expected to be put out for tender in the next two months.
The aim is to broadcast a national channel of high quality entertainment
aimed directly at ITV, Britain's main commercial television channel. The
plan is to spend several hundred million pounds on programmes from the
outset to try to make an immediate impression in the market.
Fininvest has already linked up with Channel X, the independent production
company run by Mr Mike Bolland, former deputy director of programmes at
Channel 4. Channel X had been seen as a bidder in its own right. Fininvest
says it is also talking to other potential UK investors.
Channel 5 which will be awarded by competitive tender, is expected to reach
around 75 per cent of the UK population using conventional transmitters.
The winner of the franchise will however have to pay for the cost of the
transmitters and retuning several million video recorders likely to suffer
interference from the Channel 5 signal. In most parts of the country a
separate aerial will be needed to receive the channel which has to be on air
by the end of 1994 at the latest. Mr Oliver Novick, head of corporate
development at Fininvest, said he believed the difficulties could be
overcome.
'If the product is good the public is willing to make the investment to get
a new channel,' he said. As well as using normal transmitters, Fininvest
would almost certainly broadcast by satellite to reach parts of the country
that Channel 5 could not otherwise reach.
Fininvest looked at the possibility of bidding for an ITV franchise last
year but decided it was not interested in regional television.
'This is the last opportunity to create a new terrestrial channel in a major
European country,' Mr Novick said.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Fraud law faces urgent reform in England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering remodelling key aspects of English fraud law
along Scottish lines as part of an urgent reform package to solve the
problems of complex and unmanageable City trials.
This follows widespread criticism of the handling of high profile trials
such as Guinness, Blue Arrow and Barlow Clowes which reached their
conclusions after many years of costly wrangling.
The main reform under consideration is the introduction of a wide-ranging
offence of fraud which does not exist under present English law.
In Scotland, a charge of fraud may be brought under common law and does not
need to be allied to a particular statute as it does in England.
However, thoughts of abandoning trial by jury in complex fraud cases, as
recommended by the report of the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee, are not
being seriously entertained.
The government may also enact measures to shorten the length of trials by
ensuring that arguments outlined by defendants at pre-trial reviews are
adhered to when they reach full trials.
The government has been under extreme pressure in recent weeks to come up
with a cheaper and quicker way of dealing with serious fraud.
The collapse two weeks ago of the second trial arising out of the 1986
Guinness takeover of Distillers was accompanied by a call from the presiding
judge for a 'radical solution' to the problems of long fraud cases.
The absence of a simple fraud charge means that prosecuting authorities such
as the Serious Fraud Office have to identify specific acts such as
fraudulent trading, misuse of company funds or false accounting.
The indictment in the Blue Arrow trial, which lasted just over a year and
cost an estimated Pounds 35m, contained only one charge but was followed by
20 paragraphs of detailed allegations, each of which had to be explained to
the jury. Government law officers will need to find a way of framing a
simple charge of fraud without having to include complicated and costly
specific allegations similar to those in the Blue Arrow indictment to cover
the particular circumstances of each case.
Mr Justice Henry, the judge in all four Guinness trials, told the jury:
'Once again this case has thrown up the problems of long criminal trials and
the appropriateness of our criminal justice system . . . to such long and
complex trials.'
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, recently undertook to consider
any request from the SFO to allow it to opt for civil instead of criminal
proceedings in prosecuting large fraud cases.
In civil cases, prosecuting authorities need to establish their case only on
a 'balance of probabilities', rather than the more stringent 'beyond
reasonable doubt' criterion required in criminal cases.
Mr Redwood also agreed to look at any SFO request for greater investigative
powers.
A move to increase the effectiveness of pre-trial reviews would probably
chime well with the views of Lord Roskill, who chaired the three-year
inquiry into the conduct of fraud cases which reported in 1986.
The former Law Lord argued earlier this month that 'a very firm line' should
be taken at preliminary hearings 'so that the issues have been streamlined
by the time the case gets to trial.'
The Labour party has said it would streamline the role of agencies
responsible for dealing with fraud and would consider appointing specialist
legal advisers to juries involved in complex cases.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, acknowledged two weeks ago that urgent
attention needed to be given to possible changes, while warning there was no
easy solution.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Appointments: Mining potential at Telecom Eireann
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brendan Hynes, executive chairman of Glencar Explorations, the Dublin-listed
mining company, has taken up his assignment as the new chairman of the
state-owned Irish telephone company, Telecom Eireann.
He replaces Michael Smurfit, flamboyant businessman and prominent one-time
Charles Haughey crony, who became embroiled in the wave of scandals that
contributed to the toppling of the Irish premier. Smurfit resigned last
September from the chairmanship of Telecom after controversy surrounding his
interests in a property deal for the com-pany's new headquarters the
previous year.
Hynes says the new job is 'part-time', thus enabling him to continue at
Glencar. While he emphasises that Smurfit bequeathed him a well-run
organisation, he forecasts that he will not be idle in coming months - he
will be tackling a number of areas, notably the current cost structure. 'A
lot is going to happen in the next 12 months - and I'm not talking about
privatisation,' he asserts.
In recent years Telecom has conducted an IPounds 2bn modern-isation of 'an
extremely antiquated system' and Hynes therefore considers the company
particularly well-placed to capitalise on eastern European developments. It
already has a contract advising Hungary's tecommunications company, a
project that may lead to equity investment, and Hynes says he also has his
eye on Poland and Czechoslovakia.
Although Hynes has spent much of his career in spec-ialised mining and
exploration companies, including as chief executive of Tara Mines before
moving to Glencar three years ago, he was until 1974 personal assistant to
Peter Grace, chairman and chief executive of the US multinational W R Grace.

FT  27 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINAL results from Barclays yesterday pulled the stock back sharply in an
otherwise firm banking sector. The market was particularly disappointed with
the growth in costs at Barclays and the level of losses at the US
operations.
Provisions in the second half grew by 37 per cent in the UK and 34 per cent
in the US. Lehman Brothers analyst Mr Robert Law said: 'This must increase
the likelihood that the provision figure is likely to remain high.' The
shares fell 20 to 374p in very heavy turnover of 18m.
In the light of the results, Lehman is looking for Pounds 700m this year
(down Pounds 200m), and Pounds 1.2bn in 1993, while Nomura is on Pounds 692m
and Pounds 1.214bn and County NatWest Pounds 640m and Pounds 1.1bn.
Lloyds Bank and Abbey National were again the focus of attention as recent
buy notes on the former and continued sentiment on the latter sent the
shares higher. Lloyds added 3 at 412p and Abbey 8 at 305p. National
Westminster Bank continued to find favour after its well-received results on
Monday, the shares rising 4 to 312p. Midland Bank, which reports today,
gained 5 to 239p.
US boosts BP
The marked difference between London and New York in views on BP's
prospects, obvious for more than a week, was reinforced yesterday as
analysts in the City of London expressed grave reservations regarding Wall
Street's continued support for the stock. BP shares attracted heavy US
buying in late dealings in London yesterday.
Following an analysts meeting in New York, at which BP gave reassurances
about the dividend, Mr Todd Bergman of Goldman Sachs repeated his buy
recommendation. But this view that BP shares are now cheap and that the
dividend is safe contrasts sharply with opinions in London.
When BP failed to raise its quarterly dividend earlier this month, analysts
in London questioned whether the total payout for the year could be held
against the background of falling crude oil prices. Nevertheless, after
Goldman maintained its earnings estimate of Dollars 4.25 per BP American
Depositary Receipt, which is at the top end of Wall Street estimates, the
shares found fresh support. In London the stock closed 5 1/2 higher at 264
1/2 p, rebounding from a low of 256p touched before the US market opened.
Turnover was a hefty 34m shares.
Glaxo reverse
The announcement late in the session that Denmark's Office of Fair Trading
was asking the European Commission to investigate Glaxo on suspicion of
abusing a dominant market position knocked the share price.
The pharmaceuticals company had been up 14p at one stage but the news that
the prices of three new Glaxo medicines for asthma and migraine were causing
concern among Danish health authorities sent the shares back to close only a
penny up at 794p. They also fell in New York, where they are traded as
American Depositary Receipts, in active trading. The ADRs were down by
Dollars  1/2 on turnover of more than 2.5m (the equivalent of 5m shares) in
early trading.
Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Didier Cowling of Nomura Research said yesterday:
'If Denmark manages to convince the EC, Glaxo could have a problem.'
Lonrho upset
Expectations of a disappointing annual report from Lonrho, and belief that
the trading conglomerate may terminate its UK Audi/Volkswagen franchise,
prompted traders to mark down the price of the shares at the start of
dealing yesterday.
Then, when the annual report fulfilled the market's financial concern by
disclosing that the poor preliminary figures had been boosted by a Pounds
33m asset sale, the shares fell further. They closed 9 down at 121p,
contrasting with a strong stock market, on turnover of 9.3m shares, or about
twice average daily volume. The stock has lost more than 100p since
November.
Warburg warns
Shares in merchant bank SG Warburg fell steeply as the group issued a
trading statement which warned that profits for the second half of the year
would be below those of the first half.
However, the group said pre-tax profits would be above the level of the same
period last year - putting the figure at between Pounds 155m and Pounds 178m
for the year. This was only slightly below most analysts' forecasts, and
many felt that the drop of 36 to 538p was overdone.
Kleinwort Benson produced results at the lower end of analysts' ranges and
retreated 11 to 265p.
Property shares were again weak as two brokers issued gloomy reports on the
sector. County NatWest said gearing in the sector had risen from 53 per cent
to 78 per cent over the year, and that any prospect of a revival was being
stifled by indecision prior to the general election.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew also found little to be optimistic about, and
recommended a move out of Great Portland Estates, off 4 at 156p, Brixton
Estates, down 3 at 155p, and Land Securities, 1 off at 439p.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was active, with turnover of more than 31m boosted by two
large blocks of shares placed at 16p in late trading. The stock closed
steady at 16 3/4 p.
SmithKline Beecham was held back by analysts' downgradings following the
announcement of full-year figures on Tuesday. SG Warburg cut its 1992
profits estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 1.115bn and Nomura reduced its
earnings growth forecast for the company from 15 per cent by at least 1
percentage point. The shares gained only 2 to 917p, although the units rose
30 to 4210p.
Strong US buying of electricity generators left National Power 5 1/2 higher
at 220p and PowerGen ahead 8 1/2 at 232p.
Vodafone advanced 8 to 364p in busy turnover of 5.9m after a series of
presentations to US institutions.
Electronics group Unitech surged 17 to 225p as speculation mounted over the
next move by its two large Swiss shareholders, which on Monday announced
that takeover talks had broken down.
Oil company Lasmo fell to 196p on news that Smith New Court had placed a
line of 4m shares with various institutions, but closed only 2 down at 199p.
Shell followed BP higher, rising 5 to 447p.
Grand Metropolitan lost 15 to 932p as analysts cut profit forecasts.
Kleinwort Benson lowered its estimate to Pounds 398m from Pounds 472m for
the first half of this year, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew revised to Pounds 377m
from Pounds 413m.
Switching within the food sector boosted Ranks Hovis McDougall and United
Biscuits but hit Northern Foods, as investors looked for shares which have
lagged the market in what is regarded as a safe haven sector at a time of
political uncertainty. Ranks Hovis climbed 8 1/2 to 214 1/2 p and United
Biscuits 8 to 416p, as Northern Foods lost 8 to 560p.
Retailer and drugs manufacturer Macarthy rose 17 to 316p after the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission cleared rival bids for the company from
UniChem and Lloyds Chemists.
If Lloyds, the main contender, uses the same terms as before - one Lloyds
share plus 21p - its offer would be worth about 360p a share. It shed 5 to
340p.
Wholesaler UniChem firmed 2 to 203p. It is expected to wait and see what
decision Lloyds takes. Also, in December it announced that it had bought
pharmaceutical chain E. Moss for Pounds 27m and it may be hesitant to return
to the acquisition trail so soon.
A presentation to institutions by merchant bank Kleinwort Benson on the
hotel sector left Queens Moat Houses ahead 3 1/2 at 82p. Turnover was a
heavy 10m.
Glynwed International eased a penny to 210p. Panmure Gordon issued a sell
note.
Nervousness ahead of today's figures sent Williams Holdings down 4 to 325p.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of
easing in trading rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE equities followed the futures market higher, lifted by hopes of an
easing in share trading rules and a cut in the discount rate, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 339.22 ahead at 21,364.77. It fell to the day's
low of 20,940.07 shortly after the opening, and reached the session's high
of 21,376.69 just before the close on arbitrage-related buying and bargain
hunting by individuals and dealers.
Volume picked up to 200m shares from 160m. Rises led falls by 727 to 231,
with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 16.04 at 1,552.01, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just
0.59 up at 1,184.10.
Hopes that the Finance Ministry would relax trading restrictions such as the
'30 per cent' rule, which prevents a single broker from trading more than 30
per cent of one stock, and the '15-minute' rule, which restricts brokers
from trading on their own accounts 15 minutes before the market's close,
buoyed equities. Rumours that the Finance Ministry had asked insurance
companies to support the market also encouraged investors.
Strength in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone bolstered other shares. NTT rose
Y25,000 to Y733,000 on prospects of a possible stock split. Financial
authorities have suggested that greater liquidity in the stock would
encourage more trading. Reports that NTT will co-operate with KDD, the
overseas telecom company, to operate internationally, also sparked interest.
NTT denied the reports.
Individuals were seen buying pharmaceuticals on renewed interest in
Aids-related issues. Mochida Pharmaceutical surged Y400 to Y2,630 on
speculation that it was developing a new Aids drug. Meiji Milk Products
jumped Y49 to Y941.
Electric power companies rose on hopes that lower interest rates would boost
profits. Chubu Electric Power appreciated Y90 to Y2,890.
Most electronics issues were unaffected by downward earnings revisions by
Matsushita Electric Industrial, Hitachi and Oki Electric Industry. Traders
said investors felt the sector was oversold. Hitachi lost just Y3 to Y845
and Matsushita held at Y1,340.
Brokerages were among the few losers of the day, as investors were
discouraged by the recent disputes regarding window dressing for clients'
investment losses. Nomura Securities shed Y10 to Y1,490 and Daiwa fell Y19
to Y951.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 252.85 to 22,834.75 in volume of 79.5m
shares. Popularity of drug and chemical issues spread to Ono Pharmaceutical,
the most active issue of the day, which rose Y270 to Y5,980.
Roundup
HONG KONG stood out firmly in a generally weak session on the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG climbed to a record high, encouraged by the US senate's failure on
Tuesday to approve restrictions on China's Most Favoured Nation status. The
Hang Seng index put on 34.51 to 4,794.71 in turnover of HKDollars 2.82bn,
after HKDollars 1.89bn.
Buying, however, was tempered by caution ahead of Hong Kong's 1992 Budget,
due on March 4, and the release of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's 1991
results on March 10.
Utilities were higher, Hong Kong and China Gas adding 60 cents at HKDollars
13.90.
AUSTRALIA was little changed ahead of the government's economic statement.
The All Ordinaries index eased 1.8 to 1,638.1.
News Corp dropped 62 cents to ADollars 16.90 following news this week that
Mr Barry Diller had resigned as chairman and chief executive of Fox, the
group's television and film subsidiary.
SEOUL retreated for the third straight day as a decline in cash deposits
with securities firms, and political uncertainty before the general
election, sapped the market's energy. Goldstar, the nation's second largest
electronics maker, tumbled to its bottom limit for the second day in a row
to end Won600 lower at Won13,500, following worse than expected 1991
results. The composite index fell 10.65 to 621.42 in turnover of
Won206.67bn.
SINGAPORE closed weaker after light trading while KUALA LUMPUR turned
firmer. Both markets were still digesting Tuesday's news of a Dollars 3bn
lawsuit filed in California against Malaysia's government-owned Bank
Bumiputra. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 8.85 to 1,484.42 while
the KLSE composite index improved 0.87 to 603.16.
TAIWAN continued to decline on fears that the government might tighten the
money supply further. The textile sector led the day's losses and the
construction sector was the only gainer. The weighted index receded 36.23 to
4,951.50 in TDollars 36.8bn turnover.
MANILA was disappointed that Philippine Long Distance Telephone's 15 per
cent stock dividend will not be paid until June 15. The composite index fell
21.67 to 1,193.48.
BOMBAY rose to a record high, boosted by Tuesday's railway budget which
spared industry by proposing lower than expected increases in freight rates.
The BSE index forged ahead 126.25 to 2,617.52.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Italian investment
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGNERS should not be discouraged from investing in Italy if a weak
government emerges from the general election in April, because this outcome
should hasten the demise of traditional political parties who are not
attuned to the country's economic needs, according to Mr Piero Ottone, a
leading political commentator, writes Antonia Sharpe.
Mr Ottone told UK fund managers attending a seminar in London hosted by
Pastorino, a leading Milan brokerage house, that there are already signs of
a new political formation in Italy which is ready to give incentives to the
business community, especially to the medium-sized and small companies which
form the backbone of the economy.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris resume
upward march
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR BOURSES resumed their upward march after Tuesday's brief setback,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had a strong day, as trading concentrated on Volkswagen and
second-liners. The DAX index closed up 14.97 at 1,737.27, the day's high,
while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 2.60 to 704.29. Volume
rose to DM7.6bn from DM7.3bn.
VW gained DM5.50 to DM362.00 as the market was caught short by a rush of buy
orders. The stock was also lifted by reports that the new Golf was virtually
booked out until the end of September and that the company was introducing
extra shifts to meet demand. However, analysts cautioned that the new Golf
was aggressively priced, which suggested little enhancement to profit
margins.
Among second-liners, Henkel closed DM11.40 at DM608.90 and Altana gained
DM20 to DM670. Schering added DM18.50 to DM867.
PARIS also ended at the day's high as international investors resumed their
buying of cyclical stocks, encouraged by the stronger dollar. The CAC-40
index added 27.78 or 1.4 rate turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Among the index heavyweights, Elf added FFr7.40 to FFr386.50, Michelin put
on FFr5.10 to FFr170 and Peugeot rose FFr17 to FFr747.
The supermarket group Casino climbed FFr9.40 to FFr168.40 in good volume of
245,900 shares and the retailer Promodes rose FFr96 to FFr3,125 on rumours
that the two will merge.
Hachette jumped FFr16 or 9.9 per cent to FFr178 on reports that it will
reduce its stake in the troubled television company La Cinq from 25 per cent
to 10 per cent.
The drinks company Remy Cointreau gained FFr14.90 or 7.8 per cent to
FFr204.90 on light volume of 6,475 shares. BZW, which is believed to be
involved in Remy's share placement, is presenting the company in London on
March 13 and in Paris on March 16.
MILAN lost early gains. The Comit index fell 2.3 to 542.74 in turnover
estimated at L90bn after L125.7bn.
The session started strongly with Fiat gaining L81 to L5,131 and other
stocks in the Agnelli group rose, IFI adding L100 to L13,300. But weakness
in insurers and banks spread to the rest of the market. La Fondiaria dropped
L1,040 or 2.7 per cent to L37,800.
Credito Italiano fell L195 to L2,100 on fears that it will have to offer a
higher price to take control of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura.
AMSTERDAM saw strong foreign buying in Akzo, mainly from US and UK
investors, after the chemicals group reported a 13 per cent drop in 1991 net
profit. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 126.4.
Akzo's results were at the lower end of expectations, but analysts believe
that the group has good earnings potential this year. The shares closed at a
record high, up Fl 2.8 or 1.9 per cent, at Fl 150.50.
ZURICH was lifted by Frankfurt and London and the SPI index closed up 5.1 at
1,141.8. Oerlikon-Buehrle bearers closed up SFr38 or nearly 11 per cent to
SFr386 after the industrial and armaments group reported a smaller than
expected operating loss for 1991.
COPENHAGEN fell in quiet trading, the CSE index down 0.45 at 349.61, writes
Hilary Barnes. Baltica Holding, down DKr20 on Tuesday after reducing its
profits forecast, rose DKr7 to DKr352 while Novo Nordisk fell DKr4 to
DKr525.
STOCKHOLM drifted, the Affarsvarlden General Index inching ahead 0.1 to
927.3 in volume of SKr372m. Astra put on SKr7 to SKr577. SE Banken closed up
SKr1.50 at SKr46.50.
MADRID moved narrowly ahead, the general index closing up 2.8 at 262.34.
Telefonica continued to rise, gaining Pta35 or 3 per cent to Pta1,150.
Utilities were firm.
BRUSSELS was boosted by an afternoon fall in bond yields. The Bel-20 index
closed up 4.35 at 1,197.99 in heavy turnover of BFr1bn. GIB rose BFr38 to
BFr1,390 with nearly 160,000 shares traded.

FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: New Zealand's exporters gain as economy
recovers - Second-liners have risen sharply but heavyweights have remained
in the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices for many second- line stocks have risen sharply as New Zealand
investors show increasing confidence in the country's economic fortunes.
This follows a spate of good economic news, strong profit recoveries and
rising business confidence.
Interest rates have been falling and there has been a sharp drop in the New
Zealand dollar, which is helping exporters. Commodity prices have also risen
and inflation is now running at just 1 per cent, the lowest rate of any OECD
country. Some companies, especially those in the exporting sector, have seen
their share prices double or quadruple in recent months.
However, leading stocks have been immune to this trend and, judging from
their performance, the New Zealand market is in the doldrums. The NZSE-40
index, which started on September 30 last year, struggled back through the
1,500 mark this week, to close at 1,535.86 yesterday. The index has
recovered from its mid-December low of 1,409.86 but is still well off its
all-time high of 1,561.74 reached last November.
The index is dominated by heavyweights which have been out of favour. These
include Fletcher Challenge, the country's largest industrial company, which
is 79 cents below its 12-month high of NZDollars 4.21. The stock has been
depressed by last week's news of a sharp fall in profits from its
inter-national pulp and paper operations and lacklustre performances from
all of its other activities except petro-chemicals.
Brierley Investments is receiving little support as investors reassess its
future following the sale last December of Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, its
UK-based motor division. Suggestions that it might become a major player in
Australian aviation following yesterday's decision to increase its
shareholding in Air New Zealand to 42.5 per cent is also weighing on the
stock.
Telecom has been weak on reports that it is losing market share to its main
rival Clear Communications, which now gives a cheaper telephone service
across 80 per cent of New Zealand. But Telecom picked up a little this week
after stating that it was planning to expand in Australia and Asia.
Lion Nathan, the brewer, has yet to recover the ground it lost since its
proposed merger with Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) was
cancelled in January. News that it was going to acquire the 50 per cent
stake it does not own in National Brewing Holdings, Australia's second
biggest brewer, from ACIL was seen as the less favoured option.
However, second-liners tell a different story, especially exporters, which
have been in big demand.
The commodity exporter Mair, which was selling at 50 cents last year, has
jumped from 85 cents to NZDollars 2.45 this year, with most of the rise
following last week's announcement of a strong increase in profits, the
reinstatement of the dividend and a one-for-three scrip issue.
Shares in niche primary producing companies such as the apple producers
Applefields and Eastern Equities, Grocorp and Agland have shown similar
rises.
Manufacturing exporters, which are prospering in Australia under the Closer
Economic Relations trade pact, have been sought. Ceramco, the engineering,
food and clothing conglomerate, has concentrated on high-quality lingerie
and now controls 25 per cent of the Australian market: its shares have risen
from 76 cents to NZDollars 2.55 this year.
Even the speculators are back. Remarkable movements have been seen in the
shares of the investment bank Fay, Richwhite - whose flamboyant founder, Mr
Michael Fay, is heading New Zealand's challenge in the America's Cup yacht
race.
Fay, Richwhite shares have moved in tandem with the success or otherwise of
the yacht's performance in the qualifying races. In one burst they shot from
70 cents to NZDollars 1.19, but stood at 90 cents yesterday.
All of these fluctuations have been in spite of warnings from the company
that there is nothing in its current trading to support such sharp
movements.
History is repeating itself. In the previous challenge, the company, then
known as Capital Markets, saw its shares advance from a few cents to over
NZDollars 8 when it seemed the challenge might be successful.

NORWAY IS to host talks between ministers of oil producing and consuming

last year between the traditionally opposed camps, reports Reuter from
Paris.
An official at the Norwegian embassy here said that Norway would invite oil,
energy and foreign affairs ministers from about 20 countries, including
producers and consumers, to meet in Bergen on July 2 and 3. Norway made its
initiative public yesterday at a three-day gathering of technical experts

FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices 'could fall still
further'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE market, already close to 17-year lows, could fall still further
before moving higher in a few months, according to the latest report from ED
&amp; F. Man.
Man believes there are three factors behind the recent fall, which has left
prices similar to the early 1970s in nominal terms but 60 per cent lower if
adjusted for inflation.
First the bullish influence of the approach of International Coffee
Organisation meetings is now almost non-existent; in fact ICO talks seem to
have become a negative factor. Second, New York speculators have moved from
holding long positions last September to short positions. Third,
hard-pressed producers simply cannot afford to hold back sales, and
roasters, particularly in the US, are more concerned about aggressive
competition in the retail business.
'In all sectors the sentiment seems to be that while prices may recover
during the course of the year, it is too dangerous to act now on the
assumption that there will be no short-run downward moves in the price of
coffee,' says Man.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK farmers competing on equal
terms, says Gummer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FARMERS in general are competing on equal terms with other farmers in the
European Community, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, told the House of
Commons Agriculture Committee yesterday.
'It is very difficult to argue that taken overall the British farmer is at a
disadvantage,' Mr Gummer told the committee, which is looking at the UK's
Pounds 5.4bn food and drink trade gap.
Mr Gummer said he would vigorously prosecute any case where the UK was shown
to be unfairly discriminated against and that had any hope of standing up in
the European Court. However, the court was a last resort because of the
length of time involved; most cases could be resolved speedily through the
commission or by bilateral pressure.
Asked if he was pressing for increased EC milk quotas for the UK, which is
not self-sufficient in dairy products, Mr Gummer said the idea of
self-sufficiency had been signed away to the single European market. If the
UK were to seek more milk quota, the French would in future be entitled to
call for sufficient quota to be self-sufficient in sheepmeat. France is an
important market for UK sheepmeat.
While the UK was against quotas, once they had been established as they have
been for milk it was difficult to remove them, Mr Gummer said. He also
pointed out that UK milk was still being sold into intervention. It should
be perfectly possible to restructure the industry to manufacture for the top
end of the market, he suggested.
British food standards were the highest in the world, but the image of
British food abroad was not as good as it should be. This could be changed
in time, Mr Gummer said pointing to several British success stories - the
sliced loaf, used to make 'le British sandwich', beef, lamb, biscuits, and
jams.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo American tops exploration
league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION of the UK may claim to be the world's biggest mining group
but its exploration expenditure last year fell below that of its main rival,
the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.
According to a survey by the Metals Economics Group of Canada, RTZ expected
to spend USDollars 100m on grassroots exploration in 1991 whereas Anglo
budgeted Dollars 102m. When associated companies are taken into account, the
RTZ group budget was Dollars 200m compared with Anglo's Dollars 221m.
The Anglo spending includes Dollars 60m by its De Beers diamond associate,
Dollars 22m by Minorco, its overseas investment arm, and Dollars 12m by Gold
Fields of South Africa, which MEG includes because of Anglo's 25.9 per cent
shareholding in GFSA.
Nine companies are listed in the RTZ group, including CRA of Australia,
which budgeted Dollars 86m exploration spending for last year.
Other big exploration spenders last year included Canada's Noranda, with a
budgeted Falconbridge) and the 11 companies knit into the combine comprised
of MIM, Asarco, Cominco, Teck and Metallgesellschaft,which between them
expected to spend Dollars 125m. Placer Dome budgeted to spend Dollars 60m,
as did the Anglovaal group. BHP was scheduled to spend Dollars 54m on
non-ferrous metals exploration, Newmont Mining Dollars 50m and Western
Mining Dollars 44m.
MEG says the Hanson conglomerate's US gold subsidiary, Gold Fields Mining
Corporation, expected to maintain its exploration budget at Dollars 17m.
The survey covered 153 mining companies with annual exploration budgets of
more than Dollars 1m. MEG estimates these accounted for 80 per cent of all
worldwide spending on non-ferrous metals exploration (the survey excludes
iron ore, bauxite, coal or oil and gas exploration). It says there was an 8
per cent fall in expenditure by the companies surveyed compared with 1990.
Of the Dollars 1.8bn total, Dollars 430m was directed to projects in Canada,
Dollars 353m to Australia and Dollars 341m to the US.
MEG points out that, although it is still attracting most spending, Canada's
exploration level has fallen sharply from 1987 and 1988 when favourable tax
treatment for investors boosted spending to more than Dollars 1bn in each
year.
US expenditures have remained relatively stable but Australian spending has
fallen steadily since 1987. Rough estimates put spending in South Africa at
Dollars 245m, in South America at Dollars 200m, the south Pacific region at
Dollars 125m, Europe at Dollars 80m and Africa outside South Africa at
Dollars 70m.
Gold exploration attracted more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of total
spending while base metals exploration, having recovered from the depressed
levels of the mid-1980s, accounted for 31 per cent.
MEG says: 'Many of the major companies have kept up a relatively constant
base metals exploration effort from year to year, but smaller companies are
now joining in as the low gold price continues to dampen investor interest
in gold.
Corporate Exploration Strategies: USDollars 9,500 from MEG, 2000 Barrington
Street, PO Box 2206, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3J 3C4.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Happier times for Peru's 'big
gringo octopus' - Things are looking up at the country's foreign-owned
mining giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR of cautious celebration pervades the Lima headquarters of Southern
Peru Copper Corporation, the country's principal foreign investor and
producer of two-thirds of all Peru's copper. Not only was last year's
production of blister from its Ilo smelter a record, but a long-standing
dispute with the government has amicably ended - and SPCC is about to embark
on a Dollars 300m investment programme.
'We've now got our plate full with five new projects,' says Mr Charles
Preble, the corporation's president, who has spent 26 years of his life with
the company he jokingly calls 'the big gringo octopus'. Eight engineering
companies are currently bidding for construction of two new electro-winning
plants - the combined price tag is about USDollars 100m.
The new plant at Cuajone, a copper porphyry deposit 650 miles south of Lima,
which treats some 20m tonnes of ore annually, will come on stream in March
next year. Nearby Toquepala's larger electro-winning project will take twice
as long. Combined output from the two new plants will be close to 40,000
tonnes a year of cathode copper, increasing Peru's total production by about
9 per cent.
Southern Peru, with annual sales around Dollars 650m, has made a 'firm
commitment to the Peruvian government' to plough a further Dollars 100m into
plant and equipment renewal over the next five years - well above average
annual investment. The other projects, together making up the third Dollars
100m tranche, are broadly environmental: a small sewage treatment plant for
the Ilo camp, a tailings disposal facility and a partial capture acid plant
for the Ilo smelter, a continuing thorn in the flesh both for the
corporation and for local inhabitants and farmers who regularly claim
substantial compensation for damage to health and crops from smelter
'fall-out' gases.
The problem with producing 155,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid annually at Ilo
is that Peru's market is already saturated. Acid capture plants at the
state-owned Cajamarquilla and Centromin refineries can produce 225,000
tonnes a year. They operate at about 72 per cent capacity and still sell
only 80 per cent of output. 'This is a loss project all the way,' says Mr
Preble, although he hopes to use some in Southern Peru's own projects,
capture part of the local market and maybe sell abroad too.
Despite the corporation's 35 long years of survival in what has been one of
the most difficult countries for foreign investors, banks abroad are showing
only 'guarded interest' in coming up with the Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m
of outside financing required for the handful of projects. 'Conditions for
investment have certainly improved,' says Mr Preble, 'but our impression is
that banks won't move fast to finance new projects until the Paris Club and
Peru's commercial debt is fully worked out.'
Among the avalanche of recent liberalising legislation, Mr Preble
particularly applauds freeing of remittances. Now that companies operating
in Peru can hold bank accounts anywhere it the world, remitting profits is
as simple as writing a cheque. 'And the Central Bank is no longer a player
in the inflow and outflow of capital, as it is, for example, in Chile -
that's enormously helpful.'
Southern Peru needed a boost. Last year had started tough with the company
posting a first quarter loss of Dollars 39m, mainly resulting from
exceptionally high petroleum costs (the corporation requires substantial
quantities of 'Residual 6' to generate electricity to operate the Cuajone
and Toquepala mines), an emergency 10 per cent government levy on exports
and labour costs that increased far faster than the dollar exchange rate.
Most of that loss was recovered in the second half through strict austerity
measures, permission for direct import of cheaper petroleum and personnel
reductions where feasible. By year's end, the corporation's payroll had
dropped by several hundred to 5,550 - and there have been no strikes for 18
months.
'We're still asking the accounts department daily whether we actually ended
1991 in profit,' says Mr Preble. Different accounting systems mean that US
head office (SPCC is a branch) calculates around break-even, while
'according to the Peruvians we made money'.
The 1.79m short tons (2,000 lb) of copper concentrates processed at Ilo last
year - which included some purchased from state-owned mines Tintaya and
Cerro Verde - produced a record 300,117 short tons of blister, 99.2 per cent
pure. Two-thirds of this goes to state-owned Mineroperu's refinery also at
Ilo to be made into 99.98 per cent pure copper cathodes. The rest is
exported as blister, mainly for electrical use in Europe and the Far East.
Southern Peru says it has no plans yet awhile to acquire and develop the
large but low-grade Quellaveco copper deposit which lies between Cuajone and
Toquepala. The corporation's two mines have proven reserves lasting well
into the first decade of the 21st century, and the huge open pits, already
more than 1,750 feet deep, may reveal more riches yet.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: False rumours lift zinc market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALSE RUMOURS that one of the world's biggest zinc smelters was to cut
production drove the metal's price up strongly on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday.
Zinc for delivery in three months closed at Dollars 1,180.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 33.50. The price has risen by nearly 5 per cent this week on
nervousness about supply disruptions even though analysts insist that stocks
are high and rising and the market is heading for another supply surplus
this year.
After the market closed last night, Cominco, the Canadian group, denied
persistent rumours that it was to cut output at its Trail smelter in British
Columbia. The smelter is scheduled to produce 270,000 tonnes of zinc and
110,000 tonnes of lead this year. Cominco earlier announced a cut of 500
jobs at Trail to save Dollars 50m a year.
Also underpinning the zinc price is the force majeure at Minero Peru's
93,000 tonnes-a-year Cajamarquilla smelter - although it is delivering some
metal to customers - and labour contract talks at Big River Minerals' 80,000
tonnes-a-year smelter in the US.
Analysts pointed out that nearly half of zinc demand came from the
galvanised steel industry and the main users, the construction and
automotive industries, were unlikely to recover from recession until towards
the end of 1992.
'Demand is not healthy. There have not been enough cuts in production. But
the market is being driven by sentiment,' said Ms Karen Norton, analyst with
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.

Platinum went in to retreat on the London bullion market after Tuesday's
confusion over the new Corning catalytic converter, which turned out to be
an additional pollution control device for cars. London dealers said that
positions being unwound on Nymex were pushing platinum lower while proving
supportive for gold. Strong chart support was pegged at Dollars 350 and at
the parity level with gold. In addition, downward pressure was mounting on
platinum on fears US that the economic recovery is faltering after Tuesday's
lowest consumer confidence index figures for 17 years. However, on Nymex
platinum futures were firmer at midday as support levels survived early
tests. Comex gold prices were easier at midday as investors continued to
shun the market and turn to stocks. 'People are making money in the stock
market. That, more than any other reason, is why gold is dead in the water,'
one analyst said. On the LME copper backtracked from earlier 2 1/2 -month
highs in reaction to talk that Codelco unions had postponed strike action.
But after the close, a union official said that the protest plan was still
on at El Teniente. Aluminium retreated from earlier seven-month highs in the
afternoon on profit taking.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: CP programme goes from
strength to strength - The first anniversary of a rapidly-expanding German
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week, an important anniversary was celebrated in the German financial
markets - it was a year since Daimler Benz launched Germany's first
commercial paper (CP) programme.
Since that first DM1.5bn (Dollars 937m) programme in mid-February, the
market has grown in leaps and bounds. The total value of programmes amounts
to DM25bn and the Deutsche Bank, arranger and chief dealer to the
overwhelming majority of issues so far, is predicting the figure will rise
to DM40bn by the end of the current year. Of this, half will be issued and
outstanding in the market place, the bank said.
The market came into existence because of the abolition of stock turnover
tax early last year and the waiving of the requirement that German companies
should seek Ministry of Finance permission for domestic debt issues. Before
then, costs and complications meant the only way for German companies to
issue D-Mark denominated paper in short maturities was via the Euromarkets.
Treasurers have seized the opportunity to raise funds on more favourable
terms than conventional bank borrowings. There have been a total of 34
issuers so far, 14 of them tapping the market since October.
The majority of the issuers are large German corporates - Volkswagen,
Bayerische Motoren Werke, Hoesch and Hoechst are among those represented.
The biggest issuer by far is the Treuhand, the German government's
privatisation agency for the east of the country, which last week announced
plans to double the size of its existing programme to DM10bn, saying that CP
was a particularly flexible and cost-effective form of borrowing with
interest rates at an average of 20 basis points lower than equivalent money
market loans.
With so many issuers issuing so much paper in so short a time, it is not
surprising there is jubilation in the corporate finance department of
Deutsche Bank, which has been involved as arranger or dealer in all but
seven of the issues - and in the German financial community as a whole,
which sees the rapid development of the market as an important boost for the
country's status as a financial centre.
The German market has quickly grown to be larger than its UK counterpart -
where outstandings total Pounds 5bn (Dollars 8.5bn) according to IBCA, the
London-based rating agency - but it is still only a fraction of the size of
the US market, where outstandings are USDollars 560bn compared with the
DM20bn forecast by Deutsche Bank for Germany by the end of the year.
As a recent commentary from Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency puts it:
'Despite the positive signs . . . to become an effective source of
short-term funding the market must continue to expand. To establish a
sufficient critical mass for depth, liquidity and efficiency, the numbers of
issuers should ultimately grow by several times its current base - drawing
on a diversified group of issuers as the market builds up outstandings.'
Observers say that for the market to develop in this way, two conditions
must be fulfilled. Firstly, international investors should play a much
bigger role - at present they own only 20 per cent of all outstandings
whilst the other 80 per cent is in the hands of domestic German investors.
Second, medium-sized and smaller companies should be encouraged to become
issuers, thus broadening investors' options - at present the bulk of issuers
are very large German companies.
It is not just the rating agencies such as S&amp;P's and Moody's - both of which
set up German operations last year - which say the key to both these
developments is the wider use of ratings. In an interview with the Financial
Times last week, Mr Frank Heintzeler, Deutsche Bank's head of corporate
finance, said his advice to all clients seeking a listing was to get a
rating.
'In the long run, it will help them with their cost of funds,' he said. It
would also allow investors, especially overseas investors, to come to a
better assessment of the risks attached to each individual issue, he said.
So far, Volkswagen is the only German company to have published a rating for
its domestic CP programme. The only other three issuers to have had their
paper rated were the German subsidiaries of large international companies -
Alcatel, Procter &amp; Gamble and Fiat.
Otherwise, in a reverse of the practice on the US and other markets, no
issuers have had themselves rated at all. German issuers have been able to
get away without a formal third-party assessment of their creditworthiness
because of their good name with domestic investors - and also the good name
of the sponsoring bank.
Mr Heintzeler, of Deutsche Bank, said: 'Up until now they all achieved good
terms, but there is already a definite trend towards differentiation on the
part of investors, and with higher volumes there will be more discrepancies
between the terms individual issuers can obtain.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Bell Canada in CDollars 125m five-year
Eurobond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issue activity was muted in the international bond market yesterday,
with issuers finding only small pockets of demand for new paper.
Canadian dollar bonds reacted positively to a government budget statement
overnight on Tuesday, with benchmark government bonds gaining around  1/8 of
a point in early trading yesterday.
Bell Canada, the telephone company, took the opportunity to launch a
CDollars 125m five-year Eurobond issue, lead-manged by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The 8 7/8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
100.375, where the yield spread over Canadian government bonds was 62 basis
points.
Participants in the deal expected strong demand from continental European
retail investors, attracted by high coupon and status of the issuer.
In contrast, the Australian dollar sector gave a less welcoming reception to
a budget statement by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, which
was seen as leaving little room for a further cut in Australian interest
rates.
Benchmark government bonds at the three-year maturity fell by nearly 1/2 a
point immediately after the statement, before recovering some of the lost
ground.
Syndicate managers said that the negative tone could reduce the number of
investors willing to re-invest the proceeds of maturing Australian dollar
bonds back into new issues.
KFW, the German government-backed finance agency, added Ecu150m to its
outstanding 8 1/2 per cent Ecu250m five-year issue launched at the end of
January. Deutsche Bank Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs International
placed the bonds with a small group of investors at an undisclosed price.
This cautious approach underlined the poor tone of the market, with even
top-rated borrowers unwilling to risk substantial new issues.
In the D-Mark sector, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC) launched a
DM200m three-year deal via Deutsche Bank, aimed at German investors.
However, new issue supply is expected to pause over the next week with
German public holidays disrupting market activity.
TMCC swapped the proceeds of the issue into floating-rate dollars. However,
swap spreads have tightened recently, making the D-Mark sector less
attractive to non-German companies.
In the Swiss market, Tjiwi Kimia, Indonesia's largest pulp and paper company
and part of the Sinar Mas group, launched a SFr50m convertible bond
offering, the second such offering for an Indonesian borrower in the Swiss
market.
Although the Indonesian stock market is now open to foreign investors, many
Swiss investors prefer the convertible structure, according to lead manager
Credit Suisse.
National Bank of Hungary yesterday unveiled plans to raise DM600m on the
German bond market, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
The seven-year bond issue will have a coupon of 10.25 per cent and will be
priced on March 11 by Deutsche Bank, which has been awarded the mandate to
lead manage the issue.
The issue is considerably larger than the National Bank's two most recent
bond issues. Last year, it launched a Dollars 100m issue and a Ecu200m issue
in the international bond market.
Speaking in Frankfurt, Mr Frigyes Harshegyi, vice-president of the Hungarian
bank, said it was considering making further issues this year, probably on
the US dollar and Ecu Euromarkets, although an issue in Swiss francs was
also a possibility.
MR Micheal von Brentano has stepped down as chairman of the International
Primary Markets Association (IPMA), which represents top new issue
underwriting firms in the international and domestic bond markets, writes
Simon London.
He is to take up an appointment as a partner of Merck Finck &amp; Co, the
private banking firm owned by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr Brentano was head
of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in London from its formation in 1985 until
his retirement last year to work full-time for IPMA.

<TEXT>
HESSISCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (Helaba), the large German financial
institution based in the state of Hesse, yesterday reported sharply
increased earnings for 1991.
Reflecting generally buoyant conditions for Germany's banking sector last
year, the bank increased its partial operating profits by 58 per cent to
DM256m (Dollars 160m).
The bank said the main reason for the increase was a surge in interest
income, which climbed by DM86.9m to DM613.5m, combined with an increase in
margins to 0.82 per cent. Including a modest 4 per cent increase in
own-account trading profits, the bank's total operating profits rose by 43.6
per cent to DM316.4m.
The bank said the good result would allow it to pay an unchanged dividend
for 1991, to make generous increases to hidden and open reserves of the
bank, and to bolster risk provisions, particularly in respect of loans to
problem countries.

HANWA, the Japanese steel-maker led by Mr Shigeru Kita, who is renowned for
his love of zaitech - financial engineering - said it would post losses of
Y25bn (Dollars 195.31m) on its stock and trust fund investments and
long-term stock holdings for the current year to March.
Hanwa said the losses were due to liquidation of tokkin - specified money
trusts - and other trust funds. The company expects to reduce funds under
investment management to Y300bn, half of the balance of last September.
Hanwa has been famous among the Tokyo financial community for its active
trading in the foreign exchange markets.
However, a company official said the negative image of stock investments and
market speculation had prompted it to liquidate its holdings. The low return
on equity investments has also caused Hanwa to review its investment
strategy.
Hanwa said it would move to liquidate all its investment trusts for the time
being. To cover the fund management losses, it expects to realise profits
through sales of bonds and other investments.
Earnings projections for the current year to March are unchanged, and the
company expects a 33 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to
Y25bn, on a 0.3 per cent decline in sales to Y750bn.

HONGKONG and China Gas, the monopoly supplier of piped gas to the colony,
yesterday announced a 20 per cent rise in 1991 net earnings to HKDollars
778.7m (USDollars 110.5m), against HKDollars 648.2m in 1990.
Turnover for the company, better know as Towngas, rose 19 per cent to
HKDollars 2.65bn from HKDollars 2.22bn.
Towngas has been steadily building its customer base, especially in the New
Territories, with about 70,000 added to the network last year, raising the
total to 829,292.
The company also declared a one-for-five bonus share issue, and announced an
allocation of warrants to shareholders on a one-for-10 basis.
The warrants give shareholders the right to convert into shares at a price
of HKDollars 13.30 between June this year and June 1994. This compares with
a share price of HKDollars 13.80 at yesterday's close.
Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman, forecast continued progress during 1992, with
sales climbing another 10 per cent and the addition of 70,000 customers to
the Towngas network.
The directors, who expect a strong year ahead, recommended a final dividend
of 21 cents a share which, with the interim dividend of 12 cents, makes a
total for the year of 33 cents.

<TEXT>
HONGKONG Bank of Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, has posted a net deficit of ADollars 37.8m
(USDollars 28.4m) for 1991, adding to the litany of losses reported by
foreign banks operating in Australia.
However, the result represents an improvement on the previous year's
ADollars 273m loss, and reflects a reduction in bad and doubtful debt
provisions, from ADollars 221m to ADollars 128.4m.
It follows the announcement of a ADollars 103m loss by NatWest Australia and
a ADollars 230m loss by Citibank.

<TEXT>
TYNDALL Australia, the funds management and life insurance group, has
emerged from a period of restructuring with a strong revenue and earnings
performance for 1991.
The company, in which Sir Ronald Brierley's London-based investment vehicle,
GPG, acquired a large shareholding late last year, turned a ADollars 72.4m
loss into an ADollars 8.6m (USDollars 6.5m) profit, on revenues of ADollars
24.1m against ADollars 19.7m.
The previous result reflected large write-offs, particularly in life
insurance operations. These have became the company's profit mainstay in
1991, earning ADollars 9.4m pre-tax.
Mr Ron Hunwick, Tyndall managing director, said the company's disability and
term life products had recorded growth of 46 per cent.
The company yesterday also launched a previously-announced ADollars 7.5m
rights issue, fully-underwritten by GPG, with the proceeds earmarked for
debt reduction.
The result followed a ADollars 151,000 tax credit, against ADollars 86,000
previously. Interest provision eased from ADollars 5.6m to ADollars 4.8m.
Dividend has again been omitted.
Clutha, the New South Wales coal producer, turned a ADollars 345,000 loss
into a ADollars 2.5m profit in the half-year to December.

control of bank

<TEXT>
THE Espirito Santo family has regained control of Banco Espirito Santo e
Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), Portugal's third largest bank, following the
completion of its privatisation this week.
The family owned a majority shareholding in the bank before its
nationalisation in 1975. From exile in Brazil, it has steadily built up a
new international financial group with holdings in Europe, the US and South
America.
The group began its come-back in Portugal in the 1980s, bought back control
of Tranquilidade, one of Portugal's leading insurance companies, when it was
privatised in 1990, and last July secured 23 per cent stake in BESCL when 40
per cent of the bank was sold.
In this second stage of privatisation, 24m shares representing 60 per cent
of the bank's share capital were sold raising Es89bn (Dollars 659m) - 1.7m
shares remained with an underwriting syndicate. The Espirito Santo group
(GES) increased its holding to 43 per cent in association with Credit
Agricole of France which holds 9.5 per cent.
In an earlier interview with the Financial Times, Mr Ricardo Espirito Santo
Salgado, group chairman, said a 40 per cent stake would be sufficient to
control the bank in view of the capital's dispersal among a large number of
small investors.
He said BESCL, a commercial bank with a domestic market share of around 9
per cent, would be the centre of the group but remain a retail bank, with
other group companies specialising in investment banking and other
activities both in Portugal and abroad.
BESCL is expected to show a 20 per cent rise in assets to Es1,449bn last
year from Es1,197bn in 1990 and net profits up to Es15bn from Es12.5bn. It
recently bought Banco Industrial del Mediterraneo of Spain.

<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments (BIL) has increased its stake in Air New Zealand to
42.5 per cent. Its announcement yesterday came as the airline reported a
sharp upturn in performance.
The airline's after-tax profit rose to NZDollars 58.27m (USDollars 31.6m) in
the six months to December 31, compared with NZDollars 10.88m for the six
months to September 30 1990. The company has changed its year-end to June.
Operating profits swung from a loss of NZDollars 7.2m to a profit of
NZDollars 65.5m. Abnormal items, relating to redundancy payments, reduced
operating profit by NZDollars 7.3m.
Brierley said it had bought American Airline's 5 per cent stake in Air New
Zealand for NZDollars 37m. It was paying NZDollars 1.80 a share, compared
with a market price of about NZDollars 1.84.
The move follows widespread reports that Air New Zealand is to play a big
role in the expected deregulation of the Australian airline industry.
American Airlines had previously tried to sell its stake to Qantas, which
owns 20 per cent of Air New Zealand, but the sale was rejected by the
government on the grounds that it would give Qantas market dominance.
When Air New Zealand was privatised, BIL bought an initial 65 per cent, but
this was reduced to 35 per cent through a public flotation. Last year, BIL
bought an additional 2.5 per cent from American Airlines.
Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said Air New Zealand was on target to reach a
NZDollars 85m operating profit for the year to June 30. He said the company
usually experienced a much lower level of demand in the April-June quarter
and the trend was expected to continue this year.
The company is reintroducing an interim dividend of 4 cents a share.

<TEXT>
SIAM Cement, the Thai conglomerate and largest cement producer in the
country, yesterday announced a fall in consolidated net profits to an
estimated Bt4.81bn (Dollars 200m) in 1991 from Bt5.35bn in 1990.
It blamed increased costs for the decline. Although the profits were below
expectations, this year's results are expected to benefit from low energy
prices and increased local cement production capacity, which will reduce the
need for expensive imports.
Consolidated net revenue was put at Bt53.17bn, up from Bt44.06bn in 1990.
For the parent company, net profit in 1991 fell to Bt3.89bn on net revenue
of Bt35.60bn, compared with 1990 profits of Bt4.71bn on revenue of
Bt31.06bn. Siam Cement proposed a final dividend of Bt9 a share, making an
unchanged total of Bt18 for the year.
The company said it had held prices stable for most of its products while
absorbing higher costs for fuel, financing and raw materials, including
imported bagged cement, which has to be sold at the prevailing local price.
'Their capacity is increasing very substantially,' said one broker in
Bangkok, 'so we expect their margins to increase very substantially, too, in
the next two years.'
Siam Cement plans to raise its annual capacity in Thailand to 16m tonnes by
October and to 19.5m tonnes by 1995, from the current 12.4m tonnes.
Other investments include the group's first overseas factory - a ceramic
tile plant in Tennessee in a joint venture with Finfloor of Italy - and a
Bt6bn joint venture with Yamato Kogyo of Japan to make structural steel in
Thailand. The group is also negotiating deals in Vietnam.
Mr Amaret Sila-on, the Thai commerce minister and former Siam Cement
executive, forecast that the country's cement production capacity would
double to 40m tonnes in the next five years. Although the industry was
well-placed to compete in the region, he said, Thailand could be constrained
in the long term by environmental and raw materials constraints.

<TEXT>
BANCA Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the state-owned bank, has been
restructured, grouping its activities into three separate holdings to cover
domestic banking operations, foreign banking, and para-banking activities
such as leasing, factoring and investment.
The move is primarily for fiscal reasons to comply with new regulations in
the 1992 budget law approved on December 30 and means the elimination of
BCI's property division.
The budget law obliged the bank to revalue its property assets and this week
the board approved an increase in the latter's book value of L1,390bn
(Dollars 1.13bn), bringing the total to L5,330bn.
If the property division had been retained separately the increased book
value of the four holdings would reportedly have been L7,343bn.
The new holdings will be called Comit Holding Italia, Comit Holding
International and Comit Holding respectively.
The board has also announced preliminary results for 1991 with gross
operating earnings of L1,139bn against L1,111bn in 1990 a modest 2.5 per
cent increase.

<TEXT>
ASAHI Glass, the leading Japanese glass-maker, reported a 19 per cent fall
in consolidated pre-tax profit, to Y63.59bn (Dollars 496.79m), in the year
to end-December. The results reflect the downturn in the country's
construction and car industries.
Sales rose 1.1 per cent to Y1,248bn, while parent company sales rose 0.4 per
cent to Y1,022bn. Pre-tax profit fell by 5.3 per cent Y60.23bn.
However, parent operating profit rose by 8.4 per cent to Y47.77bn. The
company reported a significant fall in non-operating income from interest
and dividends, and sales of shares in subsidiaries, which were affected by
turbulence in Japanese financial markets.
It said sales of flat glass and construction materials slowed in tandem with
a fall in new housing starts, but there was an increase in sales of
high-performance glass for the industry. Slower demand from car-makers led
to sluggish sales of fabricated glass, while total glass sales fell 0.8 per
cent to Y526bn.
Asahi said 'a quick expansion of domestic demand' was unlikely this year,
and forecast a 3.7 per cent increase in parent sales to Y1,060bn.

BANCO Portugues de Investimento (BPI), Portugal's leading private investment
bank, yesterday reported strong growth for 1991.
The bank's consolidated group results, which include for the first time
those of Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay (BFB), the former state-owned commercial
bank it bought last summer, show a 470 per cent rise in assets from Es171bn
(Dollars 1.3bn) in 1990 to Es975.1bn last year. Without BFB, group assets
rose 78 per cent to Es305bn.
Net profits rose 8 per cent from Es8.6bn in 1990 to Es9.3bn last year, but
results for 1990 were boosted by extraordinary income of Es3.8bn from BPI's
sale of an 11 per cent stake in Banco de Comercio e Industria.
BPI paid Es36bn for 80 per cent of BFB, though Es28bn remained within BFB to
strengthen its capital and build up its reserves and pension fund. It will
underwrite the sale this year of the state's remaining 20 per cent stake in
BFB. It recently sold 10 per cent of BFB to Banco Itau of Brazil.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Tide turns for eastern
shipbuilders - Recovery in the Japanese and Korean shipyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE and South Korean shipbuilders have emerged from the troubled waters
of recession aware that the most significant threat to their dominance of
the international shipbuilding industry is rivalry between them.
Companies in both countries have full order books, rising profits and a lead
in new construction and environment-related technologies. While they have
survived the market turbulence of the past decade, they no longer regard the
European industry as a serious threat, and Japanese builders are turning
down orders in the expectation that vessel prices can only increase.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), the largest Japanese builder, said 'we
were spilling blood a year ago', but now 'business is smooth'.
In Korea, the revival has been rapid. Daewoo Shipbuilding, the country's
second-biggest yard, was rescued by the government in 1989, but this year is
likely to report its first annual profit since 1983.
The two industries, which say they had a new-found 'harmony' after years of
intense rivalry, are expected to take 70 per cent of the world market in
large vessels this decade, and they are setting a course to continue their
domination into the next decade.
Japan's big seven, including Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding and Hitachi
Zosen, had diversified away from shipbuilding after the first oil shock in
1973 and the collapse of new orders.
As a percentage of the total of heavy industrial companies' sales,
shipbuilding fell from 22 per cent in 1984 to about 10 per cent last year,
but the builders expect the figure will rise slightly and be a source of
steady profits.
In achieving these results, the companies have steered clear of trade
friction with Washington, which decided two years ago not to proceed with a
formal investigation into allegations by US builders that Japan's
'restructuring plans' were a guise for unfair government subsidies.
Government assistance has certainly played an important role in reviving the
two industries, but Japanese and Korean companies now control their own
destiny, having last year captured about 65 per cent of the world market.
Replacement demand for oil tankers built in the early and mid-1970s has
combined with new demand for vessels to fill company order books - Japanese
companies had an order backlog last September 14.2 per cent higher than the
previous year.
Demand is also coming from an increased emphasis on environmental safety,
leading to changes in vessel design and increased demand for vessels to
carry liquid natural gas (LNG), seen by Asian governments as an alternative
energy source to oil and coal.
US legislation, prompted by the Exxon Valdez disaster in March 1989,
requires the gradual introduction of double-hulled tankers, regarded as less
prone to spills but 20 per cent more expensive to build.
Meanwhile, officials at the Japan Marine Research Institute expect demand
for 20 to 25 new LNG ships by 1995 and close to 50 by the year 2000.
Japanese builders have a natural advantage because of about 18 new LNG
projects likely to produce demand for vessels, 10 have been backed by
Japanese energy companies, while South Korean utility companies are funding
three.
The Japanese industry has survived in spite of fears that shipbuilding would
be transferred to lower-cost countries such as China, largely by the
introduction of labour-saving technology.
In 1973, a very large crude carrier (VLCC) took a Japanese company about 1m
man-hours to build, but the figure is now close to 270,000 man-hours for the
most efficient yard run by Hitachi Zosen, one of the leading builders. The
big savings have been in welding, which is about 65 per cent automated, and
steel cutting, about 80 per cent automated.
The second advantage for the Japanese companies is that they are essentially
rebuilding the fleets of the large Japanese shipping lines. These shippers
have traditionally placed orders with Japanese builders, without much regard
to cost, which is now about 10 per cent higher than Korean or Taiwanese
yards.
The Korean Shipbuilders Association said a VLCC now cost about Dollars 100m,
compared with Dollars 38m in 1986. It was a measure of the Japanese yards'
confidence that Nippon Yusen, the Japanese flag carrier, last year ordered
two bulk carriers from a Taiwanese company, the China Shipbuilding
Corporation, the first it has ordered from outside Japan since the end of
the Second World War.
Nippon Yusen said Japanese yards had told it they would not be free to
handle that type of vessel for two or three years. The determination of
Japanese companies to limit supply has created opportunities for Korea.
'The Japanese cannot continue to expand,' says Mr Cho Choong Hooy, executive
vice-president for sales at Hyundai Heavy Industries, Korea's largest
builder. With many of the problems facing the Korean industry in the late
1980s now resolved, they are set to reverse the trend of falling market
share. This decline saw the share of outstanding international orders placed
at Korean yards fall from 30.2 per cent in 1987 to 24 per cent in 1990.
An important change for the Korean industry has been in labour relations.
The violent clashes between workers and riot police which had seemed set to
become an annual ritual at the end of the 1980s have now largely subsided.
The effects of improved labour relations are clearly visible on the
company's accounts.
Samsung Heavy Industries, like Daewoo Shipbuilding, will return its first
profit since the early 1980s. Halla Heavy Industries last year report-ed its
first profit since 1977.
The improvement in labour relations has made foreign shipping lines more
confident about placing orders at Korean yards, as the likelihood of a delay
in delivery - an important consideration for fleet operators - is now
remote. This has removed a traditional advantage for the very punctual
Japanese yards and reduces the threat of competition from Chinese yards
which have also earned a reputation for tardiness.
Japanese and Korean builders expect longer-term but limited competition from
China and some competition in LNG carrier construction from French builders,
which had dominated the sector two decades ago. In the 1970s, about 24 yards
worldwide were capable of building LNG ships, but now there are only 12,
eight of them in Japan.
Having established themselves as the world's second largest shipbuilders,
the Korean yards now have become less aggressive competitors. Japanese
executives say that Korean companies now understand the importance of
'harmony' in the industry - the implication is that the deep discounting of
the past is over.
'It used to be that the Koreans would ask you what your best price had been
from the Japanese and then they would just offer you 10 per cent less', said
one foreign shipping executive in Seoul. 'But now there is not the same
hunger to carve out market share.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Setback for Canadian resource
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Canadian resource companies, Repap and Westar Mining, have reported
large 1991 losses, but they are looking to a lower Canadian dollar and
firmer world markets to bring an improvement this year and in 1993.
Repap Enterprises, one of North America's biggest coated paper producers
with mills in New Brunswick and Wisconsin, reported a 1991 loss of CDollars
180m (USDollars 151.2m), or CDollars 2.90 a share, including CDollars 30m
special charges. This compares with a profit of CDollars 3.1m, or 13 cents,
in 1990.
Revenues were CDollars 1.06bn, down 13 per cent. Half the loss came in the
fourth quarter when market conditions led to temporary shutdowns.
About one-quarter of Repap's business is making softwood craft pulp for the
US and other markets. The Canadian paper mills also export most of their
output to the US.
Since the end of 1991, the Canadian dollar has declined about four basis
points to about 84 US cents and pulp prices have risen from USDollars 480 a
tonne to USDollars 540. Repap and other producers seek a 7.5 per cent
increase on April 1 to USDollars 580.
Firming markets and the lower dollar should help Repap this year, although
it might not return to profitability till 1993, analysts said.
Westar Mining lost CDollars 62.2m, or CDollars 3.66, on revenues of CDollars
457m in 1991, against a loss of CDollars 4.4m, or 49 cents, on revenues of
CDollars 446m in 1990. The company has been hit by lower coal prices and
higher mining costs.
Westar, British Columbia's biggest coal producer, is negotiating to
restructure its CDollars 336m debt.
It shipped 9m tonnes in 1991, up 6 per cent on 1990. Its market is mainly
Japan and a lower a dollar will help in 1992.
Westar Group, which owns 66 per cent of Westar Mining, is selling its forest
products affiliate.
Quebecor, the communications group, through its printing subsidiary is
planning to buy 60 per cent of Nadco Directory, a mid-sized US printer of
directories, from BCE. The price was not disclosed.
The US firm has annual sales of about USDollars 70m. BCE, holding company
for Bell Canada and Northern Telecom, will retain 40 per cent.
Quebecor Printing is North America's second biggest commercial printer. It
bought the late Robert Maxwell's graphics business in the US two years ago
and has completed several other acquisitions since then, including one in
Mexico.
BCE is moving out of printing to concentrate on its communications and
equipment business, plus a Canadian financial services subsidiary.
It has taken 60 per cent control of SHL Systemhouse, an international
computer systems integrator, meshing Systemhouse operations with its own
telecommunications business.

oversupply

ALCAN Aluminium says oversupply of metal will persist this year despite a
slowdown in exports from the former east bloc to the west in the first two
months.
Alcan is maintaining its quarterly dividend of 15 US cents but expects
another tough year, says Mr David Morton, chairman.
The Canadian company has pared capital outlays to USDollars 550m from
USDollars 880m in 1991 and the investment will be confined to completing
rolling mill capacity in the US and Germany. However, Alcan will keep
environmental spending up to USDollars 120m.
Mr Jacques Bougie, president, said Alcan will cut another USDollars 300m
from its cost base in 1992 and more in 1993. Productivity targets throughout
its bauxite, alumina, smelting and fabricating operations worldwide are now
set in a five-year time frame.
He said that although recent spot market prices reflected the slowdown in
the flow of east European metals to the west, Alcan was being extremely
cautious and suspects the inflow will resume soon due to foreign exchange
pressures.
Alcan has stopped work on the Kemano hydro-electric project in northern
British Columbia, required for the expansion of its smelter nearby,
following a court judgment on environmental issues now under appeal.
In 1991, Alcan posted a loss of USDollars 36m, or 25 cents a share, against
a profit of USDollars 543m, or Dollars 2.33, in 1990. Revenues were
USDollars 7.75bn against USDollars 8.7bn.

UNITED AIRLINES of the US is understood to have had talks on taking a
minority stake in Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), the French regional
airline opening 10 new routes in Europe over the next few months.
It is thought to be the only one of the top three US carriers to have done
so.
UAL joins British Airways in looking at a stake of up to 20 per cent in TAT.
Senior executives at TAT have indicated they are in preliminary talks with
up to four other carriers, but not American Airlines or Delta Airlines.
TAT also announced it was starting all-business class routes in Europe using
Paris as a hub. Services include Paris-Milan, from March 9, and
Paris-London, from March 30.
It is looking for a strong international partner following the disposal last
year by Air France, the French national airline, of its 35 per cent stake.
Mr Michel Marchais, founder of TAT, said he was prepared to sell 20 per cent
of his family's 72 per cent controlling interest to another airline.

<TEXT>
TELMEX, Mexico's telephone monopoly, recorded net profits of 6,986bn pesos
(Dollars 2.26bn) last year, a 77.8 per cent inflation-adjusted increase over
1990.
The higher-than-expected increase pushed the price of Telmex's American
Depositary Receipts, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, up Dollars 3 to
Dollars 58 in early trading yesterday.
Telmex's operating income rose by 46.5 per cent thanks to substantial rises
in tariffs and line expansion. In the last quarter, Telmex installed 299,000
new lines, compared with 346,000 in the first nine months of the year.
Telmex made Dollars 488m in financial gains last year, of which Dollars
204.3m came from a debt swap arranged between Telmex and the Mexican
government.
Other gains came from profits on the interest spread between Telmex dollar
debt and peso denominated cash, according to Mr Scott Kald of Smith Barney
in New York.

300m into Saks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTCORP, the inter-national bank formed in 1982 as a conduit for Arab
money into western industry, is to inject Dollars 300m of new equity into
Saks Fifth Avenue, the US retail group which it acquired via a leveraged
buyout from Britain's BAT Industries in 1990.
This is the first new equity financing since the buyout, although Saks has
securitised its property and trade receivables and issued Euro-notes as
means of paying down bank debt.
At the time of the Dollars 1.6bn buyout, the capital structure comprised
Dollars 600m of equity and about Dollars 350m of subordinated debt supplied
by Investcorp and its associated investors, and Dollars 775m of bank
financing, led by Manufacturers Hanover.
Yesterday, Mr Arthur Martinez, Saks vice-chairman, said the bank debt had
since been reduced to around Dollars 325m by the post-buyout financial
restructurings, and the new equity funds would go primarily towards paying
down the expensive subordinated debt.
There have been rumours of poor operating performance at Saks and late
payments to suppliers. However, Mr Martinez emphatically denied the latter,
and said that although 'trading was clearly very difficult' and 'it was very
hard to achieve plans,' the group remained 'substantially' profitable.
Shortly after the buyout, a confidential memorandum surfaced, indicating
Saks had fallen short of trading projections.
The equity injection, Mr Martinez said, was designed continue the
'de-leveraging' of the company and fund a new 'growth plan'.
Saks accompanied news of the equity injection with an announcement of a
Dollars 250m investment plan in new stores, renovations and infrastructure
improvements.
It said that much of this money would be invested in the next
two-and-a-half-years, with five new 'replacement' stores planned. According
to Mr Martinez, the plans could envisage four to six new stores, although
sites are not firm. Saks operates 48 stores.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH, the international media magnate whose News Corporation
last year restructured Dollars 8.2bn of group debt, said he hoped to raise
up to Dollars 1bn over the next 12 months through long-term securities that
will allow News Corporation to reduce its level of bank debt.
Mr Murdoch, who on Monday announced plans to succeed the departing Mr Barry
Diller as chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's Fox movie and
television group, disclosed the debt reduction plan in an interview.
'We are going to have good profits at News Corp (in the year that ends this
June 30) and as credit ratings improve we will go for more long-term debt
issues to pay down more bank debt,' he explained.
Turning to Fox, which contributed around Dollars 340m of News Corporation's
operating income of Dollars 1.2bn in the financial year to last June 30, Mr
Murdoch said he planned to devote three weeks out of every month on the
day-to-day operations of Fox Inc, the parent company of the 20th Century Fox
movie studio and the Fox television network.
Mr Diller, who built the Fox TV network single-handedly over the past five
years, surprised the US entertainment industry when he resigned on Monday in
order to form or acquire his own business.
'I never though of bringing anyone else in,' said Mr Murdoch, adding that he
had moved his base of operations to Los Angeles last year and planned to be
at Fox 'as much as Barry was'.
'Now I can get back to what I like to do the best, which is running the
business,' said Mr Murdoch, adding that Fox represents the biggest part of
News Corporation's earnings.
He said Fox's total operating income was likely to be Dollars 20m to Dollars
25m below last year's Dollars 340m level in the year to June 30, with the
movie studio's profits down by Dollars 30m to Dollars 40m and the television
network's earnings improved.
Mr Murdoch added he planned to be involved in all aspects of the film and
television business, including decisions on which films to make.
He admitted he does not have film experience, but explained: 'The role I
have to play is to say no, to employ an editor's judgment on movies and to
make people sell ideas to me.'

<TEXT>
OERLIKON-BUHRLE has reported an operating loss of SFr200m (Dollars 134.2m)
for 1990 - its sixth loss in as many years - but its new chairman said
yesterday the troubled Swiss armaments and industrial group was beginning to
recover. 'We can now think about shaping the future rather than coping with
the past,' Mr Hans Widmer said.
Oerlikon has been in decline for several years, mainly because the former
management, led by Mr Dietrich Buhrle for 34 years, was reluctant to
restructure its businesses. Group sales last year of SFr3.6bn were 25 per
cent lower than in 1985.
In late 1990, with borrowings soaring, the big Swiss banks forced Mr Buhrle
to resign and named Mr Philippe de Weck, the retired chairman of Union Bank
of Switzerland, to plan top management changes.
Mr Widmer, head of the Schweiter textile machinery group, was appointed
chairman in April and has since led a massive restructuring effort.
Provisions for restructuring amounted to SFr700m, but Mr Widmer said the
actions taken would lead quickly to a turnround in cash flow. The group
officially forecast it would be between SFr160m and SFr230m but Mr Widmer
said yesterday it could rise to SFr290m.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: French court rules that Exor
must bid for Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Agnelli family yesterday vowed to fight to the end for control of
Perrier, the celebrated French mineral water company, despite fresh
complications thrown up by a Paris Appeals Court ruling.
The court declared that Exor, the Perrier holding group controlled by the
Agnellis and their allies, must launch a bid for Perrier itself. The water
group is also facing a hostile direct bid from Nestle, the Swiss food
multinational, launched last month.
Depending on the outcome of Exor's talks with stock market regulators, this
could increase the cost of the Agnelli approach of using Exor to gain
control of Perrier, without launching a direct bid.
Exor had asked for this obligation to be suspended while the court made up
its mind on Exor's appeal for exemption from a ruling by the Conseil des
Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) that it should bid for the water group. That
decision is expected in mid-April.
However, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, said yesterday: 'We cannot
give up because of this.' Speaking in Rome, he admitted frustration. 'This
French affair has become long, intricate and tiresome for all,' he told
Reuters news agency. But the battle could be 'lengthy and finish well,' he
added.
Exor and its allies have acquired 49 per cent control of Perrier, well above
the 33 per cent threshold at which Exor should normally launch a two-thirds
bid, under French takeover rules.
The cost of buying the extra 17 per cent needed to lift the stake to 66 per
cent would in theory be nearly FFr1.9bn (Dollars 341m) at the FFr1,235 per
share at which Perrier last month sold a stake to Saint-Louis, the sugar
company allied to the Agnellis.
Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, launched a rival hostile bid for
Perrier at FFr1,475 per share a few days later, but Exor lawyers argued
yesterday that it could discharge its legal obligations by making an offer
at the lower price.
Presumably, nobody would then accept, so Exor and its allies could continue
to hold their 49 per cent stake at no extra cost. Exor said it would discuss
the details of when and at what price it would bid with the CBV.

help prop Akzo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, posted a 5 per cent decline in net profit
before extraordinary items in 1991, with buoyant results in pharmaceuticals
helping to offset a sharp fall in the profitability of the fibres sector.
Net profit on normal business operations before extraordinaries eased to Fl
691m (Dollars 373.5m) from Fl 729m in 1990, a result which the company
described yesterday as 'reasonably satisfactory' given continued recession
in the US and a downturn in economic conditions in Europe and Japan.
Net extraordinary charges of Fl 111m, which mainly represent the costs of
Akzo's planned reorganisation and streamlining, pushed overall net profit
down to Fl 580m, a decline of 13 per cent compared with 1990, when
extraordinary charges totalled Fl 64m.
Akzo repeated the statement made earlier this month that it would maintain
its 1991 dividend at Fl 6.50 despite the high costs of its restructuring
programme. Mr Aarnout Loudon, company chairman, said it was impossible to
predict results for the current year because of uncertainties about the
world economy, but added that 'the proposal to pay an unchanged dividend
expresses a measure of confidence in the performance of the business in
1992'.
Operating profit fell by Fl 105m to Fl 1.16bn, but this decline was largely
offset by a Fl 91m reduction in financing charges, enabling after-tax
earnings on consolidated operations to remain unchanged at Fl 615m. But a
steep fall in earnings at Century Enka, a 40 per cent-owned fibres joint
venture in India, cut the profit contribution from non-consolidated
companies to Fl 64m from Fl 103m.
The pharmaceuticals division, which is the smallest of Akzo's four in terms
of sales, made the single biggest contribution to earnings, with operating
profit rising to Fl 514m from Fl 429m. Operating results in fibres, however,
were more than halved to Fl 102m from Fl 218m.

<TEXT>
MARCH GROUP, the Spanish family-owned conglomerate, is seeking to raise
Pta50bn (Dollars 490m) from the sale of electric utility interests.
The hydroelectric energy business, which is based in the Pyrenees and has an
installed capacity of 300MW has been offered to Endesa, the state-controlled
utility and also to Iberdrola, the rival utility which is privately owned.
The disposal is the first affecting Aragonesas, a group acquired in 1988 by
Uralita, a leading construction material company controlled by the March
group.
The disposal, expected to raise up to Pta50bn, is the biggest yet planned by
the March group. Last year, the March family, whose interests span banking
as well as industry, sold its minority stake in Finanzauto, the top public
works machinery distributor in Spain.
Madrid analysts said yesterday that the move appeared aimed at breaking up
Aragonesas, which is expected to make a loss for 1991. They added that there
was now a question mark over the future of Aragonesas' chemical assets which
were supplied directly by the electricity producer.
The utility contributed about a third to Aragonesas' Pta3.36bn profits in
1990. But the company has been hit by sharply reduced earnings at its PVC
manufacturer, Aiscondel.

<TEXT>
CELSIUS, the Swedish state-owned industrial group, is to acquire Nobel
Industries' half-share in Swedish Ordnance, the armament company, for
SKr250m (Dollars 42.1m).
The deal will transform Celsius into Sweden's leading military equipment
manufacturer with an annual turnover of nearly SKr13bn, a capital base of
SKr2.8bn and liquidity of SKr4.3bn.
Swedish Ordnance was established at the end of 1990 as a joint partnership
between the Bofors division of Nobel and FFV, the state-owned arms company.
It makes advanced weapon systems for tanks, anti-aircraft equipment, naval
vessels as well as battle vehicles, and employs 6.300 people. Last year, its
sales totalled SKr4.7bn.
Celsius includes the Kockums group of marine technology products, including
submarines and surface combat ships which account for some 60 per cent of
its business activities.
As part of the deal, Celsius and Nobel industries have also agreed to spend
SKr375m on restructuring the Swedish Ordnance's defence equipment
activities. The company is also being provided with SKr600m in risk capital.
'Swedish Ordnance has now achieved the economic conditions to carry through
the structural measures that have been agreed on,' said Mr Olof Lund,
Celsius's chief executive. The company has an order book totalling SKr9bn,
he said.
Mr Lund said there were now real possibilities of expanding arms sales
abroad and establishing closer co-operation with foreign defence industries.
Celsius is one of the state companies awaiting privatisation.

<TEXT>
CAP Gemini Sogeti (CGS) Europe's largest computer services group, yesterday
announced a wide-ranging co-operation and share exchange deal with Volmac,
the Dutch market leader in which it already has a small stake.
The deal comes a fortnight after the French company's acquisition of
Programator, its main competitor in Scandinavia. It marks the latest step in
CGS's attempts to broaden its European market coverage, in line with
increasing demand from big corporate customers for services groups able to
handle contracts spanning several countries.
The partners will seek to increase their share of the developing market for
the provision of in-house computer services - 'facilities management' in
industry jargon - said Mr Michel Jalabert, development director for CGS.
The new group, yet to be named, will have 4,000 staff in the Benelux
countries, and annual sales equivalent to FFr2.7bn (Dollars 480m).
Under the agreement, the pair will pool their activities in the region in a
company to be 60 per cent-owned by a new holding group. The other 40 per
cent would be divided between Volmac's existing public shareholders,
institutional investors and WSG itself.
The new holding group will in turn be roughly two-thirds owned by CGS, and
one-third by The World Software Group (WSG), which is Volmac's holding
company.
However, the exact parities have yet to be fixed, said Mr Jalabert. CGS is
not planning to offer for the remainder of Volmac's shares, listed on the
Amsterdam stock market.
Volmac was founded in 1966, the same year as the companies which
subsequently formed CGS. The pair exchanged small minority stakes in 1988.
Mr Jalabert said the deal would not directly affect CGS's profits, which
fell by 10 per cent last year, but would help it boost its international
business. CGS has made more than 20 acquisitions over the past seven years.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jose Luis Varez, the Spanish financier, was yesterday poised to buy Grupo
Ibercorp, the troubled private bank at the centre of a scandal involving
allegations of insider dealing.
If it goes through, the acquisition will save Ibercorp from the threat of
receivership and contain at least some of the damage wrought by a scandal
which has cast a deep shadow over Spain's specialised banking sector.
Mr Varez controls Agepasa, a leading domestic fund management group, and
Banco Inversion, the investment bank which is a designated market-maker in
Spanish government bonds.
Ibercorp, known as the 'beautiful people's' bank and emblematic of the new
wealth in Spain, is the most spectacular casualty to date among the banking
boutiques created in the late 1980s. It potentially constitutes one of the
most damaging financial and political scandals in post-Franco Spain.
Ibercorp was driven into losses by the weakness of the Spanish stock market
and by difficulties in the interbank market. But its problems have been
fuelled by press allegations that social celebrities and public figures had
been given favourable treatment when Ibercorp's shares fell steeply.
Amid reports of massive withdrawals of investor funds from Ibercorp's
portfolio, the conservative opposition party, Partido Popular, has called
for a parliamentary investigation into possible fraud by Ibercorp's
co-presidents, Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former chairman of the Madrid stock
exchange and Mr Jaime Soto, one of the most aggressive of Spain's new breed
of bankers.
Mr Varez, whose board was yesterday negotiating the terms of Ibercorp's
acquisition, is one of the few socially reclusive members of a domestic
class of financier that is increasingly dominated by flamboyant and
publicly-courted individuals.
He launched Agepasa in 1974 and then bought a banking licence in 1988 to
create Banco Inversion.

debt

<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and KLM, the Dutch airline, have started legal proceedings
in the Belgian courts over BFr1bn (Dollars 29.4m) of debts owed to each of
them by Sabena, the Belgian state-owned carrier.
The cash was due to be repayed at the end of 1991, since when talks between
the three airlines over the timing of the cash transfer have run into the
sand.
'We were no longer able to get a real answer from Sabena, so we went to
court,' said KLM yesterday. BA said the action was 'to protect its
position', but that talks were nevertheless continuing.
KLM and BA said they and Sabena would appear before a judge in Brussels on
March 5 for a preliminary hearing.
Sabena said it had not been formally notified about the BA/KLM action, but
that BA and KLM had said they intended to lodge a legal complaint.
It blamed its failure to pay on delays to a separate tie-up with Air France.
That deal, which would probably involve a cash injection of about BFr6bn,
was frozen when the Belgian government collapsed last October.
It also argued that the deal included a clause imposing interest charges on
the loan at 8 per cent from the beginning of 1992. However, KLM replied that
an extension to the loan was only allowed if all three airlines agreed to
it, while BA said it had not received any interest payments.
BA and KLM invested the money as a prelude to taking a 40 per cent stake
between them in a new operation, Sabena World Airways, intended as a
Brussels-based operation flying to 75 European cities. The plan was scrapped
in December 1990 and the investment converted into a loan.
The European Commission confirmed yesterday it had imposed a fine of
Ecu750,000 (Dollars 604,838) on Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, for refusing
to grant reciprocal ticketing rights to British Midland, the UK carrier. It
said Aer Lingus had abused its dominance of the London-Dublin route.

NATIONAL &amp; Provincial, the UK's seventh largest building society, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 100.4m in the year to December 31 despite bad debt
provisions of Pounds 52.1m.
The result represented a 68 per cent improvement on 1990 when taxable
profits were Pounds 59.8m.
At the same time there was a strong improvement in the society's market
share, which rose from 2.3 per cent of net building society lending in 1990
to 6.4 per cent, and in its cost/income ratio which dropped sharply from 54
to 46.6 per cent.
The figures were hailed in the City as showing that despite the housing
market depression, N&amp;P was now back on course after several troubled years.
'This is by far the most improved set of results that the building society
industry will see this year,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, a building society
analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker.
'It is an outstanding achievement considering the state they were in only a
year ago.'
National &amp; Provincial's total assets grew from Pounds 9.26bn to Pounds
10.7bn.
Net lending over the 12 months more than doubled from Pounds 563m to Pounds
1.32bn.
Its gross capital ratio weakened slightly from 6 to 5.7 per cent, but its
free capital ratio rose slightly from 5 to 5.1 per cent.
The Pounds 52.1m provisions, up from Pounds 44.6m in 1990, reflected the
society's view that the growth of mortgage payment arrears in 1991 would
cause repossessions to continue to rise in 1992.
Post-tax return on reserves was up from 9.3 to 13.8 per cent.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Telegraph up 5% to Pounds 40.5m
</HEADLINE>

   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Telegraph yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits of Pounds 40.5m for
1991 - up more than 5 per cent despite the recession.
Mr Conrad Black, chairman, said that efforts to contain costs and increase
circulation revenues had helped to offset a 12.5 per cent decline in
advertising revenues.
Profits were also boosted by investment income which rose from Pounds 5.7m
to Pounds 8.1m.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 219.1m, a fall of Pounds 2.9m. A final dividend
of 4.5p, payable from earnings of 25.4p (17.8p) per share, gives a 9p total.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Sainsbury appoints its first female
executive director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J SAINSBURY, the grocery chain which ranks as the UK's biggest retailer, has
appointed the first female executive director in its 123-year history.
She is Miss Rosemary Thorne (above), currently the financial controller at
Grand Metropolitan, who will join the Sainsbury's board in three weeks'
time.
Miss Thorne, 40, will replace Mr Derek Henson as finance director when he
retires on his 60th birthday in June.
Miss Thorne trained as a management accountant and has worked at several
retailing companies, including Mothercare, Storehouse and Harrods. She
joined Grand Metropolitan in 1990.
Mr David Clapham, managing director of Savacentre, Sainsbury's hypermarket
subsidiary, will also join the main board in September as one of three
trading directors following the retirement of Mr Cecil Roberts.
Miss Thorne becomes the second female finance director of a FT-SE 100
comp-any.
Last June, BTR, the UK-based industrial holding company, appointed Ms
Kathleen O'Donovan, a partner at the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young.
Yesterday, Miss Thorne shrugged off media interest in her appointment. 'The
appointment of a new finance director to a Footsie company is always
significant. The female bit only makes it marginally more so,' she said.
About 65 per cent of Sainsbury's 100,000 employees in the UK are female.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Evered Bardon to raise Pounds 30m from
asset disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERED BARDON, the quarry products group which is seeking to cut borrowings
following a spate of acquisitions, is selling two non-core businesses to
raise about Pounds 30m.
The company is selling its slag cement business, which has plants near
London and in South Wales, for Pounds 25m cash. Daniel Platt, a clay tile
manufacturer, is also being sold for Pounds 5m cash and Pounds 400,000 in
repaid inter-group borrowings.
Evered Bardon has now raised about Pounds 34m from disposals since
announcing last September a 49.5 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits.
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said this was 'a good step' towards reducing
gearing from 75 per cent in September to about 40 per cent. The company is
looking to sell three business in the US, in Arkansas, North Carolina and
Indiana, which could fetch between Dollars 70m-Dollars 80m (Pounds
40m-Pounds 45.7m).
Net borrowings are expected to have fallen to about Pounds 250m at
end-December, reflecting disposals and currency movements. This would reduce
gearing to about 63 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 400m.
The company has brought forward its reporting date by six weeks to mid-March
and is expected to announce pre-tax profits for last year of about Pounds
26m, compared to Pounds 43.9m last time. James Capel, the company's broker,
expects total dividends to be maintained at 5.595p even through this would
not be covered by earnings per share of about 5p.
The slag cement business, which was acquired within the Civil and Marine
aggregates group in 1990, last year reported trading profits of Pounds 2.5m
on turnover of Pounds 11.6m.
The purchaser is a consortium led by 3i Group and involves Mr Mike Uren,
co-founder of Civil and Marine and an executive director of Evered Bardon.
Mr Uren will stay at Evered Bardon on 'a substantially full time basis', the
company said.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bleak outlook in the housing market - The
problems facing National Home Loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the UK housing market has claimed several casualties but
the near-collapse of National Home Loans, the specialist mortgage lender set
up in 1987, is the most spectacular victim so far.
Two years ago, when Mr Richard Lacy, its founding chief executive, was
deposed in a boardroom coup, NHL was the size of a top ten building society
and looked set to weather the recession better than most of its competitors.
Its core mortgage business appeared to be in good shape - and the group had
diversified into wholesale banking, leasing, consumer finance and commercial
lending. Mr Jonathan Perry, who stepped up last Friday from non-executive
director to become chairman in succession to Mr John Darby and chief
executive in succession to Mr Kevin Milner, faces an almost unrecognisable
situation.
The group is overshadowed by a Pounds 47.9m pre-tax loss in 1991. National
Mortgage Bank, its banking arm, and the leasing, commercial lending and
consumer finance subsidiaries have been separated from the rest of the
business and are being managed by Mr Ian Hay Davison who has a mandate,
discreetly endorsed by the Bank of England, to run them down and close them.
'The bank has been dead since July. Realistically, we could not expect it to
take any extra deposits,' says Mr Perry, adding that the decision to close
it was, nevertheless, very recent. Mr Hay Davison, apart from winding down
the bank, has also to offload Pounds 140m in commercial loans; about Pounds
90m in leasing agreements and Pounds 90m of consumer loans.
Although Mr Perry says he enjoys his new job and says he will stay in it
until NHL is healthy again, he looks more like a stop-gap pontiff in charge
of an organisation heading for a slow death.
The outlook is plainly very bleak. Any faint hopes that an outside buyer -
perhaps a foreign bank - might be found for the company have now evaporated.
Since its cash crisis last summer, the banks have been chary about making
new cash available for NHL.
How did the group get into this situation? Last autumn it had 12,000 of its
71,000 accounts in arrears - though Mr Perry says that since then NHL's
arrears, like those of most other lenders, have stabilised.
Nearly two thirds of the mortgages in trouble were self-certified borrowers
who did not have regular salaries.
This week, negotiations with four bank syndicates - one thought to be the
ten UK banks which last summer had to put up a Pounds 200m cash life boat to
prevent the collapse of National Mortgage Bank - got under way. Mr Perry
says that he is not looking to them for more time or for fresh cash. 'We do
not have cash flow problems,' he says.
However, he confirms that some of NHL's five-year funding falls due for
renewal this year. The business he heads now consists of a mortgage book of
Pounds 700m. NHL is doing virtually no new lending. Instead, its hopes are
pinned on selling off perhaps Pounds 100m of high quality mortgages in a
securitisation to raise fresh cash. As the book shrinks, NHL is left with a
higher proportion of problem debts.
Asked if he is worried about being left with a book which is just a rump of
bad debts, Mr Perry chuckles and says that these days it is possible to
securitise arrears as well as high quality mortgages. If he accomplishes his
mission, NHL will no longer be the diversified consumer financial services
group it was in 1990 when it had assets of Pounds 2.47bn, but a relatively
large mortgage administrator with a balance sheet well below Pounds 500m and
aspirations some day to return to mortgage lending.
As for NHL's 70,000 mortgage customers, in theory they are not affected by
the company's misfortunes. But many of them are stuck with a mortgage
interest rate of 12.1 per cent or 12.65 per cent - far above the prevailing
market rate of 10.95 per cent.
Those of them that can afford to do so will probably want to remortgage to
another lender. That will not be bad news for NHL, for to exit from the
company, many borrowers will have to pay early redemption penalties, thereby
making a useful addition to NHL's cash flow.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Green light for UniChem and Lloyds to bid
for Macarthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNICHEM and Lloyds Chem-ists, which each bid for Macarthy last autumn, were
both cleared yesterday by the competition authorities as potential owners of
the retail pharmaceutical group.
Macarthy's shares rose 17p to close at 316p, valuing the group at Pounds
86.3m, as the market looked for a revival of at least one of the bids which
lapsed when they were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Both UniChem, which is a retailer and wholesaler of pharmaceuticals, and
Lloyds, which runs the second largest chain of pharmacies in the UK, have 21
days to decide whether to bid again.
UniChem, the earlier of the two bidders, said yesterday that there was still
logic in a merger between it and Macarthy 'but only on the right terms'. Its
shares closed yesterday at 203p, up 2p. At that price its previous offer of
7 new shares plus 240p in cash for every 6 Macarthy shares would be worth
276.8p per Macarthy share. Since the bid was referred, UniChem has acquired
E Moss, taking its retail chain to 132 shops.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive of Lloyds, said Lloyds would
'be re-examining the attractiveness of Macarthy in the light of what has
happened in the intervening period and of other opportunities available to
Lloyds'.
When it lapsed, Lloyds' offer had been recommended by Macarthy and accepted
by holders of 65 per cent of Macarthy's shares. Lloyds and its associates
also hold 9.9 per cent of Macarthy's shares.
Lloyds' shares fell 5p to 340p yesterday as analysts thought it was likely
to bid again. The original terms were one new Lloyds share and 21p in cash
for every Macarthy share.
Last October, Lloyds said that if it did bid again it would expect to offer
not less than 306p per Macarthy share, the highest value of its earlier bid.
If it wanted to offer less now it would have to show there had been a
material change of circumstances. Last month Macarthy reported a 15 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for its last financial year but cut its final
dividend.
The MMC found that neither merger would be expected to operate against the
public interest. It said that the regulation of the Pounds 3.8bn a year
pharmaceutical market by the Department of Health was such that normal
competitive pressures did not apply. It recommended that the DH should 'pay
close attention' to the effect of regulations on competition in the retail
pharmacy sector, and that the Director General of Fair Trading should
scrutinise any developments that might reduce competition.
The report found that Macarthy's share of the retail pharmacy market,
through its Savory &amp; Moore chain, was only 1.5 per cent, which added to
Lloyds existing share would give the combined group 7 per cent of the
market. If UniChem were to succeed with a bid it would have only 2.5 per
cent of the market.
Trends in the wholesale market were towards fewer players, with only two,
UniChem and AAH, having national coverage. If either merger were to go
ahead, Savory &amp; Moore's custom would be lost to the general wholesale
market. However, the MMC thought that the loss of custom would not
materially weaken competition.
UniChem plc/Macarthy plc and Lloyds Chemists plc/Macarthy plc. A report on
the proposed mergers. HMSO Pounds 14.35.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson returns to the black with
Pounds 27.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT BENSON, the merchant bank, yesterday disclosed that in 1991 it had
recovered to pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.9m from the 1990 deficit of Pounds
68m.
Mr David Peake, chairman, also said that talks were continuing on the
formation of an alliance with Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank.
However, these talks were unlikely to be completed until BNP had completed
its discussions on forming a separate link with Dresdner Bank, the German
bank.
Kleinwort's 1991 profits were less than it had been anticipating a year ago,
because the recession in the UK forced it to make a Pounds 39m provision
against possible losses on loans. The bulk of these losses were incurred on
loans to small- and medium-sized companies.
During the year, the group reduced its portfolio of corporate loans to
Pounds 661m (Pounds 880m).
'The level of provisioning should be lower in the current year,' Mr Peake
said.
He was pleased with the progress of Kleinwort's equities or stockbroking
activities, which caused it considerable problems in the early years after
they were acquired outright in 1986. Kleinwort made 'steady profits' from
market-making, or the wholesaling of shares, and it also increased its
market share of business with investment institutions.
The merchant banking segment, which includes the corporate finance
department and securities operations, made profits of Pounds 24.7m on loan
capital, against losses of Pounds 35.1m.
There was a modest fall from Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 27.4m) in profits of the
investment management division. Mr Peake blamed a small bad debt incurred in
the private banking operations and a decline in unit trust sales.
The full-year dividend is maintained at 16p with an unchanged final of
10.7p. Earnings per share were 14.34p (losses 36.77p).
Separately, Kleinwort announced the retirement of Mr David Benson, a member
of the bank's founding family, as vice-chairman - though he will remain a
non-executive director - and the appointment to the new post of deputy
chairman of Mr Simon Robertson, already a Kleinwort director. As a result,
Mr David Clementi will become sole head of the corporate finance department,
a role he had been sharing with Mr Robertson.
COMMENT
Kleinwort's return on capital is still a long way short of satisfactory.
Profits after tax equated to just 4.5 per cent of shareholders' funds - it
would have done considerably better to have invested its capital in a
building society account. It has been a difficult year for most lending
banks and corporate financiers. However, it is making something of a habit
of earning lowly returns - it has done so in four out of the last five
years. Poor performance has forced it to pay part of the dividend out of
reserves, having paid all of the dividend from reserves in 1990 and a large
slice of it from reserves in 1988. On a more positive note, the equities
division is at last performing reasonably following years of difficulties.
The pruning of the loan book probably also means that loan losses will
diminish. Pre-tax profits should recover to about Pounds 45m in the current
year which would at least cover a maintained dividend, putting the shares,
at 265p, on a yield of 8 per cent - which is about right. There may even be
some upside, if BNP and Dresdner decide to bid for all or some of the
shares.

BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, is to supply airbag systems

The company said it was also discussing co-operation in the development and
supply of other component systems, such as electric seat mechanisms and
electronic automatic gearbox controls.
BMW insisted, however, that no negotiations had taken place 'up to now' for
it to take either a minority or majority stake in Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
The UK luxury car maker, a subsidiary of Vickers, suffered a loss of about
Pounds 60m last year under the impact of a 48 per cent drop in sales.

FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Warburg shares fall 36p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG, the UK investment bank, yesterday warned that profits in the
current half year would fall below those of the preceding six months, due to
the continued delay in any upturn in the UK economy, writes Richard Waters.
The bank said that profits in the half year to the end of March were
expected to fall below the Pounds 89m of the previous six months, but be
higher than the Pounds 66m of the second half last year.
As a result, profits for the full year are predicted to be between Pounds
155m and Pounds 178m, below some analysts' forecasts at the time the interim
results were published last autumn.
Commenting on the statement, Mr Michael Gore, finance director, said of the
earlier market forecasts: 'At the time, most people hoped the recession
would come to an end and business pick up quicker than it has.' There had
been no single problem holding back profits, more a general decline in
business volumes, he said.
The announcement pushed Warburg's shares down from 574p to 538p.
The statement was made in connection with a proposed private placement of
debt in the US.
The bank plans to raise about Dollars 75m (Pounds 43m) of long-term loan
capital from institutions, principally insurance companies, in the coming
weeks.
The ten-year debt will add to the Pounds 200m of long-term debt the bank
already has, though at about 20 per cent its gearing remains low compared to
its competitors.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Barclays Bank falls 30% to Pounds 533m: Pounds 96m withdrawn
from reserves to pay unchanged dividend of 21.2p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS yesterday ceded the title of the UK's most profitable bank to
Lloyds Bank, when it disclosed that profits in 1991 had fallen 30 per cent
to Pounds 533m.
Like its rivals, Barclays has been hurt by record losses on UK loans. It
made a provision of Pounds 1.76bn, up from Pounds 1.3bn the previous year,
to cover the risk of losses on loans.
The recession also caused a sharp increase in losses due to fraud, according
to Mr Peter Wood, Barclays finance director. Credit card fraud resulted in
losses of around Pounds 30m.
The fall in profits meant Barclays was forced to withdraw Pounds 96m from
reserves to meet the Pounds 338m cost of its dividend, which was 21.2p a
share, unchanged from the previous year. 'This is the first time that
Barclays has been unable to finance its dividend from profits', said Mr
Wood.
Mr Wood said there had been long debates among Barclays' directors about
whether the dividend should have been cut.
Like its rivals, Barclays has been cutting its workforce to reduce running
costs. Sir John Quinton, the chairman, said staff numbers had been reduced
by more than 5,000 in 1991 and that 'thousands' more employees were to go in
the current year.
The bulk of Barclays' bad debt charge stemmed from the financial
difficulties of small companies and individuals. Sir John said it was
worrying that a sharply rising number of older established companies - which
had been 'sound banking propositions' - were running into difficulties. It
was not simply young, fragile businesses which were collapsing, he said.
'Bad debts are likely to remain at a high level this year', he said. But he
added that there were 'faint' signs of an improvement.
He said that the bank was retraining lending staff to try to prevent a
repetition of the loan losses. He also said that the bank would no longer
lend to the smallest most fragile businesses.
But he stressed that Barclays would continue to lend to sound businesses and
would not deliberately contribute to a 'credit crunch' which would hold back
recovery in the UK economy. However, he admitted there was a risk that
individual managers, chastened by bad debt charges of last year, might be
wary of lending, even to sound customers.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Commercial Union in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION-related losses in the UK have pushed Commercial Union, the
insurance group, into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 68.6m for 1991 from a profit
of Pounds 1.4m in 1990. This is the first loss incurred by the composite
insurer since the mid-1980s.
However, the result is likely to be better than those to come from other UK
insurers during the next few weeks.
CU has largely avoided the damage inflicted on some competitors by domestic
mortgage indemnity claims.
The company's management was sufficiently confident about the group's
underlying financial strength and the positive impact of recent rises in
insurance rates to announce a 3 per cent increase in the dividend to 23.65p.
Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house, said the
decision had reassured the market which marked the shares up 10p to 466p.
'The loss is due to cyclical factors but everything appears to be under
control,' he said.
Underwriting losses rose to Pounds 462.6m from Pounds 344.8m, but were
offset by investment earnings of Pounds 271.6m, up from Pounds 243.5m. Life
profits rose to Pounds 114.3m from Pounds 102m, and earnings from associated
undertakings to Pounds 8.1m from Pounds 700,000.
After realised investment gains which rose to Pounds 49.8m from Pounds
20.8m, losses attributable to shareholders fell to Pounds 15.5m, against a
profit of Pounds 22.2m. The cost of the dividend amounted to Pounds 104.8m
taking shareholders' funds to Pounds 1.21bn, from Pounds 1.23bn.
Mr Tony Wyand, finance director said the average solvency ratio (the
yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium) for
non-life business amounted to 63 per cent, although analysts suggested it
might be nearer 40 per cent.
Underwriting losses in the UK rose to Pounds 226.5m from Pounds 145.4m. Mr
Peter Ward, general manager UK, singled out the effect of the recession.
Industrial fire claims rose 21 per cent to Pounds 109.3m, with arson claims
leaping from Pounds 9m to Pounds 20m.
Mr Ward also said property and motor theft claims increased by 38 per cent.
Domestic theft claims rose from Pounds 33m to Pounds 51m.
Outside the Netherlands, where Delta Lloyd reduced its underwriting loss to
Pounds 17.4m from Pounds 26.7m, underwriting losses rose from Pounds 52m to
Pounds 76m.

Sir, Joe Rogaly draws a misleading analogy between the Scots' drive for
constitutional change and the reluctance of white South African supremacists
to replace apartheid with a new constitution.
By drawing Mr Major as a Mr de Klerk, he implies that the defeat of the
Scottish Nationalists at a referendum would be comparable to a defeat of
white South Africans opposed to power-sharing with blacks. This takes the
argument outside the bounds of reason.

Sir, Joe Rogaly's article, 'Scotland the grave' (February 25) is the best
explanation I have yet come across as to why the Conservative party clings
to the retention of the Union in its present form.
John Major's argument at the weekend that, collectively, England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland together are far greater than the sum of their
parts has to be taken with a large measure of salt. As the article points
out, it is largely the English who hold to a misplaced sense of superiority
on the world stage - something perpetuated by Mrs Thatcher, and subsequently
by Mr Major. Oh, the ether of power]
As a Scot, l have been continually frustrated by the UK's actions in being
the main brake on greater European integration. The Scottish Nationalists
have struck a strong chord when they say that they wish to attain
independence for Scotland within Europe. I feel that our aspirations as a
nation could be better satisfied within a federal Europe, instead of
clinging to a past that was great but is irrelevant in the face of new
challenges confronting us all.
Last, and on a lighter note, a possible name for the three Independent
Celtic States would be the Commonwealth of Celtic Countries (CCC).

FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: No evidence that Rolls-Royce Cars not up with latest
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir COLIN CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to express concern that your editorial comment on Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars ('Perilous niches', February 26) seems to have been written by
someone with little knowledge about Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars or their
design, development and manufacture.
There is no evidence to support your thesis that the downturn for
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is based on a failure to keep up with the latest
technology. As recently as 14 months ago, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was
announcing that its sales had been at a near record level of 3,333 in 1990 -
hardly the dying throes of neglected technology]
The current recession in the US and the UK has caused an equally steep fall
in the sales of top-of-the-range versions of motor cars from Mercedes and
BMW, despite their alleged higher technology.
The design, development and production of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars at Crewe
has involved for many years the use of computer-controlled machinery, very
similar to that found in any German or Japanese car factory. In addition,
visitors to Crewe from both German and Japanese manufacturers have actually
compared their own working and project management practices unfavourably
with those they observed at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
The whole of Rolls-Royce production is controlled by a computer-based
manufacturing resource planning (MRPII) system, which was the first to be
installed by a European motor car manufacturer.
The automatic ride control, introduced by Rolls-Royce on all its models in
1989, was the first of its kind in the world - technology developed at
Crewe. This computer-controlled system enables the car to react immediately
to different road and driving conditions to give the best combination of
ride and road-holding at all times.
Rolls-Royce has, of course, had long-term technological collaboration
agreements with a number of manufacturers, including BMW, and the
technological transfer is two-way, with, for example, Rolls-Royce working
for BMW as well as BMW for Rolls-Royce.
As was made clear in the announcement of Vickers results this week, the
research and development expenditure at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has been
maintained during this difficult period.
It was only in November last year that the technically orientated
publication, Car Magazine, tested the Bentley Turbo R alongside the most
expensive Jaguar, Mercedes and Lexus cars and came to the conclusion that
the Bentley Turbo R was 'the best car in the world'.
During 1991, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars launched two new models, including the
Bentley Continental R, for which the first two years production have already
been sold, mostly for export, and in total worth more than Pounds 100m.
Of course Rolls-Royce Motor Cars occupies a particular and small niche, as
indeed does the Financial Times. This does not, however, mean that either is
in some way backward or produces 'instant antiques'.

Brunet, the distinguished French geographer, uses a variety of indicators

Sir, We are all environmentalists now. So, like P D Martin (Letters,

FT  27 FEB 92 / Book Review: When markets alone are not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF MARKET INSTITUTIONS By John Gray Institute of
Economic Affairs, Pounds 7.95
What should inspire post-Thatcher Conservatives - and their allies abroad?
Autonomy, free markets, and an enabling welfare state, argues John Gray, an
Oxford political theorist. In this powerful Institute of Economic Affairs
tract, he combines all three to map out a plausible middle ground for
political debate in the 1990s. With most of today's politicians - left,
right and centre - desperately searching for such terrain, he is playing to
a packed audience.
Gray is that rare bird: the polemical moderate. The 'ruinous failure' of
state socialism, the 'mirage' of egalitarianism, the 'blind alley' of market
socialism, the 'illusions' of libertarianism - successive chapters shatter
each in turn. Gray's political sympathies lie unambiguously with the right,
but his strictures on the limits of markets and the importance of welfare
will cause many an IEA patron to blanch.
The promotion of human autonomy is, for Gray, the end of politics. But
autonomy is more than freedom - the 'negative liberty' of classical liberals
and conservatives. To be valuable, autonomy requires both capacities for
choice on the part of the individual and a range of worthwhile options in
his or her cultural environment. 'In the absence of this,' claims Gray,
'autonomy wanes, and the lives of individuals become the poorer, however
many choices they make.'
Accordingly, free markets are ethically justified as enabling devices for
the protection and enhancement of autonomy - since without them, the ability
of individuals to act upon their own goals, values and knowledge is
diminished. But markets alone are not enough. If worthwhile choices are to
be available to all, the state has to provide public goods for all. The
state also has to satisfy the 'basic needs' of individuals through an active
welfare and cultural policy - where markets, families, charities and other
non-state institutions fail to do so.
What are these 'basic needs'? They are needs whose satisfaction is essential
to the possibility of a worthwhile life. For the most part, they are also
capable of complete satiation. The latter feature is critical: for most
basic needs, writes Gray, 'once they are met, the content of the welfare
claim which guarantees their satisfaction is exhausted'. So needs, not
rights or justice, justify the claims of individuals on the state.
Hence the welfare state. But Gray's Leviathan is small and tame. It will
supplement, not replace, private provision. It will consume only about a
quarter of the national product, and not be a racket for the middle classes.
It will deliver as far as possible through market mechanisms, using vouchers
and the like. And its structure will conform to the principle of
subsidiarity, 'with functions being devolved to the lowest feasible and
desirable level of government'.
None of this cuts much ice with the remnants of the Thatcherite right. In
accompanying commentaries, Chandran Kukathas, of the University of New South
Wales, and Patrick Minford, the monetarist economist, defend negative
liberty - freedom from coercion - as a goal in its own right, and dismiss
'basic needs' as hard to define, and where defined, ruinously expensive to
meet.
Gray's response is persuasive. Freedom, he argues, has little value on its
own. Its chief value is the contribution it makes to autonomy - an autonomy
which involves far more than the mere absence of coercion by others. As for
basic needs, they necessarily vary across cultures and societies - to lead a
worthwhile life, the Kalahari bushman and the urban professional require
different things. Yet allowing for that, and the impossibility of precise
mathematical objectivity in such matters, a 'reasoned public discourse'
ought to generate consensus on the content of such needs.
Gray may place too much faith on the power of 'reasoned discourse': propose
reducing state spending to a quarter of the national product, and the
ensuing debate will be anything but reasoned. Beyond lauding subsidiarity -
a difficult principle to apply, as the European Community is discovering
painfully - he also has little to say about the organisation of his limited
government. Yet the issue affects his argument at every turn, with
constitutional reform moving up the agenda of Britain's political class
through concern for just that autonomy which he is seeking to promote.
A related caveat is entered by Raymond Plant, coming from the left in the
third of the commentaries. It may indeed be possible to reach broad
consensus on basic needs, but it is far from evident that such needs, taken
together, can be met completely within available resources. Gray himself
concedes the expense of many basic health needs - particularly those
relating to ageing; and that is even before aggregating them with
entitlements to education, training, housing, defence and so on.
Yet if basic needs cannot be met completely, then a debate about
distribution and fairness takes over - and the rules for conducting it
become crucial. As Plant notes, governments all too often fall victim to
interest group pressures in relation to the provision of basic services
because of their unwillingness to face the fact of scarcity, and the
consequent imperative to gauge 'a reasonable degree of entitlement given
limited resources'.
Politics evidently still has a controversial life ahead of it.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Eastern promise: German investment in Czechoslovakia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Driving west from Prague, the elegant capital of Czechoslovakia, to the
grimy industrial city of Pilsen, the name of Nuremberg appears on motorway
signs.
The mention of this German city along Czech roads is a striking symbol of
the historical links between the two countries, which will be strengthened
today when Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrives in Prague to sign a Friendship
Treaty with Czech President Vaclav Havel.
Though German occupation of part of Czechoslovakia during the second world
war severely damaged the relationship, and Czechoslovakia's subsequent
40-year domination by communism put it beyond west Germany's reach, the
economic opportunities created by the end of the cold war are helping to
heal the wounds between the two neighbours.
In the past two years, nearly Dollars 1bn of foreign investment has flowed
into Czechoslovakia, with Germany accounting for about two-thirds. German
industrial giants such as Volkswagen, Siemens and Mercedes-Benz have led the
investment charge, but smaller companies are now moving in.
What attracts them is Czechoslovakia's long industrial tradition - the
province of Bohemia was the industrial heartland of the Austro-Hungarian
empire - as well as its engineering skills, low wages, proximity, and access
to markets in eastern Europe.
For its part, Czechoslovakia needs foreign investment if it is to attain
western levels of efficiency and prosperity. The Prague government has
opened up the economy, curbed inflation to an annual rate of about 2 per
cent, and started the privatisation process. 'The Czech republic was always
part of western European markets,' says Mr Karel Spacek, finance minister of
the Czech republic, which exists in a fragile federation with the smaller
Slovak republic to the east. 'If you look at the map, Prague is more to the
west than Vienna.'
While Hungary has drawn the lion's share of western investment in eastern
Europe, mostly from the US, German companies tend to favour Czechoslovakia.
They cite its cultural similarities - Czechs often speak German and have a
reputation for industriousness and orderliness - and the fact that the
country's industrial base, with its emphasis on engineering, is similar to
their own. Shortcomings in the areas of management, design and marketing are
seen as opportunities. The main reasons for business interest are: Labour
costs. Wages are about a tenth of those in Germany, averaging about 4,500
crowns (DM250) a month. High wage claims in Germany have prompted talk among
industrialists about job losses and falling competitiveness.
While east German labour is still cheaper than in west Germany, the gap is
fast being narrowed in the wake of unification. The generous terms at which
old East German Marks were replaced by D-Marks sharply raised industrial
costs in eastern Germany. This increase was compounded by steep wage rises.
Thus Czechoslovakia is becoming the low-cost location that east Germany is
ceasing to be.
Industrial skills. Productivity is below western standards. But German
companies are impressed by local engineers and workers and have promised to
raise output and roughly to maintain employment. 'They need money to improve
their plants and they need better production and business organisation,'
says Mr Bernhard Weiss, a Siemens manager responsible for a joint rail
venture with Skoda Pilsen, the engineering group. 'But their workers know
how to use modern machinery.'
Mr Volkhard Kohler, deputy chief executive of Skoda cars, a separate
company, says: 'We're interested in doing more and more development here in
Czechoslovakia.' Access to eastern Europe. German investors foresee a
growing demand for transport and other engineering products in the east.
Overhauling the infrastructure will require huge investments. By combining
their skills and contacts, German and Czech companies hope to profit from
this enormous long-term potential.
It is this long-term approach which has helped German comapnies gain an edge
over rivals such as France's Renault, which lost out to VW and Mercedes in
joint ventures with Skoda cars and Avia trucks, and ABB, the Swiss-Swedish
concern which hoped to link up with Skoda Pilsen but was beaten by Siemens.
But the German strategy has involved spending heavily on the plants of Czech
partners to upgrade production to western standards. Volkswagen has spent
DM620m on its 31 per cent of Skoda cars and has management control. It will
lift its holding to 70 per cent in 1995. By 2000, it intends to invest some
DM9bn, more than doubling output to about 450,000 cars a year in the
mid-1990s.
Mr Kohler admits Skoda's image abroad is better than at home, where many
people now prefer western cars. But VW sees Skoda as a strategic addition to
its range, becoming the northern equivalent of its low-priced Spanish-built
Seat in western and eastern Europe.
Siemens has a twin-track strategy, concentrating on the expansion of Skoda
Pilsen's production of locomotives for eastern Europe, and the improvement
of its power station technology. It will also help Skoda bid for mass
transit contracts - Siemens and Skoda have already won an order to re-equip
the Prague Metro - and provide sub-contracting work for its international
energy business.
Siemens is taking 57 per cent of Skoda Pilsen's Dollars 170m power
generation business, its biggest division. Framatome of France will have 10
per cent. 'We wanted to broaden our range of products,' says Mr Jaroslav
Mestanek, vice-president (commerce) at Skoda Pilsen. In the long run, this
means access to Siemens' know-how in environmentally-advanced turbine
technology. 'We couldn't span the next two years without Siemens,' Mr
Mestanek says.
On the rail side, Siemens is bringing in the transport activities of Krupp
and Krauss-Maffei, in which it is already a partner. 'The idea is to develop
competence as a full-line supplier,' says Mr Weiss. Skoda, which built 2,500
locomotives for the former Soviet Union, will provide the mechanical
expertise, with the German companies contributing electrical and other
equipment. The Germans will have 51 per cent of the Dollars 105m venture.
Mercedes aims to carve out up to 30 per cent of the truck market in eastern
Europe - the same as it has in the west. Mr Helmut Werner, head of the truck
division, reckons the potential market in the east could exceed 800,000
trucks above two tonnes a year.
The Daimler-Benz subsidiary plans to invest DM350m in the plants of Avia and
Liaz, the Czech truck makers, in the next five years, lifting its minority
stake into an eventual majority. The production goal of the three-way
venture is 27,000 small, medium, and large trucks a year in 1997. The
present Avia and Liaz trucks will be phased out. This is a pill the Czech
companies have had to swallow to survive. 'We have to be realists,' remarks
Mr Vaclav Bohac, Avia's finance director.
Not surprisingly, the preponderance of German investment has led to charges
in Czechoslovakia that Germany's economic influence could become too
powerful. Criticism has mostly come from opposition politicians trying to
arouse anti-German sentiment against the government and its free-market
economic policies.
Adding to the public interest, and introducing a controversial new element,
have been the requests by Mercedes last month for high duties on imported
trucks and a long tax holiday. The Czech government, which approves all
large joint ventures, has objected to such demands, which Mercedes insists
are only a basis for negotiations.
The heat generated by Mercedes' tactics shows the sensitivities involved. Mr
Spacek, the Czech finance minister, says the Czech government will accept
the best offer of foreign investment, no matter where it comes from. But he
admits that given equal offers, a non-German company would be favoured so as
to broaden the investment spread. 'We want capital from other countries, not
just Germany.'
German executives know they have to tread carefully. Memories of the second
world war linger. 'The war was the beginning of the end of Czechoslovakia's
independence,' says VW's Mr Kohler. But many industrialists in
Czechoslovakia are prepared to forgive and forget. 'That was history. We've
got to think about the future,' concludes Mr Mestanek of Skoda.
Flurry of German invesment
Volkswagen has 31 per cent of the shares and management control of Skoda in
Mlada Boleslave.  It is investing DM600m this year, DM1bn in 1993, and total
of DM9bn by 2000.
Volkswagen has also bought smaller BAZ assembly and components operation in
Bratislava, Slovak republic.
Siemens last year agreed ventures with Skoda Pilsen in energy and transport
(need Czech government approval).  IT is taking 57 per cent of Skoda
Pilsen's poer generation business.  Siemens, together with German partners
(Krupp and Krauss-Maffel), is also taking 51 per cent of Skoda's locomotive
business.  Siemens will add its Duewag rail-wagon subsidiary.
Mercedes-Benz agreed with Avia and Liaz truck companies to produce Mercedes
range.  Mercedes will have to initial 31 per cent, Avia-49 per cent and Liaz
20 per cent.  Mercedes to invest DM350m over five years.  Needs Czech
government approval; requests for protective import duties and tax holiday
irritated Prague.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Developing cars across borders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS the industrialised world, multinationals are dispersing their
research, design, development and engineering activities from single or dual
locations to multiple ones. Nissan has added development centres in the US
and now Europe to its base in Japan. Hewlett Packard now develops personal
computers in France as well as California. Glaxo does drugs research in six
countries as well as Britain.
This trend is part of a wider organisational pattern in which formerly
centralised activities are starting to be pushed out to multiple centres
around the globe, in as balanced a fashion as possible.
So at first sight Ford of Europe seems to be turning back the clock by
considering a reallocation of tasks between its British and German
development facilities which could relegate the UK side to junior status.
The exact nature of the company's plans are unclear. But any shift in the
power balance towards Germany would be a backward step from a narrow UK
point of view. Though far fewer jobs are likely to be transferred in the
short term than the 1,200 mooted in an internal discussion document, the
issue is of equal national economic significance to the threatened closure
at some stage of one of Ford's UK assembly plants.
A shift in Ford's development balance towards Germany would be much more
controversial than General Motors' 1970s transfer of its Vauxhall's
development responsibilities activities to its Opel offshoot in Germany. It
would be a signal to other multinationals, existing and emergent, to
consider doing likewise - to the considerable detriment of employment
prospects for British graduate engineers, and of the UK economy.
Natural advantage
Germany already has a natural advantage in its reputation for the supply and
quality of development engineers, despite their higher salary levels and
social costs. Considerable infighting was needed within Sony last year for
its UK subsidiary to persuade Tokyo to locate a new European television
development centre in Wales instead of Germany.
Yet, from a corporate point of view, Ford's deliberations are not only
understandable, but arguably overdue. The point overtly at issue is
'co-location': the need to locate more of its different functional
specialists on particular projects together, in either Germany or Britain ,
so that they can work more effectively in multi-disciplinary teams in order
to slash Ford's product development times and costs to Japanese levels.
Too complex
Some worldwide development networks work well, but Ford's is arguably too
complex for an industry where projects are so large. With Britain and
Germany, plus Detroit and its Mazda affiliate in Japan, it now has four
centres to co-ordinate where ideally only three would do. Within Europe,
Ford's extra complexity is said to incur a 10 per cent cost penalty and
requires over 250 people more than the company would otherwise need.
Deeper motives may also be contributing to the product development debate.
Put starkly, Ford's management seems increasingly fed up with its problems
in Britain. Ford's UK factory productivity has been improved after years of
painful effort, but despite similar levels of capital intensity, it is still
lower than at the company's continental European plants. The significance of
such productivity gaps was underlined yesterday by a comparative
Anglo-German study from Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social
Research.
In addition, Ford is now making heavy losses in the UK, in contrast with its
performance in Germany and elsewhere on the continent. With eastern Europe
also beckoning, a shift of some of the company's UK development activities
to Germany seems not only natural, but overdue. Ford of Europe may have
taken far too long to get to grips with many of its problems, but at least
it is moving on this one.
An uncomfortable conclusion for Britain, perhaps. But, to misquote the
famous saying about General Motors, what's good for Ford is not necessarily
good for Britain.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Leading light of the north: The bitter-sweet renaissance of
Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ensconced in the Victorian splendour of Manchester's town hall, Mr Richard
Leese, deputy leader of the council, displays dour optimism about the city's
future. 'There is a lot of reason to be gloomy, but a lot to be hopeful
about too.'
At the moment it is hope which predominates. The government yesterday gave
its backing to the city's bid to stage the 2000 Olympics. The Arts Council
has decided to award Manchester the title of City of Drama for 1994, an
accolade which reinforces its claim to be Britain's foremost arts centre
outside London.
The award from the Arts Council puts Manchester centre stage in a series of
artistic events being staged around Britain to celebrate the run-up to the
millennium.
The city has already put forward 150 ideas for the bonanza, culled from 80
organisations ranging from inner-city youth clubs to established companies
such as Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre. Proposals include a spectacular
celebration of the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Manchester ship
canal.
The 10-year-old Hacienda night club, a former yacht warehouse that has
become a youth cult centre for Paris and Amsterdam as well as a wide swathe
of England, will display hallucinatory 3D videos.
The range of proposed events bears testimony to the diversity of culture to
be found in Manchester, home of British repertory theatre. Audience surveys
indicate that 300,000 of the 2.5m inhabitants of the Manchester conurbation
attend a theatre performance at least twice a year.
But it is not just in the cultural arena that Manchester is enjoying a
revival. Since the early 1980s, it has started to throw off its image of
dust and grime. In the city centre, the last decade has seen extensive
refurbishment and development of offices, shopping malls and public
buildings.
The city is also attracting new investment in high technology industries and
services which is offsetting long-term decline in its traditional
manufacturing sectors. Computer and chemical businesses are thriving,
replacing coal and steel. When ICI reorganised its management structure last
year, it chose Manchester ahead of continental Europe and the US for the
headquarters of its speciality chemicals division.
For all the obvious chutzpah, however, there are plenty of bleak spots. A
total of 16 per cent of the workforce is without a job, almost double the
national average. Social problems such as poverty, racial tensions and drug
abuse fester on the run-down housing estates - such as the notorious Moss
Side - which surround the Mancunian core.
Manchester's city government is addressing these problems with policies
intended to invigorate the local economy.
In a move away from the more confrontational and ideologically-motivated
policies of earlier in the 1980s, the Labour council now takes a more
pragmatic approach to fostering capitalism and local enterprise. Councillor
Leese complains that Manchester's higher-income professional classes escape
in the evenings in a flood of smart cars sweeping southwards to their homes.
But he accepts that creating wealth must take priority over distributing it.
Mr Simon Sperryn, the chief executive of the city's chamber of commerce, has
been attempting to bring a Japanese trade centre to the city. He stresses
the blow to Manchester's psyche caused first by its pre-war fall from world
eminence in textiles, and then - in recent decades - by closures in
engineering, steel and coal. But he says that industry has become more
broadly based during the last 10 years. 'We now have a bit of everything.'
As part of its effort to emphasise its confidence in the future, the city
has launched a bid to become the site of the European central bank. 'People
who come to work here will not have to think they're going to a wilderness,'
stresses Mr David Baker, the ex-Bank of England official who is spearheading
the campaign.
The focal point of plans for new sports facilities to support the 2000
Olympics bid is eastern Manchester, scarred by the closure of factories and
industrial plants since the 1970s.
In the late 1980s, Manchester bid for the 1996 Olympics, with hardly any
help from London. This time - from Mr John Major, the prime minister,
downwards - 'the attitude from central government has been phenomenally
positive,' says Mr Neil Fountain, head of the council's economic initiatives
department.
Among competitors for the 2000 Olympics prize, the most serious contender is
probably Berlin, a city with which Manchester shares some intriguing
features. There is the same vibrancy springing from past grandeur - and a
certain frisson that stems from the extremes of rich and poor.
Speaking from his residence in the north of the city - overlooking rolling
meadows and the site of a disused colliery - the Bishop of Manchester gives
a bitter-sweet summing up of the state of the city's soul:
'Manchester is a wonderfully vigorous and exciting part of the world to work
in. But when you go to a drinks party and meet people responsible for the
life of the city and ask them where they live, they say they come from the
south - beyond the city boundary.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Mr Keating's election bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL Keating waited a long time to succeed Mr Bob Hawke as Australia's
prime minister; so long that his first throw of the dice also represents his
last chance to win back a disaffected electorate. Under Australia's
three-year cycle, elections must be held by the middle of next year - the
fourth time the Labor party will have sought re-election since coming to
power in 1983. To win, Mr Keating must produce a tangible improvement in the
economy, for whose difficulties he himself bears considerable responsibility
in his former role as Treasurer.
The long leadership struggle last year contributed to a general view in
Australia that the Labor government was worn out and bankrupt of ideas. But
a deep, two-year recession, which has pushed unemployment to 10.3 per cent,
has been the more important underlying cause. The party's loss of popularity
may be irretrievable.
Naturally enough for a man who has little more than a year to stamp the
contrary impression on voters, the prime minister declared that the package
of measures he announced yesterday would 'stir the imagination' and lead to
'a turning point in our economic history and our social history'. The
measures do neither of these things. Instead, they offer a short-term boost
to the economy - actually rather smaller than markets had been expecting,
but with the promise of personal tax cuts after the elections - while
continuing the process of structural reform set in train by Mr Hawke and Mr
Keating in his earlier incarnation.
Regional market
The measures reflect Mr Keating's long-standing objectives. He has played a
key role in the opening up of the Australian economy, including the floating
of the Australian dollar, tariff reductions and tax and banking reform. Mr
Keating has now created a regional aviation market. He has removed the
requirement for 50 per cent Australian equity in mining ventures and raised
the threshold at which foreign mining investments require official scrutiny.
And he has eliminated most restrictions on foreign banks' entry into
Australia. At the same time, he deserves credit for resisting strong
domestic pressure to slow tariff reductions.
The other side of Mr Keating's record is one of substantial responsibility
for a boom-bust cycle. True, fluctuating commodity prices have added
difficulties. But Mr Keating misjudged policy, particularly in pulling on
the monetary reins too tightly, so adding to the depth of the recession.
Now, monetary policy has eased (though real interest rates remain high) and
fiscal policy is being relaxed too.
Implausible move
To move from zero to 4 3/4 per cent economic growth in one year, and to
maintain growth around that level, seems implausible. If it were achieved
through increased exports, it would arouse no concern. But the indications
are that the growth is projected to come more from domestic demand. This
would seem a recipe for a worsening current account, now projected to rise
from 3.75 to 4.5 per cent of GDP next year and difficulties with Australia's
foreign debt. The currency, which had already weakened in recent weeks ahead
of the statement and dropped further yesterday, could come under pressure.
Mr Keating's projection of a jump in inflation, from the current 1.5 to 3.5
per cent next year, could also be too low.
Even so, the gamble represented by measures actually undertaken yesterday is
not huge. The ADollars 2.3bn job-oriented stimulus is concentrated on
infrastructural projects, which are badly needed. The budget deficit for
this year, projected at 1.8 per cent of GDP, is small. If Mr Keating can
strike a wage deal with the unions, the lid will be kept on inflation.
Mr Keating cannot be accused of betting the economy to save his political
future. Most of the steps he has taken are sensible, even if the economic
projections are shaky, as is their wont. But he has not shown that he will
have fresh ideas for revitalising the Labor party, should he win
re-election. The Australian electorate may need a clearer sight of his
vision before giving Labor another term.

Presumably the only people not cheering on Richard Branson in his fight to
break into the air travel business are those employed by other airlines.
Faced with such wickedly high prices, especially in Europe, the rest of us
would be only too glad to see him succeed against the cartel. This Week
(8.30 ITV) considers Virgin's latest efforts, directed at the South African
route, and consults one of Branson's predecessors in the cartel-busting
business, Freddy Laker. His advice is straightforward: 'Sue the bastards'.
Switch to Channel 4 when that ends and you will find television's beady eye
fixed upon another example of big business taking the small man to the
cleaners: The Barlow Clowes Affair.
A fresh batch of the Western series Paradise (11.20 BBC1) begins with the
supposedly retired gunfighter Ethan Cord tangling with a corrupt lawman to
prevent the hanging of a Texas Ranger who once saved his life. Since
television Westerns are now as rare as dragon's teeth it is a pity this one
is not better. Oddly enough, BBC2 begins the evening with Bonanza: The Next
Generation (6.00) which should irritate 'Bonanza' fans since it stars none
of the familiar cast.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Arts: Uncle Vanya - Cottesloe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Theatre's new production of Uncle Vanya at the Cottesloe is so
exquisite that I shall concentrate this review on how such technical
excellence is achieved rather than on Chekhov's play.
The production, directed by Sean Mathias, has come up through the National's
theatre studio, copiously housed in the Old Vic and adequately endowed by
private sources. The studio is being developed as a training ground for
British theatre as a whole. That means training not only in acting, but in
every detail of how to use a stage. Performers are encouraged to question
every word of the text, and there is even a special course in how to wear
under-garments that do not show but lend elegance to the clothes on top.
Never again should you see a Restoration comedy where the characters are
ill-dressed underneath. Perfection is all.
In the case of Uncle Vanya, there are other resources to hand: Sir Ian
McKellen, for example. McKellen must now be counted as the foremost British
actor of our age. Nevertheless, even he must have gained from the studio
experience. His Vanya brims with effortless superiority: the secret of such
apparent effortlessness, however, is that it requires a vast amount of work
behind the scenes. Whenever he is on stage, McKellen not only scores in his
own right, he also looks like the captain of the side.
He plays Vanya very quietly, and the rest of the cast perform in the same
way. Nothing is shouted that could be spoken softly. Every word, every
sound, makes the audience crane forward to hear. Yet it is not the words so
much as the movements, the physical presence, that stand out.
Look at the way McKellen wears his corduroy suit, as if he had been born
into it as a perfect fit. Watch the way he eats a plum, then wipes his
moustache with a handkerchief. See him put on his hat, then look again at
the way he walks, relaxes and crawls. There are a lot of physical movements
in this production, especially in this part. I do not recall seeing a
performance like it.
Yet McKellen is not alone. He is matched, among others, by Janet McTeer's
Yelena, the young wife of the elderly professor. Yelena is said in the text
to be beautiful. Ms McTeer is certainly stunning: her beauty is of the
imperial kind, mixed with an occasional loss of self-confidence. She uses
her height to the full: the costuming, and her wearing of it, is superb, for
she too descends to the floor.
One of her best scenes comes not with the men, but with Sonya, daughter of
the professor by his first marriage and niece to Vanya. Here is a view of
real female intimacy. 'Do I have silly look on my face?' Sonya asks when she
is telling Yelena of her love for the doctor, Astrov. Marvellously, she
does. Played by Lesley Sharp, she is up among the stars.
Astrov is often seen as a replica of Chekhov himself. He is played in this
production by Antony Sher, who must be one of the hardest actors to
discipline to a team performance, particularly when he is not the captain.
He has learned from the studio. His best scene comes alongside Yelena when
she has realised her love for him. Good as Sher is, he is also magnanimous
in allowing Ms McTeer to stand out. Note her sudden onset of breathlessness.
Listen also to the ticking of the clock in the background, another of the
details in which the production excels.
I have refrained deliberately from discussing the play as such. The
character of Yelena is not developed and the piece has an unsatisfactory
ending. Yet whatever you may think of Chekhov or Uncle Vanya, this
production is a total triumph for the art of theatre. The credits extend all
the way down the line, even to the watchmen who do not speak. Without the
studio approach, it would not have been possible.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Business Law: Burning question of unfairness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In few countries is 'fair' such a hallowed concept as in the UK. Indeed,
this English word has been adopted in most languages as a convenient label
for behaving in good faith and without seeking undue advantage from a
stronger bargaining position or exploiting technicalities of law.
Yet English law is almost alone in not recognising a general and overriding
duty of performing contracts in good faith and fairly, a principle which is
of crucial importance in the legal systems of all civil law countries and of
a number of common law countries, including the US, Australia and New
Zealand.
An optimistic view of this dichotomy has been best expressed by Lord Justice
Bingham in 1989 in the case of Interphoto Library v Stilleto.
After pointing out that the civil law principle of good faith means a great
deal more than that the parties ought not to deceive each other, he said:
'English law has, characteristically, committed itself to no such overriding
principle but has developed solutions in response to demonstrated problems
of unfairness.'
To this one must add that it does not do so always and that many such
burning problems of unfairness remain unanswered.
These problems are likely to become less tolerable after the ratification by
the UK of the UN Convention on International Contracts for the Sale of
Goods. This convention, which came into force on January 1 1988, has now
been ratified by 30 states, including all leading trading partners of the
UK. Seven more are in the process of ratifying it and, in a year or two, the
total number of ratifications is expected to reach 50.
Although the traditionalist faction of UK's legal establishment is opposed
to it - partly because the convention, like all products of compromise, has
a number of weaknesses, and partly because of an irrational fear of
novelties - ratification by the UK appears to be almost unavoidable for the
simple reason of business expediency.
In deference to the feelings of the UK's negotiators, the convention does
not say explicitly that contracts governed by it must be interpreted and
performed in good faith, but it achieves almost the same result by providing
(in Art. 7/1) that it should be interpreted with regard to the need '. . .
to promote . . . the observance of good faith in international trade'.
Once it is ratified, the convention will provide for international contracts
of sale governed by English law - as it already does for contracts governed
by laws of 30 other jurisdictions - common rules likely to enhance the
certainty of the contract clauses and the correct understanding of them by
sellers and buyers trading in different countries.
The weaknesses of the convention need not cause any alarm as the parties
will have the possibility of opting out of the convention or, better still,
to supplement it by incorporating into their contracts standard terms of
their own choice. One such set of terms, designed for this purpose, will
shortly be published by the Centre for Commercial Law Studies of the Queen
Mary and Westfield College in London.
There is yet another reason why one should not be shy of the convention. The
resurgence of masochistic traditionalism among English judges, which
followed the retirement of Lord Denning, is now receding. It is being
reversed by the ascendancy of judges who look beyond the narrow confines of
English law and are guided by Lord Reid's 1963 dictum that 'the common law
ought never to produce a wholly unreasonable result . . . '.
This new generation includes, but is not limited to, Lord Griffith and Lord
Goff in the House of Lords, Lord Donaldson, the Master of the Rolls, Lord
Justices Bingham and Steyn in the Court of Appeal, and by Chancery judges
represented by Mr Justice Warner and Mr Justice Hoffmann. There are many
more, and this narrow selection of names reflects only a relatively small
number of decisions which have caught the public's attention recently.
As a rule, the views of judges must be gleaned from their judgments as they
are not much given to public speaking. However, one of them, Lord Justice
Steyn did speak up recently on the hot subject of the role which good faith
and fair dealing have in contract law, when delivering the 1991 Royal Bank
of Scotland Law Lecture at the University of Oxford.
The straitjacket of the medieval literal interpretation of contract clauses
has been despised for centuries and the struggle of English judges to loosen
it found a reflection in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice: Portia is the
portrait of an ideal English judge.
Had she been really Venetian, she would have had no need to seek an
artificial construction of the contract; in real Venice, influenced by Roman
law, Shylock's petition would have been thrown out without much ado, seeing
that the contract was contra bonos mores, and could not be performed in good
faith.
It is because these two notions are still anathema to traditionalists that
judges, who do not want to preface their judgment by the hateful phrase
'with the greatest regret . . . ', have to, Portia-like, force the facts so
as to achieve a just result in spite of the ridiculously rigid doctrine.
Relying on his experience in the resolution of international trade disputes,
Lord Justice Steyn concluded that by using a roundabout route an English
Court reached, as a rule, the same result as a foreign court applying the
principle of good faith, but that ' . . . in a number of cases the rule
requiring good faith has enabled the foreign court to adjust relations
between the parties more equitably than an English court in similar
circumstances'.
The striving for a fair and just solution, notably by Lord Denning during
his long tenure of the office of the Master of the Rolls, led to piecemeal
introduction of the concept of good faith and fair dealing in the statutory
law, particularly by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.
It is ironical that the one contract requiring under common law 'the utmost
good faith' from both parties, has been excluded from the impact of this
statute by the operation of the powerful insurance lobby.
Lord Mansfield, one of the most European of English judges (he was a Scot),
attempted in 1766 to extend the requirement of utmost good faith to all
contracts. His view was soon rejected and the label of 'utmost good faith'
remains attached only to the contract of insurance. But even here, as Lord
Justice Steyn pointed out, the label does not correspond to reality.
This misleading description is attached to what is probably the largest body
of contracts in which businesses as well as individual citizens face a party
with an incomparably greater financial muscle than they possess and which
may easily bring financial ruin on those who take it to court.
The scales were loaded against the insured by the Court of Appeal in the
1984 case of Container Transport Inc v Oceanus Mutual Underwriting, when it
was held that repudiation of the contract of insurance by the insurer is
justified by any non-disclosure of relevant facts which the insurer would
take into account even if it was so minor and innocent that it would not
affect his decision.
This ruling was based on the restatement of common law in the Marine
Insurance Act 1906, but, as Lord Justice Steyn pointed out, it was equally
applicable outside marine insurance law.
'It is difficult to understand,' he said, 'why an underwriter should be able
to avoid a contract for non-disclosure, when he would have written the risk
anyway. . . . Moreover, how can avoidance on grounds of a non-disclosure,
which was causally irrelevant . . . be squared with the proposition that the
parties owe each other reciprocal duties of utmost good faith? And why
should an insured's position under a contract of utmost good faith be less
favourable than under the general law of misrepresentation which requires
proof of actual inducement?'
Why is this part of the English insurance law so difficult to reconcile with
duties of good faith and fair dealing? Victtorin Cornel ze Vsehrd, a 16th
century Czech jurist, provided the answer: 'Law is a thin cobweb, a beetle
breaks through but a fly is caught.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When words fail you
 -Business books / A quick look at summaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now you can read the best business books of 1992 - in just 15 minutes each,
screams the advertisement.
This is not another speed reading course. The idea is that you pay other
people to do your reading for you. Tucked away in Bristol, Vermont, are
teams of experts who grind their way though thousands of business books each
year. They reject more than 99 per cent and turn the remaining 30 or so into
eight-page summaries.
Hey Presto] Busy executives can save both time and money. The summaries
'slash hundreds of hours off reading time', and cost around Dollars 100 a
year - buying the books might cost eight times as much.
It is an offer that some 25,000 managers in the US have been unable to
resist. Now the company, Soundview Executive Book Summaries, is hoping to
reach a wider audience through its full-page advertisments in the Economist
magazine.
The scheme may not catch on. To the British eye, at least, the invitation
looks odd. The 30 summarised books are called 'outstanding', and readers are
warned that missing out on the ideas and insights could be a 'serious and
expensive mistake'.
Yet if the books are as good as that, the prospect of a summary is an
affront; executives should read the book themselves.
Not a bit of it: Soundview recalls a 'scientific study' that has shown the
busy executive is more likely to remember the ideas in a summary than in the
book itself.
Moreover, it claims that the summaries will make executives look intelligent
by giving them a 'talking knowledge' of the titles that are on everybody's
lips.
One thing seems certain: the service will reassure anyone who feels that a
rich literary world is passing them by. Of the 30 'outstanding' books last
year, one was 'Business Protocol' by Jan Yager. This tells executives not to
eat with their mouths full and not to pretend to be someone else on the
telephone in order to get through to an influential person. The book says
that business gifts are fine so long as they are not too expensive. It
recommends a photo album or coffee mug.
For readers who do not have the time to read the eight pages, the message is
summarised on the front cover: 'Like Your Mom Said: Good Manners Count'.
Alternatively, companies in crisis may be helped by the summary of 'The
Turnaround Survival Guide' by A David Silver. 'Like day-hikers who start out
in the warm sun and find themselves shivering in an ice storm 10 hours
later, you never know when you'll need survival skills.' One shudders to
think what the unexpurgated version is like.
However daft the idea might seem, it initially attracted competition from
Macmillan, the publishers, who subsequently switched to business book
summaries on tape instead. Now there's a good idea for businessmen who have
no time, and who can't read either.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why location counts
 -Different ways in which retailers go in search of the right site for
stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a saying in the retailing industry that only three things matter:
location, location and location. Site your shop in the right area, the
belief runs, and the world will beat a path to your door.
But how do retailers know what the right site is and, more importantly, how
do they go about finding it?
Until recently, retailers have been happy to entrust their choice to
chartered surveyors who advise about the availability and price of potential
sites. Inevitably this can be a somewhat hit-and-miss affair, depending
heavily on a surveyor's expertise. The costs of getting it wrong can be
enormous.
But many retailers are now adopting a more scientific approach to site
selection and are using a growing mass of demographic information to
determine the best location.
This week, Pinpoint, a market research company, is launching a new service
called Site Optimiser, which promises to extend the process further. Using a
range of market research information, Pinpoint will aim to find the optimal
location for a store leaving it up to the company and its surveyors to try
to match the ideal with the reality.
So, for example, Pinpoint would be able to search its computer database and
rank a range of possible sites for an electrical retailer on being
instructed that the company would ideally like a site in Manchester with a
high concentration of young, affluent, upwardly-mobile families within a
half an hour's drive.
At present Pinpoint uses a range of information culled from the 1981 census,
cross-referenced with data from CSO regional reports and family expenditure
surveys, and trade association figures.
But Paul Winters, managing director, predicts an 'explosion' of the range of
analysis following the release of the 1991 census figures later this year.
Publication of the census figures will provide a more detailed breakdown of
household characteristics than ever before and will include about twice the
information available in the 1981 census.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys will start releasing the
information in April, beginning with the Isle of Wight and concluding almost
a year later with south Glamorgan.
The data will include such details as the regional population break-down by
age, sex, nature of household ownership and car ownership. For the first
time, information on the ethnic origin of local populations and the
prevalence of central heating will be measured.
This information will allow retailers to develop more sophisticated models
of local economies and their spending patterns. It could also help shops
market themselves more effectively and even allow them to stock products
more closely tailored to their customers' needs.
Some consumer products companies are already experimenting with such
micro-marketing. For example, Heinz, the food group is running a series of
local radio commercials in Hindi in Yorkshire, the Midlands and London, to
encourage Asian mothers to buy a new range of 11 vegetarian baby meals.
Some retailers, particularly the grocery chains such as Tesco and J.
Sainsbury, have also developed highly sophisticated models of local spending
patterns and intensively research the demographic profile of any area in
which they intend to invest. Tesco claims that its assessments of a store's
potential turnover are usually accurate to within 5 per cent; when a modern
superstore costs up to Pounds 35m to build and turns over upwards of Pounds
50m a year, it is clearly critical to make the right choice of site.
Other retailers are also latching on to the benefits of rigorous site
appraisal but some of them prove that old-fashioned instinct can still prove
to be surprisingly effective.
For example, Kevin Threlfall, chairman and managing director of T&amp;S Stores,
which runs 583 convenience stores and tobacconists, swears by a very simple
method of assessing a store's viability: he counts the passers-by during a
five-minute period at the busiest time of the week, invariably between 11am
and 1 pm on a Friday or Saturday.
'If we had a site where 100 people passed within five minutes, then that
would equate to Pounds 10,000 turnover a week. Two hundred people would
represent Pounds 20,000. As a rule of thumb it is pretty accurate,' he says.
Other factors also come into play and T&amp;S prefers to site its stores next to
shops which have a high customer flow such as bakers or greengrocers, rather
than banks or building societies.
'It may not be very scientific but it certainly works for us,' says
Threlfall.

TIME ZONES are the curse of international businesses. When the day is nearly
over in the UK, Californians are just getting out of bed and the Japanese
have already gone home.
One benefit of E-Mail is in time-shifting. Like facsimile or the postal
services, the E-Mail message is ready to be read whenever the recipient
arrives at the desk. It combines the speed of the telephone with the
off-line readability of paper-based messages.
Sun Alliance has taken E-Mail outside the boundaries of simple intra-office
communication by integrating its messaging system with its brokers. Brokers
want to help their clients and will tend towards those insurers who can
offer a wide range of services. Clearly, the timeliness of obtaining a
quotation is an important part of the transaction.
The integration with the brokers' systems is an important part of the
success of this installation. Learning new methods is a barrier to
acceptance of any new technology. Any technique that makes the new system
appear to be a logical extension (or improvement) of the old will help
overcome resistance by users.
Forms are a metaphor that is familiar to office workers. Sensibly, the
computer forms were customised so that they resembled the paper forms that
the brokers were already using in other transactions. The result is a system
that is simple for the uninitiated or computer-shy user.
Electronic data entry has appealed to many industries for some time.
However, it is only recently that companies considered making their data
available to suppliers or customers.
Generating invoices on computer and then posting them to customers, who
re-type them into their own computers, is a waste of effort and money. It is
also error-prone. Exchanging the information directly between the two
computers seems more obvious.
While the Sun Alliance system is not yet a full EDI (electronic data
interchange) application, it has encapsulated the heart of the concept.
In the 1990s companies will tend to do business with organisations which
make their operations easier (or reduce their costs). Sun Alliance has shown
considerable vision in opening its E-mail system up to its brokers.

The insurance business may be conservative, even perceived as boring, but it
is highly competitive. It has to be - 1990 was the worst year this century
for insurers. Information technology has become a weapon with which to
outwit the opposition and defeat the in-house enemy of administrative cost.
This message is at the forefront of Sun Alliance International's (SAI)
readiness to discuss its use of electronic mail. It is guarded about details
 -arising from a belief that its electronic mail project gives it a strong
edge over competitors in building relationships with its brokers.
Cost studies made it clear that something had to be done to control the
increasing expense of conducting insurance business, for both insurers and
brokers. Most commercial insurance is supplied through insurance brokers,
such as Sedgwicks, which channels business through local offices to SAI's 10
regional offices.
The traditional method of placing business is based on paper form-filling.
Typically, a broker will approach a number of insurance companies with the
details of a piece of business, then send the details to a selected few. It
can take a minimum of a week, and as long as two weeks to gather the replies
and progress the business.
SAI's aim was to speed up the process to make doing business with the
company more attractive for brokers. 'Our use of IT in the relationship with
key customers is part of business development partnerships,' explains Alan
Waring, electronic marketing manager.
After 12 years in various parts of the Sun Alliance group, Waring joined the
marketing and sales department in January 1990, specifically to speed the
development of the E-Mail project. Its aims had been defined by a steering
group on electronic marketing, a sort of senior management forum which
derived its 'business' view of the international company from Peter Webster,
corporate services manager, and its IT view from Sun Alliance Management
Services.
Verimation's Memo electronic mail product had been introduced at SAI in
1987. Initially used for internal messaging, its use had spread throughout
the information systems division, and thereafter to the rest of the group.
'Telephone tag curses most people's working day,' comments Waring. 'The joy
of using electronic mail is that you are not restricted to office hours, nor
limited to the secretary's hours.' He gives an example of one SAI manager
who answered an E-Mail message at 1.30 in the morning - from the US. 'I
wasn't here at the time but the response was waiting for me in the morning.'
There were very few rules about how to implement electronic mail at the time
that SAI decided to use it to develop closer links with its brokers. But
there was a keen awareness of the potential of electronic data interchange,
electronic mail, and networking in the industry at large. Much of the
initiative came from the brokers themselves.
So, after detailed discussions with brokers, SAI was quick to pick up on the
potential of 'screen forms' for its marketing project, and agreed to try out
the idea with a couple of big customers.
The Verimation Memo forms facility allows each broker to adapt a basic
screen format to his own design. The advantage of screen-filling rather than
form-filling is speed. According to Waring, it gives the brokers the
opportunity to bulk-process routine tasks, such as claims notification,
without the usual phone call or posting of forms. 'Using E-Mail, they can
easily send in all the claims notifications for that day.'
At the time of the prototype project, there was a variety of applications on
offer from competitors, all aimed at solving the same problem of the
increasing cost of handling business. SAI's initial efforts were primarily
directed at small premium, high-volume business, controlled by the large
brokers who were trying to streamline their operations. Waring's discussions
soon broadened to include a bigger section of customers.
A steering committee of 10 people, a mixture of business and senior IT
managers, laid down the philosophy and plans of the wider project, and
defined that the responsibility for the E-Mail project belonged firmly in
marketing. E-Mail was one of a number of applications considered to make
dealings more cost-efficient.
The benefits of free-format E-Mail - whereby people send one another notes -
are obvious. Such messages are free of postal and typing delays, more
reliable, and legible, than fax, and have the facility of making a paper
copy, or even 'archiving' for records. Used properly, E-Mail can result in a
reduction of telephone and postal charges.
With the pre-formatted facilities, the benefits are similar, but there are
further time-savings. The technique of filling-in-the-blanks in
pre-formatted screens saves time in typing, and makes sure that nothing
essential gets missed when filling in details.
No one was interested in throwing away technology already in place.
Initially SAI put its own 3,270 terminals into the brokers' offices. But, as
Waring points out, the last thing brokers want is banks of terminals in
their offices.
There are three big software packages in the commercial insurance
marketplace - MCS, Misys and Policymaster. They run on Digital VMS, Unix,
Xenix and Aix respectively. SAI identified its target hardware hosts, and
negotiated with the software houses supplying the main packages to make
their systems 'interoperable' with Verimation Memo.
These third-party relationships were important in achieving a smooth and
relatively swift programme to spread the usage of E-mail. It made
implementation much easier and cheaper, also more attractive to the brokers,
but implementation costs and the solving of communications difficulties have
represented a large proportion of the costs.
The tailored screens, closely aligned to the paper, make the changeover less
traumatic for staff.
A broker can now send details, particularly of complex risks, to a dedicated
person at SAI. The 'human factor' - one of the aspects of the project about
which some users had reservations - is still critical in getting a swift
response. 'There was no way we wanted to take the personal relationships out
of the way we do business,' says Waring. He admits there was fear that IT
would detract from the relationships built up over years, 'but what we've
found is that the way we've delivered the systems, personal relationships
actually strengthen'.
Access to mainframe records at SAI was another incentive to the brokers.
Some, with their own E-Mail systems, have linked the Verimation system to
Wang Office, Office Vision, Mail Exchange and other proprietary systems. Now
there is a strong dialogue between SAI and its brokers, reviewing ideas, and
continuing education and awareness.
For competitive reasons, comments from the brokers have to be kept
anonymous, but their enthusiasm has grown as the paperwork has shrunk.
Typical are: 'A failsafe method of communication . . . extremely easy and
quick to use . . . saves time . . . saves money on telephone and postal
charges' and 'you can avoid a protracted phone call with a short message . .
. involve a chain of people with one message at the same time.'
Waring stresses that the decision-making was all made from a business angle.
He could draw on the expertise of IT people, but it was up to him to decide
on the business problems and discuss the possible solutions. The result of
this step-by-step approach was that E-Mail quickly became an integral part
of the business operations for SAI's business partners.
'There was wide interest in the customer base once there was a recognition
that it wasn't a here-today, gone-tomorrow feature of the industry, but here
to stay and develop. It's a matter of IT support for business relationships,
part of making SAI a more attractive partner,' he says.
The series will continue on the Technology page in April. The Quarterly
Review of Software at Work will appear on March 19.
BUZZWORDS
E-Mail, the common abbreviation for electronic mail, is a software product
usually run on networked PCs or mainframe systems, where the user can
communicate with anyone on the system though defined groups and often on
pre-formatted screen layouts.
Interoperability denotes the integration of information from disparate
systems. Unlike open systems, it entails exhanging data structures between
incompatible operating environments.

Company Snapshot
Sun Alliance was founded in London in 1710 as an insurance company. It now
consists of four operating companies, focused on overseas, life, UK, and
international business. They are supported by a number of companies dealing
with property, information technology and other matters. These come under
the care of Sun Alliance Management Services.
Nature of business: Commercial insurance, in such areas as professional
indemnity, shipping or any insurance required by a company in the pursuit of
its business.
Turnover: Pounds 3,4bn (1990) and pre-tax profits of Pounds 181m (1990)
TECHNOLOGY FILE
Software: The electronic mail system used is Verimation's Memo, a strong
competitor for IBM's own mainframe E-Mail product, introduced at Sun
Alliance in 1987.
Hardware: Five large IBM or IBM-compatible mainframes (total processing
capacity of 280 Mips) at two sites, running the MVS operating system.
Installation: This can take anything from a couple of weeks to a couple of
years to complete, depending on the facilities required.
Communications: A large part of the project has been to link participating
brokers, each with its own hardware system, to Sun Alliance's own IBM
system.
Software cost: Around Pounds 45,000 to implement Verimation for an unlimited
number of users. The broker's system involved no extra Memo licensing costs.
Training: SAI sent 12 people on a training course at Lucas Systems to teach
them about workflow tools ('intelligent' Memo forms for electronic trading)
at a cost of Pounds 1,800.
Other systems: IBM's IMS is the principal teleprocessing product used in the
Sun Alliance mainframe environment. Cics is used in conjunction with IBM's
DB2 database. Most of the group's data is stored on IBM databases.

FT  27 FEB 92 / London's voluntary groups see funds fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITY financial support for London's voluntary sector has declined
at a time of escalating need, research conducted for the capital's statutory
grant-making body has concluded.
A survey of 27 of the 33 London borough councils showed funding for
voluntary groups fell from Pounds 141m in 1990-91 to Pounds 127m in 1991-92.
Only seven boroughs maintained their financial support in real terms. In
inner London - where many of the capital's social problems are concentrated
 -reductions in spending were more than twice as great as in outer boroughs.
The research was conducted by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry on
behalf of the London Boroughs Grants Committee, which makes grants to
voluntary organisations operating in more than one borough.
Mr Serge Lourie, a Liberal Democrat councillor who chairs the committee,
said the research showed a 'critical' situation in which funding could not
keep up with needs.
He said: 'Our concern is that the disintegration of our social fabric
threatens London's future prosperity.'
The research is the latest in a series of studies showing that, in spite of
government pressure for voluntary organisations to take on additional
duties, the sector's financial difficulties are worsening. The London
chamber believes demand for voluntary organisations' services will continue
to grow, while the financial climate in which they operate is unlikely to
improve.
The chamber's report said: 'Continued and perhaps increased restrictions on
local authority spending will squeeze resources at borough and London
Boroughs Grants Committee level, while recession will reduce the amount of
private sector money available.'
It argued that the voluntary sector's contribution to the vitality and
prosperity of London 'needs to be recognised at the highest levels of
business and government'. The 'dramatic reductions' in local authority
funding raised the need for improved efficiency in the use of existing
resources, but this did not negate the need for greater financial input from
both the public and private sectors.

MORE THAN a third of school pupils on the government's assisted places
scheme, which subsidises places at independent schools, come from families
earning above the national average wage, according to a study published
yesterday.
Based on a survey of 3,500 assisted-place pupils across Britain, it shows
that 35 per cent of families benefiting from the scheme had an income of
more than Pounds 15,000 a year, with 14 per cent earning more than Pounds
20,000 a year.
The scheme, which this year pays part or all of the school fees of 33,000
pupils, was established by the government in 1980 to enable children from
low-income families to go to the private sector.
It will cost nearly Pounds 65m this year and a planned Pounds 78m next year.
The Independent Schools Information Service, which commissioned the survey,
pointed to the 38 per cent of assisted pupils found to come from manual
working-class homes and the 32 per cent from families earning less than
Pounds 8,714 and receiving full assistance with fees.

FT  27 FEB 92 / National Institute Economic Review: Motor parts industry
lags far behind Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PRODUCTIVITY gap between the UK and German vehicle components industries
narrowed in the 1980s according to the National Institute.
The report says both countries still lag far behind the productivity of
Japanese suppliers.
In the 1980s, UK components suppliers 'finally dealt with blatant
under-utilisation of capital equipment, but this has not proved to be
enough'.
The report highlights deficiencies in UK training and education as
underlying causes for low productivity.
Mr Christopher Carr, senior fellow in strategic management at Manchester
Business School, the author of the report, says that if the remaining gap
between the UK and German industries is to be bridged, 'the 1990s needs to
become the decade in which Britain grapples with similarly blatant
under-utilisation of people's full career potentials'.
The report says that 'the critical conclusion, however, is that while
Britain may still have some lessons to learn from Germany in respect to
manufacturing productivity, the much larger and still continuing gap is
against Japan'.
According to one battery maker, 'while the most efficient battery plants in
western Europe were now generally up to six or seven batteries per man
hour,' the Japanese were producing more than 10.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / BTR chief defends corporate leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England and the Institutional Shareholders' Committee were
'doing a disservice to investors by encouraging them to think of themselves
as owners' according to Sir Owen Green, chairman of the conglomerate BTR,
yesterday.
Speaking at the annual investment conference of the National Association of
Pension Funds in Eastbourne, he robustly attacked institutional investors'
attitudes to corporate governance.
Debating with Mr Mike Sandland, chairman of the ISC, he denounced concepts
such as audit committees and independent non-executive directors. 'The word
independence sticks in my gullet,' said Sir Owen, whose company has been one
of the most successful in Britain over the past 20 years.
'I don't think there is very much wrong with corporate governance as it
stands,' he said. There might be a problem with institutional investors
growing so large that they could not easily sell investments in companies
they did not like, but that, he said, was a fiscal problem rather than one
of corporate governance.
Mr Sandland, an investment manager with Norwich Union, said shareholders
should assume the responsibilities of ownership. Institutional investors
should show their commitment by registering votes and playing a full role as
active shareholders.
Sir Owen said shareholders would be better regarded as freeholder landlords
than owners of public companies. 'It is different in concept from the
ownership of goods and chattels,' he insisted.
In one respect, however, Sir Owen supported in principle a recent
pronouncement of the ISC, which represents the view of various kinds of
institutions including pension funds. He agreed that the chairman of a
company should not be the chief executive as well.
Even here, however, he suggested that the ISC had 'copped out'. Too many
important people had influenced the ISC, which continued reluctantly to
accept the combination of the two roles subject to safeguards and
conditions. 'It ought to be stopped tomorrow,' Sir Owen said.

FT  27 FEB 92 / FT Conference on International Banking: European merger wave
predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAVE of mergers is likely to sweep through the banking and insurance
sectors of several European countries with the onset of the single European
market, a Financial Times conference in London on international banking was
told yesterday.
Mr Jurgen Lemmer, deputy member of the board of managing directors of
Commerzbank, said mergers in Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia
had already changed the list of the biggest banks in those countries.
This would soon be the case in Italy, too, and there were signs of mergers
between the public-sector Landesbanks in Germany.
'Up to now the banking industry has not produced any institutions with a
prominent position through Europe as a whole. The market share of the
largest, Credit Agricole or Deutsche Bank, is barely more than 2 per cent.
By contrast the largest carmakers, Volkswagen and Fiat, each account for
about 15 per cent of the western European market,' Mr Lemmer said.
Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of BZW, the securities and investment arm of
Barclays Bank, said he believed that the rules and system of regulation
governing investment banking were adequate. He said it was a perverse result
of improved regulation rather than slackening standards that markets were
trusted less today than in the past.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Canada bites the fiscal bullet: A budget bent on harsh
economic restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S finance minister tabled a budget this week which aims to lay the
groundwork for his party's next election campaign but at the same time to
take a few steps forward in the painful restructuring of the Canadian
economy.
Mr Donald Mazankowski, who has a reputation as one of the Progressive
Conservative government's shrewdest politicians, announced modest tax cuts
for both individuals and companies. As another spur to growth, the
withholding tax on dividends paid to foreigners is being halved to 5 per
cent.
But one of the pillars of Mr Mazankowski's budget package illustrates how
Canadians are being led - not always willingly - towards a more hard-nosed
existence than the one provided for decades by a pervasive, protective and
free-spending government.
For the past 47 years, every parent has received a monthly 'family
allowance' cheque to help pay child expenses. The government began clawing
these back from upper-income households a few years ago. But if the
proposals made on Tuesday become law, the cheques themselves will stop
arriving at about half a million homes next January.
This and some of the budget's other measures fit a pattern of economic
restructuring which also includes the negotiation of the 1989 free trade
agreement with the US, Ottawa's participation in more recent talks to bring
Mexico into the that agreement, and the stern monetary policy which has
earned the Bank of Canada the nickname of the Bundesbank of North America.
Free trade is forcing Canadian companies and workers to become more
competitive or face a mass southbound exodus of jobs. Tight monetary
policies have helped bring down Canada's inflation rate to a year-on-year
rate of 1.6 per cent in January, the lowest among the Group of Seven
industrialised economies.
In the budget, tax concessions are balanced by discipline on the spending
side. Mr Mazankowski observed at a press conference after his budget speech
that people from coast to coast are telling Ottawa that they are 'sick and
tired of paying the bills'. 'Government must scale down.'
To help pay for the tax breaks, Ottawa plans to cut several hallowed
programmes and institutions. Canadian combat troops are being withdrawn from
Europe. Subsidies on student loans are to be cut. A total of 46 government
agencies are to be either abolished or taken over by other bodies.
The risk of Mr Mazankowski being blown off course is substantial. His
assumptions of a 4.5 per cent growth rate in 1993 and a decline in interest
rates for the next two years are more optimistic than most forecasts.
Mr Mazankowski aims to bring the budget deficit down from CDollars 31.4bn
(Pounds 15bn) in the year to March 31, to CDollars 27.5bn in 1992/93. He
plans to lower the deficit from a peak of 6.7 per cent as a proportion of
gross domestic product in 1985 to 1.7 per cent in 1994.
But the government has a spotty record in meeting its targets. Just a year
ago, it promised a 1992/93 shortfall of only CDollars 24bn.
Unlike the US and UK, Canada is proposing a discretionary fiscal tightening,
instead of allowing the automatic fiscal stabilisers to work unhindered. The
scars of the profligacy of the early 1980s remain. The government has no
wish to return to the budgetary difficulties of that time.
Nevertheless, the temptation to loosen the purse strings over the next 12
months will be heightened by the approach of the next election, which is
likely to be called by mid-1993.
It is surely no accident that the proposed reduction in manufacturers' tax
rates (from 23 per cent to 21 per cent) will be phased in over the course of
a year to January 1994, while the entire cut in the personal surtax (from 5
per cent to 3 per cent) will be in place a full year earlier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Rio's hoteliers, shopkeepers, businessmen and tourist agents
held a demonstration along Copacabana beach yesterday to protest against the
resort's increasing violence, which, they say, is destroying its tourist
industry.
Since 1987, the number of tourists visiting Brazil has plummetted from
almost 2m to 800,000, largely because of Rio's spiralling crime rate. As a
result, Rio has suffered an estimated Dollars 400m loss in revenue,
according to Mr Ronaldo Monterosa, president of Embratur, the Brazilian
tourist authority.
'Over the last five years we have watched tourism collapse,' said Mr Philip
Carruthers, general manager of the Copacabana Palace hotel and president of
the Association of Hoteliers.
'Occupancy of five-star hotels in peak months has fallen from 97 per cent to
63 per cent. The main reason is Rio's appalling image, which is based on a
fundamental reality - complete lack of security.'
He complained that his hotel staff have to prevent guests leaving the hotel
with cameras, jewellery or watches because of the 'complete ineffectiveness'
of the police. 'The police here are part of the problem rather than the
solution.'
Immediately after the press conference, two journalists were stopped at
knifepoint near the hotel and opposite a police cabin.
Mr Paulo Protasio, head of Rio's Chamber of Commerce, said 'we need to
mobilise Rio's taxpayers to see that this constant drop in tourism, which is
the state's principal economic activity, is jeopardising everyone's jobs.'
He said the aim of yesterday's march was to press the state authorities into
taking action.
Rio's commercial and tourism associations have presented a plan to the state
governor for the creation of a new 1,500-strong bilingual tourist police
force which would be well-paid and better motivated.
Mr Protasio pointed out that Rio should be capitalising on the World
Environment Conference, which it is hosting in June, to present a new image.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Argentina yesterday began discussions in Buenos Aires on
developing oil resources in the South Atlantic, writes John Barham from
Buenos Aires.
The talks, expected to last two to three days, are the first formal
negotiations on the most challenging and complex issue facing the two sides,
apart from the central question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.
It has long been rumoured that the seabed around the islands holds large oil
reserves. However, there has been no exploration in the region since an
inconclusive survey in the 1970s.
Last year, London authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue
seismic exploration licences, bringing the fraught issue of oil resources to
the fore.
If oil is found in commercial quantities around the islands, co-operation
with Argentina would be essential to develop the reserves. Major gasfields
have been found in Argentine waters between Tierra de Fuego and the
Falklands, but, so far, little oil has been found.
Although both sides will use this week's talks to set out their points of
view, issues such as harmonisation of legislation, law enforcement,
taxation, environmental policies and the demarcation of zones are yet to be
addressed. Inevitably, they will touch either directly or indirectly on the
sensitive issue of sovereignty.
The islands' councillors have yet to pass any oil legislation. Their laws
will depend on the outcome of the talks with Buenos Aires. However,
Argentina does not recognise the Falklands' local government.

VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has used this week's cabinet
reshuffle to achieve a stronger political base, more support from his own
Democratic Action party, and a tougher image on crime and corruption.
The changes, carried out late on Tuesday, represent an effort to recapture
the political initiative following the failed military coup of three weeks
ago. However, they do not signal an economic policy shift.
The President named Mr Carmelo Lauria, an important official in two previous
governments, to the key post of interior minister; Mr Ricardo Hausmann to
the ministry of planning; Mrs Arminda Quintana to the justice ministry and
Mr Celestino Armas, formerly minister of energy and mines, to the ministry
of the presidential secretariat. The Venezuelan press said other changes
would be announced soon.
The most important change in the economic sector was the moving of Mr Miguel
Rodriguez from the ministry of planning to the presidency of the central
bank.
Mr Rodriguez, 39, has been a leading architect of economic reform and one of
the most powerful figures in the government. He is expected to devote much
time to fighting inflation.
Mr Rodriguez has declared he is in favour of regular mini-devaluations of
the Venezuelan bolivar, and is also said to favour strong banking reform. He
replaced Mr Pedro Tinoco, who announced his resignation last week.
The appointment of Mr Lauria, who offers a rare combination of broad
experience in the public and private sectors, reflects the president's
desire to control one of the country's most sensitive problems: violent
crime.
Figures from the two main opposition political parties refused Mr Perez's
invitation to join the cabinet. However, Mr Perez yesterday established a
new presidential consulting committee to provide advice on key national
problems. The panel is made up of prominent individuals from the private
sector and the opposition.
An announcement on the energy and mines portfolio is expected soon.

MR Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, yesterday said he regretted that
Canada had decided to bring home its troops from Europe, signalling alliance
concern about the weakening of crucial transatlantic links, Reuter reports.
Canada's government announced the decision on Tuesday as part of cuts to
pull the country out of recession.
'While I recognise the financial pressures which led to this decision, I
have noted it with considerable regret, given the political and military
importance of the presence of Canadian forces in Europe,' Mr Worner said.
Britain yesterday also expressed concern at the Canadian move. 'The decision
to withdraw the remaining Canadian forces is a sad end to a long and valued
Canadian deployment in West Europe,' the Foreign Office said. 'We note that
the withdrawal will be phased over two to three years and we hope that this
may give time (for Canada) to reconsider.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / S African parties back safeguards for minorities
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN political parties have agreed in principle to include
protection for minorities in a new constitution, one of the most sensitive
issues in multi-party democracy talks.
The parties, meeting in the forum known as the Convention For a Democratic
South Africa (Codesa), have yet to discuss detailed proposals for protecting
minorities, a bottom-line demand of the National Party government before any
deal on a post-apartheid constitution. Working out a final plan will take
time.
But government ministers yesterday welcomed the fact that the Codesa working
group charged with drawing up constitutional principles had agreed that
'meaningful participation by political minorities' should be one of them.
That phrase is National party shorthand for protection of minorities, mainly
whites.
Yesterday, the party released details of its proposals on this issue. Mr
Tertius Delport, deputy constitutional development minister, said mere
representation for minorities - for example, a white block of seats in
parliament - would not guarantee 'meaningful participation', since that
block would be outvoted by the majority. The National Party's plan relies on
the principle of consensus decision-making, with minorities given a
disproportionately large say in government policy at central, regional and
local government levels, with maximum devolution of power.
The National Party said yesterday that normal liberal democratic protections
such as a bill of rights, an independent judiciary and mechanisms to prevent
abuse of power were insufficient to prevent domination in South Africa's
racially and culturally diverse society.
It cited Belgium, where the cabinet includes an equal number of French- and
Dutch-speaking ministers (apart from the prime minister), and where a
principle of parity applies in other government structures down to local
level. The statement insisted such protections should be entrenched in a
constitution; the African National Congress says coalition government must
develop naturally.
Mr Roelf Meyer, defence minister, sought to reassure whites that government
would not surrender control of police or army during transition from white
rule, though joint control could be implemented if passed by parliament.
Black township violence and rising crime in white areas are likely to be
central to the right-wing Conservative Party's campaign for a vote against
political reform in the referendum.
The neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) has reversed its decision
to boycott the March 17 referendum and has joined the Conservative Party's
campaign for a 'no' vote.

<TEXT>
PALESTINIAN delegates yesterday went into the third session of Middle East
peace talks insisting they would only discuss Israeli settlements and what
they described as human rights abuses in the occupied territories.
They ridiculed the Israeli plan for Palestinian self-rule presented on
Monday, calling it an attempt to negate the whole purpose of the peace
process. Israel planned to bring in the first of its experts yesterday to
analyse issues involved in its proposals for interim self-governing
arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said the
scheme put forward by Israel was a tactic to use the peace process to
reorganise the occupation. By proposing two separate legal systems for the
West Bank and Gaza, for Jewish settlers and Palestinians, Israel was trying
to legitimise the annexation of the territories and set up a formal
apartheid system.
Efforts are continuing in Washington to find a formula allowing Israel
access to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) loan guarantees requested to settle
immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

</HEADLINE>

   By EMILIA TAGAZA

<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL concessions were offered to the mining industry in an attempt to
boost flagging exploration and development.
The economic statement, delivered by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
announced abolition of the 50 per cent Australia equity requirement for new
mines, and of the economic benefits test for acquiring existing mines.
The government also increased the threshold of foreign investment screening
to ADollars 50m (Pounds 21.4m). The new threshold applies to all mining
proposals except uranium, where the limit of three mines continues. Foreign
investment proposals of less than ADollars 50m, including those in the
mining sector, would be automatically approved unless the project were
judged against the national interest.
In considering whether a mining proposal was against the national interest,
the government would give weight to downstream opportunities and value-added
processing. Mr Keating announced removal of export controls on iron ore and
the introduction of 'life of mine' approval for mineral sands projects.
The statement addressed problems for mining arising from the Aboriginal
Heritage Protection Act, used to stop or delay projects. The government is
to act immediately to streamline procedures for assessing heritage concerns
at local, state and federal level.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Brussels tries to rescue fisheries agreement with Morocco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community was yesterday trying to patch up a diplomatic breach
with Morocco in time to save a fisheries accord which runs out on Saturday.
The difference was caused by January's decision by the European Parliament
to vote against Ecu463m (Pounds 328m) in loans and grants because of
Moroccan human rights abuses and its failure to comply with the United
Nations peace plan for Western Sahara.
The fishing agreement, mainly of interest to 700 Spanish and a few
Portuguese vessels, had worked smoothly. But after the parliament's veto,
Rabat was sufficiently enraged to call into question both the fisheries
accord and the co-operation agreement with the EC under which the loan and
aid programme was agreed last summer.
Efforts by the European Commission and Council of Ministers to persuade
parliament to reconsider failed to get the Moroccan finance package on the
agenda at this month's plenary session.
As a consequence, foreign ministers, acting on Spain and Portugal's
suggestion, decided last week in Lisbon to explore the possibility of a free
trade agreement with Morocco. Mr Vitor Martins, secretary of state for
Europe of Portugal, which currently holds the EC presidency, met Mr
Abdellatif Filali, the Moroccan foreign minister, yesterday to try to
prolong the fisheries deal for at least three months, officials in Brussels
said.
The free trade carrot has two tactical virtues to recommend it. First, the
suggestion has gone down well in Rabat, officials in Brussels say, where
King Hassan has seized on it as a move towards the special relationship he
has sought with the EC ever since his application for Community membership
in 1987 was rebuffed. Second, by going the free trade route, the Commission
and the Council largely circumvent the parliament.
Co-operation agreements must reach a high bar of 260 votes at Strasbourg to
get through. But a free trade agreement, although much wider in scope, would
at the moment reduce parliament to an advisory role, since it would be
routed through the 113 Committee, made up of the member states and the
Commission, which decides EC commercial policy.
But some officials regard the free trade idea as little more than a gesture
to get the EC over the fisheries accord hurdle by signalling Community
willingness to explore a closer relationship with Morocco. Much of the trade
between the EC and Morocco is already free anyway, with the conspicuous
exception of agriculture, which has about nil chance of becoming so.
Parliament, moreover, will get a big say on free trade agreements once the
Maastricht treaty on European union comes into force next year, and there is
no hope of concluding a deal by then, even assuming one was being seriously
pursued.
But because Spain originated the gesture, officials hope King Hassan will
reciprocate by helping out its fishing armada. If its does not, the
Commission is preparing a financing package to help the fishing industry
through any lay-off period.

The islands, which lie off the northern coast of Japan, were seized by the

subject of a territorial dispute.
Tokyo hopes the end of the Cold War could lead to serious negotiations with
Moscow over the islands. But Russian leaders have yet to go beyond

MR KEATING'S statement has paved the way for a free-for-all market for
Australian and New Zealand domestic and international airlines.
It removes curbs on equity investment among Australian airlines, letting
Qantas, the international carrier, buy into Australian Airlines and other
domestic carriers, and the domestic airlines buy into Qantas.
Qantas will be allowed to carry domestic passengers while the established
domestic airlines will be allowed to fly international routes.
Domestic airline deregulation began in late 1990, when the government
revoked the two-airline policy confining the market to Australian Airlines
and Ansett. It now aims at a single aviation market between Australia and
New Zealand by 1994, with each country's airlines having full access to the
other's market.
Mr Keating said Wellington had assured Canberra that full integration in
aviation would be a priority. It was recognised both markets were relatively
small, with scope for the industry to reorganise.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial production for January fell 0.8 per cent from December,
allaying fears it had fallen sharply during the month, but signifying the
fourth consecutive month of year-on-year decline.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said the
seasonally-adjusted production index stood at 124.8, against a base of 100
for 1985, while the shipment index gained 1 per cent from December to 127.6
and the inventory index stayed flat at 124.5.
The fall in output was less than expected, but Miti said the decline was
likely to continue over the next few months, with a 0.7 per cent decrease
predicted for February and a 1.3 per cent fall for March.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, said the economy was 'not
contracting quickly' and the bank was more concerned about price stability
than falling industrial output. Japanese politicians have urged the central
bank to cut the official discount rate from its present 4.5 per cent. But Mr
Mieno said monetary policy should not be altered to respond to short-term
economic indicators. Prices were stable, but upward price pressure could
return quickly.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Restrictions lifted on foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN banks are being given virtually free rein to set up branches or
subsidiaries in Australia, and buy into the smaller domestic trading banks.
The move is part of a sweeping banking reform including changes to the
treatment of non-bank financial institutions and to the tax treatment of
banks' bad debts.
The lifting of curbs on the number of foreign banks is a follow-on to the
government's 1985 deregulatory push, which allowed entry to only 15 foreign
banks.
Under the 1985 policy, licences were granted only to foreign bank
subsidiaries.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the rationale for limiting the
number had lost its force. He expected foreign banks to raise the efficiency
of the Australian financial system by providing competition, especially in
business lending and in credit risk assessment.
Under changes to be introduced in the Banking Act, foreign branches'
activities will be confined to wholesale banking. Retail banking will be
allowed in locally-incorporated subsidiaries. Foreign branches will not have
to maintain 'endowed capital' in Australia, nor be subject to the Reserve
Bank's limits on capital-based exposure. But they will still be subject to
Reserve Bank liquidity and prudential requirements.
To put more foreign institutions under Reserve Bank control, exemptions
enjoyed by money market companies calling themselves merchant banks will be
revoked. Under present rules, merchant banks are outside the Reserve Bank's
prudential control. About 90 foreign institutions conduct banking or
quasi-banking businesses, of which 17 operate as authorised banks. Over 50
operate as merchant banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government should resist calls from manufacturers and others
for a slow-down in the pace of tariff reductions, according to a report on
Australia's trade with north-east Asia, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
The report, by the Foreign Affairs Department's East Asia Analytical Unit,
says attempts to protect domestic industries through protection and
government intervention would damage Australia's trade prospects. The report
is an update of a 1989 study by Professor Ross Garnaut which provided much
of the justification for government plans to reduce tariffs to negligible
levels by early next century.
It says north-east Asia - especially Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and Hong
Kong - is crucial to Australia's future economic performance.
The region already takes 40 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports, and
provides 20 per cent of investment. The region will continue to grow faster
than most parts of the world, and the report warns that Australia needs to
stay abreast of important changes, including the movement of manufacturing
operations to lower-cost countries.
The report rejects the argument that countries in the region have benefited
from intervention by governments in selected industrial sectors.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSIDIES are distorting world trade in textiles and clothing, and hurting
UK exporters, according to a report published today by the London-based
Apparel, Knitting &amp; Textiles Alliance (AKT), writes David Dodwell.
Biggest offenders are India, Pakistan and China, says the report. Subsidies
range from simple cash support for exports to subsidy of raw materials, or
subsidised loans for investment and export.
The AKT, which represents the UK's Pounds 15bn textile and clothing
industries, calls for a ban on export subsidies, increased transparency,
rights to impose countervailing duties on offending exporters, and agreed
international environmental standards.
The alliance calls on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to
tighten rules on the use of subsidies, and to enable rapid investigation of
abuses. The UK industries have trimmed an estimated 87,000 jobs since 1988.
Among investment subsidies, the AKT targets South Korea's recently agreed
plan to provide Pounds 2.5bn to promote investment in its textiles and
clothing industry.
Controlled prices for raw cotton in Pakistan and China provided effective
subsidies of Pounds 350m and Pounds 1.5bn respectively in 1991 to textile
and garment exporters, the report claims.

SENIOR European Community diplomats yesterday cleared the way for
implementation of the free trade agreements between the EC and Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but asked the European Commission to continue
discussions with the Poles about their alleged discrimination in favour of
certain EC car imports.
EC objections to Poland's plan to divide its quota of duty-free car imports
between General Motors, Fiat and Volkswagen - and impose a duty on other EC
car imports - had threatened to delay implementation of the agreements on
March 1.
But diplomats agreed yesterday to freeze the relevant clauses of the
agreement with Poland until the dispute was resolved. In effect, this will
mean that trade in cars can continue, but neither side will introduce a
duty-free quota system until the Commission and the Polish government have
found a solution.
France raised last-minute objections to Poland's plans at Tuesday's meeting
of EC internal market ministers, and was backed by the Commission and other
member states. An EC official said that Greece had also dropped its threat
to block the agreements with Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

CHINA yesterday angrily rejected a US Senate bill attaching conditions to
renewal of China's preferential trade status with the United States, warning
it would harm relations, Reuter and our foreign staff report.
'The bill violates the principle of mutual benefit of bilateral trade, and
the Chinese side rejects this and will never accept it,' the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement on national radio. 'This kind of conditionality
will harm bilateral trade and diplomatic relations.'
Both countries yesterday gave conflicting accounts of progress made between
them in talks in Beijing. The Chinese press said progress had been made on a
number of specific issues.
However, Mr Joseph Massey, assistant US trade representative, told a press
conference in Beijing that 'we made no specific progress in terms of a
document or set of commitments to advance the talks beyond where we have
been.' Mr Massey said the differences between the two sides were
substantial, with the US calling for profound changes in practices, policies
and regulations governing trade in China, many of which remain secret.
The Senate on Tuesday approved a bill linking renewal of China's
Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status to improvements in Beijing's record
on human rights, trade and missile proliferation.
Washington first granted China MFN status in 1980 and it has been renewed on
a year-by-year basis since then.
The vote marks the opening shot in what is likely to be a period of
aggressive exchanges between China and the US as the deadline for renewal of
MFN status approaches on July 3. It also marks the end of a brief period of
calm in US-China trade relations.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX European Community countries and Switzerland are intending this week to
denounce the International Labour Organisation convention banning night work
by women in industry. The move has been hailed by supporters as ending
unjustified sex discrimination but decried by critics as increasing women's
vulnerability to exploitation.
After this week no Community country will be bound by the 1948 ILO
Convention, whose 48 remaining adherents will be almost exclusively drawn
from the Third World. Germany, Britain and Denmark never ratified the
convention, and Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands pulled out 10 years
ago. Now Belgium, France, Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal are taking
advantage of the latest year-long 'window' for revoking ratification of the
convention which expires this month.
Their decision reflects a ruling last year by the European Court that a
French law forbidding nightwork by women was discriminatory, and so illegal
under Community law. Governments and employers have also complained that the
1948 convention, which applies only to industry, is too rigid.
In Switzerland, where the government's denunciation decision was preceded by
a long public debate, trade unions argued that the nightwork ban (with
exceptions) should be extended to men and expressed fears that scrapping it
could make women especially vulnerable to pressure to work at night by
employers because they tend to be cheaper to employ.
Some estimates suggest that in the Swiss economy as a whole more women
already work at night than men since they predominate in services such as
nursing, hotels, cleaning and so on where nightwork is routine.
The European Commission in Brussels has recommended that member countries
ratify ILO Convention No. 171 of 1990 - a 'new generation', more flexible
convention which aims to improve conditions for all nightworkers, men as
well as women, in services as well as industry.
The convention includes provisions on pay for unsocial hours, health
monitoring, the right to transfer to day work for medical reasons and
maternity protection. Switzerland has already said it plans to change its
law on working conditions with ratification of the 1990 convention in mind.

Another political row has broken around the Polish government following the
appointment of Mr Radek Sikorski, a 29-year-old naturalised British citizen
and a former Warsaw correspondent of the London Sunday Telegraph, as a
deputy defence minister. President Lech Walesa served notice that he would
contest a decision widely criticised by press and politicians.
Mr Sikorski obtained British citizenship after leaving Poland during the
martial law period. 'As a loyal citizen of the British crown will he be an
equally loyal citizen of the Polish republic when he gets access to the most
confidential state secrets?' asked the mass circulation Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper. Over the past year Mr Sikorski worked as a consultant in Warsaw
for media magnate Rupert Murdoch.
Control over the armed forces remains a sensitive political issue. Last
month the government's decision to chose a civilian defence minister, Mr Jan
Parys, to replace replace Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczk brought it into
conflict with Mr Walesa.
The president wanted to reassure the military by keeping one of their number
at the head of the defence ministry. The government was equally keen to show
that it is intent in severing the links with Poland's communist past.

fill the economic policy vacuum caused by the resignation of Mr Karol
Lutkowski, the finance minister.
The 44-year-old economist will have to be approved by the parliamentary
budget committee and by the lower chamber of parliament, which is expected
to vote on the nomination later this week.
Mr Olechowski, who, as minister of foreign trade, played a key role in
negotiating last year's EC association agreement and was deputy chairman of
the Polish central bank before that, faces difficult budgetary and other
decisions once he wins approval. Mr Lutkowski resigned after six weeks
saying he had no confidence the government would avoid inflationary
policies.
Earlier this week the government announced a 12 per cent devaluation of the
zloty against a basket of five western currencies to improve Polish
competitiveness and offset the impact of domestic inflation. The latter is
running at an annualised rate of around 70 per cent. This devaluation comes
on top of the regular 1.8 per cent monthly 'crawling peg' devaluation which
has taken place since October.
Mr Olechowski, who spent nine years at Unctad in Geneva and the World Bank
in Washington, says he is determined to cut the government's Zl 115,000bn
(Pounds 5.57bn) budget deficit by the Zl 60,000bn needed if the government
is to fulfil its target of restraining the budget deficit to 5 per cent of
gross domestic product.
His other priority will be to gain more support from international financial
institutions. This year, he says, Poland needs to offset the Dollars 1.5bn
outflow from the resumption of debt service payments.
This follows last year's 50 per cent debt reduction agreement with the Paris
Club of official creditors. 'We can't have a net capital outflow this year
given the difficult stage our reforms have reached,' he says, referring to
mounting concern over the depth of Poland's recession after two years of
sharply declining industrial production and GDP.
Mr Olechowski remains a supporter of rapid privatisation, especially of
financial institutions like state-owned banks and insurance companies. He is
also determined to attract more foreign investment: 'Something has to be
done about dispelling the xenophobic mood which is beginning to appear.'

Mr Philippe Pegorier, commercial attache, said the account opened by the
Kiev embassy last July had been frozen by Vnesheconombank's Moscow
headquarters.
The embassy's plight is shared by hundreds of Ukrainian enterprises, said to
have lost Dollars 500,000 deposited with Vnesheconombank. Their accounts
were frozen in December when Russia suspended Vnesheconombank operations.
Recovery of these assets and collective control over Vnesheconombank are key
Ukrainian demands in negotiations over dividing Soviet debts and assets.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Yeltsin's young reformers in firing line
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's government may have survived the launch of
unpopular economic reforms. But behind the scenes the Russian leader is
having to manoeuvre hard to withstand what could be a fatal attack on his
young cabinet of economic reformers.
Storm clouds are gathering fast before the crucial meeting of the Congress
of People's Deputies, Russia's top legislature, on April 6 - its first since
it gave President Yeltsin emergency powers to conduct the reforms.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament, yesterday
again urged Mr Yeltsin to give up the leadership of the cabinet and
reshuffle the government in order to protect his popularity. Otherwise
Congress could strip him of the emergency powers, or force the government's
resignation with a no-confidence vote.
Meanwhile, an aide to Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, another leading
critic of the team of economic reformers, claimed Mr Yeltsin had given Mr
Rutskoi additional powers to 'control the cabinet'.
He said a new presidential decree confirming Mr Rutskoi in his new role as
land reform overlord gave him the final say in matters extending to the
conversion of defence plants for the production of agriculture machinery and
the allocation of proceeds from state arms sales.
A spokesman for Mr Yeltsin's government denied that the decree gave Mr
Rutskoi additional powers, saying his authority would simply extend over
areas such as drafting unemployed army officers into private agriculture.
Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Rutskoi have led public attacks on the government for
focusing on financial recovery at the expense of industrial output and
social subsidies. Although they do not as yet command significant popular
support, both men are waiting for further economic woes - such as an slump
in production - to advance their cause.
It was no coincidence that Mr Yeltsin was yesterday consulting leaders of
parliamentary factions, and his vice-president.
Other critics include the mayor of St Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, who told
the German magazine Stern that Russia faced a 'social explosion' if Mr
Yeltsin's government continued its current economic policies.
In addition, 60 deputies who are also managers of heavy industry, are
drafting a plan to strengthen state controls and subsidies for industry. The
group, which includes a number of directors from the defence industry, will
take their plan to parliament if the government rejects it.
President Yeltsin is unlikely to crumble easily. Not only does he enjoy the
legitimacy of being Russia's first democratically elected president, but he
has been driven into the radical reforms because of the failure of
half-measures in the past.
None the less, he will need all his political skills to outmanoeuvre his
critics.

<TEXT>
LORD CARRINGTON is hoping to restart the stalled negotiations on Yugoslavia
within the next two weeks. The chairman of the European Community's peace
conference on Yugoslavia said after a meeting yesterday with Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian president: 'We shall probably have a plenary
(session) in about 10 days time. . . when we can take stock of where we
stand.'
Although the fifteenth ceasefire in the Yugoslav conflict, brokered by the
United Nations on January 3, has mostly held in Croatia's war zones, little
progress has been made in political negotiations between the former Yugoslav
republics.
'The arrival of the (UN) peacekeeping troops does not in itself bring a
peaceful settlement,' said Lord Carrington. 'We've got to do what we can to
speed things up.'
The two men also discussed the situation in Krajina, the Serbian enclave in
Croatia, whose leaders had opposed the despatch of UN peacekeepers. About
14,000 UN troops are expected to arrive in three crisis zones in Croatia
over the next six weeks.
An EC-brokered conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina is due to resume today in
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, before the weekend referendum on independence
in the central republic. The referendum has stirred fears of conflict among
the republic's volatile national mix of Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats.
About 44 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m inhabitants are Moslems, 33 per cent are
Serbs and 17 per cent are Croats.
Violence is slowly increasing. Twelve people were hurt in a bomb blast in a
northern Bosnian town on Monday and a local official was killed the same day
in the west of the republic.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Wakeham seeks power price curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN WAKEHAM, secretary of state for energy, has intervened in commercial
negotiations between power companies in an attempt to keep energy prices
down ahead of the general election.
Mr Wakeham has told British Gas and Nuclear Electric, the state-owned
company which operates nuclear power stations in England and Wales, they
must keep prices down as the government tries to demonstrate that its
privatisation effort will benefit consumers.
The move follows the government's repeated insistence that it would not seek
to influence pricing in the recently privatised gas and electricity markets.
Both industries are, however, closely regulated by government appointed
watchdogs.
Mr Wakeham is keen to avoid public rows over high energy prices because they
could damage the Conservative party's standing in the opinion polls. Large
industrial users of electricity, represented by the Major Energy Users
Council, have been lobbying Mr Wakeham over prices they claim are too high
for them to compete in Europe.
Mr Peter Rost, Conservative MP for Erewash and chairman of the users
council, said yesterday that Mr Wakeham had asked Nuclear Electric to offer
industrial consumers cheap power in an attempt to resolve the row. Mr Rost
said the Mr Wakeham had asked Nuclear Electric to re-enter the market in the
hope that this would increase competition in an industry dominated by
National Power and PowerGen.
Mr Rost's remarks offer one explanation for Tuesday's announcement by
Nuclear Electric that it would be selling electricity contracts directly to
customers in a 'new and innovative auction.' Nuclear Electric held its usual
auction late last year.
The nuclear power group said it could not comment on the suggestion that Mr
Wakeham had engineered the auction, which it said was designed to meet fresh
market demand.
Mr Wakeham has also stepped into talks between British Gas and the Office of
Fair Trading over the OGT's insistence that British Gas halve its share of
the industrial gas market by 1995.
British Gas has been threatening price rises for industrial customers and a
change in domestic pricing if it is forced to cut its market share.
It has said that if it goes ahead with reducing market share and hiving off
its pipeline and storage system, as agreed with the OFT, it will have to
vary prices to customers. The company says it will mean eastern consumers
paying less for gas because they are closer to gas terminals.
Mr Wakeham's intervention comes just before British Gas's announcement today
of an expected rise in profits to around Pounds 1.3bn from Pounds 1.2bn last
year.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (7): Less fickle, less
profitable - The tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEANS are still arriving in the Dominican Republic, 500 years after
they first set foot on Hispaniola, the island of which it now forms part.
More than half the country's visitors are now from Europe, led by Italians,
Germans and the British. The Spanish are beginning to arrive too on the 14
flights a week to Santo Domingo from Madrid.
This is in sharp contrast with the early 1980s when 80-85 per cent of all
tourist visitors were from the US and Puerto Rico. Now the figure is closer
to 25 per cent, with Canadians accounting for 20-25 per cent of arrivals.
That has allowed the republic, unlike other tourist destinations in the
Caribbean more dependent on the American market, a cushion against the
impact of recession in the US.
The American tourist has become highly cost-conscious, and many of the
destinations in the DR (as they call it) are pricey. Casa de Campo, one of
the country's oldest resorts at La Romana along the coast from the capital,
for example, provides highly-ranked sporting facilities - three golf
courses, shooting, riding, tennis, deep-sea fishing - in a glamorous
setting, with prices to match. With every round of gold or game of tennis
costing extra, many Americans prefer destinations with all-in prices.
The reduced dependence on the US has made the country's tourism business
somewhat less fickle. Europeans appear less sensitive to upward flickers in
the price of aviation fuel that used to kill the American market stone dead.
There are, however, some drawbacks of higher dependence on Europe. Its
tourists, for example, do not spend as much as Americans once they arrive.
Italians tend to spend freely, and the Germans (like the Canadians)
moderately, while the British tend to be penny-pinching.
But all visitors are sensitive to the kind of negative publicity that
enveloped the island in late 1990. As the government shifted economic
policies to try to rein in 100 per cent inflation, the strain on the
Dominican economy showed. There were petrol shortages and a scarcity of
basic goods; water was cut off to many hotels and tourists were left
stranded without power for most of the day.
The worst of the crisis lasted for two or three months, but the effect of
the bad publicity lasted for more. Combined with the sharp drop in tourism
brought about by the invasion of Kuwait and war in the Gulf, the first half
of last year did not appear promising for the country's tourist industry.
According to Mr Ellis Perez, president of the Tourist Promotion Council, a
private sector body set up to fill the gap left by the government's baleful
promotion efforts: '1991 was a year of survival for our tourism industry.'
None the less, according to official figures from the Ministry of Tourism,
the number of arrivals in the year as a whole increased significantly. There
were 1.32m visitors, against 1.05m in 1990, and 1.1m in 1989.
Meanwhile, the number of hotel rooms rose to 21,500 at the end of last year,
from 19,000 a year earlier and 6,100 at the end of 1981. Current plans
envisage that number rising to 28,000 over the next two years. Average hotel
occupancy rates for 1991 stood at 65 per cent.
However, Mr Perez admits more has to be done to bring all tourists the kind
of security of services they expect. Some resorts, particularly the newer
ones, are protected against power shortages by their own generating capacity
but a full solution to the problems awaits confrontation of the country's
big infrastructure problems and a shift toward the proper maintenance of the
infrastructure already in place. The importance of tackling these problems
is heightened by the possible re-emergence in the next few years of Cuba as
an important tourist destination.
Mr Perez, a former tourism minister, is optimistic about 1992. The expensive
upgrading of the airport at Santo Domingo and its use as a Latin American
hub both by the Spanish state airline, Iberia, and American Airlines,
encourages that view.
However, plans to sell off all or part of the state-owned Dominicana airline
appear to have stalled. Talks with Iberia have broken down, to the evident
relief of some in the industry who believed that Iberia was not an ideal
partner and who would have preferred to see Dominicana being used creatively
to aid tourism in the country, rather as Jamaica has used its national
airline.
Mr Perez sees his country as offering a wide variety of tourist destinations
which should reduce the volatility of the market. A third of its coastline
consists of beaches, but he also points to the tourist enclaves on the north
coast, sporting facilities in the south; and the historic city of Santo
Domingo, where the old colonial town has been renovated in preparation for
the celebrations to mark the first visit of Columbus to the 'new world'.
In contrast with the equivocal attitude in other Caribbean countries to the
quincentennial, most Dominicans appear unaware of the debate about the issue
that rages elsewhere in the region.
The expectations are that the celebrations will benefit an industry whose
important to the economy cannot be denied. Twenty-one years after the first
law was passed to encourage tourism, the sector employs an estimated 50,000
people. It is now the country's biggest foreign exchange earner, yielding
around Dollars 800m a year in gross earnings and over 10 per cent of gross
domestic product.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (12): Where the lights still go
out - Electricity supplies have improved, but the problems remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOMINICAN Republic's state-owned electricity company must be one of the
world's strongest arguments for privatisation. Thanks to its inefficiency,
power cuts are a daily fact of life. At the height of the country's economic
crisis in late-1990, many users were without electricity for 20 hours a day,
writes Stephen Fidler.
As a result, there has been a huge shift to privately-generated electricity.
Every important office building, factory and hotel in the country needs a
private generator. This is not only hugely inefficient - it also raises the
costs significantly of doing business in the country: a generator capable of
producing 1,000 kilowatts costs Dollars 1m. Capacity in such microgenerators
is estimated at around 600-700MW, equivalent to the capacity of the state
Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE).
At its worst, estimated generating capacity of CDE fell to around 400
megawatts. This compares with nominally installed capacity of 1,200MW and
demand of closer to 800-900MW.
The crisis prompted President Joaquin Balaguer to replace the head of the
CDE, since when there has been an increase in capacity, helped by loans from
the World Bank to rehabilitate some electricity plants. Loans from the
Inter-American Development Bank are also ready for the rehabilitation of
more. As a condition for their help, the international financial
institutions insisted that outsiders be brought in to administer the
company, a task to be taken over by Fenosa, the Spanish utility.
Offers have been placed to provide a further 600-700MW of privately
generated capacity, but it is not clear how much of this will be installed.
Government officials make much of the country's hydro-electric capacity
which it claims should fill the supply gap. Industry observers, however,
reckon the priority use for the reservoirs is irrigation rather than
electricity generation, and that hydroelectricity will only provide marginal
input to the grid.
For now, improved management and maintenance have raised capacity to an
estimated 700MW. This is still insufficient to cover demand and blackouts
remain common, but there has been a marked improvement from 18 months ago.
The problem remains in the longer term, where there is nothing to stop
future managers of the system once again running down capacity through
abysmal management and maintenance procedures.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (9): Columbus fever runs high -
Canute James looks forward to the celebrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A low hill overlooking the harbour in Santo Domingo, capital of the
Dominican Republic, teams of workmen are scrambling over a massive concrete
structure that was designed 43 years ago. The government hopes it will be
completed this year.
The Columbus Lighthouse, a monument whose completion is costing millions of
dollars, is central to much that is happen- ing in the country this year.
The lighthouse is the most ambitious part of the country's commemoration -
celebration, says the official literature - of the arrival of Christopher
Columbus in the Caribbean 500 years ago.
Columbus fever is running high in the country. One weekend earlier this
month, thousands of Dominicans flocked to the port in Santo Domingo to view
the replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa Maria, Columbus's famed
boats, which were on a short visit.
'This will be a good year for this country,' says the head of a local
business group. 'We are celebrating a milestone.'
Preparations for the event are evident all over Santo Domingo. Roads and
bridges are being improved, the colonial section of the city is being
rebuilt and efforts are under way to improve the electricity supply. The
administrators of the country's tourist industry expect an increase in the
volume of visitors, drawn by the focus on Columbus.
Cynics and the political cognoscenti concur that 500 years after he arrived,
Columbus still has a profound effect on contemporary Dominican politics.
They say Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the president, was determined to stand again
for office in the 1990 elections simply to be in charge of this year's
events.
According to the Dominican Commission for the Celeb- ration of the
Quincentenary, La Isabela, established on Hispaniola by Columbus on his
second voyage, was the 'first seat of western civilisation in America,' and
produced 'the miracle that today we call America.'
It was the Dominican Republic, according to the commission, which was the
centre of the transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America'.
The country, it says, was the site of the first mass celebrated in the
Americas, the first munic- ipality, the first city, the first viceregal
court, the first university and the first cathedral in which, incid-
entally, Columbus is buried until his remains are moved to the lighthouse
which is being built.
Dominicans appear oblivious to the consternation which they have created in
other parts of the region, not by their claim on Columbus, but because of
the language which they use. There is little tolerance of suggestions that
the use of the word 'discovery' is eschewed by most of their neighbours who
prefer to 'commemorate' the event as an 'encounter' of Europe with the
Americas.
'Of course there were people here when Columbus got here,' agrees the
business leader. 'But if he did not discover them no one would have known
they were here. He brought them Christianity and civilisation. I must be
thankful. I would not be here if it had not been for Columbus.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (10): Incentives spur investors
 -Free trade zones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE end of the shift at the Tabacalera de Garcia cigar factory in the
free trade zone in La Romana in the south-east of the country, 1,000
workers, mostly women, stream through the gates.
The scene is repeated at factories in the 22 other free trade zones in the
country, 12 of which are privately owned and the others owned by the state,
and which provide 8m square feet of factory space. Five more free trade
zones are being built and another seven are planned.
Mr Jose Seijas, a director of the Free Zone Association, and general manager
of Tabacalera de Garcia, says the 140,000 workers employed in the free zones
across the Dominican Republic would otherwise have been involved in farming
or domestic services with low productivity. The factories have contributed
to relieving unemployment in the country.
The free zone is a virtual enclave, a designated area outside the national
customs and tax territory, and which offers exemptions on taxes and duties
on a range of light industries and services. Production in the free zones is
mainly for export. They are islands of industrial efficiency which benefit
from the special conditions and incentives.
The expansion of free zones in the Dominican Republic has been dramatic.
Exports from free zones in 1980 accounted for 5 per cent of the country's
export earnings. By 1988, exports from the zones were valued at USDollars
515m, about 35 per cent of export earnings. Free zone exports in 1990 were
valued by the government at Dollars 840m.
Investors are drawn to the free trade zones because of a range of
incentives. The depreciation of the Dominican peso over the past five years
has made wage rates compar- ative, particularly against those paid in the
US. Proximity to the US market has also assisted in drawing investors to the
free trade zones.
The main activities are the production of apparel, foot- wear, electronic
assembly and pharmaceuticals. Rather than investing in a free zone, some
companies have used Domin- ican businesses to produce for them under
contract.
'Companies in the free trade zones were originally all foreign-owned, but
there is now a tendency for Domin- icans to own companies,' says Mr Bernado
Vega, one of the country's leading economists. 'The foreign owners were
mainly Americans, but today there are investors from Taiwan and South Korea
who are seeking easy access to the European Community market.'
The growth of the Domin- ican free zones has been encouraged by the
Caribbean Basin Initiative, a preferential trade programme extended by the
US to selected countries in the region. Dominican officials say the
prospects for expansion of the facilities are good, with the country's
recent access to the Lome Convention, a treaty which grants preferential
entry to the European Community market.
Being insulated, the free zones have not been affected much by the economic
prob- lems which have overtaken the Dominican Republic in recent years. But
businessmen are questioning how long they can remain apart from the domestic
economy, and whether it would not be in the government's interest to declare
the entire country a free trade zone.
'Free zone companies are looking at ways to increase sales to the local
economy,' said Mr Seijas. 'They are trying to create more links with local
suppliers.' Since the free zones operate under a different fiscal regime,
commerce across the fence with the local economy is treated as foreign
trade.
The continued expansion of the free zones is threatened by local and
international developments. The poor quality of the electricity
infrastructure in the Domin- ican Republic has forced the owners and
operators of the free zones to install their own power plants, increasing
their operational costs and those of their clients. Mexico's likely
membership of the North American Free Trade Area could also reduce the
compet- itive advantage which free zones in the Dominican Rep- ublic and
other countries in the region have in trading with the United States.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (11): An industry slow to adapt
 -The country's sugar production has halved in eight years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY years the main pillar of the Dominican economy, the sugar industry
has recently undergone some difficult years. As the region's second largest
producer after Cuba, the Dominican Republic has seen production fall by a
half between 1983 and last year. In 1983, the industry accounted for 35 per
cent of the country's foreign earnings; last year its share fell to 16 per
cent, writes Canute James.
The decline has been the result of changes in the economics of international
sugar, which have overtaken an industry that has been slow to adapt. At the
root of the problem has been the State Sugar Council (CEA), an enterprise
created in 1966 to manage the large holdings once owned by President Rafael
Trujillo, the dictator assassinated in 1961.
Favourable world prices masked a high degree of inefficiency, until
depression overtook the international sugar market about a decade ago.
Falling prices and high production costs, compounded by outbreaks of cane
rust disease which caused depleted yields, exposed the company, and forced
it to diversify its operations and sell off land, reducing the area under
canes. Much of this land is now taken up by non-traditional agriculture,
tourism resorts and free trade zones. The country's other producers, Central
Romana (once owned by Gulf and Western) and the Vicini Group, which are both
privately owned, also suffered, but were better able to adapt.
The sugar industry was also hit by reduced access to the US market with a
cutback by Washington of import quotas. Fluctuations in domestic US output
led to an increase in the Dominican quota to 333,000 tonnes in 1990, but
this has again been cut to 232,500 tonnes this year.
At the same time, the Dominican Republic has not made use of preferential
access for its sugar to the European market. When it signed the Lome
Convention, traditional suppliers said they feared Dominican sugar would
depress prices on the EC market. The Dominican government said it would not
ship sugar to the EC under preferential terms granted by the Convention.
A more recent setback to the country's industry has been the break-up of the
Soviet Union, to which it has been supplying between 50,000 and 225,000
tonnes a year. Industry officials and bankers say there is uncertainty about
the future of sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The sugar industry was hit last year by a row over allegations that Haitian
children were being used as labourers on farms owned and operated by the
CEA. The Dominican government, stung by accusations from human rights groups
that it was condoning child slavery, ordered the deportation of thousands of
Haitians who, it said, were illegally resident in the country. Government
officials say wages in the sugar industry do not encourage Dominican
workers, but there appears to be no worry about the supply of labour for the
industry.
Rather, Mr Frederico Echineque, executive director of the Dominican Sugar
Institute, says that this year production will be higher than last year. The
industry is moving into new areas, using the byproducts of the canes for
such products as chemicals for the paint industry. But it is unlikely that
the industry will abandon production of sugar as its main undertaking. It
provides a livelihood for 80,000 people in a labour surplus economy.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (8): Welcome hints for
travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST IMPRESSIONS on arrival in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, are of
a modern, efficient airport. While customs and immigration procedures are
smooth - one may be required to pay an entry fee of Dollars 10 - it is
advisable to make sure that baggage is retrieved early.
If it is not claimed soon, it could take another visit to the airport -
costly to scheduled meetings - to get hold of it.
Foreign currency should be changed as early as possible to cover local
costs, such as taxi fares. Prominent signs throughout the city warn that it
is a criminal offence to use foreign currency to settle transactions. This
does not apply to the fee for entering the country and that airport tax,
also of Dollars 10, which is payable on departure.
The major hotels in Santo Domingo are located close to the main business
districts, and taxis are freely available. As these are not metered, it is
advisable to determine the cost of the trip before setting out. Rates stated
at the hotels are usually ignored by drivers who set their own.
Telecommunications from the Dominican Republic are efficient, although
callers to Europe may experience delays because of limited circuits. The
hotels are equipped with their own electricity generators so guests do not
suffer unduly from the frequent power cuts which are common to the city.
Dominicans are usually willing to meet you at short notice, although it
would make for a better management of an itinerary if meetings are set up
beforehand. Dominican time is equally flexible, and some delay in
appointments is not unusual.
The Dominican Republic also offers the business visitor a wide range of
after-hours activities. The city is blessed with many fine restaurants with
an international and local menu. One may even dine elegantly in a cave.
The colonial section of Santo Domingo, which is being restored, is worth a
visit, particularly this year when Dominicans are marking the quincentenary
of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean.
A stroll through the old city will provide a close view of buildings erected
in as early as the first decade of the 16th century, including the Columbus
palace and several art galleries and museums dedicated to the colonial
period. The cathedral, which Dominicans say is the oldest in the Americas,
has what are claimed to be the remains of Christopher Columbus.
The country has many fine beaches and resorts. Located in La Romana, to the
east of Santo Domingo, is the Casa de Campo resort spread over several
square miles. On the north coast, Puerto Plata is a growing resort with
several beach front hotels.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (6): Focus turns to new crops -
Farmers, after a decade of poor performance, are breaking with tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON ROLLING plains about 50 miles to the north of Santo Domingo, the
Dominican capital, almost 7,000 acres of land previously under sugar cane
have been taken up by seemingly unending rows of pineapple plants. To the
east of the capital, in the sugar town of La Romana, a new meat processing
plant is expanding capacity to meet growing demand in foreign markets.
These ventures are part of the cutting edge of a dramatic change in
agriculture in the Dominican Republic.
Up to 10 years ago the agriculture sector was dominated by traditional crops
such as sugar (which for long was the backbone of the economy), coffee,
cocoa and tobacco. Now non-traditional crops are getting more attention from
local farmers, the government and foreign investors.
The sugar, coffee, cocoa and tobacco sectors have performed miserably in the
past decade, due to a combination of domestic and foreign market
developments. There has been a concurrent expansion of the non-traditional
sector, with investments in new crops reaching Dollars 350m over the past
eight years, and earnings from exports rising to Dollars 430m in 1988, and
expected to reach just over Dollars 600m this year.
The Joint Agribusiness Co-investment Council, which promotes the development
of non-traditional agriculture, says the expansion is reflected particularly
in the production of pineapples, citrus, melons, mangoes, vegetables, cut
flowers and ornamental plants.
The expansion has also been encouraged by a mixture of government incentives
and market opportunities. One significant development has been the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, a US trade prog- ramme which allows countries designated
by Washington to ship a range of products, also selected by the US govern-
ment, duty-free to the US market.
More recently, the Dominican Republic became a beneficiary of the Lome
Convention which allows preferential access to the European Community.
Already the country is increasing its exports of non-traditional
agricultural products to Europe. Pineapples, citrus and juice concentrate
are among the products making use of preferential access to both the
Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Lome Convention.'
Dole Dominicana produces about 2.5m (40lb) boxes of pineapples a year, and
800,000 gallons of juice concentrate. The company plans to invest another
Dollars 1m to expand the facility, which already gives the Dominican
government about Dollars 1.5m in rental fees and sales.
Agrocarne, a Dollars 16m joint venture between local investors and Campo
Frio of Spain, was drawn to the Dominican Republic for much the same
reasons, according to Mr Luis Rodriguez, the company's export manager. 'We
could have gone to other places, but labour here is cheaper and the
location, in relation to the markets we want to access, is very good.'
The company's processed pork products are currently exported to Mexico and
some Caribbean islands. Agrocarne also supplies part of domestic demand. It
is now awaiting the conclusion of negotiations between the Dominican
Republic and the US on the conditions under which Dominican pork products
can enter the American market.
Even the non-traditional agriculture sector has not been immune to problems
which have troubled the Dominican economy over the past decade. Those which
have proved most worrisome include the lack of chemicals to fight pests,
restrictions on products (such as some varieties of vegetables and fruit)
entering the US market, and outdated practices in farm management,
post-harvest handling and packaging and marketing.
Mr Fleming says that there need to be changes to some 'old bad habits and
attitudes' in the Dominican Republic, if the agriculture sector is to
continue expanding. 'The Dominican Republic is operating against the clock
in the face of changes which will be created by the widening of the North
American Free Trade Area and the possibility of changes in Cuba,' he
observes.
The concentration on non-traditional agriculture has diverted attention from
the traditional crops. While the financially embarrassed State Sugar Council
is attempting to rationalise its operations, coffee and cocoa output
continue to be victims of outdated husbandry.
Peasant farmers who should have profited from land reform with the break-up
of large plantations owned by Pres- ident Rafael Trujillo have found
themselves unable to get farm credit because they have received only
provisional titles which bankers find to be unsatisfactory collateral.
Coffee and cocoa output has fluctuated over the past decade, and although
still important foreign currency earners, both crops have been affected by
the uncertainties of a volatile market. The expansion in the output of
non-traditional products has helped to stem a decline in the agriculture
sector, which accounts for 15 per cent of the gross domestic product.
One promising area is tobacco. Exports of cigars have been increasing as the
Dominican Republic makes use of new market opportunities. 'The Dominican
Republic exports between 58m and 60m cigars each year, with the major market
being the US, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the product,' says Mr
Jose Seijas, general manager of Tabacalera de Garcia, one of the country's
leading cigar manufacturers. 'Between 10 and 15 per cent of the country's
cigar exports now go to the European Community.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (5): Balaguer set to award
Dollars 200m contract - Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A few weeks the Dominican government will name the foreign company it has
approved to develop what will be one of the largest gold-mining ventures in
the Americas, writes Canute James.
The companies have put in bids for building facilities to exploit gold and
silver deposits, which are owned by Rosario Dominicana, the state company,
in Pueblo Viejo in the island's north.
The development of the facility follows the exhaustion of reserves in the
oxide zone of the mine, and a decline in the country's gold and silver
output in recent years. Bids are being considered from four companies - Davy
McKee of the UK, Minproc Engineering and BHP Utah International of
Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrea Gutierrez of Brazil.
The favoured company will be granted a Dollars 200m contract. Rosario
Dominicana expects that the Pueblo Viejo sulphide zone will yield an average
of 1,100 ounces of gold (with 40 per cent silver content) a day. The country
expects to earn about USDollars 7bn before the deposits are exhausted.
All the companies have presented projects that would take between two and 2
1/2 years to complete. The board of Rosario Dominicana is evaluating the
bids, and such is the importance which the government has attached to the
venture that the final decision on the award of the contract will be taken
by President Balaguer.
The development and exploitation of the sulphide zone will reverse the trend
in the decline in production of precious metals. Gold production in 1981 was
412,991 ounces, but fell gradually to 138,640 ounces in 1990 and is
estimated to have been slightly less last year.
'Gold production has been falling as the oxide deposits have been exhausted
and attention has been turned to a transition zone,' says Mr Gerald Ellis,
director-general for minerals. That zone will be worked for three years and
then the sulphite zone will be exploited for about 25 years. The transition
zone will be mined until 1993 and is expected to yield gold and silver worth
about Dollars 125m.
Earnings from the expanded gold-mining venture will lift the country's
already significant minerals sector, now dominated by nickel production. The
Dominican Republic is the world's seventh largest nickel producer and the
second largest after Canada in the western hemisphere. The country's proven
reserves are about 37.8m tonnes with a grading of 1.72 per cent nickel.
The only producer, Falconbridge Dominicana, a subsidiary of a Canadian
company, has a facility with a capacity of 63m lb a year. The industry,
which has overtaken sugar as the main foreign currency earner for the
Dominican Republic, has been troubled by domestic and market problems in
recent years.
The plant was shut in 1988 as the company and the government argued over an
export levy. The issue was resolved when the government guaranteed the
company's mining operations and exports, while the company allowed the state
an increased share in profits.
More recently, the industry was affected by low prices and weak demand for
nickel. Exports last year are estimated to have been slightly lower that the
67.4m lb exported in 1990, and which were valued at Dollars 262.1m. The
reduced production was caused by a cutback in production by Falconbridge in
the last quarter of last year because of low prices.
'Several companies are involved in exploration for precious and base metals
in other parts of the country,' says Mr Ellis. 'There is some hope of
finding another major gold deposit, and several major Japanese, US and
Canadian companies are in the hunt.' The companies include the Mitsubishi
Corporation of Japan and Canyon Resources and Battle Mountain of the US.
At the same time, a number of companies is involved in oil exploration as
the government attempts to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, and to
ensure that its electricity generating capacity is below demand. The company
needs about 23m barrels of oil a year, and the government clearly hopes that
two ventures will yield oil. Mobil of the US and Once Once, a joint
US/Dominican venture are exploring areas offshore and onshore for which they
have been granted licences.
'The Dominican Republic has a policy which is favourable to investments in
petroleum and mining,' says Mr Ellis. 'The country is willing to welcome any
company which comes. The paperwork and the bureaucracy are slow, but we are
trying to speed up things.'
The bauxite mining industry is in an uncertain state. Mines which were
worked by the Aluminum Company of America were closed in 1982 after
declining production. The Dominican Republic, a founding member of the
International Bauxite Association, a producers' organisation, lost its
membership when the industry died.
There have since been bauxite shipments from the country when agreed
quantities are mined by a local company, Ideal Dominicana, for the Aluminum
Company of America. Most of this has been to fill shortfalls in Alcoa's
operations, notably in Surinam when that industry was affected two years ago
by anti-government rebels.
Mr Ellis reported that the Dominican Republic has 15m tonnes of bauxite
reserves, and that Alcoa ordered 150,000 tonnes of ore last year. The order
was not filled as President Balaguer suspended mining because of increasing
local concern over deforestation and other adverse environmental effects.
The government has also been trying to expand production of other minerals.
Corde, the holding company for state enterprises, is attempting to increase
output of gypsum, lifting production which was 75,000 tonnes in 1990, to
about 250,000 tonnes a year. There are also plans to lift marble extraction
well beyond current levels which average 20,000 cubic metres a year.
Limestone production has also fluctuated in recent years, moving from
350,000 tonnes in 1989 to 503,000 tonnes last year.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (4): President shifts an
elephant - The country's political future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOMINICAN newspapers were full of the story: would Mami the elephant be
moved from her home in a park in Santo Domingo to allow a construction
project to go ahead? The answer was handed down by the one man who could
decide on the issue: President Joaquin Balaguer.
Mami, he decided, should be moved. The popular elephant justified his
decision by surviving the shift to a zoo.
The story illustrates more than the occasional comedy of life in this
country. It shows how many of even the most trivial decisions are made by
the office of the president.
The man who has held this office for much of the last 30 years, and was an
influential figure in the 31-year Trujillo dictatorship which preceded it,
is President Joaquin Balaguer. Now 85 years old and blind, the president has
said that he will not run again when his sixth four-year term ends in 1994.
It is hard to find a Dominican who believes him.
For Mr Balaguer's disability should not be mistaken for intellectual
frailty. He seems to have lost little of his political astuteness and
continues to outflank his opponents. The opposition parties are fragmented
and the economy is improving: few people see why, this side of the Rubicon,
he should not stand again.
The constitution that Mr Balaguer helped to fashion in 1966 allows him to
rule his country as a constitutional dictatorship, according to Mr Pedro
Catrain, the lawyer and political commentator. Even though the president's
Christian Social Reform Party (PRSC) is in a minority, the lower house is
rarely able to stand in his way. He signs all the cheques for central
government. Every week, he travels round the country to open government
projects where he personally distributes largesse such as chickens and
baseball equipment to waiting crowds. He is in the long tradition of the
caudillo, the Latin American strongman, expert in the exercise and
preservation of power.
So skilfully has he done this that the other institutions of state have been
debilitated, some fatally. This has been positive in the case of the armed
forces, which have been allowed to exert influence in a limited way - they
dominate, for example, commerce with Haiti. On the other hand, an
undeveloped legislative and judicial system will hinder the country's
attempts to move into the modern world.
Furthermore, it is difficult to see where the country's next leader will
come from. The other grand old man of Dominican politics, former president
Juan Bosch, is only three years younger than Mr Balaguer. Mr Bosch claims he
was defrauded from victory in the 1990 election: the result was certainly
close. But he does not appear to offer a great shift in style from Mr
Balaguer and in any case is seen as a weakened force, partly because of his
advanced age. While he claims the government is illegal, he has been at odds
with the deputies of his Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) who, for example,
voted with the government to pass budget legislation.
Also in opposition, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) is seeking
reform of the country's weakened institutions, such as the legal system.
While its leader, Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, represents social democratic
forces, he faces two handicaps. He is black and the country has never
elected a black leader, and his party has suffered from the attention given
to the trial for corruption of Mr Salvador Jorge Blanco, PRD president from
1982-86. Yet there is no PRD monopoly on corruption in the Dominican
Republic (the highest paid officials and ministers receive an annual salary
of about USDollars 3,000) and the trial is seen by some of the president's
critics as politically-motivated.
In Mr Balaguer's own party, half a dozen potential candidates have emerged.
They include Mr Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, an economist; Mr Ramon Perez
Martinez, a deputy for Santo Domingo; Mr Jacinto Peynado, a senator; Mr
Caonabo Javier Castillo, administrator of the country's reserve bank; Mr
Luis Toral, governor of the central bank; Mr Donald Reid Cabral, a former
foreign minister; and Mr Carlos Morales Troncoso, the vice-president.
While some of these candidates would represent a bigger change from the
current style than others, none has the political support to match the
incumbent leader. The outlook for Dominican politics is thus one of great
certainty - until the moment that President Balaguer goes. After that, what
will happen is anyone's guess.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (3): It looks better, but it
may not last - The economy has recovered in the past 18 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in inflation and the chance of a resumption of economic growth
this year have encouraged greater optimism about prospects for the Dominican
economy than has existed in years.
Such optimism hardly seemed conceivable less than 18 months ago. As the
government attempted to tackle inflation which exceeded 100 per cent in
1990, petrol and food shortages developed and electricity and water supplies
were cut off for 20 hours a day or more.
Yet 1991 inflation was below 5 per cent. The economy, after shrinking by 5.3
per cent in 1990, levelled out or contracted slightly last year. The
prospects for a resumption this year of economic growth, perhaps of 2 to 3
per cent, seem good as the high interest rates that were part of the
economic stabilisation plan have fallen.
At the end of 1990, t h e country was in arrears to all its creditors,
including the international financial organisations, forcing the World Bank
to cut off new lending to the country. Arrears were cleared to the
organisations last April, allowing for a resumption of World Bank and
InterAmerican Development Bank loans and for a standby agreement signed with
the International Monetary Fund last summer.
Foreign reserves have begun to climb, with inflows into the country of
flight capital, encouraged by positive real interest rates.
The plan included a unification of the exchange rate and a liberalisation of
foreign currency rules and of interest rates. Government subsidies were
reduced for a variety of goods, including petrol and electricity. A new
central bank governor, Mr Luis Toral, was appointed, who appears to have
ceased, more or less, printing money not backed by government transfers of
funds to the central bank.
As a result of the programme, the public sector deficit fell from 6 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1989 and 5.1 per cent in 1990 to 0.1 per cent
in 1991.
The government has also begun to attempt structural reform of the economy. A
presidential decree simplified the tariff structure in September 1990,
reducing the maximum tariff to 35 per cent from over 200 per cent
previously. A new law on tax reform, which would include a reduction of the
top marginal rate of personal income tax from 73 to 30 per cent, has been
presented to Congress.
A reform of the banking sector is expected to be introduced this year which
would lead to universal banking. It would aim to strengthen a financial
system where many of the specialist banks are weak, and which saw a handful
fail in late 1990. This is expected to encourage further consolidation.
Of the 650 financial firms in the country in 1983, only some 50 remain. The
trend continues: in December, Chase Manhattan of the US sold its assets to
Banco Nacional de Creditos, an affiliate of the Grupo Financiero Nacional, a
fast-growing financial services group.
Although all this has added to improved sentiment about prospects for the
economy, some economists see a limit to the extent of the reform. They also
express concern that the programme could easily be reversed. Since much of
it has been introduced by presidential decree and has not been passed into
law by Congress, it can be reversed by decree.
The rationale behind the changes appear to have been linked more with
President Joaquin Balaguer's view of how he can gain politically than with
any coherent economic policy objective. 'The president has an exclusively
political mind, not an economic one,' says one close observer.
Mr Hugo Guiliani Cury, a former central bank governor, reckons economic
policy is still being decided 'on a day-to-day basis.'
Mr Andres Daujhare of the Economic and Development Foundation, a pro-market
think tank in Santo Domingo, sees limits to likely immediate structural
reform in the Dominican economy. For example, the president still thinks of
'state enterprises as necessary to employ poor people who don't have jobs.'
Pressure on the government not to liberalise quickly is also coming from
those domestic businessmen who want to keep out cheap foreign imports which
challenge their protected position in the domestic market. In a country
where unemployment is reckoned at a quarter of the workforce, this view may
well carry significant weight with an electorally - sensitive president.
The view of these domestic producers is opposed by a significant group of
exporters and foreign investors.
Mr Randolph Fleming, president of the fruit group Dole Dominicana, a
subsidiary of Dole Corporation of the US, represents one of the largest
foreign investors in the country. He says that the tariffs that his company
is forced to pay on imports are increasing his company's costs. Unless they
are lowered, foreign investment will be attracted to other countries in the
region offering tariff-free regimes.
This presents a dilemma for a country which is still seeking to diversify
its economy away from sugar.
But there are other priorities, too. Agricultural reform is needed to
strengthen a debilitated sector of the economy: productivity growth is
coming mainly from foreign investors. The government is ill-equipped to deal
with its role, for example, in plague control. And, because many farmers
only have provisional title to their land, they cannot obtain bank loans.
Another priority, which particularly influences foreign investment, is to
tackle the weakness of the legal system. Mr Luis Heredia-Bonetti, a
prominent lawyer in Santo Domingo, says: 'The legal structure of the
Dominican Republic has become obsolete.' Much economic and business law
needs to be reformulated, he says.
Priorities include:
revisions to laws which set one Dominican peso as equal to one US dollar,
when the actual rate is 12.5 to the dollar.
a repeal of the state's usury laws which limit to 1 per cent a month the
interest chargeable on loans.
a revision of foreign investment laws that do not allow for repatriation of
funds.
This contrast between the law of the land and the recent decreed reforms of
the president is serving to enlarge daily the already huge informal economy.
'Every day,' remarks Mr Daujhare, 'the government violates all the laws.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (1): Apres moi, le deluge - The
economic picture has brightened in the past 18 months. President Balaguer,
who is 85 and blind, says he will not fight the next election in 1994.
Though few people believe him and there is no obvious successor, the end of
an era is in sight

THE DOMINICAN Republic is approaching the end of an era. The man who has
dominated it for more than a generation, President Joaquin Balaguer, is now
85; his chief political opponent, former president Juan Bosch, is only three
years younger.
President Balaguer has been prominent for 60 years in the politics of his
country, whose 7.2m people share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
He was re-elected for a sixth term in elections in May 1990 by the narrowest
of majorities over Mr Bosch: less than 25,000 in a total vote of 1.93m. Mr
Bosch denounced the result as a fraud.
Mr Balaguer was a minister and later titular president of the Trujillo
dictatorship which ruled the country from 1930 until 1961.
After the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in 1961, the state seized (and
still owns much of) the property of the Trujillo family, which had
ruthlessly used its position to become the country's largest landowners.
Following the election of 1962, Mr Bosch assumed the presidency, only to be
deposed seven months later in a military coup. A virtual civil war followed,
prompting intervention in 1965 by US marines.
The 1966 elections enabled Mr Balaguer to assume the office he has held
continuously since, except for the two presidential terms from 1978-86.
Although the sightless president has announced that he will not contest the
next presidential election in May 1994, most Dominicans believe that if his
health and luck hold out, he will go on.
Until his departure, the pattern of Dominican politics will continue much as
before. What happens afterwards is a mystery, even to the closest followers
of the Dominican scene.
Mr Balaguer fits into the mould of the traditional Latin American caudillo,
or strongman. He remains adept at the exercise and preservation of power,
which means limiting the influence of others. As a result, his opponents are
weak, and no obvious successor has been allowed to rise through his own
party.
His approach has also meant a centralisation of power on the office of the
president that is matched in few other countries, and therefore a severe
weakness of most of the other institutions of state.
His political antennae remained perceptive enough to recognise that, when he
reassumed office in 1990, something drastic was needed to reform the
economy. Near economic collapse was the price being paid for the
free-spending years of his fifth term.
Inflation exceeded 100 per cent in 1990. There were severe shortages of fuel
and food. The notoriously unreliable water and electricity supplies had
become even more erratic, with power cuts of 20 hours or more a day.
The last 18 months have made quite a difference. Now, as the country
prepares to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher
Columbus in the new world, the economic picture appears much brighter.
Inflation last year dropped below 5 per cent. After two years in which the
economy shrunk perhaps by 7 per cent, there are renewed prospects for
economic growth.
The astonishing collapse in inflation was due to an orthodox economic
policy, which sharply reduced the deficit on public sector spending. The
government abolished subsidies on food, petrol and energy. It cut financing
to public sector enterprises and stopped the central bank from issuing
currency unbacked by genuine government revenues. Reforms to simplify the
customs structure have been decreed; tax reform is in prospect, as is a
restructuring of the financial sector.
Less than a year ago, the country was behind in payments to all its
creditors, thereby cutting off important sources of finance from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and
InterAmerican Development Bank. Now, having cleared the arrears to them, it
is drawing funds from the two institutions and the International Monetary
Fund, with which it signed a standby loan agreement last July.
This has cleared the way for negotiations now under way with the Paris Club
of creditor governments over debt rescheduling. The government is pursuing
bilaterally debt concessions from other governments. It has already secured
debt relief agreements from Mexico, to which it has repaid Dollars 52.9m to
eliminate Dollars 162.8m face value of debt, and Venezuela. The government
is also proposing significant debt relief from commercial banks, to which it
suspended payments in September 1989 and which are owed Dollars 900m of its
Dollars 4.5bn foreign debt.
The speed of the turnaround in economic fortunes is said to have surprised
even the IMF. However, the economy and the government's management of it
have been notoriously volatile in recent years, and there have been no
institutional changes to guarantee that this situation will alter. To the
cynical, the reforms so far have merely abolished claims on the public purse
from subsidies and public enterprises, leaving more revenue in the hands of
the central government.
Some economists, lawyers and businessmen in Santo Domingo are urging an
intensification of reforms to the structure of the economy, including an
overhaul of the legal system which inhibits foreign and domestic investment.
The prospects for such profound change in the near future are less than
rosy.
Although most of the country's fundamental economic problems remain -
unemployment for example is estimated at over 25 per cent - the Dominican
government's attempts to diversify the economy away from sugar have had some
success.
Free trade zones - where businesses can import and export free of taxes and
duties - now employ 120,000-130,000 people and contributed Dollars 250m in
hard currency last year to the central bank.
There has also been some success in non-traditional agriculture - for
example, fruit. The most successful of these have depended on foreign
investment. Domestic agriculture is in need of reform, for example giving
farmers unchallengeable legal title to their property, to reverse a trend
which could leave the country needlessly dependent on food imports.
Tourism income was estimated at Dollars 880m in 1991, a significant
contribution to an economy whose merchandise exports totalled some Dollars
730m last year. More than half of the tourists now visiting the country are
from Europe, reducing the heavy dependence of the Dominican economy on that
of the US.
This dependence on the US - reinforced by the remittances of the many
Dominicans living there - may be further reduced by the country's accession
in March 1990 to the Lome Convention. This allows duty-free access to 320m
consumers in the EC.
The country has been a beneficiary since 1983 of the US's Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI) which gives duty and quota free entry of many goods to the
US market. However, there are concerns that the signing of a free trade
agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico will displace investment and
exports from the Dominican Republic.
Another cloud which could influence US trade concessions is the Dominican
human rights record. The US State Department published last month a 1991
report on human rights practices. It cited abuses, particularly in the
treatment of the many Haitians working in the Dominican sugar cane industry.
Relations with neighbouring Haiti, which has invaded morethan once, have
long been poor and worsened with the election of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide. Last June, the president decreed the repatriation of all
foreigners under 16 and older than 60. According to the State Department,
6,000 Haitians were involuntarily repatriated before the programme was
suspended on the day after the Haitian army coup in September. In addition,
'some 50,000 to 55,000 Haitians left, mainly to avoid the possibility of
losing their possessions.'
The influence of the US remains strong, as it has been throughout the
century. The other main influences on the president - the army and the Roman
Catholic church - are also traditional.
Mr Balaguer has long awaited the celebration of the 500th anniversary of
Columbus's 'discovery and evangelisation of the Americas' and may well see
this year as the culmination of his life's work. The scale of his country's
festivities contrasts with the equivocation evident elsewhere in the region.
The Pope will be among a stream of visitors to Santo Domingo, the first
permanent settlement established by Columbus in the new world. The president
has ordered a refurbishment of the fine colonial quarter of the capital,
dominated by its coral rock cathedral.
In a typically grand gesture, in a poor country where electricity is a
scarce commodity, Mr Balaguer has also decided to complete a commemorative
lighthouse first commissioned from a student Scottish architect in 1929, and
only now reaching completion. The lighthouse, costing tens of millions of
dollars, will project the symbol of the cross on to the clouds above.
A more important bequest for his people would be for President Balaguer to
use his last years in office to further economic reform, to strengthen the
institutions of state and to reinforce the democratic process. But that
would probably be too much to ask.

FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Better margins return BfG to
profit
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BfG, THE former German trades union bank which has been in the throes of a
painful restructuring for the last two years and which is currently the
subject of intense takeover rumours, achieved partial operating profits of
DM78m (Dollars 47.2m) last year, compared with the losses of DM252m in 1990.
Mr Paul Wieandt, brought in as chief executive of the troubled bank in early
1990 and architect of the subsequent rationalisation, yesterday said BfG had
finally turned the corner after two exceptionally difficult years and that
the profits result was far better than expected.
Operating profits were DM120m last year and are likely to rise to DM320m in
1992, he said.
The results benefited from a rise in interest rate margins, a deliberate
decision to move out of unprofitable lending, and sharply reduced costs,
reflecting a reduction in the number of branches and in the number of staff.
The headcount dropped from 6,500 to 5,700 at the end of last year, down from
7,400 when Mr Wieandt took over.
BfG, 51 per cent owned by the Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB)
insurance group, has recently become something of a pawn in the complex
battle between AMB's management and Assurances Generales de France (AGF),
which has accumulated a 25 per cent stake in AMB.
Earlier this month, it emerged that AMB was considering a reconciliation
with AGF on condition that AGF brought Credit Lyonnais, the French
state-owned bank, in as a buyer of at least a partial stake in BfG.
Mr Wieandt refused to comment on persistent rumours that a deal with Credit
Lyonnais was imminent. He said an international alliance would be useful to
help the bank's capital position.
Direct talks with the French bank had taken place but were now over, he
said. This still leaves open the possibility that BfG's fate will be sealed
by talks between AMB, AGF and the French bank.

SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken plans a cash infusion for its real estate
credit company Svensk Fastighetskredit, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm.
In a first phase, SFK will receive SKr1bn (Dollars 168m) over the first four
months of 1992, SEB said. The cash infusion comes on the back of a 47 per
cent decline in SFK's operating profit to SKr267m in 1991.
The fall reflects a jump in provisions for loan losses, to SKr285m from
SKr20m a year earlier, SEB said. SFK's new lending last year amounted to
SKr16.6bn, which brought its total lending volume to SKr103.9bn at the
year-end.
Earlier this week, SEB, Sweden's biggest bank, reported a near 30 per cent
fall in operating profits to SKr2.32bn for last year after heavy credit
losses.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Plight of the Pehuenches stirs Chile's conscience: The
national debate over Indian rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 22 Pehuenche Indian families face imminent eviction from their
ancestral lands in the southern Andes unless the Chilean government provides
enough money to buy the title deeds from the landowners of the Quinquen
valley.
In any other year, the incident would not even make a footnote to the long
history of dispossession suffered by America's native peoples. But this is
1992, and the issue of Indian rights is enjoying unprecedented exposure 500
years after Columbus stumbled across the New Continent.
The Pehuenches of Quinquen have become a cause celebre in Chile. Every
politician worth his salt has made the trek up the remote highland valley to
express solidarity with their plight. The negotiations over their future
have robbed three top government ministers of their summer holidays. And the
landowners, who obtained an eviction order from the Supreme Court against
150 'illegal squatters', are being grilled by the press.
The title holders, a company of local businessmen called Sociedad Galletue,
hold another weapon besides the Supreme Court mandate: they know President
Patricio Aylwin's government will not dare expropriate their property for
fear of raising the spectre of the mass land seizures that traumatised
Chile's land-owning class during the Allende years.
Sociedad Galletue has therefore held out while the government has
progressively increased its bid. Ironically, the latest offer of Dollars 5m
for 37,000 hectares of non-arable land is probably more than all the
governments of Chile have ever spent on their indigenous population.
The government has been drawn into the conflict because of the growing
militancy of Chile's 500,000 Mapuches, the tribe to which the Pehuenche clan
belongs. Late last year, Mapuche groups decided to end more than a century
of land-poaching by white settlers. They invaded a dozen farms in the scenic
Lake District, claiming back land that had historically belonged to their
unprotected Indian reservations.
The land occupations were shortlived; many Mapuches were thrown into jail.
But their actions succeeded in sparking a national debate over Chile's
forgotten Indians.
The government plans legislation to protect Indian rights and establish a
'land-fund' to purchase some of the territory the Mapuches have lost this
century, but time is running out for the Pehuenches.
Chile's right-wing opposition has dismissed the government's project as a
'fashionable international bandwagon' and Sociedad Galletue says it will
enforce the eviction order on March 3 unless the government pays Dollars 10m
for the disputed valley. Mr Edgardo Boeninger, President Aylwin's
chief-of-staff, admitted that negotiations remained deadlocked last week.
The Pehuenches are living in constant fear of a surprise raid and have
posted hilltop lookouts to warn of the arrival of Carabineros. These are
Chile's paramilitary police, which have repaired the mountain track leading
to the Quinquen valley to assist the fast deployment of troops.
'Quinquen', in the native Mapudungun language, means 'refuge', a name that
underscores the Pehuenches' mystical connection to their land, which they
hold in common as an integral part of their religion and culture. So it is
not surprising that the Indian families have declined a government offer to
relocate them in a nearby valley. 'Our land is not a negotiable issue,' said
a Pehuenche mother last week. 'We cannot cultivate our traditions in a
flower pot.'
The Pehuenches' lives revolve around the collection of the pine nut of the
Araucaria (monkey puzzle tree), which is roasted or ground into flour for
bread. Sociedad Galletue also lived off the Araucaria, chopping it down for
timber until a government decree in 1990 declared the millenary tree a
protected species and banned its exploitation.
Environmentalists claim Sociedad Galletue is seeking the eviction of the
Pehuenches out of spite for having lost its main source of income. One
owner, Mr Gonzalo Lledo, came near to suggesting as much in a recent press
interview: 'The government need only revoke the decree that bans the
exploitation of the Araucaria and the Pehuenches could live there for free.'

FT  27 FEB 92 / Egypt hoists 'full up' signs as tourists come in droves:
Tony Walker writes on growing investment in the holidays business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR FOUAD SULTAN, Egypt's minister of tourism, is a happy man these days.
Well he might be, with Cairo's hotels full to overflowing and some Dollars
1bn earmarked for investment in the tourism sector.
If Dr Sultan has a worry it is that Egypt's tourism infrastructure will not
be able to cope with tourist numbers this Easter. He confidently predicts
that receipts in 1991-92 will exceed the Dollars 3bn earned from tourism in
1989-90 before the Gulf crisis.
In 1989, the peak year, some 2.8m visitors came to Egypt, compared with
about 2m in 1990, and a similar figure last year. This does not include
domestic tourism which Dr Sultan estimates adds one-third to receipts,
making the sector easily Egypt's largest money-earner, ahead of workers'
remittances, oil and Suez Canal dues.
All this activity is attracting new investors. The tourism sector together
with the oil industry has become Egypt's biggest magnet for investment in
new projects, including the refurbishment and enlargement of existing
hotels.
Dr Sultan, who hardly disguises his impatience with the government's
faltering steps towards de-nationalisation, sees tourism as a model for new
private sector investment, and for the beginning of a divestiture programme
of state-owned businesses.
When he was appointed minister six years ago, Dr Sultan began leasing some
of Egypt's government-owned grand historic hotels to private companies which
were obliged to spend money re-furbishing seedy relics such as the Cataracts
Hotel at Aswan.
In 1990, the minister moved on to the second phase of his plan which is to
begin selling off hotels to private investors, provided they undertake to
enlarge hotel capacity to make better use of prime sites. Thus the Meridien
Hotel on the Nile was sold to Saudi investors who plan to increase the
hotel's capacity to about 1,000 rooms from the present 260 at a cost of some
Dollars 250m.
Dr Sultan's planned third phase is to begin offering clusters of
government-owned hotels, which are good money-earners but are what he
describes as 'mature properties' and not suitable for further expansion, to
local institutional and smaller investors who would be guaranteed an
immediate return.
He sees this as way of helping to encourage a revival of public confidence
in the equity markets and to 'build awareness of the value of
privatisation'. Finally, he wants to offer for public sale, state
institutions such as Misr Travel which is involved in a range of tourism
activities, but he says such a step will be 'a little way down the track'.
The minister has also identified four main areas for development outside the
population centres of Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor and Aswan.
These are the Red Sea coast south of Hurghada; Sharm el-Sheikh and Dahab in
Sinai; and Egypt's oases in the Western Desert towards the Libyan border.
Among the more ambitious planned projects on the Red Sea coast is one being
promoted by the Abu Soma Development Company which is proposing to transform
10m sq metres of barren Ras Abu Soma headland into a tourism centre with
12-15 hotels, a golf course and several marinas.
Dr Farid Saad, chairman of the Cairo-based Egyptian Finance Company (EFC),
which is behind the Abu Soma development, hopes that work will begin this
year on two hotels at a cost of about Dollars 50m. The virgin site is some
40km south of Hurghada.
Dr Saad is also the moving force behind the creation of an investment fund
specialising in tourism, to be called the Egyptian Tourism Investment
Company. Initial capital of LE53m (Dollars 16.1m) would come from
debt/equity swaps.
Dr Saad has been wrestling with the government over the rate at which
debt/equity swaps will be permitted, but pending approval he has already
identified several new projects, including a hotel development in Luxor.
Dr Sultan's recent success in persuading the government to prevent oil
exploration encroaching on prime tourist sites in the Red Sea, south of
Hurghada and in other marine regions, is regarded by environmentalists as
promising.
The minister is also planning to use the newly-established Tourism
Development Authority, with backing from the World Bank which is offering up
to Dollars 200m in loans, to help pioneer tourist development in remote
areas, especially on the Red Sea coast and in South Sinai. The authority
would contribute initial infrastructure support for such projects.
Barring fresh Middle East turbulence, Dr Sultan sees no reason why tourism
receipts should not double by the end of the century.

BRITAIN promised continued support and protection to the Iraqi Kurds
yesterday when Mr John Major, the prime minister, received one of the two
main Kurdish leaders at 10, Downing Street.
Mr Massoud Barzani had two main requests on behalf of his people, who
currently enjoy de facto autonomy (thanks to the withdrawal of Iraqi
government forces from the area after last April's intervention by US,
British, French and Dutch troops and aircraft) but are being denied all
supplies from the government-held area.
One was for economic development aid, to enable them to rebuild their
infrastructure and escape dependence on emergency relief. The other was for
an assurance of continued military protection (from allied aircraft across
the border in Turkey) until a political solution could be reached.
The current agreement under which allied forces are stationed in
south-eastern Turkey expires at the end of June.

FT  26 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in brisk trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVES flinched on the UK stock market yesterday afternoon when Wall Street
fell heavily in early trading. London quickly recovered its poise, but its
loss of 12.9 points left the FT-SE 100 Index once again below the 2,550
mark. Traders sounded unperturbed, however, pointing out that UK equities
had stood up well to a mixed bag of trading results from some of the
market's big guns.
Shares were easier at first, but then turned higher as optimism for a base
rate cut flickered off and then on again. Traders also tried to read the
implications for sterling of yesterday's reduction in repo rates by the Bank
of Spain. However, with Budget Day now less than a fortnight away, most UK
analysts doubt whether there will be a move in domestic rates until then.
The conflicting range of uncertainties ensured an erratic session for share
prices. The Footsie gained 13.1 in early trading only to plunge to a net
decline of 15.6 after Wall Street opened. With the Dow reducing its early
setback from 40 to 22 points by the time London closed, the UK market
trimmed its losses.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,546.8 for a fall on the day of
12.9. 'Not a bad performance in view of the uncertainty in the US market,'
commented the leading trader at a London investment bank.
Seaq volume increased to 511m shares from the 440.5m that were traded in the
previous session. Yesterday's total took in heavy trading in the group of
blue chip stocks which dominated the market after disclosing their
respective trading statements.
In one of its heaviest trading sessions, National Westminster Bank closed
firmly, although an initial advance which reflected satisfaction with the
trading results and dividend payment was trimmed before the end of the
session.
The Footsie was pulled down by a sharp fall in Unilever, as investors showed
disappointment with very modest profits growth for the year, and by a
smaller decline in SmithKline Beecham, in spite of meeting market forecasts
by moving above the Pounds 1bn profits mark.
The lesson appeared to be that the stock market will accept bad corporate
news, provided that it is no worse than expected. Midland Bank, whose
dividend announcement tomorrow could be the litmus test for the sector, held
steady yesterday.
Wall Street's reaction to the fall in the US consumer confidence index to
its lowest level for 17 years clearly upset London, but did not produce the
setback predicted until recent-ly by those analysts convinced that Wall
Street is overvalued.
Across the full range of the market, falls in share prices were modest.
Retail issues eased as hopes of an immediate cut in base rates faded again,
but losses among such sector leaders as Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher
were slight.
The property sector, also sensitive to interest rate moods, gave ground but
losses here were blamed on more immediate reports of bearish developments in
London's office rental market, which has already borne down heavily on the
shares of property companies.
A more positive factor was the relatively steady performance from the blue
chip oil companies, which fell heavily last week following profits
statements from BP and Shell Transport but resisted transatlantic influences
yesterday.

FT  26 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE of any signs of reduction in UK interest rates, together with
figures showing a fall in US consumer confidence, caused a retreat in FT-SE
stock index futures after an initial jump, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract, having started the session at 2,579, saw light selling.
The downward trend was, however, reversed by speculation, later confirmed,
of a 0.25 per cent cut in the Bank of Spain's official intervention rate.
This triggered a squeeze in the March future, sending it to the day's high
of 2,596 as dealers anticipated that the Bank of England might soon follow
suit.
It did not, and selling followed which gathered pace with the release of
poor US consumer confidence statistics. These, in turn, led to falls on Wall
Street, once again hurting the March contract.
March finished at 2,557, around 4 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 6. Turnover reached almost 7,000 contracts.
Traded options remained dull, volume totalling 24,491 contracts, with the
FT-SE 100 index option having 8,872 lots transacted. British Airways was the
busiest stock option, with 1,744 lots dealt.

consumer confidence

Wall Street
A WEAKER than expected consumer confidence report unsettled the equity
market yesterday, sending share prices lower across the board, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above its low for the day but was
still down 24.59 at 3,257.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.82 at 410.45,
while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks fell 3.53 to 621.40.
Turnover on the New York SE came to 210m shares, and declines led rises by
1,052 to 654.
Although the Dow indicator has crept up to new highs in recent days, the
underlying tone of the market has been weak, and news of the decline in the
Conference Board's February consumer confidence index to 46.3 - the lowest
level since December 1974 - provided a good excuse for selling.
The fall in the consumer confidence index was unexpected, as was an equally
damaging decline in the Conference Board's measurement of consumer
expectations, which pointed to more trouble for the economy. Even Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has made positive noises
recently about an economic recovery, was moved to call the confidence
figures 'quite disturbing'.
Leading stocks were lower across the board. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 88 1/8 , Merck Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 152 3/8 , Procter &amp; Gamble
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 100 5/8 and General Electric Dollars 7/8 to Dollars
79 3/8 .
Motor shares were particularly hard hit, having been bought recently on
hopes that rising consumer confidence would boost car sales. Ford slipped
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36
1/2 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16 3/8 .
A rare gain was reported by SmithKline Beecham, which climbed Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 73 3/4 on news of a 16.5 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits
and plans for a two-for-one stock split.
Wells Fargo dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 71 3/4 after credit rating agency
Moody's downgraded Dollars 4bn of long-term senior debt and commercial paper
because of concern about the outlook for the bank's asset quality.
On the over-the-counter market, Intel weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 63
3/4 as investors reacted to news that an arbitrator had granted Advanced
Micro Devices, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19 1/4 , rights to the technology
in its clone of Intel's 386 microprocessor.
Canada
THE Toronto market closed mixed after moderate trading, as dealers awaited
the announcement of the Canadian government's Budget for the 1993 fiscal
year.
The composite index ended a slight 1.7 firmer at 3,544.9, but falls
outnumbered rises by 297 to 262 after volume of 22.5m shares worth CDollars
238.3m.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rates close easier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DWINDLING expectations of an imminent UK base rate cut were briefly
rekindled first thing yesterday as the Bank of Spain lowered its
intervention rate by 25 basis points to 12.40 per cent.
There was a momentary thought that this might be part of a co-ordinated plan
to allow a simultaneous UK base rate cut, and in 15 minutes of lively
activity the three months interbank rate shed  1/16 to 10 1/4 -10 3/16 per
cent. Short sterling futures jumped 9 basis points to 89.90, from an opening
of 89.81 and a previous close of 89.80. 'The market was split 50/50 on
whether there would be a cut', said one dealer.
The Bank of England forecast a shortfall of about Pounds 850m, and invited
an early round of bill offers. Dealers were reluctant to tender paper,
however, in case there was a base rate cut on the way, and at mid-morning
the Bank announced that it had purchased only Pounds 6m of Band 1 bank bills
outright at 10 3/8 per cent. That indication of unchanged interest rates
pushed short sterling futures down 5 basis points to 89.86.
For the rest of the day, activity was quiet, with the Bank keeping liquidity
tight. Later in the morning, the Bank revised the expected shortfall to
Pounds 900m, and bought another Pounds 30m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8
per cent. In the afternoon, the forecast was revised upwards again, to
Pounds 950m, and the Bank bought Pounds 55m of Band 1 treasury bills and
Pounds 341m of Band 1 bank bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent, before providing
unspecified late assistance of around Pounds 465m.
Overnight money traded as high as 12 per cent. Short sterling futures closed
at 89.90, and the three months interbank rate ended  1/16 lower on the day
at 10 1/4 -10 3/16 per cent, with the market's belief that a base rate cut
is likely around or before the Budget on March 10 strengthened by the day's
events. Those expecting a cut sooner rather than later are focusing
attention on Thursday, when the January trade figures are due.
German call money rates eased further to 9.40/50 per cent, down from
Monday's 9.45/55 per cent. Banks had overestimated the February reserve
requirement, dealers said, and found themselves with surplus cash as the
month drew to a close.
In the US, Federal Funds traded at 3 15/16 per cent, just below the Federal
Reserve's presumed target of 4 per cent. There were no reserve operations,
said the Fed.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fearful consumers hurt dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET day for the dollar was transformed by the publication of the
Conference Board US consumer confidence index at 3pm London time. The index
dropped to 46.3 in February, the lowest level since the survey started in
1967.
The confidence numbers pushed the dollar down sharply from DM 1.6480 to DM
1.6350 in what one observer described as 'very aggressive selling' - though
this was mostly interbank dealing, he said, not corporate interest.
The drop in the confidence index called into question belief in an imminent
US economic recovery based on stronger recent retail sales figures and
monetary data, said Gerard Lyons of DKB International. Traders also noted
that Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a US
senate committee that the drop in the index was 'quite disturbing' and that
'there is room for the Fed to move (to ease interest rates) if we have to
move further'.
In spite of the burst of dollar selling, the market was heartened, said Mr
Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank, by very good resistance around the DM
1.6375 level. The dollar ended London trading at DM 1.6390, after a DM
1.6460 London start and Monday's close of DM 1.6510. It rallied to end at DM
1.6575 in New York.
Against the yen, the dollar had performed more strongly, helped by an
absence of the half-expected Japanese government intervention and by
political pressure for lower yen interest rates. On Tuesday, the dollar
closed in Tokyo at Y 129.32, and moved in a narrow range in European
trading, reaching a high of Y 129.91 before ending at Y 129.20, slightly
above Monday's close of Y 129.15. Against sterling the US unit closed at
Dollars 1.7610, down from an opening Dollars 1.7525.
Among European currencies, there was an easing of Spanish interest rates as
the Bank of Spain's intervention rate fell from 12.65 per cent to 12.40 per
cent. The move was primarily a result of strains within the EMS, not
domestic concerns, said Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister. 'The
peseta has been in the higher band of the ERM, and we thought we could
achieve a more balanced situation with a small reduction in rates,' he
added.
His comments were a clear reference to the way in which the peseta's
strength has kept sterling trapped against its lower ERM limit. Yesterday's
move on peseta interest rates produced no corresponding easing from the UK
authorities, but the pound stayed close to its peseta floor. There was
little activity: 'The pound was really completely sidelined,' commented one
trader.
Sterling opened at DM 2.8802, slightly weaker than its previous close of DM
2.8835. During the morning, the pound dipped to DM 2.8791, climbing back to
DM 2.8803 at 3pm. The dollar weakness thereafter, which pushed up the
D-Mark, left sterling a little easier and it closed at DM 2.8787.
In spite of very good trade figures, the French franc closed slightly lower.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC denies Canadian fish charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday strongly denied Canadian suggestions that
overfishing by EC vessels outside its 200-mile limit was a major factor in
the severe depletion of its fish stocks, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
Canada announced on Monday a 35 per cent cut in this year's northern cod
quota to 120,000 tonnes, immediately closing the winter fishery for offshore
trawlers inside Canadian waters.
Canadian officials say Spanish and Portuguese vessels last year took 42,000
tonnes of cod from the so-called 2J3KL area of the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries Organisation. The EC quota, which it sets unilaterally, was 27,000
tonnes, and only 21,500 tonnes were reported to the community, the officials
claim.
They argue that this has a knock-on effect, exacerbating stock depletion
inside Canadian waters and adding to unemployment in Newfoundland. A
Canadian scientific body last week cut its estimate of the spawning stock
from 1.1m tonnes in December to 780,000 tonnes.
Commission officials argue that, even if Canada is correct, it is
'outrageous' to suggest that the EC's extra 15,000 tonnes was responsible.
'The cause of the problem in Canadian waters is overfishing by the Canadian
fleet . . . just as the overfishing in Scottish waters is the result of the
overcapacity of the Scottish fleet,' an official said.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Consumer confidence fall boosts market
sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG drop in consumer confidence provided a welcome boost to US Treasury
market sentiment yesterday, although the pressure of fresh supply following
the afternoon auction of two-year notes pegged back early price gains.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  11/32 at 100
5/8 , yielding 7.938 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32
at 99 1/16 , to carry a yield of 5.374 per cent.
In the morning, the Conference Board's report that its consumer confidence
index fell to 46.3 in February - the lowest seen since 1974 - from 50.2 in
January, surprised the market, which had been expecting the index to rise.
The report overshadowed the second leg of the Federal Reserve chairman's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress. Although Mr Alan Greenspan made some
mildly encouraging noises about the economy, he warned that it was too soon
to assume that the recovery was assured, and hinted that further monetary
stimulus may be required.
After several weeks of steady losses as hopes for more interest rate cuts
dwindled, this was exactly what the market wanted to hear. The results of
the Dollars 14.25bn auction of two-year notes, however, meant prices fell
back from their highs.
EUROPEAN markets responded in knee-jerk fashion to the news from the US,
with most markets bouncing significantly higher in late trading.
UK government bonds gained around half a percentage point on the day, after
the market had earlier shown some disappointment that the UK authorities did
not follow their Spanish counterparts in cutting interest rates.
The expected rate cut in Spain, of  1/4 point, provided the opportunity for
the UK to steer rates lower, too: but with a national budget announcement
two weeks away and an election campaign about to get into full swing,
political considerations appeared to determine that now was not the optimum
time for a rate cut.
Early firmness in the gilts market eased as a result, helped by rumours of a
poor opinion poll showing for the Conservative government. The news from the
US later, though, brought a busy afternoon's trading - with around 31,000
contracts in the March gilts future traded on Liffe - and a sharp upturn.
The Liffe future ended at around its high for the day of 97.30, up from its
opening of 97.18.
GERMAN government bond futures also jumped in late trading, but failed to
break out of their current trading range.
In a quiet morning, the March bund futures contract firmed from its opening
of 87.74 to around 87.80, before the news from the US pushed it up to its
resistance level of 88.00.
With inflation data due this week, the up-turn brought little trading from
investors, though the heavy day on the futures market suggested that traders
were positioning themselves for future buying.
AFTER a weak start to the week, Japanese government bonds advanced in early
trading in Tokyo as hopes of an official discount rate cut were rekindled.
However, the early advances were lost during the afternoon, with the
benchmark bond No 129 closing at around the same level as Monday, when it
closed with a yield of 5.385 per cent.

<TEXT>
TWO LARGE US department store chains, Arkansas-based Dillard's and May
Department Stores, unveiled earnings figures yesterday which provided
further evidence of a dull final quarter in the retail sector.
May, which operates 318 department stores and almost 3,300 Payless
ShoeSource outlets, said after-tax profits in the 13 weeks to February 1
rose only modestly, from Dollars 252m a year ago to Dollars 266m.
Sales in the important fourth quarter rose from Dollars 3.28bn to Dollars
3.36bn, but on a same-store basis there was an overall 0.5 per cent drop,
reflecting a 0.7 per cent fall in the department store division and a 1.5
per cent gain on the shoe store side.
For the year, May saw net profits of Dollars 515m, against Dollars 500m in
1990-91, on sales of Dollars 10.4bn, against Dollars 9.86bn. Its shares
gained  7/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 .
May, which opened 14 department stores and 328 Payless outlets last year,
said it planned to add six department stores and 270 Payless units in the
current 12 months.
At Dillard's, which owns 198 department stores, mainly in the midwest and
south-west, after-tax profits in the fourth quarter totalled Dollars 93.3m,
against Dollars 92.3m. Sales reached Dollars 1.32bn against Dollars 1.22bn,
but same-store sales rose a modest 2 per cent.
For the year overall, sales rose 12 per cent to Dollars 4.07bn, with
comparable-store advancing by half this amount. Net profits for the period
were Dollars 206.2m against Dollars 182.8m.
The drab figures follow news of a fourth-quarter profits fall at Nordstrom,
the Seattle-based fashion store chain.

sale

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC), said it has hired the Wall Street stockbroking firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ) to conduct a strategic review that could lead to the
sale or recapitalisation of the company.
Berlitz said DLJ would consider alternatives, including the sale of all or
part of the company. Another option would be the continued New York Stock
Exchange listing of Berlitz as an independent company.
Mr Joe Rodgers, Berlitz chairman, said the company's committee of
independent directors had decided to expand DLJ's role from a more narrow
previous assignment.
Any recommendations from DLJ will nonetheless be difficult to implement in
the near-term.
MCC, which nominally owns 56.5 per cent of Berlitz shares, is itself
operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law in a complex arrangement
that requires co-ordination between New York and UK court-appointed
administrators of the Maxwell empire.
At present, most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake is actually in the
hands of five US and European banks and companies that received the stock as
collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. The pledging of the Berlitz shares was
discovered last year after MCC had announced the sale for Dollars 265m of
56.5 per cent of Berlitz to Fukutake, the Japanese publisher.
Earlier this month, Berlitz adopted a 'poison pill' scheme designed to deter
an unwanted change in the control of the company. Macmillan has meanwhile
brought injunctions against the banks that received Berlitz shares from Mr
Maxwell to prevent them from selling the stock.

WEAK commodity prices, poor metals distribution markets, and declining
uranium output reduced Rio Algom's revenues and earnings sharply in 1991,
writes Robert Gibbens.
Revenues dipped to CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m) from CDollars 1.3bn in
1990, and net profit was CDollars 24.5m, or 51 cents a share, against
CDollars 87.3m, or CDollars 1.93. in The results include special losses of
CDollars 20.2m, against CDollars 30.3m, mainly related to the Nova Scotia
tin mining operation finally closed on January 3, 1992.
Rio has temporarily suspended efforts to sell its metals distribution
business, which has annual sales of about CDollars 700m. No acceptable
offers were received mainly because of the recession.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Court ruling fails to defuse
chip war - Implications of the Intel-AMD technology decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIVE-YEAR arbitration battle between rival Silicon Valley chip-makers
Intel and Advanced Micro Devices has resulted in a decision that appears
unlikely to end bitter disputes over AMD's rights to manufacture
Intel-designed microprocessor chips.
The dispute focused on the 386, the chip at the heart of current-generation
IBM-compatible personal computers. Until last year, Intel was the sole
supplier of the 386.
However, in April AMD launched its own 'reverse-engineered' clone of the
microprocessor, and has since won a 30 per cent share of the market.
In his decision, the arbitrator awarded AMD a 'permanent, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-transferable worldwide right' to any Intel technology
that may be incorporated in AMD's reverse-engineered version of the 386.
He found that Intel had breached a 1982 technology-sharing pact with AMD,
under which the companies agreed to swap microprocessor and related product
designs.
AMD was also awarded nominal damages of Dollars 15m in connection with
disputes over earlier versions of the chips. Intel, however, will be allowed
to keep Dollars 23m in disputed royalty payments made by AMD.
Commenting on Intel's conduct, the arbitrator said he would have awarded
punitive damages against Intel if they were within his powers. He would also
like to have been able to transfer a portion of Intel's 386 revenues to AMD.
The arbitrator found that the damages to AMD from Intel's violation of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing were 'immeasurable', and that he
felt unable to 'even out the balance' entirely.
The arbitrator, a retired California judge, said his decision was aimed at
'aborting the incessant warfare which has gone on between these two
companies for the past five years'.
He said: 'I intend that AMD be permitted to go forward in its production and
sale of the AMD reverse-engineered 386 without harassment from Intel from
any further law suit.
'After five years, it is now the end of the day . . . the parties have had a
full and fair hearing. Now it is time to go home.'
However, Intel immediately said it would oppose enforcement of the portions
of the decision relating to the 386, and that it expected to continue to
fight AMD in the courts. One of several pending lawsuits between the
companies is expected to go to trial next month.
A new round of legal battles appears likely when AMD introduces its own
version of the next-generation 486 microprocessor, which was specifically
excluded from the arbitration decision.
'The remarkable thing is how little real impact this decision will have on
either company,' said Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive.
'We keep the Intel 386 chip and they keep selling their imitation of it. The
only thing new is that the arbitrator sprinkled holy water on their chip and
has given them additional defences to help them fight us in court.
Financially, the decision is also a non-event.'
Not surprisingly, AMD took a different view of the decision. 'Justice has
been done,' said Mr W. J. Sanders, AMD chairman and chief executive.
'AMD now has the unfettered, royalty-free rights to manufacture and sell the
386 microprocessor. All past and future 386 revenues and profits are no
longer under any cloud of legal uncertainty.'
Computer-makers have welcomed AMD's entry into the 386 market. Competition
between the two companies has forced Intel to lower its prices, fueling a
rapid decline in personal computer prices that is boosting sales of
computers and computer software.
With both Intel and AMD hailing the decision as a victory, there is,
however, widespread confusion within the industry over what the decision
means.
Both companies can be expected to attempt to use the ruling to gain market
advantage.
Wall Street analysts, many of whom had anticipated a much larger monetary

Dollars 2.2bn AMD was seeking.
Since its introduction of the 386 clone, AMD has posted record sales. For

145.3m, while Intel also unveiled record revenues last year of Dollars
4.78bn and Dollars 819m in profits.

<TEXT>
MOODY'S, the US credit-rating agency, yesterday downgraded the rating on
Wells Fargo, the big California commercial banking group, in the latest
indication of how the US investment community is reacting to the weakening
of the California economy.
The downgrade, affecting about Dollars 4bn in securities, brings its
long-term senior debt rating down to BAA1 from Single-A2, and the rating on
commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
The long-term deposit rating of Well Fargo Bank, the principal operating
subsidiary, was lowered by Moody's from Double-A3 to Single-A2.
Moody's said the action reflected 'the uncertain outlook for asset quality,
especially in Wells' sizeable portfolio of commercial real estate loans'.
Moody's noted, however, the bank had a formidable retail franchise in
California that continued to generate strong earnings.
The bank, traditionally seen as an excellent performer, was subjected to a
tough inspection by US bank regulators last December. This led to unusually
heavy bad debt provisions, especially in the commercial real estate loan
portfolio.
Its 1991 net earnings were almost wiped out following some Dollars 700m of
fourth-quarter bad debt provisions.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEERE &amp; Co, the US heavy equipment-maker, managed to reduce first-quarter
losses, thanks largely to improved prices and greater efficiency.
The company suffered a net loss of Dollars 19.9m, or 26 cents a share, in
its 1992 first quarter, ended January 31, compared with a loss of Dollars
43.1m, or 57 cents, in the same period a year ago.
Worldwide production was the same as last year's during the first quarter,
but net sales rose to Dollars 1.45bn from Dollars 1.43bn last year.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said first-quarter results were affected by
continued weak demand and efforts to reduce company and dealers'
inventories. But heavy discounting to improve sales has moderated.
Lawn and grounds care equipment sales and production were higher, while
agricultural equipment volumes were down in the first quarter.
Prospects for the rest of 1992 are uncertain due to the recession and low
customer confidence. While the North American agricultural market would
appear to be poised for an upturn, farmers' buying attitudes still seem
cautious, the company said.
Retail demand in overseas markets is expected to decline in 1992, reflecting
European farmers' concern with the Gatt negotiations.
Deere has consequently reduced its scheduled production tonnage this year by
about 5 per cent compared with that of 1991. Deere's lower production levels
are expected to result in further reductions in dealer and company
inventories.

ADollars 90m

<TEXT>
PIONEER, the Australian building products and petroleum group, has reported
record net profits of ADollars 90m (Dollars 67.60m) after abnormal items for
the six months to December, a rise of 2.4 per cent on the corresponding
period last year.
The result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 37m on the sale of its
holding in Ampol Exploration, an Australian petroleum company. However, the
abnormal profit was offset by a provision of ADollars 40m against the book
value of US assets, which was also treated as an abnormal item.
Pioneer said it had restated profits for both periods to exclude
contributions from Ampol Exploration, the sale of which was completed for
accounting purposes in July. The group said sales revenue fell 13 per cent
to ADollars 2.5bn.
Revenue from building materials was down 2 per cent to ADollars 1.2bn,
primarily because of weakness in Australian markets.
Petroleum refining and marketing operations revenue fell 17 per cent to
ADollars 1.3bn, principally reflecting a fall in crude oil prices at the end
of the Gulf war.
Directors declared an interim dividend of 7.5 cents a share, unfranked
because of available tax losses incurred in previous years.

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of Montreal recorded an 18 per cent gain in net profit for the first
quarter ended January 31 and an 11 per cent rise in total assets due to
strong mortgage and commercial loan business, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
The bank, the first of Canada's Big Six to report for the first quarter,
said earnings advanced to CDollars 164m (USDollars 138m), or CDollars 1.23 a
share, against Dollars 138.5m, or Dollars 1.10, a year earlier.
The figures also benefited from higher contributions from Harris Bankcorp,
the US subsidiary, and Nesbitt Thomson, its securities subsidiary.
The fiscal 1991 period, however, was dragged down by a loss in the Brazilian
subsidiary, which is now accounted for on a cost basis.
Return on common equity was 15.1 per cent, up from 14.5 per cent a year
earlier.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest chartered bank, managed a 24
per cent gain in first-quarter profit to CDollars 174.2m or 76 cents a
share, from CDollars 140m, or 63 cents, a year earlier.
The results were in line with analysts' forecasts that BNS would show a big
improvement in the January 31 quarter, with better margins stemming from
declining Canadian interest rates.
Return on equity was 16.5 per cent against 14.9 per cent, return on average
assets 0.77 per cent against 0.62 per cent, and non-interest expense rose 10
per cent due to aggressive efforts to improve service and efficiency.

ELECTRICITE de France (EdF), the power utility which is western Europe's
largest energy exporter, yesterday reported a steep rise in profits, writes
William Dawkins.
Net earnings at EdF rose from FFr100m (Dollars 17.8m) in 1990 to FFr1.9bn
last year, before a FFr500m levy collected by its government owner, on
turnover up by 9.6 per cent from FFr156.5bn to FFr171.4bn.
Mr Pierre Delaporte, president, attributed the improvement to a strong rise
in demand for EdF electricity from Britain and Germany, with a steady rise
in French domestic sales. He expected FFr2bn of profits this year.
Export sales rose 18 per cent to FFr12bn, representing 53.4bn kilowatt hours
(kWh) out of total output of 406.5 kWh.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Porsche defuses management
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergency meeting of the supervisory board of Porsche yesterday
succumbed to an ultimatum from Mr Arno Bohn, the company's chief executive,
and agreed 'unanimously' to extend his contract for another three years.
The board's vote appears to defuse an immediate management crisis at the
German sports car-maker. Mr Bohn had threatened to resign unless the board,
some of whose members had previously offered his job to a senior BMW
executive, gave him a vote of confidence this week.
However, some industry observers last night expressed the belief that the
apparent boardroom climb-down could not wholly repair the damage done to Mr
Bohn's relationship with the board by a series of events over the past
fortnight.
The crisis was triggered by the offer of his job to Dr Wolfgang Reitzle,
research and development director of executive BMW. the executive car-maker.
It is understood this offer was made by Dr Ferdinand Porsche, chairman of
the Porsche supervisory board.
Subsequently, a regular meeting of the Porsche supervisory board last week
failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to endorse the extension of
Mr Bohn's existing contract after it runs out at the end of this year.
Almost immediately afterwards, Dr Reitzle, who is seen as heir-apparent to
BMW's 63-year-old management board chairman, Dr Eberhard von Kuenheim, said
he had decided not to take up Porsche's offer.
Mr Bohn described the board's actions as 'damaging' for the company and said
he would 'not be available for reappointment' if the board did not give him
unqualified backing'.
The company last night offered a 'no comment' to question's about the
long-term implications of the dispute for Porsche's management.
The dispute has come at a bad time for Porsche, whose worldwide sales have
fallen sharply. Some 4,000 workers are on short time, following a fall in
1991 sales to 26,200 - 4,000 fewer than in 1990 - and little more than half
the 50,000 vehicles sold in Porsche's peak year of 1986.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Police probe Perrier stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH police have been called in to investigate suspected irregularities
over the sale of a stake in Perrier, the mineral water group, to Saint
Louis, the sugar group which is allied to Italy's Agnelli family.
Mr Hubert Gasztowtt, a legal official of the French public prosecutor's
office, yesterday told the Paris commercial court a preliminary inquiry into
possible 'penal infractions' had been handed to the fraud squad.
Legal officials said that the investigators would be looking for evidence of
insider trading.
This latest twist in the increasingly bitter struggle for control of Perrier
came on the first day of one of two court cases in which Nestle, the Swiss
food multinational, is seeking to reduce the Agnellis' stake.
An Agnelli holding company launched an agreed bid for Exor, a French holding
company owning 35 per cent of the water group, late last year. The
subsequent purchase of more Perrier shares by Saint Louis allowed the
Agnelli camp to lift its stake in the water company to 49 per cent, only
days ahead of a hostile FFr13.4bn (Dollars 2.3bn)bid for Perrier from Nestle
four weeks ago.
The Swiss group's chances of success hinge largely on its winning at least
one of the legal cases.
Nestle met an initial setback yesterday when the public prosecutor advised
the Paris court to uphold the sale of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier to
Saint Louis, alleged by the Swiss group's lawyers to be 'fraudulent.'
Nestle claims the sale should be annulled because Perrier and Saint-Louis
both knew that the Swiss company was about to bid for the mineral water
group and at a higher price.
Mr Gasztowtt said that an inquiry by the Commission des Operations de
Bourse, the stock market watchdog, showed there was no proof that Mr Jacques
Vincent, Perrier's chairman, knew about the impending Nestle bid at the
time, so the sale to Saint Louis should be valid.
The case appeared to swing back in Nestle's favour when Mr Gasztowtt
announced the police inquiry into the conditions of the transaction. The
Paris court,which is free to choose whether to follow the prosecutor's
recommendations, is to issue its judgment on March 16.
Nestle's other legal attack is in Nimes, near Perrier's main plant in
southern France, where it has challenged Exor's voting rights on its 35 per
cent stake in Perrier.
The public prosecutor has advised the Nimes court to reduce the voting
rights of Exor and its allies to 20 per cent for two years.
A decision from Nimes is expected on March 6.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: News Corp hopes to raise Dollars
1bn to reduce bank debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH, the international media magnate whose News Corporation
last year restructured Dollars 8.2bn of group debt, said that he hopes to
raise up to Dollars 1bn over the next 12 months by way of long-term
securities that will allow News Corporation to reduce its level of bank
debt.
Mr Murdoch, who on Monday announced plans to succeed the departing Mr Barry
Diller as chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's Fox movie and
television group, disclosed the debt reduction plan in an interview.
'We are going to have good profits at News Corp (in the year that ends this
June 30) and as credit ratings improve we will go for more long-term debt
issues to pay down more bank debt,' he explained.
Turning to Fox, which contributed around Dollars 340m of News Corporation's
operating income of Dollars 1.2bn in the financial year to last June 30, Mr
Murdoch said that he planned to devote three weeks out of every month on the
day-to-day operations of Fox Inc, the parent company of the 20th Century Fox
movie studio and the Fox television network.
Mr Diller, who built the Fox TV network single-handedly over the past five
years, surprised the US entertainment industry when he resigned on Monday in
order to form or acquire his own business.
'I never though of bringing anyone else in,' said Mr Murdoch, adding that he
had moved his base of operations to Los Angeles last year and planned to be
at Fox 'as much as Barry was.'
'Now I can get back to what I like to do the best, which is running the
business,' said Mr Murdoch, adding that Fox represents the biggest part of
News Corporation's earnings.
He said that Fox's total operating income was likely to be Dollars 20m to
Dollars 25m below last year's Dollars 340m level in the year to June 30,
with the movie studio's profits down by Dollars 30m to Dollars 40m and the
television network's earnings improved.
Mr Murdoch added that he planned to be involved in all aspects of the film
and television business, including making decisions on which films to make.
He admitted that he does not have film experience, but explained: 'The role
I have to play is to say no, to employ an editor's judgment on movies and to
make people sell ideas to me.'
A top priority for Mr Murdoch will be bringing forward plans to expand Fox
television's programming from four to seven nights a week. This, however,
would depend upon a recovery of advertising demand in the US.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Recession and Gulf war hold back Unilever
profits - Guy de Jonquieres analyses the facts and figures behind the static
1991 results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEPER-than-expected recession in the US and the UK coupled with the
Gulf war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and adverse currency movements
held Unilever to 1 per cent growth in pre-tax profits and sales volumes last
year.
Nonetheless, the sluggish overall results were relieved by some strong
performances by individual businesses. The company also continued to spend
heavily on new products - backed by a 10 per cent increase in marketing
expenditure to Pounds 2.3bn.
Unilever's overall operating margin declined from 9 per cent to 8.6 per
cent. It said the fall was due to currency movements and the impact of
exceptional gains on 1990's results. Before exceptionals, operating profit
was Pounds 75m higher at constant exchange rates.
The year produced a particularly mixed picture in foods, Unilever's largest
business, where operating profits were static at Pounds 1.06bn on sales of
Pounds 11.9bn (Pounds 11.6bn).
Consumer foods performed well, particularly in Europe, where ice-cream sales
exceeded 1990's record levels.
Prepared meals, sauces and edible fats - particularly European healthy
eating ranges - all enjoyed good growth, though tea faced increasingly
fierce competition.
However, these positive developments were offset by a decline in results
from food service and catering supply operations, which were hard-hit by the
effects of the Gulf war on travel and the restaurant trade. Though the
business recovered in Europe later in the year, it remained depressed in the
US by recession.
Unilever also said its exports to the Soviet Union suffered from the
political and economic upheavals there. The company was, however, steadily
expanding its presence in eastern and central Europe, where it expected to
make further acquisitions and investments in the coming months.
A rapid rate of innovation, notably in concentrated washing powders, helped
detergents to increase sales volumes and market share.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 374m (Pounds 365m) on sales of Pounds 5.2bn
(Pounds 4.98bn), reflecting margin improvements due to cost reductions.
Operating profit on personal products fell to Pounds 242m (Pounds 272m) on
sales of Pounds 2.82bn (Pounds 2.72bn), reflecting lower duty-free sales of
prestige lines and weaker US demand for mass-market products.
In contrast, prestige brands such as Ralph Lauren and Elizabeth Arden's
top-of-the-range cosmetics had an 'excellent' year, recording double-digit
sales increases.
Action was under way to improve Elizabeth Arden's efficiency. Sales of
Chesebrough-Ponds, Unilever's US subsidiary, also fell 'materially' last
year. A management reorganisation was expected to produce increased profits
this year.
The group said the reorganisation of its European businesses in preparation
for the single market was proceeding well. About half the Pounds 195m
after-tax charge it had made for European restructuring had been committed,
and a total of 60 projects had been identified.
Events in the Middle East and the Soviet Union disrupted the speciality
chemicals business, which turned in flat profits of Pounds 222m (Pounds
223m) on sales of Pounds 1.79bn (Pounds 1.74bn). Nonetheless, National
Starch enjoyed an excellent performance - though Unichema International and
Crosfield encountered more difficult conditions.
Unilever said it had significantly improved its position in Japan, though it
was continuing to make losses there which had been magnified by the strength
of the yen. The company said it was determined to remain in 'key Japanese
markets' over the long term.
The company said its businesses in Chile, Argentina, India and South Africa
all enjoyed an 'excellent' year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSEBYS, the curtain and linen stores group owned by Cattle's (Holdings),
yesterday became the first retailer to seek a public listing for more than
two years.
Shares in the company will begin trading on Monday following a placing by
County NatWest of 10.2m new and existing shares with institutions at 115p.
The placing price gives Rosebys a market capitalisation of Pounds 21.3m.
Cattle's, the financial services group, will retain about 45 per cent of
Rosebys' enlarged share capital.
Mr Michael Rosenblatt, vice chairman, said margins had improved 20 per cent
since 1988, partly due to sourcing from overseas. With wage and rental costs
coming down, further savings were hoped for this year.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 2.17m last year, while
turnover rose slightly to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 40.9m). The placing price
puts the shares on a p/e of 12.9 from earnings per share of 8.9p last year.
This compares to a multiple of 19 for QS Holdings, a much bigger company and
the last specialist retailer to come to market.
Cattle's will receive total net funds of about Pounds 7.5m from the placing
and from repayment of outstanding inter company loans. Cattle's is proposing
a special dividend of 0.5p, payable with the final dividend for last year.
Rosebys will use Pounds 1.7m from the proceeds to finance the completion of
a new distribution centre. A further Pounds 1.7m will be used to repay part
of its overdraft.

<TEXT>
A DISPUTE has broken out between the Maxwell empire's beleaguered pension
funds and National Westminster Bank over the ownership of shares worth
Pounds 28m in Teva Pharmaceutical, an Israeli concern.
NatWest said yesterday that it had not made a decision on whether to keep
the shares, in which the Maxwell pension funds claim an interest. Lord
Alexander, NatWest's chairman, confirmed that the bank had been approached
by Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, the provisional liquidator
of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which acted as both manager and
trustee of the Maxwell pension funds.
Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, said the bank had been given no
conclusive evidence that the shares were the property of the pension funds.
He said the bank had been given the shares as security against a modest loan
to the Maxwell private companies shortly after Mr Robert Maxwell died last
November.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Robert Maxwell's son, had pledged the shares to
NatWest. 'We took them in good faith', said Mr Melbourn. 'We cannot simply
give them back without investigating the pension funds' claim. What would
our shareholders say if we did?'

Fisons has been cleared of questions regarding its 1990 accounts. The

Fisons argued that consolidation requirements were defined in company

The panel stressed last month that this did not remove the requirement to
