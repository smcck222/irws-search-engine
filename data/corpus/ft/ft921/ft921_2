FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Industry's fear of the unknown - Credit
controls - Tax incentives to encourage investment - Takeover curbs - Levy to
support training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LEFTWINGERS used to accuse Mrs Thatcher of turning Britain into the 51st
state of the US. Rightwingers might soon be accusing Labour of wanting to
turn Britain into Germany's 17th land.
For if there is a guiding inspiration to Labour's industrial strategy it is
the stable, regulated, and highly productive German manufacturing sector.
Among business executives, Labour's plans excite nervous apprehension, laced
with ignorance and spiced by a dose of self-interest about their tax bills.
Labour's strategy has four main ingredients:
The focus would shift to supply-side policies to stimulate investment and
promote training as macro-economic policy would be anchored to sterling's
ERM membership.
Direct state intervention and public ownership have largely given way to
regulation of business. The labour market would be regulated by a minimum
wage and a levy to support training; oversight of the privatised utilities
would tighten; competition policy would restrict takeovers in 'the public
interest'; banks and borrowing could be regulated by credit controls.
To offset the risk that the economy would be made less flexible by
regulation, Labour hopes that it would make the economy more productive by
offering tax incentives for investment, and by spending more on education,
training and infrastructure.
Labour would seek to emulate the consensus of Germany's social market by
building a partnership between the public and private sectors, for instance
through private investment in railways and a national investment bank to
gather private investment for public infrastructure projects.
The impact on business would depend on the interaction of these ingredients
over the short, medium and long term.
In the short-run the main risk would be heavy foreign selling of sterling
assets, bringing pressure on the pound and interest rates. If Labour had to
put up interest rates for more than three months the consequences could
become very serious, especially for construction, property and retailing.
Should Labour get through the first few months without its plans being
derailed, business would start to feel the medium-term effects of the
party's industrial strategy.
This package is crafted to deflect business criticism. Labour would carry
over key measures from last month's Budget - a reduction of the uniform
business rate and a halving of the car tax. Many other measures are drawn
directly from proposals made by business groups.
The most potent and costly would be a one-year increase from 25 per cent to
40 per cent in tax allowances for manufacturing companies to invest in plant
and equipment.
This could provoke a temporary surge in investment. Mr Sushil Wadhwani,
director of UK and European Equity Strategy at Goldman Sachs, estimates it
would reduce the cost 1.2 per cent to corporate profits. The National
Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the move would cost
about Pounds 1.3bn in a full year and increase the level of investment by
6.5 per cent.
These allowances would mainly benefit the motor, chemicals and food
manufacturing industries but bring little joy to brewers and metals and
electronics groups.
Labour estimates that a permanent tax credit worth 25 per cent of any
additional research and development spending would cost Pounds 120m a year
if it boosted business R&amp;D by 10 per cent. This would benefit
science-intensive sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals and
engineering.
A scheme to encourage engineering companies with fewer than 500 employees to
invest in new production processes by providing grants worth 25 per cent of
the outlay would have a marginal effect. Its cost, Pounds 40m a year, is
equivalent to just one day's investment by the engineering industry.
House builders, particularly in the south-east, would benefit from Labour's
plan to allow councils to use receipts from council house sales to fund new
building. About Pounds 4.5bn of the Pounds 8bn receipts are held by councils
in the south-east. Construction companies should also benefit if Labour
delivers its commitment to fund extra public infrastructure work.
The utilities, spared the threat of renationalisation, could suffer from
tighter regulation. The 'RPI-minus-X' price formula could be tightened and
Labour might cap the rate of return that utilities can earn to curb
'excessive profits'.
This could hurt British Gas and the water and electric companies, but might
benefit big industrial consumers, such as the steel and chemicals
industries, which complain about electricity prices.
Restrictions on takeovers might be a blow to young acquisitive groups such
as Williams Holdings and Tomkins, which aim to follow the likes of Hanson
and BTR by growing big through acquisition. The restrictions might be
welcomed by some of the managers of the smallest quoted companies - the
bottom 60 per cent - which face the highest probability of being taken over.
Life for small takeover targets might become easier.
Small businesses would be most worried by a Labour victory. Labour plans
streamlined advisory services, measures to combat late payment by big
companies, and technology audits. However, small businesses would gain least
from measures such as higher capital allowances and would suffer most from
the cost of a minimum wage, although this may well only become effective
midway through a Labour government.
Many industrialists will privately admit that for a period of up to two
years Labour might be better for their companies - if not for their own
pockets. They claim their real worries are about the long-term change to the
business climate.
They have two concerns. The first is that Labour has not changed, that
leftwingers and unions would gain influence, public spending and borrowing
would let rip, inflation and interest rates would rise as the work ethic
declines and authority slips from managers.
The second, and more realistic, anxiety is that Labour has changed but its
reformed policies would bring a new hazard: business could be burdened by
regulations which would slowly sap entrepreneurial dynamism while Labour's
supply-side policies prove ineffective as a counterbalance.
In this scenario, business could get German-style regulation without the
compensating benefits; German costs without German levels of productivity.
If Labour were installed on a strictly short-term basis to lift
manufacturing out of recession then a significant minority of industry might
vote for it. But Labour wants more than that: it wants a framework for
business modelled on continental Europe as an alternative to the free-market
capitalism of the 1980s. That would require not grudging acquiescence but
enthusiastic co-operation from business.
As business got used to Labour, with European monetary union in prospect,
perhaps the culture would change. But it seems unlikely. As one of Labour's
economic advisers put it: 'The package will work; Labour has changed. The
problem is that British industrialists have not changed and they do not want
to let it work.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Views of a Tory supporter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What would be the greatest risk of a Tory government?
For it to have an insufficient majority to enable it to take the difficult
decisions necessary to make Britain competitive within Europe and other
world markets.
What would be the greatest risk of a Labour government?
The country will rapidly return towards a managed economy, increased public
expenditure, higher taxes and under-managed (or worse, politically managed)
public services.
Has the election campaign addressed the most important issues facing
business?
The main concerns upon which all others hinge is increased taxation and the
diminished confidence and stifled enterprise which a Labour government would
cause.
What should be a government's priority for industry?
Encouragement for industry to invest for the future, based upon downward
pressure on inflation, movement out of recession and an easing of the
interest burden.
Will Britain be a better place to invest under Labour or the Conservatives?
To return to the policies of the 1970s could lead to a loss of confidence
abroad and a gradual withdrawal of foreign investment.
What would be the effect of Labour's plans to restrict takeovers?
Anything that limits proper competition between groups of managers for the
right to manage the limited corporate assets available is against the
interests of consumers, shareholders, employees and in the long term the
community as a whole.
Should Britain have a minimum wage?
No. A minimum wage would push up costs and lead to demanning and further
unemployment.
Are there any attractive features of Labour's industrial policy?
No. A Labour government would reintroduce the failed policies of the past.
Labour's detailed regulations would be a bureaucratic nightmare.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: True colours will take time to show through -
Proposed legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY MAINLY fear the worst. But the first offerings of a Labour government
may be less alarming for Britain's business leaders than they commonly
suppose.
The measures outlined in the shadow Budget aside, the new masters would
probably be so busy creating their promised raft of trusts, agencies and
commissions that they would have little time for anything more radical - at
least in the early days.
The true colours of this new apparatus of government - including technology
trusts, consumer and environmental protection commissions, a defence
diversification agency and others - would in time emerge. But building
quangoes is hardly the stuff of socialism red in tooth and claw.
A few more radical and controversial initiatives are among the party's
priorities for the first full parliamentary session.
These would include implementation of a minimum wage, creation of a national
investment bank, forcing companies which invest less than 0.5 per cent of
their payroll in training to pay the difference between what they do spend
and this level into an in-work training fund, and tougher regulation of
utilities. The party would also opt into the social chapter of the European
treaty as quickly as possible.
But much watering-down has gone on since these measures were first proposed:
The minimum wage would be unlikely to come into effect until next year, with
the original policy formula of half of median male earnings having for the
moment been shelved.
The national investment bank would not engage in direct investment, as
originally suggested, but instead channel private finance into public
projects.
The training contributions from companies failing to invest the stipulated
minimum in their own workforce would not be raised above 0.5 per cent
without extensive consultation with industry.
Revamped regulation of utilities is generally seen as a more acceptable and
cheaper way of asserting public control in the interest of consumers than a
return to majority public ownership.
Even the water industry, described as 'a priority for return to the public
sector' in last year's Opportunity Britain policy document, is an unlikely
candidate for repurchase in the short term.
Other measures that officials would like to cram into a first full
parliamentary session include the following:
Introduction of a 'public interest' test for bids, which would seek to take
into account the impact of any deal on research and development, employment
and regional location. The test would be adjudicated by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The share-ownership threshold - currently 30 per cent -
above which a bid has to be launched would be reduced to an unspecified
level no lower than 15 per cent.
Reorganisation of the Department of Trade and Industry along unspecified
lines but with particular attention to small companies and consumer affairs.
Another high priority would be to beef up the Office of Fair Trading,
strengthening its investigative powers and empowering it to pursue a more
proactive competition policy.
Reforms to industrial relations law and practice, including setting up a new
industrial court, restoring a limited right to take sympathetic industrial
action, and banning employee blacklisting on the basis of trade union
membership. Legislation is planned to prevent the total sequestration of a
trade union's income and assets in a way which paralysed it in its lawful
business. Courts would be stopped from issuing ex parte injunctions to an
employer without the union being able to put its case.
An employees' charter, dovetailing neatly with the rights enshrined in the
EC social chapter, would be implemented.
This would cover equal status for all employees including part-timers, the
minimum wage, health and safety at work, protection against unfair
dismissal, and maternity and paternity leave. Not all of the associated
legislation would necessarily be enacted in one go.
Reform of the motor vehicle taxation system in a fiscally neutral way to
promote efficiency and fewer harmful emissions.
The process of linking arms exports to recipients' human-rights records will
begin with the setting up of a human-rights department within the foreign
office.
Implementation of legislation passed in 1990 which would give creditor
rights to members of wound-up pension funds.
As a first stage of reform, the law would be changed so that pension funds
belonged to their members and not to employers. Employees would make up half
of pension trustees.
The party is keen to push consumer-protection measures on to the EC agenda
during the UK's six-month Community presidency, which starts on July 1.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What would be the greatest risk of a Tory government?
That the recession would continue and they would take no effective steps to
tackle it.
What would be the greatest risk of a Labour government?
Expectations on the part of the electorate might exceed the realistic
possibilities of what can be achieved by government action.
Has the campaign addressed the most important issues facing business?
Because of the concentration on the plight of the economy and the depth of
recession and the concerns regarding the health service, there has been
insufficient attention paid to date to education, training and homelessness.
What should be a government's priority for industry?
The sheer inertia induced in business by the depth and duration of the
recession, aggravated by the unwillingness on the part of the Conservative
government to recognise the problem, makes investment a major priority.
Will Britain be a better place to invest under Labour or the Conservatives?
Further investment depends upon restoration of confidence. Many people do
not believe the policies or indeed lack of policy of the previous government
warrants its re-election. Britain would be better for investment under
Labour because Labour would be more aware of the need to encourage
investment.
What would be the effects of Labour's plans to restrict takeovers?
Labour is broadly in line with that of the European Community. The
distinction is between short-termism and Labour's longer-term view.
Should Britain have a minimum wage?
I do not believe that a minimum wage would have an adverse impact. Our
objective must be to stimulate the economy and a factor in this must be
tackling low pay.
Are there any attractive features of the Conservatives' industrial policy?
It is the sheer absence of an industrial policy which has contributed to the
worst recession that business people in the UK have ever encountered.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Cuts haunt Major's troops in marginals - The
issues: Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTSMOUTH South was once rock-solid Conservative ground. Now it is one of
the Tories' most precarious constituencies, among at least 30 Conservative
marginals hit by defence job losses in the past two years.
At its eastern tip it ends in a cluster of empty navy homes, fenced off with
'MoD Warning - Keep Out' signs. The occupants and neighbouring council
tenants were evacuated last autumn in a contamination scare. Underfoot is
what was known as the 'glory hole' - used by the navy as a tip for asbestos
and other waste.
Just to the west, behind the shingle beach, are the Victorian Eastney
barracks, recently abandoned by the Royal Marines. Beyond that is the
sea-front Tory heartland, backed by a swathe of guest-houses and bedsits. By
contrast, north of the city centre, inland from the naval base, is a scarred
zone of bleak council estates. Tory campaigners tread here at risk of verbal
abuse.
The dominant employer is the navy - 12,000 service personnel in the
Portsmouth area, 5,000 civilian staff.
'As a naval base its future is secure,' Mr Norman Martin, a union official
at the base, admits. Navy cuts will actually mean more activities being
concentrated at Portsmouth. But a question hangs over the future role of its
repair yard, once a major dockyard.
Further afield is a string of defence factories which have been shedding
jobs several hundred at a time, including GEC-Marconi, which has about 5,000
employees in the region. Since 1989, unemployment has doubled to about 10
per cent.
The impact of such cuts on voting intentions is hard to assess. The Tories,
traditionally strong on defence, still believe it is a card they can play
against Labour's perceived 'weakness'.
But in Portsmouth South, as in other constituencies nearby, the direct
challengers are the Liberal Democrats. This is a top target seat for them.
Their candidate Mr Mike Hancock, who heads the city planning committee,
captured it in a by-election in 1984. In 1987 the Conservatives' Mr David
Martin dug him out by just 205 votes.
Mr Hancock, who wants the region to get special assisted status, is counting
on transferred votes from Labour's home-ground. Mr Martin admits that, if
there is large-scale tactical voting, 'it could be a problem'.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are banking on strong interest in
these areas for their proposals to help defence industries move into civil
sectors.
Recent cuts have reduced Rolls-Royce's workforce at Bristol from 8,000 to
6,500. Mr Becker believes that without investment to bring in more civil
business 'there is really no future there'.
Bristol's other main defence producer, British Aerospace's missile division,
has shed more than three quarters of its employees, leaving 800 and hardly
any manufacturing activity.
One of the BAe survivors, Mr Lawrence Elton, says many potential Tory
supporters have become disaffected. 'When you think of the number of people
who've gone down the tubes under a pro-defence Tory government . . . '
According to Mr Paul Dowdall of Bristol Polytechnic's Research Unit in
Defence Economics, nearly half the 10,000 defence jobs lost in the
south-west in the last two years have been in and around Bristol. This
compares with a current total, he estimates, of 15,000-20,000
defence-related jobs, about to be boosted by the transfer of some 5,500
Ministry of Defence procurement staff to Bristol's business park, close to
the Rolls-Royce and BAe works.
Of five Bristol constituencies, three - Bristol North-West, Bristol East and
Kingswood - are Tory marginals, all in the catchment area for these plants.
The most marginal of these is Kingswood. A 3.8 per cent swing would win it
for Labour.
Mr Rob Hayward, who has held this untypical seat for the Conservatives since
1983, sees it being a close result either way. A 'residual consciousness'
about the importance of defence to the region is one factor still in the
Tories' favour, he believes.
Not so, says his Labour opponent, Mr Roger Berry, an economics lecturer.
'Whenever Conservatives talk about defence, people think about job losses,'
he says. Unemployment in the constituency, he says, has risen 160 per cent
in the past two years. He identifies defence employment as a key issue.
In other respects, defence is hardly a prominent issue at all. Differences
between the main parties have shrunk since the last two elections, and the
Liberal Democrats say defence would not be an obstacle to their co-operation
with either Labour or the Conservatives in a hung parliament.
The old clash over Britain's nuclear deterrent is reduced to whether there
should be three or four Trident submarines, and a Labour government might
well decide to build the fourth anyway. Trident is not even mentioned in the
Labour manifesto.
Nor is there mention of a defence review, although the party has said it
would carry out a 're-assessment' in its first six months in office.
Targets for cutting defence funds have become something of a taboo for both
Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Defence savings were a popular theme until
the Conservatives showed how unpopular the results of even their reductions
could be, when they hit regiments or civilian jobs.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories on Idiot Curve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE impossible is now a distinct possibility. Mr Neil Kinnock could march
into No 10 Downing Street on Friday week the undisputed champion of the
election, a temporary uncrowned king needing no support from the Liberal
Democrats, the unchallenged holder of one of the most powerful offices in
the democratic world, Britain's elected dictator for the duration.
Hold hard. I know it could go the other way. The Conservatives could learn
how to do politics. The thought of Mr Kinnock might frighten floating voters
into a last-minute stampede towards the Tories. It is also true that the
polls point unwaveringly towards a hung parliament. That would favour Labour
but might constrain it in office. It is still the most likely result.
Yet it would be unwise to rule out the most stupendous outcome of them all -
a simple majority for Labour. In 1987 and 1988 the thought of such an
upheaval was properly dismissed as fantasy. Labour was hopelessly
discredited. The Conservatives were riding high. When the election came,
Labour would have to capture about 100 seats to win outright. Many of its
target constituencies are in the south-east, the most difficult territory
for Mr Kinnock's party. An unprecedented proportion of the Conservative
electorate would have to be persuaded to change their allegiance.
This ancient conventional wisdom, which I shared at the time, has since been
replaced by a less mechanical theory. What nearly everyone now says is that
there will be no winner, and that in consequence there will have to be a
coalition. Failing that, a second election will follow hard on the heels of
the first. The new supposition has gained credence since 1989. The basis for
this is shown in a special graph, designed by a bank of computers in the
Financial Times laboratory of political science. It is the Idiot Curve. The
x-axis represents rising Tory ineptitude. The y-axis shows an increasing
Labour advantage. The line is currently pointing upwards at a steep angle.
It charts the realisation that even if the psephological arithmetic seems to
make a Labour triumph highly unlikely, the probability of the Conservatives
throwing the entire game away grows every day.
This is why a Conservative overall majority would now be the surprise
outcome. A mere 50 seats down, and they lose their supreme command of the
commons. They have worked hard to lose those 50 seats. It has required a
long and laborious climb up the Idiot Curve. They invented the poll tax,
then messily discarded it at the cost of 2 1/2 p more VAT. They encouraged
the aspiring classes - their own voters - to mortgage themselves beyond
their reasonable means. They lowered taxes and deregulated, stoking a boom,
and were in consequence obliged to raise interest rates, busting it. This
destroyed the housing market and faced their loyal supporters with the
threat of eviction. They kept Mrs Margaret Thatcher on as prime minister for
at least a year longer than was wise, as I suspect her old adviser, Lord
Whitelaw, would agree.
All of this landed Mr John Major with the task of preventing Labour from
winning and a maximum of 18 months in which to do it. He was an interesting
choice as antidote to Mrs Thatcher. I thought he might do the trick. Yet his
many attractive qualities have obscured the central fact about his political
abilities: that he is deficient in both experience and sheer horsepower.
That explains why he mistimed the election, persevered with the politically
deadly (although otherwise sound) reforms of the National Health Service,
chose as party chairman a man with a marginal seat to defend, and appointed
Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor. He climbed that Idiot Curve like a squirrel
after nuts. All the Conservatives need to do is keep climbing for 10 more
days and General Kinnock will enjoy a walkover.
It need not be that way. There is no national desire to see the Labour
leader become prime minister. But if the Conservatives are to pull back
Labour's lead in the short time available they should learn campaigning from
the experts - the Labour party. One small example: the Kinnock platform
always flaunts the slogan 'it's time for change; it's time for Labour', or a
part of it. The leader's speeches almost invariably end with the same
assertions. The ordinary rules of advertising prevail. As to the Tory slogan
 -do you know what it is?
Mr Major, or his party chairman Mr Chris Patten, should select one and stick
to it. If desperate, they could settle on 'you can't trust Labour'. It could
shift the focus to Mr Kinnock this week. He acknowledged in his TV interview
with Mr Walden yesterday that under his governance public-sector pay would
be indexed to private earnings. Labour is already committed to indexing
social payments to earnings or prices, whichever rises faster. These are
immense commitments but the Conservatives' attack on Labour economics is not
focused. It strays from hyperbole to absurdity. The Tories' tacticians will
have to do much better than that if Labour is to be turned back. Failing
such an improvement, Mr Kinnock's dream will come true.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: To the rescue - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Patten, the tired-looking Tory chairman, may be safe in his marginal
seat of Bath after all. The Labour candidate, Pam Richards, social worker
and local councillor, is coming to his rescue.
Labour won only 5,507 votes last time, way behind the Tories and the Social
Democratic party who came within about 1,400 of Patten's vote. Richards,
however, is splitting the anti-Tory vote.
At a meeting for all seven candidates on Friday, Richards tore into
Conservative policies on health, education and the economy. Although the
audience had been carefully selected to provide rough balance between
supporters of rival parties, she was rewarded with a 20 second ovation at
the end, against only 10 seconds for Patten.
The real loser was Don Foster, the Liberal Democratic candidate, who said
Richards' vociferous support was due to the fact that she had given her
chief canvassers the evening off to allow them to cheer her on. Most Liberal
Democrat activists were hard at work knocking on doors.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Surge in Lib Dem support foreseen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASE in support for the Liberal Democrats recorded in the weekend
opinion polls was being noted on the doorsteps in several marginal
north-west constituencies earlier last week.
It was particularly prevalent among former Tory supporters and appeared to
have been boosted by the row over Labour's broadcast on the National Health
Service.
The switch in voting intentions was said to be in reaction to the depth of
the recession and what is perceived as the extremes of the two main parties.
These voters see nothing wrong with the idea of politicians being forced to
work together in a hung parliament.
In Pendle, Hyndburn, the two Bolton seats, Bury and Davyhulme, it was
difficult to find people who had voted Conservative in 1987 ready to admit
that they would switch to Labour. Their chosen halfway house was Liberal
Democrat - in a few cases because of the positive aspects of that party's
policies, but more often due to unwillingness to identify with either Labour
or Conservative.
The area was already fertile ground. One of the most commonly heard
arguments in urban north-west constituencies is that all the parties should
work together for the greater good. In Scotland an opinion poll by Mori for
the Sunday Times confirmed Labour's strong lead, putting it on 42 per cent
(down one point from a week ago). The Scottish National party was on 27 per
cent (unchanged), the Conservatives on 20 per cent (unchanged) and the
Liberal Democrats on 10 per cent (up one point). The findings are roughly in
line with other Scottish opinion polls, except that Mori puts the Tories two
points lower than other polls last week.

THE DRIZZLE is turning to a downpour in Derby. About 60 mostly elderly
voters have forsaken television's Inspector Morse to sit on red plastic
chairs at Murray Park Community School.
Before them, Michael Meacher, Labour's social security spokesman, is hurling
hatred at the government. His subject is the poor. Tall and dark-haired, his
slight lisp makes him appear to spit as he vents anger. He is regarded as
among the most leftwing of Labour's shadow cabinet. He is not telegenic or
lovable; he is too much the old fashioned socialist to be given a high
profile by national strategists.
'From the scale of greed, of selfishness and materialism for which the
Tories stand, these people have drawn a blank,' he says. The ending of the
earnings link for state pensions? 'Frankly it puts the Maxwell robberies
into a kind of kid's play.'
He derides as a 'searing indictment' the lot of those on income support. 'It
is now for them a more spartan regime than it is in prison,' he says. 'I'm
sick and tired of hearing people on six-figure salaries saying there isn't
the money to help those who spend in a year what they spend in a week.'
The audience listens politely. Beside Meacher sits Margaret Beckett, Labour
candidate in Derby South and the serenely tough shadow chief secretary to
the Treasury.
Her effect is to control what Meacher says. He jokes about being 'squeaky
clean' in his spending pledges. It is like a Howitzer firing blanks.
Other flammable socialists in the shadow cabinet have been sidelined. Frank
Dobson, energy spokesman, is scarcely seen on television.
Transport spokesman John Prescott's bilious contempt of the government has
been re-directed. He promises new schemes but says the finance will come
from the private sector.
A reporter at a press conference asks if this is the future of socialism?
'I've no worry about socialism getting its money from wherever it comes,'
pants Prescott.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Japanese by-election gives boost to LDP
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday won two parliamentary
seats in a hard-fought by-election contest in Gunma Prefecture, a rural
constituency to the north-west of Tokyo.
The LDP's victory in the lower-house by-election comes after two consecutive
losses in by-elections for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) earlier
this year. Those losses were sharp setbacks for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, and his scandal-ridden gov-ernment.
The by-elections are an important barometer of voter sentiment ahead of
elections in July for the upper house. Many observers had all but written
off the LDP's chances of regaining its majority in the upper house.
Preliminary results last night put the two LDP candidates ahead by a
convincing margin.
It was the turn of the Socialists, the largest opposition party, for
embarrassment. The party has also been plagued by scandal recently and
voters vented their anger against Mrs Toshie Sunaga, widow of the former
representative from the district.
The LDP victory boosts by a single vote the party's majority in the lower
house of the diet (parliament).
More importantly, it could serve to raise morale in advance of the upper
house elections. The LDP's inability to command a majority in the upper
house has made it more difficult to push through controversial legislation.
Mr Miyazawa's popularity has dropped steadily since he took office last
November. A poll published last week put his approval rating at just 26.5
per cent, compared to 55.7 per cent four months ago.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Kashmiri police set to block militants' march
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of police and para-military troops were on alert yesterday in the
state capital, Muzaffarabad, in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, as security
was tightened ahead of a today's planned march by militants to cross a
disputed border with India.
The authorities intensified their search for the march leaders at the
weekend and cut some telephone links. A special law was introduced
prohibiting public gatherings of more than four people.
While militants vowed to press ahead with the march, government officials
were confident the turnout would be low. During a similar march last month
at least a dozen people were killed and many were injured after police
charged at demonstrators trying to reach the border.
A similar march is planned by militants from the Indian side of Kashmir in
an effort to cross the border into Pakistan, but officials believe the heavy
presence of Indian troops is unlikely to allow that.
Meanwhile representatives of the militants said they were concerned that the
turnout would be low due to the Islamic fasting month of Ramadhan.
Moreover, a goverment crackdown since last Wednesday has forced many of the
march's leaders to go into hiding. Mr Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the leading organisation which called the
march, is still in detention at a unknown location in Pakistan since his
arrest last week.
The prime minister of Pakistani-ruled Kashmir, Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan,
said that none of the militant leaders would be allowed to leave
Muzaffarabad. Militants leaving other cities to go to the border would also
be stopped, he added.
Mr Qayyum defended his goverment's position on the Kashmiri right to
self-determination leading to accession with Pakistan. He said: 'The
overwhelming majority of Kashmiris want accession to Pakistan. Our lifeline
depends on Pakistan.'
This has emerged as one of the most controversial differences between the
JKLF and the position adopted by the government of Pakistan and Kashmir.
A day earlier Mr Rajaz Muzaffar, acting head of the JKLF, who plans to lead
today's march, said: 'In Indian-held Kashmir, Mr Saxena, the governor, has
pronounced that he will stop the march of the JKLF. In Muzaffarabad Abdul
Qayyum has announced the same. What is the difference between Saxena and
Abdul Qayyum?'
India and Pakistan have fought three wars on the disputed division of
Kashmir and most observers fear that there could be another conflict as long
as the dispute remains unresolved. Pakistan claims that the state should
have been allowed to join it at the time of independence from Britain in
1947, whereas India rejects that position.
Pakistan has traditionally favoured a plebiscite for the Kashmiri people,
giving them the choice to join India or Pakistan. As the region has a Moslem
majority, Pakistani authorities are convinced the choice would favour
Pakistan.
But that stand is at odds with the position adopted by the JKLF militants.
They demand a 'third option' - the right to become independent, without
being tied to either India or Pakistan.
While their view is officially rejected by the government, it is finding
gradually getting some recognition.
Ms Shireen Mazari, a leading defence studies expert, says: 'The issue of an
independent Kashmir has to be thought about,' adding: 'Whether we like it or
not, that is very much a demand coming from certain quarters who are after
all fighting the Indian forces.'
The government is also concerned that restraining the march would make it
difficult for it to maintain a public image of criticising human rights
violations in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

THE REFORMIST wing within Romania's ruling party, the National Salvation
Front (NSF), won an important political victory this weekend with the
re-election of Mr Petre Roman as party leader.
Nearly two-thirds of delegates meeting in Bucharest for the party's annual
convention voted in favour of Mr Roman and adopted his motion: 'The future -
today.' The document, which espouses a western European-style social
democracy, will form the basis of the party's political platform.
Addressing the delegates, Mr Roman said: 'Today the party won because we
showed we had a clear political line. This can lead us to victory in the
election.'
His supporters expressed relief that 'neo-Communists' no longer dominated
the party.
Mr Roman's re-election follows several weeks of open dispute in the NSF
between his supporters and those favouring Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's
president. President Iliescu, one of the party's founders, is associated
with the NSF's more reactionary faction.

FT  30 MAR 92 / The European Market: France seeks a cure for drug subsidies
 -The Glaxo controversy is an important test case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE governments across Europe, the French administration is fighting to
curb the amount it spends every year on subsidising its citizens'
consumption of pills and potions.
In the latest round in this battle, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, France's social
affairs minister, has just locked horns with Glaxo, one of Europe's largest
and most aggressive drugs companies.
Mr Bianco has asked an independent panel to report by mid-May on the
ethical, legal and medical acceptability of Glaxo's heavy promotion of
Imigran, a migraine treatment which has not yet got government approval for
sale in France. Glaxo says its negotiations with the government are also
stalled on price, where the UK company is insisting that it must be allowed
to charge the same in France as elsewhere in Europe.
This is an important test case, say officials. The results will signal to
other drug companies the government's thinking on how they market their new
products in one of Europe's fastest growing and highest volume markets,
despite the government's efforts to reduce its drugs bill.
Angered by the government's toughness, Glaxo insists that it is acting
properly and has already threatened to reconsider its French investments, as
has Merck, Sharpe and Dohme, the US pharmaceuticals giant.
Politically, Glaxo has taken on the government at the worst moment. Mr
Bianco is in no mood to compromise, just as the spring session of
parliament, which opens on April 2, is due to give the final reading to
wide-ranging reforms to cut drug companies' spending on promotion, in favour
of research and development, and to reduce needless consumption of
medicines. It is also an important part of the government's attempt to keep
its social security deficit under control, down to a forecast FFr2.2bn
(Pounds 226m) this year after a FFr15bn in 1991.
Imigran is a high priced drug, with a potential market of more than FFr1bn
in France alone and Dollars 10bn worldwide, say analysts. It has already won
approval in several other European markets, including Britain and the
Netherlands.
But Mr Bianco's experts are not convinced that Imigran is worth the money,
or that it is as effective as rival products. Accordingly, he is nettled at
what he sees as Glaxo's attempt to whip up patient demand before he has made
up his mind.
The outcome will be watched by the European pharmaceuticals industry
generally. Glaxo's prices have already run into trouble with the Danish
government, which has asked the European Commission to examine whether it is
illicitly abusing a dominant market position. Now its marketing methods are
under scrutiny too.
For Glaxo, the stakes are high. It needs to prove to investors that it has
successors to its Zantac ulcer drug, the world's best selling
pharmaceutical, which accounts for nearly half of Glaxo's sales but faces
slowing growth. It also needs to resist pressure to reduce prices for its
innovative drugs in France, so as to avoid the risk of having to compete
against cheap parallel imports to Britain.
The stakes are high for the industry. Drugs' companies across Europe face
the challenge of making enough profit to cover the rising research bills
needed to keep up with the fast pace of innovation. Accordingly, the prices
they are allowed to charge by governments, which - as in France - are often
also the drug companies' main customers, are crucial. So are the permitted
methods of promotion.
France is an especially sensitive case. For its citizens swallow more
medicine than most other Europeans; Dollars 136 worth per head annually as
against the average Briton's Dollars 65, according to a recent survey. It is
unlikely that they end up twice as healthy, One factor is the government's
traditional but changing policy of keeping prices relatively low, so that
spending on medicines is growing at 10 per cent annually.
Another may be the intense competition for patients in an overcrowded
medical profession. 'A popular doctor is one who is liberal with his
prescriptions, who knows all the latest drugs and gives large supplies of
them,' explains Mr Theodore Zeldin in his book The French. Many general
practitioners confess they do not know what ails three quarters of their
patients, but they prescribe lots of drugs to show they have something to
say, he argues. The armfuls of medicines showered on my own family bear him
out.
So the government has seized on what is as much an issue of national
behaviour as budget management. It is trying to curb needless spending on
medicines on two fronts.
Firstly, the bill before this coming parliamentary session will tighten up
the price fixing regime and could lead to higher prices for some products.
A new national medical agency will decide prices across the whole range of a
group's products, rather than by individual drug as before. Companies with
high research budgets - spent in France - will be allowed to charge more to
help recoup those costs.
The second front on which the government is acting is in its dealings with
individual companies. Here Glaxo is not the only one to have come under the
spotlight.
Lipha, the French arm of E. Merck of Germany, is smarting after having been
told by the government last week it must abandon a joint marketing agreement
with Pfizer of the US, for Amlodipine, a treatment for hypertension.
Foreign owned companies privately complain that the government is
discriminating in favour of French producers. But even the French
phramaceuticals industry association, Snip, is worried.
Mr Bernard Mesure, Snip's president, fears the pharmaceutical bill's attempt
to limit the growth of reimbursable drugs will hold back his industry's
development, as will the blockage on joint marketing. He warns: 'If
collaboration is prevented, we will have no chance of catching up our
foreign competitors and France could simply become an area for the
distribution of imported medicines.' The government appears to have decided
to put the nation's financial and physical health first.

<TEXT>
THREE PEOPLE people were killed yesterday in Bosnia-Hercegovina despite a
truce called by leaders of the central Yugoslav republic, amid fears that
the fighting would engulf Bosnia's ethnically mixed population of 4.4m.
The ceasefire reached at the weekend by members of the republic's collective
presidency calls for a buffer zone of about 500 yards to divide the warring
sides in Bosanski Brod, northern Bosnia.
A joint commission comprising Moslems, Serbs and Croats - Bosnia's three
main ethnic groups - as well as police and European Community monitors will
arrive today to monitor the truce.
Dozens of people have been killed over the past week in mortar, artillery
and gunbattles in and around Bosanski Brod. Both sides yesterday expressed
doubts that the ceasefire would take hold.
Mr Anton Kljajic, a spokesman from the emergency council of Bosanski Brod,
said by telephone yesterday that Serb snipers shot dead a Croat man and a
Moslem man. Serbian media said one Serb was killed and several wounded in
fresh clashes in a nearby village.
Each side has accused the other of launching the attacks in incidents which
could not be independently confirmed.
Croatian and Serbian media also accuse each other of deploying tanks and
massing forces around Bosanski Brod, whose population of 34,000 is 41 per
cent Croat, 34 per cent Serb and 12 per cent Moslem.
The Serb-controlled federal army, which says it is remaining neutral in the
conflict, at the weekend warned that it would retaliate if Croat forces
continue to attack Bosnia. 'The army will be forced to react decisively to
any form of armed threat on the citizens and on their units,' an army
statement said.
Thousands of Croats and Serbs are fleeing Bosanski Brod and other ethnically
mixed towns in Bosnia. Long queues of people yesterday in Bosanski Brod
carrying blankets, pots and pans jammed the bridge over the River Sava,
which marks Bosnia's northern frontier with Croatia.
The emergency council has issued an order banning men aged 18-55 from
leaving the town.
Serbian media in Zvornik, 65 miles southeast of Bosanski Brod, at the
weekend appealed for Serbs to remain in the town after reports that Moslem
police had seized the local police station.
The fighting in Bosnia has sharply escalated since the begining of the month
and will most likely hamper European Community-brokered peace talks.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Kravchuk adopts mantle of economic reform: Capitalism creeps
into Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shops of Kiev, Ukraine's capital, are undergoing a quiet metamorphosis.
Take the Hastronom Podil, in the heart of the old city. Beautifully packaged
Austrian jams, juices and cakes are on sale alongside locally produced jugs
of discoloured vegetables topped with lard. These new goods can be bought
with coupons, the Ukrainian quasi-currency which is scheduled to entirely
replace roubles next month.
Creeping capitalism at the consumer level received a boost last week, when,
for the first time, economic reform was pushed to the top of the Ukrainian
political agenda. A fierce debate in a closed session of parliament obscured
more than it revealed of the details of Ukraine's reform programme, but it
had one important result. After nearly four months of official lethargy, the
Ukrainian government, led by President Leonid Kravchuk, is now publicly
committed to formulating an independent economic reform plan.
'The president has become a new man,' said Mr Oleksandr Iemelianov, the
architect of the economic programme discussed last week. 'He supports
radical economic reform.'
Observers at least week's parliamentary session said the president
threatened to replace foot-dragging cabinet ministers and overrule the
parliament if it sought to block reform.
The overall theme of Mr Iemelianov's programme is, in his own words, the
realisation that 'apart from our flag and our trident, our independence is
nothing. Although the centre no longer gives us orders, today the chief
commandant has become the rouble.'
Ukraine, like all of the former Soviet republics, is struggling to find a
way to transform its state-dominated economy.
But everything in the economic reform package is contested and ambiguous. Mr
Iemelianov's draft reforms were criticised at home as anti-market. He has
since fleshed out the package in response to this criticism.
His latest proposals, which he hopes the president will sign today or
tomorrow, call for rapid privatisation, a sharp reduction in the budget
deficit, and tightening of government lending policies, further
liberalisation of prices and the complete replacement of the rouble with the
coupon - and all of this by the end of April.
In an unsigned policy paper, New Ukraine, a liberal political grouping with
ambitions to spearhead Ukraine's economic reform, makes three key criticisms
of the Iemelianov plan.
First, it argues that Ukrainian banks are technically unprepared for the
introduction of the coupon as the sole currency in the republic. Second, it
charges that the rapid pace of privatisation proposed by Mr Iemelianov would
allow the ex-Communist apparatchiks to grab the best property. Third, they
argue for co-operation with Russia, Ukraine's main trading partner, as
opposed to Mr Iemelianov's go-it-alone course.
Any market obstacles to implementing the reforms are compounded by a bitter
power struggle in the Ukrainian leadership.
But fighting in the cabinet 'shows that the political will for reform has
finally developed,' according to Mr Bohdan Krawchenko, a western adviser to
the government. 'I hope that when the dust settles, Ukraine will have a
real, viable reform plan and a team able to implement it.'

THE government of Moldova has declared a nationwide state of emergency to
try to bring to heel an enclave of Russians and Ukrainians who have declared
independence.
Mr Igor Smirnov, president of the self-proclaimed Trans-Dnestr republic,
immediately responded by declaring a 10pm to 6am curfew and called on his
forces, which include Cossack mercenaries, to prepare for an attack.
The state of emergency, declared at the weekend, provides for direct
presidential rule through special local committees and empowers police and
fledgling army units to take all necessary measures to disband and disarm
illegal armies.
Ms Alina Demakova, a spokeswoman for the Trans-Dnestr government, said
Moldova was 'not yet ready for a fullout attack but was readying forces for
one.' She said the Moldovan government planned decisive action within 48
hours.
The Russian foreign ministry appealed to all parties to 'act in accordance
with international law', avoid further bloodshed and show respect for
minorities.
Forty people have died in clashes between Moldovan and Trans-Dnestr forces
over the past month. Ms Demakova said Trans-Dnestr was quiet yesterday
although two of its guardsmen had been injured in overnight skirmishes.
Moldova's Popular Front, the opposition movement which wants reunification
with Romania, expressed puzzlement at President Mircea Snegur's announcement
of a state of emergency.
Ms Natalya Paskal, a Front spokeswoman, said she suspected the declaration
could prove as ineffectual as a government ultimatum issued two weeks ago
demanding that the Trans-Dnestr forces lay down their arms.
But she noted that it had come just in time to ban rallies planned by the
Front yesterday to support the goal of reunification with Romania. The
Trans-Dnestr republic, a sliver of industrialised territory on the left bank
of the Dnestr River, does not want to live under Romanian rule and has also
rejected legislation to make Romanian the republic's official language.
Ms Demakova, said the Russians and Ukrainians were prepared to remain part
of Moldova if it was turned into a federal state but she said the
government's refusal to accept such an arrangement meant it was heading
towards unification with Romania.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Lombard warrior sets out to slay giants: A populist party is
upsetting Italy's traditional voting pattern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MESSAGE of the Lombard League is brash and combative.
The populist movement, certain to disrupt the traditional voting pattern in
northern Italy in the April 5 general elections, has chosen as its symbol a
12th century Lombard warrior brandishing a sword. Every poster mixes demands
for autonomy with defiance of the Christian Democrat-led government in Rome.
'They are all ruffians in Rome,' says Mr Luigi Moretti, one of the League's
two Euro-MPs and secretary for the Bergamo region. 'We want to make the
Christian Democrats die of fright in these elections,' he adds, echoing the
bellicose contempt of the Italian political establishment shown by the
league's leader, Mr Umberto Bossi.
In an office above a pizzeria in Bergamo inaugurated a year ago, Mr Moretti
and a small group of volunteers are preparing to deliver a shock to the
Christian Democrats who have long dominated this rich northern industrial
city. Volunteers such as Mr Francesco Bruletti, a marketing executive, have
taken a month's leave to work free for the league.
The Bergamo office operates on a shoe-string budget, supplied by
contributions and subscriptions from 12,000 local members each paying
L70,000 (Pounds 32.50) a year. 'The local media ignore us and we can afford
little publicity. We have to rely on word of mouth and our message,' says Mr
Bruletti. 'But we are well organised and confident of our support. This is
not a movement dreamed up by university graduates - it comes from ordinary
people.'
Most of the activitists like Mr Bruletti have never been involved in
politics before. They are fed up with being ruled by a distant, incompetent
state apparatus from Rome which ignores local needs.
In Bergamo in the 1990 regional elections the league became the second
largest party, with 26 per cent of the vote against the Christian Democrats'
39 per cent. Officials have set their sights on rivalling, if not
overtaking, the Christian Democrats in next week's general elections. The
movement just squeezed ahead of the Christian Democrats last year in
municipal elections in neighbouring Brescia.
Throughout Italy's hard-working northern industrial belt in cities like
Bergamo the League has emerged as a big new force and is certain to remove
votes not just from the Christian Democrats but across the traditional party
spectrum. Nationwide, it could get 10 per cent of the vote.
Although Mr Bossi, the League's 50-year-old leader, is being ignored by the
national media, his abrasive, emotional speeches decrying corruption of the
traditional parties and demanding greater regional autonomy have struck a
chord among workers, the professional classes and small businessmen.
The league has even formed its own employers' organisation and its own union
(the Milan taxi drivers are members en bloc and provide free one of their
number as Mr Bossi's chauffeur).
Typical of Mr Bossi is a comment in a written interview for the FT. 'The
league has threatened a campaign of non-payment of taxes to show the state
that those producing the nation's wealth are exasperated: that they will no
longer agree to work for a political class which sustains its absolute power
enriching and swelling the numbers of its clientele; that they will no
longer work for a free-spending state which survives by devouring its own
citizens like Saturn devouring his children.'
The son of a textile worker who moved from a small northern town near Varese
to Milan, Mr Bossi, like many of his generation, was the first to experience
higher education and grow up with the industrialisation of the north. A poor
student, he gravitated into local politics formally founding the 'Autonomist
Lombard League' in 1984. On this ticket he was elected a senator for Varese
in the 1987 general elections.
The initial stamp of the league was distinctly 'autonomist' with a platform
of demands having parallels with that of the Scottish Nationalists' calls
for greater independence from parliament in Westminster.
Mr Bossi encouraged the formation of 'autonomist' leagues in other regions
of the North - in Emiglia Romagna, Liguria, Piedmont, Tuscany and the
Veneto. Together in February 1990 these formed with Lombardy the Northern
League as a federal movement, and subsequently leagues have been added
covering central Italy and the south.
Thus while the movement is popularly referred to as the Lombard League it
consists of a number of associated autonomist groupings headed by Mr Bossi.
He is proposing a radical constitutional shake-up of Italy into three blocks
 -the North, Centre and South. 'The league wants a federal constitution with
a central parliament that co-ordinates the activities of the parliaments of
the three (blocks) which have a degree of autonomy which will be modelled on
the experience of the Swiss, American and German models. . . to avoid the
current damaging experience of centralism.'
The essential aim is to ensure that northern savings cease to finance the
nation's huge public sector deficit, much of which goes on ill-controlled
transfers to the south.
Its most seductive slogan is 'further from Rome and closer to Europe'. This
underlines Mr Bossi's threat to found a republic of the north, linked to
Europe but separate from the rest of Italy, if the Rome politicians fail to
reform their ways.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Bundesbank call for tight money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY must continue its efforts to reduce inflation to put its own house
in order before European monetary union (Emu), according to Mr Otmar Issing,
one of the five top directors of the German Bundesbank.
Reiterating the central bank's commitment to tight monetary conditions, Mr
Issing said its policy, including last December's half-point rise in
interest rates, was in line with the need to ensure that Emu began under the
right conditions at the end of this decade.
German efforts to curb inflation - now well over 4 per cent - and keep its
currency stable despite weaker economic performance and rising public sector
deficits caused by unification were important because of the D-Mark's anchor
role in the EC.
'The European central bank will start afresh,' he said, 'so it is important
that it begins in a stable environment.' Countries taking part in Emu will
have to achieve a high degree of economic convergence. 'This can't be
achieved if the D-Mark is weak and German inflation is at 4 per cent.'
The Bundesbank has warned ceaselessly about rising inflation, high wage
settlements, and unchecked state spending in west Germany at a time of big
transfer payments to the east. Latest money supply figures also show that
the bank's target for 1992 is being exceeded by a wide margin.
Mr Issing expects German inflation to fall clearly below 4 per cent by the
year-end, and possibly below 3 per cent. But it would still be above 4 per
cent in the next month or so, which was unfortunate in view of the wage
negotiations.
This year's wage trends would have a strong influence on the economy, Mr
Issing said. The gradual economic decline after the strong first quarter of
1991 should bottom out later this year with a renewed upturn in 1993, helped
by recovery in the US. 'The real economic basis for wage rises has become
decisively smaller.'
Mr Issing said it was too early to tell when December's policy moves,
bringing the Lombard rate up to 9.75 per cent and the discount rate to 8 per
cent, would brake money supply expansion. But he indicated that these rates
would not be cut for some time in view of present monetary growth. 'It's
like a big tanker,' he said of the money supply. 'If it's on the wrong
course, it takes time to correct this.'
M3 grew at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent in February against the target of
3.5-5.5 per cent. 'We have to wait and see when this flattens out.'
If wages rose too much, the resulting economic weakness could dampen money
supply growth. The scope for easing rates would thus depend on how the
economy developed.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Intel files patent suit to block Cyrix challenge
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the largest US semiconductor maker, has pre-empted another challenge
to its dominance of the market for personal computer microprocessors. It has
filed a patent infringement suit against Cyrix, a small Texas company, that
is today announcing its own version of one of Intel's widely-used
microprocessors.
Anticipation of the Cyrix announcement fuelled a sharp decline in Intel's
stock price last week.
Even before seeing the Cyrix chip, Intel filed a suit charging Cyrix with
infringing four patents that protect Intel's microprocessor technology.
Intel said that its claims were based on information gleaned from financial
analysts' comments.
'We do not believe that it is possible to produce a chip that is compatible
with our 386 microprocessor without infringing our patents,' said Mr Thomas
Dunlap, Intel general counsel. Intel is seeking a preliminary injunction to
prevent Cyrix from selling its microprocessor chip.
Until last year, Intel held a virtual monopoly in the market for the
microprocessors that form the brains of IBM-compatible personal computers.
Then Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Chips &amp; Technologies, two Silicon
Valley competitors, entered the field with their own versions of the Intel
386.
Intel has filed suit against all of its would-be competitors, but has yet to
win an injunction to prevent them from selling the look-alike chips.
AMD, the first to enter the microprocessor clone market, is now estimated to
hold a 30 per cent market share.
Intel is also already involved in a legal dispute with Cyrix over the Texas
company's earlier product, a version of Intel's 387 co-processor, a device
that works alongside the 386 to speed mathematical calculations.
On Saturday, Mr Jerry Rogers, president of Cyrix, when informed of the new
Intel suit, said that the action represented a 'frivolous lawsuit that
amounts to legal harassment'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Percival Patterson, a 57-year-old, London-trained lawyer, will be sworn
in today as the prime minister of Jamaica, succeeding Mr Michael Manley, who
retired on Saturday because of ill health.
Mr Manley's retirement took effect soon after the ruling People's National
party elected Mr Patterson as its president, giving him a margin of four
votes to every one in support of the only other contender, Miss Portia
Simpson, the labour and welfare minister. Miss Simpson had support in the
rural and inner-city areas, with Mr Patterson being backed by the
parliamentary party and the island's business community.
After his victory became clear, Miss Simpson claimed there had been
irregularities in the voting, but said she would respect the result 'in the
interest of the party and the country'. In accepting his election to the
presidency of the PNP, Mr Patterson invited supporters of both factions to
unite under his leadership.
The impact of the row on the unity of the government will be reflected in
the composition of the cabinet Mr Patterson names this week. Mr Hugh Small,
finance minister, who supported Miss Simpson's candidature, said he doubted
he would be appointed to Mr Patterson's new cabinet.
The new prime minister has held several portfolios over the past 20 years,
but left the cabinet under a cloud in January following allegations that, as
finance minister, he had erred in granting a waiver of import duties to the
local subsidiary of an oil company, headed by a member of the PNP executive.
He had come under intense pressure from factions in the ruling party and
opposition, and from the public, to resign, and was omitted from the cabinet
in a reshuffle by Mr Manley on New Year's Day.
His first big task will be to bring some stability to the economy.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (22): The
price of a good reputation - A series of big US claims have hit Lloyd's hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY has Lloyd's attracted in recent months the intense scrutiny of
authorities as diverse as insurance regulators, Congressional subcommittees,
the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and the FBI?
Lloyd's share of the US market is modest in volume terms. Including
reinsurance, the US contributed about Dollars 3.7bn to its global premium
income in 1990, while its domestic nonlife premium income was worth Dollars
265bn in 1989, about half the total for the whole world.
In the same year, the US ceded Dollars 8.9bn worth of net reinsurance
premiums abroad, according to Department of Commerce statistics. Lloyd's
takes about 1.35 per cent of all US non-life and reinsurance business, while
the 15 largest US insurers each takes a greater share than that of the
primary non-life market alone.
The question is not one of quantity, however, but of quality. Lloyd's only
operates as if it were a local US insurer in Illinois and Kentucky, but is
authorised to insure surplus lines - cover which cannot be obtained from an
insurer authorised in the state - everywhere except Kentucky and may write
reinsurance in all states except Kansas.
Cover taken out with Lloyd's syndicates is often high profile business -
from the Golden Gate Bridge on the West Coast to New York's Verrazano
Narrows Bridge on the East. Many Fortune 500 companies have insurance links
with Lloyd's which date back to at least the 1920s, and it is a major
provider of cover for US airlines and shipping.
The flexibility of the Lloyd's market in insuring new, unusual or
specialised risks is also heavily used. Syndicates at Lloyd's cover the
thoroughbreds of Kentucky racing stables and of American Football teams such
as the Cleveland Browns. It led the cancellation cover for the Los Angeles
Olympics and the National Collegiate Basketball Championships. It insures
NASA space launches and nuclear power stations.
Lloyd's is the leading provider of the insurance cover which US banks must
have by law. Lawyers, accountants and other professionals look to Lloyd's
for their professional liability insurance, and Lloyd's is one of the few
markets still prepared to accept US medical malpractice risks on a large
scale, which most US reinsurers will not.
In addition, most major US property insurers take out some protection
against natural catastrophe at Lloyd's.
Given the publicity, most of it bad, which has surrounded Lloyd's over the
past year, concern about Lloyd's ability to meet its commitments is
understandable. Perhaps it is no longer enough for it to point out that its
underwriters have never failed to meet a legitimate claim, or that its US
and other dollar-denominated business is secured by a Trust Fund in New York
worth Dollars 8bn, or that as most of this is invested in US Treasury Bonds
Lloyd's is one of the largest private lenders to the US government.
Despite its long relationship with the US market, Lloyd's as an institution
is still not well understood outside the insurance industry, however.
Lloyd's has its own reasons to be concerned. In 1990, it drew 32 per cent of
total premium inflow to the market from the' US, the second most important
single source after the UK itself although it represents a decline from the
mid-1980s when the proportion was closer to half. In addition, US names
provide about 10 per cent of underwriting capacity.
Unfortunately, the US has also been responsible for many of the major losses
which have periodically caused the market problems. When it made an overall
loss in the mid-1960s, the trigger was Hurricane Betsy. In the 1970s, the
largest losses were caused by insuring US computer leasing companies.
This year Lloyd's will report the losses on the 1989 account, the worst in
its history. The main factor will have been Hurricane Hugo, which cost
insurers over Dollars 4bn and Lloyd's over Dollars 1.5bn. In the same year,
the San Francisco earthquake cost Dollars 1bn, with Lloyd's share close to
15 per cent, and it also met part of the bill for a Dollars 1bn explosion at
a petrochemical plant in Texas, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Lloyd's overall 1988 loss - the first since Betsy - was largely due to an
extra contribution of Dollars 575m on old policy years. Asbestos- and
pollution-exposed risks also caused the losses which led to the most
high-profile legal action by names against their agents at Lloyd's, the
well-publicised Outhwaite case.
In 1906, the innovative underwriter Cuthbert Heath ordered claims from the
San Francisco Earthquake to be paid even if the paperwork was not completely
in order, and so laid the foundation of Lloyd's reputation and business
expansion in the US.
In 1981, again in pursuit of customer loyalty, leading Lloyd's underwriters
signed the so-called White Paper memorandum with leading US brokers,
agreeing to treat reinsurance policies which they had written to cover US
primary insurers of asbestos-exposed policies as if they became operative
when an overall level of loss had been reached from a series of claims
rather than a single loss.
In hindsight, it was the first step in what Lloyd's deputy chairman Richard
HazeIl now describes as 'in a way, the biggest catastrophe that has ever hit
the insurance industry'.
David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said last year that the market had
'always sought to take America as we find it, whether we like what we find
or not, and adapt as we can'.
That attitude may not last forever. However difficult, Lloyd's might just
possibly find it easier to adjust to life without US business than US
business would adjust to life without Lloyd's and the deep pocket its names
have come to represent.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (23): A
promising opportunity - The EC Single Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE approaching single market is both an opportunity and threat for European
insurers. There seems little doubt, though, that Lloyd's, which specialises
in large non-life risks, ought to gain handsomely from Brussels' efforts to
break down national barriers.
As Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, observed recently in a speech to
Greek practitioners: 'When it (the third non-life insurance directive) comes
into force, the insurance markets of Europe will have undergone a
revolutionary transformation within a relatively short space of time. EC
insurers will be free to transact non-life insurance business in any of the
member states, and regulation will be administered by the insurers' home (as
opposed to host country) authority.'
The so called third 'framework' directive to which Mr Coleridge was
referring - it got the political nod from EC countries just before
Christmas, but will not be implemented until 1994 - is one of the most
important pieces of insurance legislation in the single market programme.
Its significance for Lloyd's is that Lime Street will be able to write all
non-life business throughout the EC from London - without having an
establishment office on the ground - subject only to having local
claims-handling facilities for third party motor insurance.
The chief benefits of the directive, which also apply to business written
through local establishments, will be:
Technical reserves, which all insurers have to set aside to cover the risks
they are writing, will no longer have to be kept in local assets.
Insurers will no longer have to submit statistical information to host
country insurance supervisors, though some records may be required for
paying local premium taxes.
Prior approval of contract wording and rates by local regulators will not be
required. Policy conditions will still have to be notified, but only for the
purpose of ensuring that the 'general good' has been observed in compulsory
classes of insurance.
In future, therefore, the Department of Trade and Industry alone will be
responsible both for Lloyd's supervision and for receiving statistics of
Lloyd's EC business.
According to Mr Barry Gibson, general manager of the international
department at Lloyd's, there will still be snags for those engaging in cross
frontier business.
The main one will be the tax on premiums levied by many European
Governments, notably in Italy, Germany and France, but not by the UK. 'These
can vary quite a lot', explains Mr Gibson. 'The insured has to pay, but
under local law it is ultimately the responsibility of the insurer that he
does. It means having some local mechanism in place.'
About 16 per cent of Lloyd's total premium income already comes from Europe,
both in the form of direct insurance and reinsurance. Official attitudes
have varied from country to country, but the Lloyd's strategy since the
introduction of an EC directive permitting freedom of establishment in 1973
has been to seek Government licences in the more important centres. This has
often been a time consuming process, as illustrated by negotiations with
Italy and Germany which did not bear fruit until 1986 and 1989.
Licences have often been restricted to certain classes of business.
Non-marine was only added in Greece in late 1991 - though the ability to do
marine business is long standing - while extensions in Italy to cover
aviation, marine, and motor were agreed in mid February this year.
Since July, 1990, Lloyds has been able to do business with most EC countries
under the second non-life insurance directive, which extended service
freedoms to large non-marine, and marine, aviation and transport risks. As a
result, of this an increasing amount of business previously done under
licensing arrangements has been carried out directly with the Lloyd's
market.
London's pre-eminence as a financial and insurance centre - there are 140
foreign owned insurance companies in the UK - should provide a significant
edge in the more open European market created by the third non-life
directive . But as the acquisition strategies of the big French, German and
Italian players demonstrate, gaining a foothold in each territory may be the
key to winning profitable business. inhibited from making takeovers, but
there is no reason why bigger managing agents cannot show the way.
One interesting development has been the recent decision by Sturge Holdings,
the biggest managing and members' agency group, to acquire the British
American Insurance Agency, a Dusseldorf based insurance agency, for around
Pounds 1m. The deal represents the first direct entry by any Lloyd's agency
group into the German market, and follows Sturge's entry into the French
insurance market last year.
BAI, which formerly underwrote on behalf of the Prudential Corporation of
the UK, specialises in the insurance of small and medium sized commercial
risks in the North of Germany. Sturge's German and French ventures are
relatively small. But the important thing, according to Mr James Macdonald,
a director of the company, is to get a foothold.
Continental European business still has to be routed through Lloyd's
brokers, but this is one area which could see change. As the Rowland task
force report pointed out, 'the Lloyd's broker network (in Europe) is less
well established (than in the US). At present a managing agent may have to
use a small Lloyd's broker to guarantee premiums from a major European
broking firm. The commercial rationale for this current requirement is not
clear.
It added, 'Therefore, the taskforce believes that Lloyd's should 'accredit'
a select number of European broking groups with which Lloyd's syndicates
could deal direct outside of the London market without interposing a Lloyd's
broker.'

Pervasive signs of a new commercial spirit - David Barchard on the coming of
marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MOST of the world, marketing and insurance are inseparably linked. At
Lloyd's of London, however, marketing is a new arrival.
Until very recently brokers brought business to underwriters and their
agencies more or less unbidden. But there are pervasive signs of a new
spirit. Old logos are being swept away and replaced by new ones. Sedgwick
and Willis Caroon, for example, have both revamped their corporate image
over the last two years.
Sedgwick's 'flying Christmas pudding' logo has been replaced by a crisper
global symbol. 'It gives us more co-ordination and synergy. Sedgwick people
give out the same business cards wherever they are in the world and the
corporation receives a stronger image,' Ms Julia Fish, Sedgwick's corporate
communications manager, explains.
There are other signs of change. In November 1990, Cassidy Davies became the
first Lloyd's syndicate to appoint a full-time marketing manager. Lloyd's
itself appointed a marketing manager, Beverley Landais, late last year.
Both moves reflect a growing awareness at Lloyd's that unless it develops
stronger marketing skills, it has little chance of regaining ground already
lost to outside competitors.
Such an attitude would have been almost unthinkable a few years back when
the supremacy of Lloyd's was taken for granted and the exchange was shrouded
in its own mystique. In January this year, the Task Force report noted that
the market needs to development a wider mix of more flexible distribution
channels to meet customer needs and competitive pressures in the various
markets in which Lloyd's operates.
In the Task Force's view, Lloyd's faces two basic marketing challenges.
One is to capture lost market share and to stem what seems from the outside
very much like steady decline. Lloyd's has lost share of world premiums over
the last quarter century, even though its overall share stabilised in the
1980s.
Business areas singled out by the Task Force include direct business, other
than motor, and, more worryingly, direct marine insurance, a market where
Lloyd's has traditionally been strongest.
The second challenge is to find new markets and expand into them. But how is
this to be done by an entity which itself consists of scores of smaller
competing units?
In Ms Landais' opinion, the first task is to build up outside awareness of
Lloyd's of London as a brand name. Last year, Lloyd's, working with
Citigate, spent Pounds 600,000 on the first-ever national advertising
campaign to enhance public awareness of the exchange.
At a second level, Lloyd's is trying to encourage regional brokers serving
particular markets such as aviation or motor insurance to put business its
way.
One way of doing this is to organise seminars in which groups of
underwriters visit large cities in the provinces and talk to brokers.
An underlying aim in the last few months is the desire to dispel the
after-effects of the unfavourable publicity surrounding Lloyd's during the
last few weeks.
The authors of the Task Force report seem to have envisaged marketing as an
activity to be handled centrally. But at the level of syndicates and
underwriters, attitudes are also changing. Underwriters have always been
client-conscious, but professional marketing specialists are now also
beginning to appear alongside the older generation of underwriters
specialising in client relationships.
Several agency groups have set up independent marketing initiatives to bring
in new business. Sturge Holdings and A J Archer have set up service or
marketing companies. Sturge's Paris office opened in 1990 and Archer has a
Copenhagen operation.
These offices are part of a drive to build up business in mainland Europe
and other international markets where Lloyd's is less well known than in the
US or UK. The Far East is another target for marketing activities.
There is also a lot of ground that can be covered at home in the UK.
Ms. Beryl Hobson is one of the first full-time marketing managers to be
appointed by a Lloyd's agency, essentially with the task of developing a
marketing culture where none had existed before. She joined Cassidy Davies
in November 1990. Before then, she had worked at Bradford &amp; Bingley Building
Society and spent eight years with Royal Insurance.
With this sort of background in retail financial services, Ms Hobson
believes strongly in focusing on the customer and his needs.
'One of the first things I made us address was who is our customer - it's a
fundamental question, but one we often lose sight of,' says Ms. Hobson. 'On
all Syndicate 582's classes of business our customer is the Lloyd's broker.
We're the manufacturer selling to a wholesaler who sells to a retailer.'
Her starting point was the need to create a clear branding for Cassidy
Davies with a strong corporate identity. She selected a plain, rather
Classical, logo for the group and then set to work developing sub-brands
around it.
Whether or not changes of this sort are merely cosmetic will be hard to
judge for some years until it becomes apparent whether or not Lloyd's has
arrested the market erosion.

Heavyweights in the ring - The brokers seek wider horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON a typical morning at Lloyd's, underwriters sit on their clusters of
benches, quaintly known as boxes, waiting for brokers to arrive with new
business or details of claims.
An outside observer might be forgiven for thinking that most of the work of
keeping the market going rests in the hands of its 220 brokers. This
perception is not quite right. Brokers are still the main distribution
outlet at Lloyd's, closely bound up with the fortunes of the market, but
they are by no means all-important as they once were.
Lloyd's offers face-to-face contacts and the chance to spread risk, and
occasionally the opportunity for brokers to get together against a client
who is trying to play the field. In general, however, brokers describe their
business as savagely competitive, even though they see themselves as
offering their clients a distinctive service in much the same way that
company lawyers or accountants do.
'The selection of the right broker is very important for a client. A good
broker can get a better rate on the same risk than a bad broker would get,'
says Mr Alan Colls of brokers Nicholson Colls. Brokering at Lloyd's in the
1990s, however, is very different from what it was a decade or two ago when
brokers would queue for hours for small amounts of business.
One change is that the two biggest brokers - Sedgwick and Willis Faber  -
have somewhat outgrown Lloyd's. Both Sedgwick and Willis Faber are among the
biggest brokers in the world, along with others such as Alexander Howden and
CT Bowring, which are now offshoots of big international brokers, Alexander
&amp; Alexander and Marsh McLennan.
Most recently, Willis Faber, long regarded as the most blue-blooded and
traditionalist broker on the exchange, followed suit by merging its
operations with Corroon &amp; Black, so forming Willis Corroon.
Since the early 1980s, these bigger brokers have become less dependent on
the Lloyd's market. After the 1982 Lloyd's Act, they were forced to divest
control of the managing agencies which administer underwriting syndicates,
on the grounds that there was a conflict of interest as long as they held
the roles of both insurer and broker, since brokers act for the client being
assured.
That said, the links of the large brokers with Lloyd's remain extremely
intimate, and their top executives are usually to be found in prominent
places in the governance of the Lloyd's market.
For example, Mr Philip Wroughton, the chairman of CT Bowring, is still a
member of the Lloyd's Council, while Mr David Rowland, the chairman of
Sedgwick, was given the job of heading the Task Force which last year
conducted a searching examination of the market's business structure.
'Lloyd's is still at the centre of the wheel in much of the international
insurance market,' says Mr Sax Riley, managing director of Sedgwicks. 'We
have never yet found suitable alternatives.'
In some sectors, however, London business is dwarfed by the American market.
The biggest four brokers earn less than 15 per cent of their total
commission income from business placed at Lloyd's. They get over 50 per cent
from retail operations in the US.
They are also vital to Lloyd's. The 20 largest brokers' firms produce about
70 per cent of the Dollars 25bn premiums placed in London each year.
'Lloyd's is very important to us, but it is far from the only place in the
world where we do business,' says Mr Peter Tritton of Alexander &amp; Howden.
'Where Lloyd's is important is that it is a leader. About two thirds of the
London market is led by Lloyd's and respect for Lloyd's is very high. If
Lloyd's is willing to underwrite something, others will follow in Paris and
Zurich.' At the other end of the market, there are other changes. Though new
broker firms are regularly set up, often by brokers working with the larger
houses who want to strike out on their own, the number of firms seems to be
contracting as a result of mergers. There are about 60 fewer brokers at
Lloyds today than there were in the late 1980s.
Many of these are established with the intention of becoming niche-players
in their chosen sector. The stronger smaller brokers are beginning to
diversify. Steel Burrill Jones started life as a specialist marine
reinsurance broker in the late 1970s, for example, but it has latterly
expanded into UK retail and wholesale business. This now makes up about two
thirds of its total business.
'The cost of doing business is absolutely critical in London these days and
as a result you are getting new groupings of brokers and alliances in an
attempt to get sales and business in larger units,' says Mr Tritton.
He points out that brokers do all the preparatory work on the risk for a
particular deal and then present it ready-made to underwriters.
As the interests of brokers have changed, Lloyd's agents have shown concern
about their lack of control over distribution. In the late 1980s, when the
volume of business being brought to the market was declining, several
leading agencies began launching initiatives to win business for themselves,
especially in personal lines business where direct marketing is becoming
steadily more widespread in the rest of the insurance industry.
At the same time, the rules for service companies are being relaxed. These
are owned by the Lloyd's agencies but have their offices outside the Lloyd's
building, generally but not always close to the market.
In the UK, the Octavian group has now set up companies in Leeds and the
Merrett Group has a Birmingham office. At least three agencies, AJ Archer,
Sturge, and Cater Allen, have set up European operations, though they seem
so far to be underwriting relatively small quantities of business.
The most radical step so far has been taken by Hayter Brockbank, one of the
fastest growing agencies, which announced that it would set up a direct
motor insurer to sell motor insurance over the telephone to the general
public.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (21): Darkest
before the dawn? - The underwriting recovery may be about to start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JUDGING by the news surrounding Lloyd's over the past year, it may seem
pointless to consider whether or not to become a Name.
However, many fortunes have been based on the use of a a counter-cyclical
investment strategy. Should we then attribute great astuteness to the small
number of new Names commencing underwriting for the 1992 account? Or do they
merely have an unquenchable thirst for sophisticated gambling?
The market is currently in a phase of losses with Pounds 509m losses last
summer for the 1988 year of account. Lloyd's reports three years in arrears
and more are bound to be declared for 1989 and 1990 over the next two years.
The jury is still out on 1991, but it seems unlikely to herald a return to
significant profits.
The fortunes of insurance companies worldwide are notoriously cyclical and
there are now definite indications of a turn in the cycle. Indeed, it could
be said that the sun is rising in the east. Any recovery must be driven both
by improving rates and growth in demand.
Last year's Japanese typhoons and the current re-rating of many marine and
aviation policies are bringing significant increases. but there is still
little sign of an upturn in the all-important US property account, despite
increasing pressure on the domestic US insurance market.
However, even the US market cannot continue to maintain low premium rates
indefinitely and its exposure to junk bonds and real estate losses will add
to its loss of surplus in the current stage of the underwriting cycle, which
must ultimately lead to a reduction in capacity and an upturn in rates.
There have also been increasing calls for an amendment to the US legal
system, the worst excesses of which are perhaps now seen to benefit no one.
So, with firming rates, increasing demand coming from the emerging markets
of eastern Europe, and a world economic recovery providing a further boost
in demand, the stage could be set for a new era of profitable underwriting.
Regardless of the global insurance market conditions, the prospective or
continuing Name must convince himself that the recommendations of David
Rowlands' recently released Task Force Report really will help to redress
the balance in favour of Names' interests.
Syndicates and managing agents can no longer afford the luxury of a cost
plus operation. We know there is a move to cut costs, which is commendable,
but it so far has had little impact.
Executives of unprofitable syndicates are still earning excessive salaries,
despite the losses currently being faced by Names, and no syndicates have
yet deemed it necessary to reduce their charges to Names.
Over time, the introduction of the Task Force recommendations will help,
although they will do little to improve the immediate prospects for profit.
One of the more interesting proposals is the introduction of MAPAs (Members'
Agents' Pooling Arrangements) whereby smaller Names will be able to
participate in Lloyd's by entering a pool of all, or some, of the syndicates
with which their members' agent maintains agreements.
These MAPAs may serve several purposes: they will effectively act as unit
trusts spreading Names' exposure across a far greater number of syndicates
than would otherwise be possible, which may provide greater protection.
However, the market average is hardly an attractive prospect at present.
MAPAs will, however, fulfil one important role - that of providing some
visible measure of the skills and professionalism of members' agents, which
is vital if Names are to be given the opportunity to select their advisers
on the basis of performance.
The members' agents community has changed dramatically over the past decade,
falling from 271 in 1981 to 111 in 1991, and is likely to shrink further.
The fact is that smaller firms are unlikely to be in a position to offer the
range and depth of service that future Names will demand. This and the
requirement to remain commercially viable has led to the current round of
mergers and acquisitions.
Many existing members have found themselves in a position of being
transferred to new agents so it becomes all the more important that both
they and prospective new members examine closely the skills and relative
merits of their agent. Historically, most members have selected their agent
from a choice of one, having been introduced by a friend or relative, and
probably did not fully appreciate that different agents have a different
range of syndicates on which they are able to place Names, not to mention
their differing policies in respect of size of line on syndicates, markets
supported, stop loss, investment advice and agency charges.
Against this background, it is clear that Names must give careful
consideration to precisely what their agent or prospective agent has to
offer, probably with third party advice and, perhaps most importantly, they
should examine the track record of the candidate agencies.
Although much ink has been spilt about the horrendous losses' suffered by
some Names, a large number will come through the present difficulties
relatively unscathed due, in large part, to the skills of their members'
agent.
Once an agent has been selected, probably after interviewing several, the
next area to examine must be the costs associated with membership. l have
already mentioned that different agents levy different fees, but so do the
accountants, banks, insurance companies and stop loss brokers.
Income is but one element of a profit and loss account and significant
savings are frequently achieved by those Names who take the time to shop
around for these items. Advice on these cost saving measures should form
part of the service from any members' agent that takes its job seriously.
It is certain that if Lloyd's is to maintain its position in the
international insurance market, it must take positive and radical steps to
ensure that its capital base, currently provided by the Names who pledge
their wealth, is secure and that an acceptable combination of risk and
reward is achieved. Otherwise, it will not be in a position to take
advantage of the recovery in the insurance market that has already begun.
I believe that first and foremost the cost cutting must continue, at both
central and syndicate level, to win back the expense advantage once enjoyed
by Lloyd's over its corporate rivals and in the area of managing agency
charges and ancillary costs to ensure a better deal for Names.
Lloyd's must also ensure that, as it investigates the apparently attractive
world of corporate capital, it does not forget the individuals who have been
its lifeblood for 300 years.
So, to be or not to be .. I believe that if Names appreciate that they are
in the business of insurance, and are prepared to take the steps normally
associated with good commercial practice in respect of cost control and
relative performance evaluation, membership of Lloyd's has a great deal to
offer as an efficiently geared tax effective business opportunity.
As with any industry, quality management will ride out the present storm and
emerge relatively unscathed compared with their less professional or less
capable colleagues. With a public assault on costs and perhaps some
consideration as to whether self regulation is really necessary or helpful,
we may then look to the results of the 1990s with optimism.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (19): Time
for boldness - and caution - John Authers examines some complexities and
pitfalls of becoming a Lloyd's member
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WHAT do you have to do to become a Name at Lloyd's?
After the events of the last few months, this question sounds like a joke.
With so many members of Lloyd's seemingly desperate to leave, and losses
running at record levels, this does not look like the time to join.
Most professional advisers who assist investors in dealings with Lloyd's
seem to accept this. While there is so much uncertainty, and confidence is
at such a low level, those who are in any doubt at all should stay out of
the market.
However, for the bold, there are two broad reasons why this could be a good
time to enter:
The Task Force Report, would, if enacted, take away unlimited liability,
arguably the single greatest deterrent to Lloyd's membership.
Many expect the market to stage a recovery this year, while the losses for
1989, still unravelling, should soon become more clear, and probably
represent the worst that Lloyd's will have to bear.
Becoming a Lloyd's Name would look much more attractive if it meant sharing
in a profitable market, with a lid on the total risk taken.
In good times, membership of Lloyd's is still attractive, because it allows
people effectively to use their money twice - they take the underwriting
profit if there is any, while they are free to derive income from
alternative sources with the capital they use to back their membership.
Provided the market avoids its current losses, deciding whether to become a
Name is best approached as a problem of personal financial planning.
Mr Edmund Wood, a partner with BDO Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm,
says: 'You need to have a reasonably secure source of income and earnings,
and you also need to have easily disposable capital.'
But he goes on to caution that some people are too rich to become Names. The
benefit of being a Name is that it can utilise assets to produce an extra
source of income, at the cost of added risk.
Those who are already comfortably off, and are utilising their assets to the
full, need not bother. The less wealthy, with a greater need of income,
should consider membership more closely.
This is most likely, according to Mr Clive Scott-Hopkins, director of the
independent financial adviser Towry Law, for people who have particularly
illiquid assets which are difficult to exploit, such as farmland. This does
not, of course, apply for farmers who need the land as their prime source of
income. He also suggests that Lloyd's membership is most appropriate for
people who may just have retired, and want to make up the shortfall in their
earned income.
Mr Robert Saunders, an adviser on Lloyd's with the private bank Smith &amp;
Williamson, differs slightly from this - he suggests that Lloyd's is
probably better for younger people, who still have the chance to earn more
money to make good any losses they make. Otherwise, except in the case of
readily disposable land, he suggests assets to back Lloyd's investment
should be readily disposable, and should not constitute business assets.
Mr Scott-Hopkins also suggests that it would be a mistake to include one's
house in these calculations - the membership is a way of deriving income
from an under-exploited asset. Such assets should also be disposable -
unlike houses. Thus it could be most appropriate for people with land valued
at Pounds 250,000 or more, which they could countenance losing.
Potential Names must still therefore be called 'wealthy' by any criterion.
Mr Wood suggests that they should be able to fund reasonably substantial
losses for two or three years without it affecting their way of life. Few
can say this.
Further, he suggests that there is little point in underwriting for the
minimum amount, of Pounds 250,000. This limits gains while still exposing
investors to the full, unlimited, liability. He therefore suggests
underwriting a minimum of Pounds 400,000 or Pounds 500,000.
However, if the proposal to limit liability to the total amount underwritten
is enacted, this would act as a strong incentive for Names to take on rather
less risk.
There are other tax-planning measures which can effectively limit the
liability for married couples, thanks to the introduction of independent
taxation for husband and wife. Mr Scott-Hopkins suggests that couples should
rearrange their assets so that one has only Pounds 250,000 to his (or her)
name. This should not include the house.
This partner then becomes the Lloyd's Name, and has effectively limited his
or her liability to exactly Pounds 250,000. This measure plainly requires an
advanced level of trust, but as most potential Lloyd's Names should be
around retirement age, when relationships are relatively stable, this should
not represent too great a problem.
If, as is likely, the Name is only a basic rate taxpayer, this means that
there are less taxes to pay on any profits, which makes the deal more
attractive.
A final financial problem is that, in the early years, Names will not have
been able to build up adequate reserves to fund any losses. This means that
stop-loss insurance, which is now not as good a deal as it once was, could
make sense.
Once an accountant has confirmed that Lloyd's membership makes financial
sense, the sad story of the current litigations shows that it is vital to
take independent legal advice. Mr Richard Astor, a barrister who has written
a legal guide to Lloyd's membership, says that Names have a duty to seek
full, frank, expert, neutral, independent legal advice. This provides a
valuable legal defence against the problems which can emerge later, and
proves that Names have taken due care in entering their commitment.
Having taken professional advice, you need to choose syndicates.
Effectively, this usually boils down to choosing a member's agent, who can
then gauge the profile of risks and liabilities you are prepared to take on.
Accountants should be able to put you in contact with a 'beauty parade' of
member's agents. Mr Saunders suggests that would-be Names should contact at
least three agents for a breadth of choice. Some are more independent than
others, and there are also differences in the strength of their contacts
with underwriters and brokers.
Finally, one should act soon, although irrevocable commitments can be
avoided until November 30. Sponsorship and application forms must be
submitted by the end of August.
Details of members' agents and all charges and paperwork involved are
available on request from Lloyd's.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (20): The
great, the good and the not so lucky - Tom Lynch takes a roll call of top
Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of public figures losing their shirts adds spice to the
intermittent stories about losses at Lloyd's.
The man in the Clapham bus cares little that people he has never heard of
are in a spot of bother because of long-tail liability losses arising from
asbestosis claims. But when one of them turns out to be a former prime
minister - Mr Edward Heath - the complex and abstruse affairs of Lloyd's can
become the subject of lounge bar speculation.
It is usually when losses mount that the identity of Names is revealed, as
they join pressure groups seeking redress or taking legal action. Lloyd's
itself does not name Names, arguing that their identity is a private matter,
and should not be disclosed without their owners' knowledge.
So when it becomes known that a syndicate has struck losses, attention is
focused on the famous.
Their names used to add a touch of sparkle to Lloyd's. When it was known as
an aloof, remote, solid, stuffy institution, reeking of leather armchairs,
port and four-hour lunches, the occasional enrolment of a show business
personality, especially one from a humble background, was a sign that anyone
could make it into one of the world's most exclusive and moneyed clubs.
In those days, the fact that the super-rich and aristocracy were part of
Lloyd's was used in a low-key way to persuade sceptical Americans that
Lloyd's membership had its advantages. 'Solid as a rock, old boy. Good
fellows, salt of the earth. Not supposed to say, but titled chaps, Duke of
Norfolk, that sort of thing, you know. Can't go wrong.'
For many of the rich and famous, as for those who were merely rich, the
annual cheque kept dropping through the door.
But, also like other Names, they were not immune to heavy underwriting
losses, as the market was hit in the late 1980s by catastrophe and long-tail
liability losses.
Even the blue-blooded were not immune - the Duke of Norfolk appears on the
1989 list of Names on the Wellington 406 and 448 syndicates, which were hit
in the 1988 underwriting year by long-tail liabilities; the 1989 position is
not yet clear.
In the case of Outhwaite, the famous were represented among about 1,000
members of Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in the 1982 year who reached a Pounds
116m out-of court settlement in February of their legal action to recover
Pounds 200m losses. Mr Heath was an Outhwaite Name, along with the actress
Susan Hampshire, Rocco Forte, Tony Jacklin and, before anyone suspected the
scale of his misdemeanours, the late Robert Maxwell.
Cynics say Lloyd's is ideally suited to sportsmen and women, to showbusiness
stars, to politicians and to entrepreneurs. They say that people who build
up their wealth through taking risks understand that there are risks
involved in being a Name at Lloyd's.
It is not clear how a distinguished career on the stage, the golf course or
the green leather benches of the Commons enhances an individual's perception
of financial risk.
The old boy network sometimes became the new boy network in the 1980s, as
Lloyd's sought to expand capacity and brought in some of the newly
prominent. Critics say this was storing up trouble, since some of the newly
prominent were only moderately well off, and lacked the wealth to cushion
them against a really bad couple of years.
One such case related to Lime Street Underwriting Agencies, the Lloyd's
members' agency which is now in liquidation.
Some of the 450 or so Names recruited to Lime Street were placed in some of
the syndicates with the worst losses in recent years - many were enrolled on
catastrophe reinsurance syndicates managed by agencies such as Feltrim,
Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire. Famous or not, Lloyd's has
refused to inform the Names whether it is conducting an investigation. It
says such matters are confidential.
Mr Robin Kingsley, who founded Lime Street, was, like his father, a tennis
player and a member of the All England Lawn Tennis Club at Wimbledon. He
persuaded tennis players to join, including Mark Cox and Buster Mottram.
But it was not just the new showbusiness and sport stars who were among the
big losers at Lloyd's in recent years. The 1989 list of Names on the
Wellington syndicates has a good flavour of Who's Who and Burke's Peerage
about it - perhaps the most prominent being Prince Michael of Kent.
There are at least two Dukes - Norfolk and Atholl, the latter a dangerous
man to upset, being the only individual in Britain allowed to keep a private
army.
The roll call goes on through a dozen or so earls, 20 or so assorted
viscounts, viscountesses, countesses, marquesses and marchionesses and
upwards of 30 Lords. The roll call of lawyers includes a number of judges.
The peers include members or former members of the government, like Lord
Denham, who, as Chief Whip in the Lords in 1988, was responsible for turning
out backwoods Conservative Lords from boardrooms and country houses to
squash a backbench revolt and ensure a 134-vote government majority on the
poll tax.
From the other end of the palace of Westminster, the Wellington list
includes a dozen or so MPs, including Sir Nicholas Lyell, the solicitor
general. and a government Whip, Mr Nick Baker. All are Conservatives.
From the diplomatic world there is Sir Ewen Fergusson, Ambassador to Paris,
and from sport there is John Francombe, the jockey.
The Wellington syndicates are among a number which have come to grief in
recent years, and blue blood and stardom have proved no protection.
Like Wellington, the Poland 105 and 108 syndicates suffered from long-tail
liabilities. On the 1989 list of members of 108 was Dame Shirley Porter, the
steely leader of Westminster Council, while John Julius (Viscount) Norwich
and Sir Freddie Laker are listed in the same year on Gooda Walker 290, hit
by catastrophe losses. On another Gooda Walker loss-maker, 299, is listed Mr
Edward de Bono, the lateral thinker.

'Biggest' insurer steps on the gas - The private motor business is returning
to favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lloyd's market, with a 13 per cent share of total motor premiums written
in 1990, claims to be the largest private car insurer in the UK.
Excluding fleet business, Lloyd's syndicates probably insure one private UK
motorist in five.
Lloyd's pre-eminence has been greater - its market share peaked at 16 per
cent in the mid 1980s - and one question now is whether the Lime Street
market will retrieve any of the lost ground.
Certainly there should be no shortage of capacity in the next few years,
with clear signs already that Names are anxious to increase their exposure
to a sector which has produced consistent, if not necessarily exciting,
profits.
'Names have tended to devote about 10 to 15 per cent of their premium
capacity to motor in the past', says Mr George Johnstone, chairman of the
Lloyd's Motor Underwriters Association (LMUA). 'I would expect this to rise
to 20-25 per cent in the future.'
To a large extent extra capacity is likely to be absorbed by premium rate
increases, which have typically run at 25-30 per cent for motor over the
last 12 months. Nevertheless, although direct writers pose a fresh threat,
the worsening solvency ratios of the UK composite insurers provide an
interesting opportunity for Lloyds to boost volume growth.
The 1991 results of both Guardian Royal Exchange and General Accident -
which showed a substantial drop in the company's motor premiums last year -
highlight the point. Lloyd's market, constituted in 1909, is perhaps best
known for its wide variety of tailor-made policies, which appeal to groups
as diverse as motor cyclists, kitcar and classic car owners, and young
drivers.
The operation of Lloyd's motor syndicates is also fundamentally different
from syndicates elsewhere: they issue their own policies, endorsements,
debit/credit notes and accounts; they investigate, negotiate and pay their
own claims; and they normally write 100 per cent of any risk. Nearly all
motor syndicates have set up service companies, wholly owned by syndicates'
managing agents, to process business which is not economic for brokers to
handle.
Volume growth at Lloyd's was particularly rapid throughout the 1970s,
following the well publicised failures of companies such as Vehicle and
General and Mr Emil Savundra's Fire Auto Marine. The number of syndicates
also increased in this period, but has recently shrunk due to cost
pressures, mergers and poor performance. Today there are 28 specialist motor
syndicates, which write about Pounds 800m in annual premiums.
Lloyd's syndicates have not escaped the downturn in the underwriting cycle
of the last two years. Mr Johnstone of the LMUA maintains, though, that they
have fared better than the composites. 'The company sector has had a very
rough time, but our emphasis on distribution channels, the more personal
relationships we tend to develop with high street brokers, has made for a
more tailored risk.'
Names on Syndicate 866, for example - Shead Motor Policies at Lloyd's - will
make profits on the 1989 account, though according to Mr Peter Routledge,
its motor underwriter, they will not be as good as in 1987 and 1988. 'It is
too early to say what will happen in 1990 and 1991, though I believe that we
will make a profit in 1990,' he adds.
Shead, which does a lot of specialist fleet business and numbers the Stock
Exchange and Bank of England among its customers, says there has been no
difficulty attracting Names: capacity for the current year is well up on
last year at Pounds 47m.
The smaller Holdsure Group, which has capacity to write Pounds 26.5m of
premiums this year, is expecting 1990 to be more difficult than 1991. 'Even
though it didn't happen until the 1991 budget the increase in the VAT rate
from 15 to 17.5 per cent inflated the cost of 1990 claims,' explains
Holdsure's underwriter Mr David Poll. 'Nineteen ninety-one will be better
because rates started to increase from the middle of the year.'
Mr Poll agrees that it is the specialist nature of the Lloyd's market which
differentiates it from the composites, and which shows up in the results.
'The composites have tended in the past to write motor policies for market
share, using it as a loss leader for other types of business,' he claims.
Lloyd's practitioners, meanwhile, firmly refute the idea that Lloyd's
undoubted competitiveness on rates is matched by an unhealthy disregard for
service. 'This may have been true a few years ago when one or two
syndicates, which have now disappeared, gave the whole place a bad name. But
it is not true today,' insists Mr Routledge. 'We couldn't survive with poor
service.'
Adds Mr Poll: 'At one point, about 10 years ago, the market was taking on
more business than it could cope with. There were one or two maverick
syndicates in those days which cut rates to win business, and then tried to
use the small print to avoid paying out on claims. I believe that the level
of service given by the Lloyd's market today is actually better than the
composites. Most syndicates have developed sophisticated software, and are
highly efficient.'
While the composites are having their difficulties the direct writers, who
use TV and national newspaper advertising to bypass brokers, have emerged as
a source of new competition for the business of private motorists.
The LMUA has obtained permission from the Council of Lloyds for syndicates
to deal direct with the public in addition to the traditional broker based
network, an opportunity which has recently been addressed by the Lloyd's
agency group Hayter Brockbank. Hayter says it will be investing Pounds 1.8m
this year in a new direct response company for motor and other personal
lines of insurance, and aims to have 50,000 policyholders by May 1994 and
100,000 by January 1995.
Notwithstanding suggestions in the Task Force report that their superior
cost structures may enable the direct writers to eat into Lloyd's share of
the motor market, the LMUA's Mr Johnstone plays down the threat. 'If you
look at the Department of Trade and Industry returns for 1990 they are very,
very small,' he maintains.
'I don't believe they are the success story that everyone seems to say they
are. They only appeal to a certain section of the population, and will end
up fighting among themselves for those clients who are persuaded by an
advertising approach. Most people prefer to trust the advice of the friendly
insurance broker who they meet in the pub.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (18): Light
fingers on the keys / A look at risks in the age of electronic theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE early 1920s, an enterprising underwriter and broker called Harrison
wrote, on behalf of his five-member syndicate, a number of financial default
policies guaranteeing hire-purchase agreements for cars and particularly
taxis.
Further premium income could be generated, he discovered, by covering unsold
vehicles still on dealers' stocks, and credit instruments drawn up not to
fund purchases but for sale in the financial markets. It must have seemed
but a short step to the logical conclusion of insuring vehicles which were
also imaginary.
Not surprisingly, the enterprise ended in tears. Mr Harrison's book-keeping
was as creative as his underwriting. The syndicate was unable to meet its
commitments, and its losses were met by a special policy underwritten by
every single member of Lloyd's at a guaranteed loss.
The episode was instrumental in the establishment in 1927 of Lloyd's Central
Reserve Fund. An even more direct result was a ban, which continues to the
present, on presentation in the Underwriting Room of credit insurance
covering debts owed to a commercial trader, although this was not
universally supported.
Cuthbert Heath, the most influential underwriter of his generation, was a
strong believer in credit insurance, but despite his protests he was forced
to continue his interest through CE Heath &amp; Co's shareholding in the Trade
Indemnity Co (now Trade Indemnity plc).
Mr Heath and his supporters did gain one concession: reinsurance, rather
than direct cover, of such credit risks was permitted, and continues to be
written.
Furthermore, the restriction applies to commercial risks only. Political
risks, where the debtor is a governmental entity, may still be written and
Lloyd's is one of the largest markets for such business.
The collapse of the command economies of eastern and central Europe has led
to the decentralisation of international trade away from state organisations
to individual commercial enterprises, which Lloyd's cannot technically
underwrite. If nothing else, this has highlighted the artificiality of the
1923 blanket ban, which sections of the market are lobbying to be modified.
Lloyd's is also a leading source of cover for financial institutions. At the
core of this class of business is fidelity and theft cover for banks,
enabling protection of cash against the threat of appropriation by employees
as well as expropriation by robbers. Such cover is compulsory by law for US
banks, and one of Lloyd's early innovations was the Banker's Blanket Bond
providing comprehensive protection in one package.
During the 1960s, demand for policies of this kind grew as financial markets
increased in sophistication and the type of financial institutions became
more diverse. Simple cover for theft of cash on the premises and in transit
together with employee fidelity became patently inadequate, according to
Alec Sharp, underwriter of Castle Underwriting Agents syndicate 839, and a
leader in the financial institutions market.
What had once been staid leading banks in the US and the UK, as well as in
Europe, began to develop their range of activity; merchant banks grew in
strength; and these were supplemented by an expansion of hire-purchase
companies, leasing companies, trust funds and other manifestations of what
became known as the secondary banking sector.
The new patterns of business led to the reappraisal of insurance
requirements. 'Insurance can be proactive or reactive,' Mr Sharp comments.
'In this case, it was reactive to the situation, but proactive in developing
the covers.'
By the early 1970s, however, the so-called secondary banking crisis
evidenced by the collapse of some of the new financial institutions had
indicated that there were deficiencies in the system. From the institutions'
point of view, business had grown out of proportion to its underlying
technical structure, while insurers perceived that the risk element had
escalated beyond that previously considered.
One element, for example, was insurers' exposure to losses which were
primarily commercial in nature but contained an element of infidelity.
In one well-known case, a foreign exchange dealer employed by a leading UK
clearing bank in Switzerland began losing money. In an attempt to cover his
losses, he concealed information from head office and attempted to cover
them by further overtrading. When it was eventually discovered, the insured
portion of the loss was paid, but subsequently a joint Lloyd's and London
company market committee agreed that events of this kind should not be
covered in future.
The result was the introduction of the standard wording that actions
involving the infidelity of employees would be covered only when they
involved 'improper personal gain'. The analogy with theft was now clear, and
together with cover of cash on the premises and in transit, forgery,
counterfeit currency and fraud, the primary purpose of the core policy to
protect against losses due to criminal activity rather than bad debts or
trading losses was boosted.
In a faint echo of the Harrison case, the dangers inherent in covering
leasing business were further reinforced in 1975-6 by heavy losses suffered
on policies written to indemnify computer leasing companies against the
effects of the termination of the contracts. These caused Lloyd's worst
results of the 1970s, but they were the result not of fraud but of an
inadequate appreciation by most of the underwriters involved of the effects
of rapid technological change upon the risk element of the business they
were writing.
The development of financial institutions cover is, in Mr Sharp's view,
Lloyd's major innovation in the last 20 years, and further refinements have
continued. As the international banking system has come to rely increasingly
on telecommunications and computer operations, perils covered have been
extended to include fraudulent manipulation of telex, fax and
'voice-initiated' transfers.
The first computer crime policy was developed by David Newman in 1982, but
market conditions at the time were not conducive to innovation. However, the
cover has grown in importance over the last few years. As well as electronic
communications media, these policies also cover external manipulation of
banks' computers.
'The exposures are massive, but the controls are good,' Mr Sharp says, since
the perpetrator faces the problem of converting the electronic balance into
real cash. Most sums stolen in this way have been subsequently recovered not
only due to controls against such thefts per se, but because of controls
introduced to prevent the laundering of profits from drug dealing and other
crimes.
Such cover is now an integral part of any financial institution's insurance
package, and includes protection against damage to electronic data, media
and transmissions caused by computer viruses.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (17): Ready
for takeoff as 'cheap' cover ends - Aviation Premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK to anyone at the aviation insurance market at Lloyd's of London and
they will tell you their favourite story about how cheap airline insurance
has been in the past few years.
'It would cost less to insure a jet aircraft for a transatlantic flight than
the cost of fuel needed to circle once around Heathrow', jokes Mr Alan
Colls, aviation specialist with brokers Nicholson Chamberlain &amp; Colls in
London and chairman of the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee.
A Rolls Royce owner paying the same premium rate as the owner of a jet
airliner rate could insure his car for little as Pounds 8 a year, quips Mr
Ted Jemphry, managing director of Willis Corroon Aerospace, the world's
leading aviation broker and another active player in the Lloyd's market.
But everyone in the market - brokers who contract insurance on behalf of
airline operators, and underwriters who work for insurers who collect the
premiums and pay out when there are claims - agrees that the days of cheap
insurance are ending.
Nearly three quarters of airlines renew their annual hull and liability
policies on October 1. Most paid increases of between 200 and 300 per cent
for their hull cover and up to 100 per cent for liability policies during
the last renewal season.
Subsequently a spurt of large accident claims - including the loss of an SAS
MD-80 and a China airlines Boeing 747 - in the week after Christmas - has
reinforced the determination of underwriters to obtain further increases
this year. Claims from both losses amounted to nearly Dollars 100m and
served to expose the inadequacy of the industry's rating base. Total
premiums collected by airline insurers in 1991 amounted to barely Dollars
500m compared with claims of over Dollars 800m.
The rate rises have signalled a hardening in the market after five years of
fierce rate competition at Lloyd's, which has gradually undermined the
profitability of the aviation market. Mr John Wescott, the chairman of the
Lloyd's Aviation Underwriters' Association, acknowledges that the market has
traded at a deficit for at least four years.
Syndicates were attracted to the aviation market by the record profits of
Pounds 266.3m achieved in 1986. Many of the newcomers had little experience
of aviation insurance and simply formed a 'supporting market', co-insuring
risks which were in practice underwritten by the traditional market leaders.
Competition depressed premiums and increasing claims put pressure on a
number of syndicates. Although the aviation market returned profits of
Pounds 246.2m in 1987 and Pounds 154.2m in 1987 and 1988 this was only
possible because underwriters had bought reinsurance protection from other
Lloyd's syndicates, often at rates that were highly attractive for the
insurers buying the cover.
Short of traditional shipping business as a result of the downturn of the
shipping industry, a number of marine syndicates were particularly active in
this field.
However, over the past two years heavy losses have led many of these
reinsurers to back away from the market leaving aviation underwriters to
carry greater amounts of risk on their account. Aviation syndicates will be
only just in profit in 1989 and the market could even record a small overall
loss when it reports its 1990 results next June.
Many bigger syndicates are increasing their 'net lines', the amount of a
risk they are prepared to assume on their own account. Tougher operating
conditions have exposed the relatively high expenses of smaller syndicates
and prompted rationalisation.
The average size of aviation syndicates has grown a number of smaller
syndicates who had previously constituted a supporting market to the main
players have backed away. Sturge Holdings (which manages five aviation
syndicates, including the biggest, syndicate 960 underwritten by Brian
Beasley) now controls more than Pounds 250m in stamp capacity (effectively
capital backing underwriting). This is about a quarter of the whole Lloyd's
aviation market.
Five other agents - Methuen (whose Ariel syndicate is one of Lloyd's best
known), Wellington, Murray Lawrence, Wren and Archer - control a further
Pounds 350m in stamp capacity.
Wellington and Murray Lawrence, together with a smaller agency, Barder &amp;
Marsh, have pooled the capacity offered by three of their syndicates to
support underwriter, Mr Barry Coleman. Talks are afoot to bring a fourth
syndicate, managed by Stewart &amp; Hughman, into this arrangement. Other
syndicates which are all under pressure to reduce costs and rationalise
their operations may follow suit. These trends parallel developments on the
London company market.
In November, 1990, the separate aviation subsidiaries of the UK composite
companies - Commercial Union, Eagle Star, Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance,
Pearl, Prudential, Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, and General Accident -
merged to form the British Aviation Group in order to improve efficiency.
BAG has the capacity to underwrite 25 per cent of airline fleets on its own
account, making it less reliant on other underwriters with whom it coinsures
most risks.
Indeed, Mr Wescott believes that eventually there may be only four large
syndicates and companies underwriting in the London aviation market as a
whole. That would lead the way to a more ordered and less volatile market.
It might mean the end of anecdotes about Rolls Royces and cheap insurance
but it would leave underwriters freer to compete on service rather than
price and that might be a better thing for the airlines.

Insurers pick up sick planet's health bill - Chris Clarke takes a look at
pollution cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS routinely voice dismay at the insurance industry's reluctance to
offer the rest of the economy cover against pollution damage.
It would be such a simple way to safeguard the public and the taxpayer from
uncertain pollution costs, if every economic actor could be required to
carry unlimited pollution insurance.
A rapidly growing number of statutes, at European Community and national
level, is now requiring insurance or equivalent financial guarantee before
activities with high environmental risks can operate. Very little thought
seems to have been given to where such provision would come from.
Insurers, on the other hand, have spent the last decade trying to survive a
tidal wave of unforeseen asbestos and pollution claims under liability
policies written long before anyone anticipated such things.
More than Pounds 5bn has been paid out of the London market on asbestos
bodily injury claims and the annual totals are only just beginning to peak.
Behind that, there is a battle to resist what some see as potentially
hundreds of billions of dollars in asbestos property damage claims.
In addition to these concerns about asbestos, insurers are also facing the
threat of massive liabilities in relation to environmental clean-ups.
So far, the claims in this area are largely confined to the US, where
insurers are fighting in the courts to show that comprehensive general
liability policies (CGL) with 'sudden and accidental' exclusion wordings
should not have to cover clean-up costs at 'Superfund' hazardous waste
sites. (These are areas covered by American legislation of the 1980s which
primarily addresses hazardous abandoned sites.)
This is an important battle for the insurance industry. Current estimates
for total Superfund costs range between Dollars 50bn and Dollars 750bn with
further billion dollar sums awaiting under other federal and state
legislation.
In Europe, EC liability proposals and member state laws are both introducing
concepts such as strict, joint and several, and, to some extent, retroactive
liability to the environmental field. Governments have been trying to
reassure people that the retroactive element would be avoided here, but
insurers are rightly sceptical of any such promise. An imminent EC green
paper on environmental liability makes it clear in draft that vast sums of
money are going to be required from someone to pay for Europe's historic
contamination problems.
Already, European insurers know that there are thousands of old public
liability policies out there, written on an occurrence basis, that were
silent about pollution and will very likely give rise to claims in the long
run. Today, most such policies include 'sudden and accidental' exclusions,
which most insurers think will be more effective than equivalents in the US.
Meanwhile, a small number of company insurers are offering policies
specifically aimed at gradual pollution problems, known as environmental
impairment liability (EIL) insurance. These require the insured to pay for
extensive site investigation and possibly improvement before acceptance,
then restrict cover to a claims-made basis, with strict policy limits and
substantial deductibles.
A UK Chemical Industries Association EIL scheme, known as CEILIF, with a
Pounds 5m per site limit, was the first in the field, with a similar package
for non-CIA members, from brokers Bain Clarkson. These were followed by the
largest US carrier in this market, AIG, with a Dollars 20m per company limit
through its AIU subsidiary, and US rival Reliance is now launching a range
of policies through its associate ECS.
While there has been much interest in these schemes, there has been
virtually no take-up of the actual policies. Small companies seem to have
found the premiums and deductibles too high, while large companies have
apparently preferred to retain the risks. Both groups have also been getting
a good deal of cover for nothing, out of public liability policies which
still lack pollution exclusions.
In that context, the Lloyd's market has established an environment working
party, under Michael Payne, recently retired as underwriter of syndicate
386, to look at what can be sensibly provided without attracting ruinous
losses. Mr Payne reports that it will examine all the options as
constructively as possible, including insurance pools, as already exist in
various forms in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.
He looks somewhat enviously at what has happened in Germany, where he sees a
good working relationship between government, industry and insurers 'to
produce something that is insurable', rather than the vague, unrealistic
demands circulating elsewhere.
Meanwhile, a number of Lloyd's underwriters are involved in separate
initiatives to develop new environmental liability products. One group is
looking at the scope for an EIL policy with a higher limit than is currently
available, while another, chaired by Special Risk Services, the financial
risk liability specialists, is examining cover for banks and other financial
institutions.
What no one is going to offer is unlimited cover on an occurrence basis,
which provides a guarantee for all time against future pollution damage. Nor
will there be much cover for existing operating sites, where insurers are
determined to avoid picking up what John Murphy, of Bankside Syndicates, who
underwrites syndicate 1156, calls 'the sins of the past'.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (15): Board
room defences highlighted - Executive protection is on the rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE seems little doubt that a key growth market lies in various forms of
corporate and personal liability.
A recent survey of the UK market for directors' and officers' (D&amp;O)
liability insurance, by the Wyatt Company, management consultants, estimated
that total premium income in the UK for D&amp;O policies had risen from Pounds
20-25m in 1989 to Pounds 40-50m in 1991. Most insurers in the market seem to
think that this is about right.
Despite this rapid growth, UK and European take-up of D&amp;O cover lags far
behind demand in the US. 'In the US, you won't get directors sitting on a
board if D&amp;O insurance is not in place,' according to Philip Foley, managing
director of brokers Minet's professional services unit. Yet a series of
pressures in recent years has been driving Europe in the same direction.
In Britain, Minet identifies more than 200 offences in the Companies Acts,
where directors and officers can be held personally liable, with more under
the Health and Safety Act 1984, the Financial Services Act 1986, the Company
Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the Insolvency Act 1986 and other
legislation.
This piercing of the corporate veil has been highlighted by a series of
court cases, including not only Barlow Clowes, Blue Arrow and Guinness, but
also the less spectacular 1990 case involving Caparo Industries, in which
auditors were held not to be liable for misleading representation of an
acquisition target's financial position. Although many expect the Caparo
ruling ultimately to be overturned, it is still seen as a milestone,
signalling a shift in liability from professional auditors to company
management, after a long period when litigation seemed to be directed
towards accountants' professional indemnity (PI) insurance.
In a period of high mergers and acquisitions activity, such as the
mid-1980s, or of recession and company failures, such as today, the risk of
such litigation is high. Mr Foley detects a worrying tendency to assume that
if something goes wrong it is not a risk for investors but one for which
management or professional advisers must be held responsible. 'Auditors have
been punished in some situations,' he says, 'because either they were the
only party left on the scene or they were the only ones who had taken their
responsibilities seriously enough to have maintained adequate insurance.'
Apart from Caparo, a lot of attention has been attracted by a 1991 case
under the Insolvency Act, in which two directors of a small company were
found personally liable for Pounds 417,000 for breach of fiduciary duties
under the the Act's 'wrongful trading' provisions.
'Small companies are terrified of Insolvency Act exposure,' according to Reg
Brown, of Octavian Underwriting, who underwrites syndicate 702. He is aware
of several hundred cases pending under the Insolvency Act.
Beyond that, there is the European Community's proposed fifth Company Law
Directive, which would introduce joint and several liability and a reversed
burden of proof. This has been delayed for years, primarily because of the
UK's objections to quite separate provisions for inclusion of worker
representatives on company boards. Parts of this directive worry even the
Americans, according to Mr Brown.
Despite these risks, most companies in the UK do not yet purchase D&amp;O cover.
Hayley Shaw, financial risks underwriting manager at Sun Alliance, estimates
that there are still probably less than 10,000 D&amp;O policies in the UK. The
Wyatt survey found that the buying of such insurance was directly related to
company size. In its sample, 74 per cent of firms with turnover above Pounds
100m had D&amp;O cover, compared with only 6 per cent of those with turnover
below Pounds 5m.
At present, the UK market is led, in terms of premium income, by two
American groups, AIU and Chubb, with Lloyd's third and Sun Alliance emerging
in fourth place. In terms of policy count, however, the survey found Sun
Alliance overtaking Lloyd's since 1989, to take second place behind AIU.
This reflects, Ms Shaw argues, the fact that her company has the widest
branch structure in the D&amp;O market, allowing it to pick up a much wider
geographical spread of business, including many small companies.
Lloyd's, however, remains ahead by premium income; and Alec Sharp, of Castle
Underwriting Agents, who underwrites syndicate 839, can see real advantages
to the policyholder from insuring this kind of personal liability business
with Lloyd's - particularly PI cover, which protects lawyers, accountants,
architects and similar professionals.
'I firmly believe that PI is very much a Lloyd's market kind of business,'
he says. This, he argues, is primarily because of the professional and
in-depth claims-handling service at which Lloyd's often excels. Architects
especially require a sensitive approach to claims, because they frequently
want to retain a client, even where he makes a claim against them.
One trend that is emerging is a cross-over between PI and D&amp;O cover, in the
form of management indemnity insurance. Minet are offering this, with Mr
Brown the lead underwriter. It is aimed at accountants employed within
companies, as opposed to independent professionals, giving them individual
liability cover, either in addition to, or in advance of, company D&amp;O
insurance.
In the long run, Mr Sharp foresees an increasingly sophisticated approach to
this kind of insurance. 'Insurers are going to know much more about the
people they insure,' he says, with a more scientific approach to the risks.
Mr Brown warns that the D&amp;O market could be heading for disaster if the
growth is seen as an easy way of making money. 'This is a long-tail class of
business, where the average claim stays outstanding for five to seven
years,' he argues. He sees evidence of the potential risks in Australia,
where the market has grown rapidly and there are reported to be in excess of
ADollars 1bn (Pounds 440m) of outstanding claims.

London's special expertise - Tom Lynch explores the complexities of the
political risk market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard enough to work out the chance of a particular house being burned
down or a particular aircraft crashing. But into other kinds of risks have
to be factored the actions of governments and of terrorists and criminals.
For Lloyd's, political risks have brought about a profitable niche market
for a relatively small number of specialist underwriters.
Insurance against kidnapping and ransom (K&amp;R) is the high-profile area of
political risk, but most of the business is older-established, less
glamorous and more complex - covering areas such as a change of government
being hostile, a bureaucracy causing delays or a central bank slowing down
its payments schedule.
Some believe a certain amount of business is still done on an old-fashioned
wing-and-a-prayer. Just as an early denizen of the Lloyd's coffee house
might back a merchantman to the Indies after supping ale with a merry fellow
who said the people had great need of woollen bonnets, so risk analysis is
still not fully understood in some areas.
The fact that good risk analysis requires a lot of expensive skilled labour
may help explain the relatively small number of significant players in the
market.
Mr Kit Brownlees, managing director of Investment Insurance International, a
division of Hogg Group, one of the leading players in commercial risks,
divides political risk into three main areas - contract frustration,
investment and personal.
Contract frustration is loss of payments to exporters, through non-payment
by governments or arising from trade embargoes or from new regimes
repudiating contracts signed by their predecessors - though not often,
apparently, on arms deals.
Some of these risks are covered by government agencies, such as the UK's
ECGD, but the private sector picks up business from countries whose
governments do not cover certain risks, and from multi-national joint
ventures with no obvious domicile.
National agencies deal in contracts paid for in cash, so one fast-growing
area for the private market is counter-trade and barter - for example, a
company selling goods in return for minerals, or financing a mine to produce
minerals.
Mr Brownlees says it is a profitable business. Countries seldom renege on
such deals, so the claims record is good, and there is a good stream of
repeat business from companies anxious to eliminate country risk from their
calculations.
Investment insurance covers confiscation or nationalisation of assets,
inability to remit profits and dividends, and conflict in its various forms,
from nuclear war to riot.
Mr Nigel Alington, a director of Hogg Insurance Brokers, says investment
risk policies are becoming more popular. Poor countries without means to buy
products encourage investors to set up factories to make them, with the
added advantage of employment, skills and technology transfer. Also, more
state-owned companies are being privatised, and foreign investors want their
assets protected.
One sideline is insuring aircraft leasing by bank consortia to Third World
airlines. A debtor country has no use for an aircraft it cannot fly abroad,
and may be able to land in only two or three places at home, so there is a
high probability of repossession in the event of default.
The ECGD stil does all UK investment insurance for major projects such as
dams and power stations. The government will also insure war risk - the
private market usually does not do war insurance on land-based assets (ships
are different, as they can be moved out of the way).
The advantage of government schemes is that capacity is, in theory,
unlimited and they can cover periods up to 25 years - whereas the private
market will usually stop at three years. But governments only cover
investors of their own nationality, and only on new projects, while a big
chunk of the private market's business comes from existing investments.
Even industries such as oil, which have long lead times, will insure
privately, renewing annually because, says Mr Alington, they can make
flexible arrangements like putting together a large portfolio of risks and
insure part of it in the normal way, with catastrophe cover for the balance.
London is the centre of the world political risk market because of Lloyd's,
which started by covering confiscation of ships and developed contract
frustration in the 1970s. It is covered as marine insurance on capacities up
to Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m per risk and uses other markets to add on.
Mr Brownlees says big contract frustration risks - over Dollars 10m or so -
need a Lloyd's lead. But capacity has shrunk along with the rest of market
and has been replaced by commercial underwriters.
For the future, Lloyd's would like to do export credit insurance, believing
that the line between that and political risk is artificial - a working
party is looking into it.
Some Lloyd's players would also like to take on the full range of war risks,
excluded in the wake of the Spanish Civil War because of the possibility of
catastrophe losses. Currently governments cover the range from nuclear war
to civil strife, while the private sector ranges from riots to terrorism.
This, says Mr Alington, leaves 'all sorts of gaps and overlaps,' with
'endless grounds for doubt on whether something is covered by a policy'.
Recent problems have concerned whether war risk insurance covered damage to
western assets in Islamic countries by rioters in sympathy with Saddam
Hussein during the Gulf war, or looting in Liberia after the civil war
there.
He and Mr Brownlees both expect increasing co-operation between the
government and private sector - the private market already reinsures some
government risks and some governments are reacting against spending a lot of
money on export credit schemes which have lost money for years.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (13): Gulf
war raises profile of kidnap insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLIGHT of people detained as part of Saddam Hussein's 'human shield' in
the Gulf war raised once again the profile of kidnap and ransom insurance,
which began to be written in the 1930s, following the Lindbergh kid-napping.
Most K&amp;R policies are taken out with criminal kidnap in mind - Colombia is
the world capital with three a day. But hostages can be taken by terrorists
demanding ransom in cash or reciprocal action, and by governments such as
Iraq's acting outside international law.
Policies reimburse any ransom paid out, and the salaries and other costs to
the insured company associated with unavailability of the staff kidnapped or
detained.
Detention is defined as a person being held against his will, provided he
has not broken the law of the country of which he is a national. It is,
admits Mr Edward Creasy, underwriter at Cassidy Davis Underwriting, a
difficult line to draw - a murderer is clearly not covered, but where
someone is imprisoned for a crime there can be a dispute about whether the
case would have stood up in the UK, or whether the charges are false.
About 500 of Saddam's detainees were insured against detention, at a loss to
the market as a whole of more than Dollars 8m. Although the affair raised
the profile of K&amp;R, it did not, says Mr Creasy ruefully, raise premium
income.
The London market has a big lead in K&amp;R, accounting for Dollars 40m of the
Dollars 70m premiums generated in the world, with Cassidy Davis writing the
lion's share of the Dollars 40m. In most years, it makes an underwriting
profit, says Cassidy Davis.
Premium income is static, and is not expected to grow substantially -
although 97 per cent of kidnaps are uninsured, most companies have by now
considered, and rejected, K&amp;R policies. Any growth is expected in specialist
areas, such as emergency political repatriation.
There are conditions on a K&amp;R policy. Perhaps the most important is that the
policy becomes void if its existence is disclosed - this prevents a company
going to a bank and raising ransom money on the back of the policy, and
conceals from terrorists who they are dealing with.
The company must also co-operate with law enforcement agencies; the insurer
reimburses the company, and will not fund a ransom payment; there is no
reimbursement where an illegal act has been committed and the policy limit
is always less than the net worth of the insured company.
In a tie-up with Control Risks, a specialist risk analysis and advisory
group, Cassidy Davis clients are offered advice on reducing the risk of
kidnap, and a crisis management service if a kidnap takes place, though most
companies prefer to pay for such services without paying insurance premiums.
Mr Charles Webb, Control Risks operations director, says inexperienced
companies often do not realise the amount of damage a company can suffer
from the abduction of one person, with the effect on moral, disruption of
business and press attention.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (11): From
Pavarotti to Nessie / A look at unusual risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S has long prided itself on being the market where anything can be
insured. Appropriate parts of actors and sports personalities, voices of
rock legends, quest for monsters in Loch Ness, cancellation of the Olympic
games, and raindrops falling on Pavarotti in the park can all be
underwritten at Lloyd's.
The attraction of such risks for Lloyd's underwriters is simple - they
provide welcome publicity and usually make money. Professional stuntmen, for
example, no matter how daring their exploits, make careful plans and take
adequate precautions.
Even a more amateurish piece of daredevilry - a voyage from Dover to Cap
Gris Nez by a merchant navy officer in a bath tub - was covered, on
condition that the bath plug remained in position at all times . . .
In some ways, the writing of such eccentric one offs best defines the hard
to define skills of underwriting - having the feel and flair to take a punt
on the unknown, and getting the rating right to make it worthwhile.
The first question an underwriter must ask, said one expert in the cover of
unusual risks, is 'Who is the client, who is the client, who is the client?'
An honest client means that a risk, no matter how extraordinary, has a good
chance of being rateable. Lloyd's prides itself on asserting that a good
underwriter can put a price on anything and do it in about three minutes, as
the broker waits at the box for the underwriter's verdict. The chances are
that a rate will be given, for after all, as an underwriter commented,
'there's lots of money to be made out of the unusual'.
One of the market sectors in which the unusual and the high value come
together is the insurance of fine art risks. Some of these are necessarily
one offs, such as the huge Van Gogh celebration in Amsterdam in 1990, which
was covered for around Dollars 3bn, or the latest selection from the Saatchi
collection now on show in London which includes a real (dead) shark in a
tank of formaldehyde.
There is also a growing market in covering wealthy households whose home
contents may include collections of art and antiques. Hiscox Insurance
Agencies (HlA), for example, was formed in June, 1990, to underwrite
high-value household business for Syndicate 33 at Lloyd's.
Personal insurance is considered to be a major growth area for the Lloyd's
market, and those individuals likely to own or occupy high-value property
are especially sought after as clients. The 606 High Value House and
Contents Insurance available from HlA includes a specialised all risks
section for fine arts, covering art, antiques or collectible items. The
cover is underwritten by Syndicate 33, which has a capacity this year of
Pounds 129m.
The syndicate writes the UK's biggest thatched house and fine art accounts
and is the leader in Lloyd's fine art risks 'from Rembrandts to classic
Ferrari cars' with an underwriting team 'particularly trained to underwrite
all the personal lines of the rich ..'
The syndicate's expertise has been built up under the supervision of HIA
chairman Robert Hiscox, and illustrates how a personal interest - Mr
Hiscox's is in fine art - can lead to a business opportunity.
ln recent years, however, as the values of fine art and antiques have risen,
so has the incidence of theft. In financial terms, art theft is now second
only to the drugs 'trade', with an annual turnover reputed to be Pounds
500m.
The Art Loss Register, established in October, 1990, with offices in London
and New York, provides a centralised computer register of stolen items. A
commercial enterprise which works closely with international police forces,
its shareholders include representatives of the art trade such as the
International Foundation for Art Research, Sotheby's and Christie's.
Insurance shareholders include Lloyd's (Lloyd's of London Press), Hogg Group
and Nordstern Insurance.
The register aims to deter art theft, aid in recoveries and help the fine
art trade avoid selling stolen property by entering stolen items on the
database. Auction catalogues and sales can be checked against the database
and stolen items located, making it more difficult for thieves to resell
them. The register will also reveal individuals who may have insured with
more than one company in the hope of collecting on multiple claims.
The hope is that by improving recoveries, deterring theft and preventing
fraud, premiums for fine art cover can be held at acceptable levels. The
existence of such a service is thus a useful marketing tool for fine art
insurers. And it works - since January 1991, the register has assisted in
the recovery of paintings by Rubens, Bonnard, Picasso, Basquiat and Twombly,
among others.
So with the Ferrari and the Rembrandt safely covered, the chance of a
relaxing round of golf being ruined by the cost of celebrations for a hole
in one taken care of, and even the likelihood of being hit by space debris
while on the fairway covered, what else could go wrong?
Well, something always can. Nicholas Thomson, underwriter of Syndicate 33
tells of the talking robot developed to teach delinquent pupils in a school
in Harlem, which had been programmed to scream 'Help, I'm being stolen.' But
when the theft eventually happened, it 'just didn't scream loud enough.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (10): Many
sense that the market is firmer - The marine underwriters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEE COPPACK

<TEXT>
LLOYD'S marine underwriters are poised between the announcement of some
unpleasant results for 1989 and 1990 and considerable optimism for the
current year.
Starting in 1991, rates for most types of marine risk, hull, liability and
energy began to harden. It may have been too late to have a significant
effect on the 1991 year, but many underwriters believe the market is now
firmer than it has been since the early 1970s.
The last closed underwriting year, 1988, produced the largest ever
underwriting loss in the Lloyd's marine market - Pounds 609.4m - and the
first since 1966. Claims, including the loss of the North Sea drilling
platform Piper Alpha and reinsurance of the tanker Exxon Valdez, exceeded
premiums by 24 per cent.
Announcing the result, Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Lloyd's
Underwriters' Association, indicated that the 1989 and 1990 years were
already showing larger than expected settlements, substantial claims, and
pressure on reinsurers, particularly excess of loss underwriters. Rates had
remained soft long after the catastrophes of 1988.
While the market's underwriting profitability peaked in 1986, capacity
increased nearly 22 per cent over the following two years, until it began to
fall slowly from 1988.
Chatset, a private organisation that analyses Lloyd's results, believes that
the marine market could make an overall loss after investment income 30 per
cent higher in 1989 than in 1988.
Within the overall results some syndicates have made good profits, while a
few have had disastrous losses. In Lloyd's the excess of loss spiral
aggravated the effect of catastrophes. And for over a decade different
marine syndicates have needed to increase reserves for old years of
liability business in the US.
But the fundamental problems are not unique to Lloyd's and have affected all
marine insurers. They are, according to Stephen Merrett, inadequate rates
and a simultaneous deterioration in the claims experience, largely a result
of falling standards of ship management.
Over the 1989, 1990 and 1991 revenue years, the London company marine market
paid 62 per cent more claims than it received in premiums. While marine
reinsurance has usually been good business for UK-based companies, 33
reported a loss ratio of more than 300 per cent for risks written during
1988 after three years.
The mutual P&amp;I clubs which insure shipowners' liabilities suffered a sharp
deterioration in claims starting in 1987. The largest of these mutuals, the
UK P&amp;I Club, with over 20 per cent of the world fleet, reserved Dollars 618m
(Pounds 361.4m) for all outstanding claims at the end of its 1989 year; by
1991 the figure had risen to Dollars 839m (Pounds 490.6m).
An informal study by the Norwegian broker, Henschien Insurance Services,
last year shows what had happened. The daily cost of the hull and liability
insurances for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) with a constant hull value
of Dollars 40m had fallen from Dollars 4,181 per day in 1971 to under
Dollars 1,000 by 1990.
These calculations were based on hull rates from Scandinavian insurers, who
have been major competitors of Lloyd's. It is widely claimed, however, that
some Lloyd's syndicates wrote reinsurances for overseas competitors at rates
which allowed them to undercut London. Between 1984 and 1989, Lloyd's share
of the world marine direct market slipped from 20.5 to 17.5 per cent.
'They have given away their own birthright,' said David Lentaigne, managing
director of broker Alexander Howden Marine. 'Can they recover it? The next
two years are make or break.'
A drop in capacity internationally, including a near disappearance of
catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance, finally strengthened the position of
the remaining underwriters. Rates and deductibles have increased materially;
policy conditions are much tighter. Lloyd's own marine capacity dropped 13.5
per cent between 1988 and 1991, and some familiar names are disappearing.
On renewal for 1992, the Dollars 40m VLCC's insurance costs would have risen
to over Dollars 3,000 a day and the owner's deductible would have doubled.
Last summer brokers were unable to complete one of the largest facilities in
the London marine market, the energy master lineslip, on which many of the
world's largest and most expensive offshore facilities had been written. The
limit of cover for any one unit had reached Dollars 850m in 1988/9 (Pounds
497.1m), but last year even Dollars 500m (Pounds 292.4m) could not be
placed.
When the excess of loss reinsurance for the pool of international P&amp;I clubs,
who cover the liabilities of over 90 per cent of the world's seagoing
tonnage, was renewed in February, the retentions increased, the top limit
reduced and rates went up between 91 and 144 per cent depending on the type
of ship.
'The collapse of the reinsurance market is a very healthy thing,' commented
leading underwriter Ian Agnew of the Wellington Underwriting Agency. 'It
forces people to think very clearly about the way they are writing business
as they know they are running their own risk.'
Although Lloyd's lost part of its share of the direct marine market, the
task force looking into Lloyd's future said: 'It continues to be seen by
brokers as the clear leader in marine and aviation, although in both markets
it faces intense competition from the company markets.'
Besides improving rates and conditions, marine underwriters in Lloyd's and
the London market took advantage of their stronger position to tighten terms
of trade with the aim of improving the cash flow from brokers. They also
introduced a new warranty giving underwriters more powers to require surveys
of ships not considered in satisfactory condition.
There is still competition on some risks, particularly cargo, though even
this often difficult class of underwriters has been tightening terms of
cover and not renewing the least profitable facilities. A few shipowners
have moved their insurance out of London altogether. There is still enough
capacity in other markets, but it means that Lloyd's underwriters are
refusing to cut prices to gain premium.
Leading underwriter Richard Youell of the Janson Green agency says there is
now more cohesion among the underwriters. He stresses the importance of
underwriters taking a market perspective which will ultimately work to the
good of their names.
'The concept of spread preached by members' agents means that many names
will be on most of the major marine syndicates; when they compete among
themselves on price, the member will pick up the business at the lowest
possible price.'
Marine underwriting years remain open for three years because it takes that
long for a fair picture of the result to develop. It will be some time,
then, before it is clear whether 1992 has marked a critical point in marine
underwriting.
Stephen Merrett thinks that the improvements may last a little while. 'I
cannot believe that the amount of money being lost will be forgotten
overnight.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (9): Risk in
a cool climate - Norma Cohen finds that the coffee-shop spirit survives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR all the high-tech 20th century facade of the Lloyd's insurance market,
the heart and soul of the business remain what they were 300 years ago - a
group of men meeting in a coffee shop.
Unlike the trading floors of the world's leading equities and commodities
exchanges, occasionally the site of frenzied dealing, Lloyd's on a busy day
consists of hordes of dark-suited brokers patiently lining up at
underwriters' 'boxes'.
Seated or kneeling, they bargain with the underwriters, hoping to persuade
each to accept a portion of risk in return for the smallest possible fee.
Oil rigs, satellites, ships and international trade transactions are all
assets which can collapse at any time, causing devastating losses for their
owners. Underwriters, in short, agree to bear these losses if they occur and
charge a fee for their risk.
Unlike London's other major financial exchanges, Lloyd's temperature never
reaches fever pitch, even in the most trying times.
On the day of the insurance market's greatest single disaster - the
destruction of the Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea - unflappable
brokers went about their business in the usual fashion.
Calculating how much risk is worth is the job of the underwriter. 'It's
really much more an art than a science,' said Stephen Adams, of S E Adams,
head of an insurance syndicate specialising in excess of loss reinsurance.
Mr Adams ought to know. He joined the Lloyd's insurance market as a clerk
with an agency group in 1971 as an 18-year old school leaver with shoulder
length hair. 'I took the job because it paid Pounds 25 a year more than the
others,' he said. While many underwriters and brokers are clever barrow boys
whose education stopped at 16, a large number are university graduates and a
significant group are public school educated. Patrick Cunningham, an
underwriter in Mr Adams' syndicate, joined Lloyd's after a brief stint as a
milkman following graduation from Warwick University with a degree in
economics.
Salaries at Lloyd's vary widely but internal statistics show that a third of
all underwriters earn more than Pounds 100,000 a year - a figure that
understates actual earnings because it does not include the fees they pay
themselves as directors of agencies. Those directors' fees have now been
called into question by MPs who have been examining the pattern of losses at
Lloyd's.
In 1987, Mr Adams struck out on his own, forming his own syndicate backed by
'names' - wealthy individuals who pledge to use their entire personal wealth
to cover losses, if necessary. 'I see my main responsibility as making money
for my names,' said Mr Adams, summing up his role.
Mr Adams's day, like that of most other underwriters, begins at 7:45am in
his office. By 11:00am he has migrated to the Lloyd's building, joining
streams of like-suited gentlemen parading past the so-called 'waiters' in
red morning coats and top hats who staff the Lloyd's floor.
Mr Adams says publicly what some other underwriters will only say after a
few drinks - that some of the industry's woes must be laid squarely at its
own doorstep. 'Eighty per cent of these guys are unrealistic. and they are
driven by ego.'
Like himself, many underwriters got their feet wet by working for a large
agency group. When they finally strike out on their own, their sense of
power leads them to underwrite risks they do not properly understand.
In the early and mid-1980s the sudden surge in worldwide personal wealth
spawned a new generation of Lloyd's names, many from outside the UK and who
had never previously considered insurance as an investment. With fresh cash
sloshing around, underwriters undercut each other, offering lower and lower
premiums for high risk.
'My agency group hired a guy in 1984 to try to attract some American names.
They sent him to Georgia with a book of contacts and told him to come up
with four Names. He joined a golf club and signed up 84,' recalled one
underwriter.
The influx of cash had an electrifying effect on the lifestyles of
underwriters and brokers alike. 'A lot of marriages broke up in the early
1980s,' said one underwriter, adding that his own had succumbed as well. Too
many Lloyd's members - almost exclusively male - used their newfound wealth
to take women out on the town.
Meanwhile, underwriters must be distinguished from the brokers, with whom a
fragile relationship exists. A broker is a go-between, acting for the
insured, whose job is to persuade underwriters to accept the highest
possible risk for the lowest possible fee.
One of the most successful brokers is reputed to have earned more than
Pounds 1m last year, and not for nothing.
One underwriter, recalling the man's superb style, said he has 'a way of
patting you on the shoulder. All of a sudden I was being invited to dinner
at Carlton Towers (a posh London hotel) and flying by helicopter to the
races at Ascot. He wanted to be my best friend.'
It is a broker's job to keep underwriters happy. They are the source of many
of the Lloyd's perks - from football tickets to golfing holidays in France
to nights out in the West End. 'One guy I knew had been driving a 15-year
old Ford escort. All of a sudden he had a Jaguar] I knew where that came
from,' said one underwriter.
On the other hand, Lloyd's is a very small world and blatant bribery will
not be effective for long. A broker who habitually urges high-risk
low-profit business on underwriters will quickly find himself getting a cold
shoulder at underwriters' 'boxes'.
Regulators of all stripes have been calling for reform of the Lloyd's market
for years. In the early 1980s following a particularly devastating set of
losses for members of some syndicates, a set of regulatory reforms for
Lloyd's was introduced with much fanfare. But those have glaring failed to
prevent the sort of losses Names are now facing and members now agree the
market has finally taken reform to heart.
'Those were early days then,' said Mr Reg Brown, of RE Brown said. 'We all
thought we were bomb-proof.' He said the market was finally taken a more
business-like view of itself, a departure from the clubby days of old. 'I
have always said to my lads, 'We're nothing more than a sweet shop.' If we
don't open up in the morning, we don't sell sweets. If we don't sell sweets,
we don't make a profit.'
And the 'lads' at Lloyd's are getting the message.
Ironically, for all its significance in the world's insurance business, the
revolution of the 1980s appears to have touched Lloyd's little in many key
ways. For instance, the number of female underwriters can be counted on one
hand, although a number are employed as brokers.
But members insist there is no sex discrimination. 'Oh we make a special
effort to get the ladies. Any one that comes within a whisker of our box on
February 14 gets a chocolate heart,' said one underwriter.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (8): Acts of
God and of man - A crescendo of disasters has hit the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A wry smile, Lloyd's deputy chairman, Dick Hazell, readily concedes
that the unprecedented worldwide string of natural catastrophe and other
large insured losses which began with the October 1987 storms in southern
England have been 'an unhappy' experience for the market.
Since participation at Lloyd's is on a partly-paid basis (Names Action Group
chairman Peter Nutting candidly calls it a 'barely-paid' basis) a series of
large claims requiring prompt settlement will necessarily strain cash flow.
Less often identified, but also very important, is the burden of
administration as claims successively trigger reinsurance protections.
It is not only Lloyd's underwriters who are affected, Mr HazeIl points out:
the company market is faced with the same difficulty, and London-based
brokers are faced with the task of making collections not just on their
doorstep but from companies all over the world.
In the wake of the heavy losses suffered by reinsurers and in the
retrocession market (which provides insurance cover to the reinsurers
themselves) there has inevitably been a reduction in those willing to
underwrite catastrophe business, and the premium which those remaining in
the market demand has risen sharply.
According to the traditional insurance cycle, the resulting improvement in
the ratio of premium to exposure to risk should restore the attractiveness
of catastrophe-level cover, provided that the frequency of large losses
returns to historical norms.
Major reinsurance companies such as Swiss Re and Munich Re have both
expressed concern that this may prove not to be the case, and in such
circumstances it is hardly surprising that underwriters at Lloyd's and
elsewhere have taken the view that if a general upturn in insurance rates is
on its way, it is preferable to wait and take advantage of more predictable
and less inherently high-risk business.
The possibility of a long-term change in weather patterns as an effect of
global warming is only one of the issues involved. As a result of the
development of manufacturing processes and the organisation of both
industrial and service operations, losses from man-made causes such as big
fires or pollution incidents which approach those associated with natural
catastrophes such as hurricanes or earthquake can now be regarded as
inevitable.
The first industrial accident to generate an insured loss of Dollars 1bn was
the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil platform in the North Sea in 1988,
followed in 1989 by another at a Philips Petroleum plant in Pasadena. In
both cases, an important element in addition to the concentration of value
represented by expensive equipment was cover for loss of business as closure
of centralised production facilities disrupted related areas of production.
The chemical industry provides an almost insoluble problem for the insurer
in these terms, Mr HazeIl points out. Under normal conditions, the world
market will be in a state of marginal oversupply. A single major loss will
transform that to undersupply, which a second will multiply, creating a
level of exposure to which the insurance cover was not designed to respond.
The same development is observable in the service sector with the
development of very large retail units and centralised distribution
networks.
Not all insurers and reinsurers of catastrophe business have withdrawn from
the market.
Mr HazeIl continues to underwrite catastrophe business in the same basis as
he has since 1985, although since the spectacular market-wide losses of 1988
he has done so on a basis of greater premium income and lower exposure.
Mr HazeIl's syndicate also carries its catastrophe book without reinsurance.
Instead, the overall exposure to losses from natural catastrophe is limited,
and the effect of a loss on the overall results of the syndicate mitigated
by a broad spread of other business - a classical Lloyd's underwriter's
approach.
In Mr Hazell's view, there is no reason why such a first reinsurance account
should not form part of a prudent underwriter's book, nor part of a prudent
Name's portfolio of interests. The number of reinsureds will tend to be
small and stable, and each will typically be a relatively major player in
the particular catastrophe-prone area. As a result, the client will be more
responsive to the reinsurer's needs.
One example is the Japanese agricultural mutual Zenkyoren, which suffered
heavy losses from Typhoon 19 in September last year. 'There was no continual
worsening of the claim. We knew the exposure and paid out the Pounds 200m
within eight weeks,' Mr HazeIl comments, adding that the cover has been
renewed at a higher premium. 'I tell my clients we never pay claims, but we
occasionally lend them money,' he says with an ironic laugh.
Reinsurance brokers with a client who has a clean loss record will often
argue that it justifies a discount at times when rates in general are
rising. 'That's a fallacy,' Mr Hazell says. 'We need to return to the
realisation that once a premium is paid and cover offered, that premium has
been fully earned.' Furthermore, everybody will have to pay towards the
catastrophe cover that their insurer needs to buy.
Brokers are trying to find more underwriters who will replace lost
catastrophe capacity or provide an alternative.
There are franchise covers, for example, which respond to a dual trigger of
individual exposure and overall loss. These Mr HazeIl describes as 'a
perfectly fair and reasonable way of buying reinsurance'. So-called
financial or finite risk reinsurance is also widely touted, but that is
still a weapon which Lloyd's cannot have in its armoury.
Mr Hazell sees no difficulty in brokers rather than underwriters providing
the impetus for innovations in the field, which he considers is their job.
Lloyd's underwriters have 'no idea' what the public, or the insurance buyer
or reinsurance buyer wants, as face to face business is done with the
broker: 'That's how we work.'
Although Mr HazeIl remains uncertain about the wisdom of reinsuring
catastrophe exposures as a speciality or at a secondary level, others are
more sanguine.
Despite the well-publicised losses on the so-called LMX spiral, some
underwriters who provided such cover in the past continue to do so, although
the cost is higher and the cover offered more clearly segmented. Whole
account protection can still be obtained, but the terms divide the world
into Americas and non-Americas, and the insured perils into elemental and
man-made.
In order to trigger the policy, two categories must be affected. This
two-risk warranty avoids whole account cover responding to a single insured
event such as Piper Alpha, which, its proponents argue, was not what such
policies were intended to do.
What of the long-term future of Lloyd's as a catastrophe insurance market?
'It's not a question of the long-term. It's here and now,' Mr Hazell says.
'The sort of market we're in here, where people will back their judgment
with their own cash is ideally suited to catastrophe business.'

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (6): A
blizzard of litigation - Lawyers in US and Europe have a field-day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELL OVER 1,000 Names are currently involved in legal battles with their
agents and with Lloyd's corporation.
It all seems a long way from the friendly spirit which permeated the Lloyd's
insurance market when it began. How did it happen?
Few of the litigant Names would deny that they entered the market with their
eyes open. But the risks they thought they were taking on involved
industrial disasters like the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion, or the wreck of
the Exxon Valdez, or natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo, or the storms
which ravaged Europe in October 1987, and again in January 1990.
The fact that all of these events happened in quick succession made things
very difficult for the market.
But Names seem to have been enraged more by the way in which the market
protected itself against these risks, which many saw as inadequate, and more
particularly by their exposure to risks which they barely knew existed.
Asbestosis claims in the US provide arguably the most dramatic example of a
risk which Names felt they never understood - exploding oil rigs were one
thing, but the personal damages suffered by US employees who caught
asbestosis were another.
The field of US liability insurance also produced losses from
government-ordered pollution clean-ups for which Names had not been
prepared. These led to losses on 'long-tail' liability business in which
claims emerge sometimes many years after the business was written. Few Names
had understood that this kind of loss was even technically possible, and
they were certainly not prepared for them.
Bemused reactions were typical: one Name commented that he did not mind
going to the races and losing money on a horse, but he did mind losing the
money if the horse had been doped.
This probably explains why the first serious litigation involved a syndicate
which had reinsured a series of US liability contracts and come seriously
unstuck - Outhwaite.
Many of these Names certainly felt that their 'horse' had been 'doped'
following insurance losses of Pounds 200m on just 32 reinsurance contracts
underwritten in 1982 by the one-time star underwriter of Lloyd's syndicate
317/661, Richard Outhwaite. All of these contracts reinsured the liabilities
of other insurers, mostly Lloyd's syndicates.
Overall losses for the 1,614 Names on the syndicate amount to more than
Pounds 200m and are rising. A group of 987 Names exposed to these losses
resorted to litigation alleging negligence and breach of contract. They were
represented by Richards Butler. It culminated, this February, in an
out-of-court settlement.
The Names shared Pounds 116m, including Pounds 2m for legal costs, between
them in a result which Mr Peter Nutting, the leader of the Outhwaite 1982
Names Association, described as a 'thoroughly satisfactory outcome to a long
and difficult road'.
Most of the Names - including the former prime minister Mr Edward Heath and
golfer Mr Tony Jacklin - were 'outsiders'. Members of the syndicate who had
not joined in the litigation - mostly working Names or market 'insiders' -
failed to join the action or benefit from the pay-out.
In another case to have reached a settlement, some 500 Names on the Warrilow
553 syndicate, represented by the solicitors Elborne Mitchell, won a Pounds
4m out-of-court settlement including legal costs on But there are many other
actions still under way. A group of 33 Names is suing Lloyd's alleging it
negligently failed to close the Oakeley Vaughan agency before the syndicates
it managed ran up heavy losses. They are represented by the solicitor
Michael Freeman.
About 175 Names, represented by Macfarlanes, from Aragorn syndicate 384's
1985 year have also decided to embark on legal action in a bid to recover
insurance losses.
Writs have been issued and served in three other cases. More than 400 Names
on Pulbrook syndicate 90's 1982 year, more than 320 of the 570 Names on
Pulbrook 334 in 1985 and more than 400 of the 800 Names on Poland syndicates
105 (1985 year) and 108 (1986 year) are all taking action. All three groups
are advised by solicitors DJ Freeman and are alleging breach of contract and
misrepresentation by members' agents and negligence by managing agents.
More than 790 Names on Feltrim, Devonshire, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson
Young syndicates, represented by Michael Freeman, are issuing motions to
seek an injunction preventing Lloyd's from drawing down their deposits. This
added a dramatic new legal development to the problem, as it effectively
adds up to a refusal to pay for their losses.
Following the decision by Lloyd's to contest the action, injunctions are
against the agents, who have agreed to freeze their deposits until the cases
come to court. All of these hearings are imminent.
In the US, litigious Names have relied on a slightly different set of legal
arguments. They claim that they were systematically misled by the agents who
persuaded them to join Lloyd's, and are therefore not liable to pay their
losses.
Three Names brought a case in a Chicago district court alleging that
agreements signed with Lloyd's and the agents who handle their affairs
should not be enforced because Names' rights to the protection of US laws
took precedence.
But the Chicago court upheld Lloyd's contention that under these agreements
any disputes must be heard in English courts. A motion by Lloyd's to dismiss
the entire case is still pending before the same judge. Last autumn, a
federal judge in Denver also found that the US courts had no jurisdiction
over similar plaintiffs' claims, and an appeal has been lodged against that
ruling.
However, a third case brought against Lloyd's and a group of agents by 91 US
Names is still awaiting a hearing in the US.
At least 91 US Names allege Lloyd's breached US securities laws when they
were recruited. They are represented by Proskauer Rose, the New York firm.
In Canada, about 70 Names - represented by the Toronto law firm McCarthy
Tetrault - are in the midst of a case against Lloyd's.
They are appealing against a verdict in Lloyd's favour on a preliminary
issue, but have so far successfully prevented banks from drawing down their
deposits.
The sums involved in all these litigations are massive, and in many cases
the Names have their livelihoods at stake. There is a lack of much precedent
in case law for many of the arguments currently being presented, so legal
wrangling is set to last for years.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (7): Echoes
of the City's Big Bang - Electronic dealing has revolutionised the business
</HEADLINE>

TODAY sees the live launch of the first phase of the electronic placing
support system for the London insurance market. The system will allow
brokers and underwriters to transmit and receive, over the LIMNET network,
structured messages which contain the information needed to support the
placing of insurance.
Translation software converts those messages to and from a format
understandable by the brokers' and underwriters' in-house computer systems.
The system is being implemented under the title Joint Market Initiative
(JMI), and it represents a significant development in the methods of
insurance trading in London and especially at Lloyd's.
It is arguably Lloyd's most important step to date regarding new technology
and electronic data interchange initiatives (edi).
It is called the joint initiative because it involves the whole of the
London insurance market, embracing insurance company members of the
Institute of London Underwriters (ILU) who transact marine, aviation and
transport insurance; members of the London Insurance and Re-insurance Market
Association (LIRMA) who transact non-marine business; Lloyd's syndicates;
and brokers in the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee (LIBC).
Important as it is, the JMI should not be seen in isolation from other
networking initiatives in the London market, particularly those involving
claims handling, launched since LIMNET was set up in 1987. Developments
include:
more than 850 brokers and underwriters have access to LIMNET, utilising more
than 30,000 computer terminals;
28 per cent of all non-marine, property and casualty insurance claims have
been settled over the network by members of LIRMA using ELASS (Electronic
Loss Advice and Settlement System) since the system was introduced in
November 1988. In 1991 the figure averaged 36 per cent, and it has reached
55 per cent in recent months. In 1991, 81,000 claims advices were notified
on ELASS;
20 per cent of all marine, aviation and transport insurance claims have been
settled over the network by ILU members using CLAMS (Claims Management
System) since the system was introduced in July 1990. In 1991, the figure
averaged 22 per cent and current usage rates are in excess of 25 per cent.
In 1991, 20,169 claims advices were notified on CLAMS;
both LIRMA and ILU are looking to 100 per cent use of ELASS and CLAMS using
a standard claims message system by the start of next year. Lloyd's has
streamlined its claims procedures and the whole market is moving towards a
unified electronic claims system;
regarding signing, accounting and settlement information, around 20,000
transactions per day are being received by LIRMA and ILU members; more than
half of Lloyd's syndicates receive the underwriters' signing message (USM)
amounting to 6,000 advices per day; 65 broking organisations are receiving
daily signings and settlement information from Lloyd's, LIRMA and the ILU.
An estimated 80 per cent of daily signing information is now transacted via
LIMNET.
Other initiatives allow: outward reinsurance debit and credit transactions
to be processed over LIMNET (saving ultimately up to 800,000 pieces of paper
per year at Lloyds alone); processing of year-end excess of loss
adjustments; electronic mail with links between London market participants
and abroad.
The first phase of the Joint Market Initiative will involve all members of
the ILU and LIRMA, syndicates from 19 Lloyd's managing agents (around 65
syndicates in all), and some of the larger members of the LIBC.
More participants will join in progressively during 1992 and by the end of
the year 19 brokers accounting for 85 per cent of London market business
will be on board.
The placing support system will allow the preparation on screen by the
broker of a risk package or proposal; the obtaining of quotes from leading
and supporting underwriters (the creation by the broker, and confirmation by
underwriters, of a Firm Order package); the transmission of a Signed Line
message to underwriters confirming the insurance package (a facility for
processing Endorsements to a risk package held on the system); the ability
to notify and process individual declarations off Line Slips where the
leading underwriter has the authority to accept a risk on behalf of other
underwriters.
The system allows several tiers of participation. At the lowest level, the
placing of a risk will involve face to face contact between broker and
underwriter, with the traditional paper 'slip' containing details of the
risk complemented by electronic provision of a 'common core record'
(comprising the main details of the risk in a structured format), and other
electronic support information.
The paper slip will remain the basis of the contract at this level. At a
higher level, face to face contact will utilise an electronic version of the
slip, along with electronic supporting information. The underwriter will
'write' the line on the system and the electronic information will form the
basis of the contract. At the highest level there will be no face to face
contact between broker and underwriter, all contact being made remotely over
the network. Again the electronic information will form the basis of the
contract.
Dennis Purkiss, Chief Executive of the underwriting division of Merrett
Holdings, a managing agent of Lloyd's syndicates, argues that the JMI
electronic placing support initiative is 'the key to the future of the
market'.
Terry Hayday, chief executive, insurance services, at Sturge Holdings,
another managing agent, and chairman of the Lloyd's network steering group
(NSG), argues that 'this is the way forward, the way to enable the London
insurance market to compete in the next century'.
Similar sentiments were expressed in the Rowland task force which argued
that developments such as the JMI will 'strengthen London's collective
appeal as a market and reduce the costs to brokers of bringing business to
Lloyd's and the London market companies'.
Max Taylor, managing director of reinsurance brokers Willis Faber &amp; Dumas
(part of the Willis Corroon group) and chairman of the London network
management committee, says that the electronic placing system will support
the brokers' job which is primarily 'the negotiation of business and premium
for our clients'.
According to Mr Taylor, a considerable amount of face to face business will
be underlined by being able to put the information on the screen. However,
there is a 'whole range of the business that occurs even in a complicated
risk that will be made massively easier by the electronic system, for
example endorsements', he says.
Brokers would benefit in two ways - first, higher efficiency enabling
increased responsiveness to clients' needs; second, the commercial
opportunities to be grasped by individual participants to 'utilise the
network in ways that will enhance and increase their business'.
Terry Hayday says that there have been objections from 'Luddite' sections of
the market but that enthusiasm is now increasing. 'Support for technology in
general has been given a great big affirmation by the Rowland task force.'
Dennis Purkiss also notices growing support: 'in the last six months people
have seen the system working (at demonstrations) and there are now more open
minds', he says. This enthusiasm has been built up gradually throughout the
market since it became obvious that if the ILU, LIRMA, and Lloyd's all took
different paths chaos would ensue.
The launch of the JMI should not be seen as rerun of the 1986 'big bang' in
the London Stock Exchange. An insurance transaction is generally much more
complicated than, say, a share transaction, and the London insurance market
offers a bespoke service to clients. It is not possible to force everyone
down the same route on the same day.
Comparisons with the 'big bang' are also wide of the mark in another
respect. The City 'big bang' obviated the need for face to face contact
between jobber and broker. But direct contact between insurance brokers and
underwriters will still be vital in the London insurance market following
the JMI launch, although it will not always be ideal in every situation.
Initially, there will be benefits from a reduction in the time required to
place risks. For standard risks and simple tasks, such as agreeing an
endorsement, underwriters can be presented with the relevant information
speedily over the network. Time saved can be spent developing new business,
while increased efficiency may allow London to gain business that was
previously uneconomic to place there, particularly at the high volume, low
risk end of the market.
Underwriters will gain access to important information on risk exposure as
soon as the lines are written, rather than having to wait for closing. Also,
because the risk information is entered once, there is less scope for
mistakes.
Further ahead lies the prospect of integration of electronic placing,
claims, and accounting systems thereby providing even greater back office
efficiency.
Dennis Purkiss says that electronic placing will 'help produce business that
we wouldn't otherwise see in Lloyd's via link ups with other networks,' such
as RINET in Europe and the Brokers and Reinsurers Market Association (BRMA)
and the Reinsurers Association of America (RAA) in the US.
Terry Hayday concludes that the market 'has got the people, got the talent,
and has now got the systems' to support those attributes in the most
efficient manner.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (5): The
unflappable man in the hot seat - The chairman discusses his troubles with
Richard Lapper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'SO MUCH venom without facts. So much outpouring. The market is very numb,'
says Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's.
'They have never been treated like this before. They are very miserable,' he
adds summing up the demoralisation at the Lloyd's insurance market.
Certainly both Lloyd's and Mr Coleridge have had a rough ride since he took
over as chairman of Lloyd's at the end of 1990. Last year, his first in
office, was bad enough as the market posted its first losses for more than
20 years when it reported its 1988 results in June.
This year will be far worse. As Lloyd's prepares to report record losses for
1989 the market has been subject to ferocious criticism from loss making
Names. During February a highly effective publicity campaign by Names'
organisations has left the market enveloped in a cloud of bad publicity.
Increasingly Mr Coleridge himself has come under attack. Unimpressed by his
displays of sympathy with their fate, angry Names who have been quick to
point out the contrast between their own difficulties and Mr Coleridge's own
immense personal wealth - earned in 30 years underwriting at the market.
His image - his old Etonian background and style - have sometimes undermined
his ability to present Lloyd's case in the media. And he has been an obvious
target for those Labour MPs who have joined in a campaign of Lloyd's bashing
in the House of Commons instigated by Conservatives who have lost money at
the market.
Even some of Mr Coleridge's strongest erstwhile supporters, the successful
businessmen who head up Lloyd's bigger agencies and brokers, have directed
their frustration about Lloyd's problems in Mr Coleridge's direction.
But for a man at the centre of a crisis Mr Coleridge maintains a remarkably
unflappable air. Last month, market gossip predicting his imminent
resignation had apparently not percolated up to Mr Coleridge's spacious
office at the top of the Lloyd's building.
Simply posing the question of resignation was 'silly', said Mr Coleridge.
'I've been asked to be chairman of Lloyd's for another year and I've done
two months,' he says insisting that he intends to complete his term of
office. There had been no letters calling for his resignation and the
Lloyd's Council had not indicated that it wanted 'a change of captain'.
If the Council was to say 'look chairman we know you're doing your level
best but quite honestly your level best isn't good enough so do the decent
thing or we've got to throw you out', he would 'of course think hard about
it,' he said.
In the meantime, he was aiming to re-establish morale and confidence at the
market: 'If everyone goes on running down this business here, people will
begin to say they don't want a Lloyd's policy. The whole thing will be in a
state of total disarray and that will be an absolute disaster.'
An initial goal was to 'kick to death' the allegations raised by MPs that
market insiders were benefiting to the detriment of outside Names. Mr
Coleridge had appointed Sir David Walker, the chairman of the Securities and
Investment Board, to head up an investigation into the charges. Sir David
would look carefully into the mechanics of the 'spiral', the way Lloyd's
syndicates and London market companies insure each other against catastrophe
losses, which - it is alleged - has systematically favoured working Names.
Sir David's independence and integrity was such that if he were to find that
the allegations were unfounded this would be accepted. 'I needed a man who
is so white that snow white looks dirty,' said Mr Coleridge. 'If Sir David
puts his mark on a document there is no need to go further.'
If on the other hand the investigation were to discover that 'it is true in
a section - however small - of our society that somebody had been doing
something that they shouldn't', Lloyd's own regulatory machine would be
brought into action. 'We will either demolish the accusations or get hold of
the wrongdoers and string 'em up.'
But for the moment at least Mr Coleridge has little to offer Names facing
large losses and insists that these must be met even if, by paying, Names
are driven to the mercies of the hardship committee. In particular, Lloyd's
would resist legal moves by Names to prevent draw downs on their deposits.
This threatened the 'lifeblood of our operation'.
Names were perfectly free to sue but must pay claims first. 'We can have
'can't payers' but we can't have non-payers who are wilfully trying to
prevent us meeting our obligations.' The action by more than 790 Names,
represented by solicitor, Mr Michael Freeman, would be resisted
"vigorously'.
'We'll fight the case for ever and a day. If on some technicality they get a
result that is damaging - then we'd have to apply to the House of Lords at
once.' The best answer for Names was to trade out of their difficulties - by
paying past losses with future profits - if at all possible.
He described 1989 as a 'horrific catastrophe year on a low rate basis' and
said the damage had been done. Claims from US asbestosis and pollution were
a problem but 'Lloyd's was better reserved than practically any other
insurance operator'. A few point profit would be shown for 1991 and with
rates now hardening better times were on the horizon for 1992, 1993 and
1994.
In the longer term the implementation of the recommendations of the market
task force which reported in January would improve the market's efficiency
and profitability. Working groups were meeting to study ways in which the
recommendations should be implemented. Sir Jeremy Morse was heading up one
on reforms to the way Lloyd's is governed.
There had been consternation in the market at Mr Coleridge's initial
rejection of the separation of the regulatory and business development
functions of the Council as 'codswallop and absolute hot air'. He now
acknowledged that the rejection had been a mistake, even though he belived
the reasons behind it - potential delays to the implementation of other task
force recommendations - were valid.
When the 'governance question comes up it can't be settled quickly. I tried
to settle it and it wasn't acceptable. But still that is now water under the
bridge. I don't mind changing my mind. I don't find it embarrassing - I
don't find I've lost face.'

<TEXT>
all of which have been accepted by the Lloyd's Council - include both short
term and long-term measures. A number of working groups are now examining
how a number of changes can be implemented. Among the most important:
The establishment of a compulsory stop loss scheme, financed by a levy on
Names, which would cap all losses over a four year period at a level
equivalent to their premium limits. A Name underwriting Pounds 500,000, for
example, would have all losses above Pounds 500,000 - incurred over a four
year period - paid from the fund. Liability could return to the individual
if the fund is exhausted, although the task force saw this as happening only
if the market as a whole were collapsing.
The setting-up of members' agents pooling arrangements, or Mapas, to allow
agents to pool all the syndicate participations of the Names whose affairs
they handle, to spread risks and rewards more evenly. The agent would pool
all portfolios and allocate units in the pool to Names, constructing a kind
of unit trust, as distinct from a separate portfolio of participations on
separate syndicates for each Name.
New measures to deal with open years - which syndicate managers are unable
to close because of uncertainty over the size of future claims usually
arising from liability business, in which claism can arise many years aftert
the inception of policies. CentreWrite, the company created by Lloyd's in
July last year, to reinsure open years should shift its focus from
syndicates to individual Names.
Syndicates should be allowed to increase the business they write by making
more use of reinsurance from outside the market and should also be
encouraged to co-insure risks with companies via consortium arrangements.
Names should be given rights akin to those enjoyed by shareholders,
including the rights to: continue participation in a syndicate, replace
their managing agents, approve major syndicate transactions, access
syndicate information and hold regular meetings of their syndicates.
In the longer term three important proposals would require legislative
changes: the introduction of limited-liability capital, the creation of a
secondary market for syndicate participation and the abolition of the rule
obliging Lloyd's brokers to sell any majority interests in managing agents.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (3): A time
for disentanglement - Reform will end Lloyd's peculiar intimacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL this year, it looked as if the regulatory issues which bedevilled
Lloyd's throughout the 1970s had been finally laid to rest by the reforms of
the early 1980s.
Though Lloyd's problems were pressing, as was freely acknowledged in the
Rowland task force report on the market's future published in January 1992,
they were seen as essentially commercial. The Lloyd's Act of 1982 had
settled Lloyd's regulatory issues once and for all, it was argued, and the
seal of approval had been given to those reforms by Sir Patrick Neill's
inquiry into how they were operating later in the decade.
The Neill inquiry's verdict was quoted in the Rowland report in January. In
the few months since then, however, it has become clear that regulation is
still a live issue at Lloyd's, one which may yet decide whether the market
is permanently enfeebled by the problems of the 1990s.
It is Lloyd's commercial problems - in particular the heavy losses on
catastrophe insurance in the late 1980s - which have brought the regulatory
issues back to the forefront. The losses have revived a time-honoured debate
about the treatment afforded 'outside' Names - those who do not work in the
market, but participate solely through their commitment of capital - as
compared with the 'working' names who earn their livings as underwriters,
brokers and other active market participants. Outsiders have always grumbled
that they are excluded from the best, most profitable syndicates, which were
reserved, they alleged, for those who had good market connections, and
especially for those who were able to bring business to the syndicate
managers. These complaints would have stayed at the level of grumbling had
the scale of the losses not suddenly made the treatment of outsiders a hot
issue once again. The problem stems from a distinctive feature of the way
Lloyd's is organised: the intimately entwined nature of the relationships
between insiders at Lloyd's. For example, brokers who bring business to the
market are often also Names in their own right. Underwriters on a syndicate
are obliged, by Lloyd's regulation, to participate in the risks as Names on
that syndicate; but they may well be members of other syndicates also.
The reforms of the early 1980s, by forbidding brokers from owning managing
agents, cut one of the links binding the parts of the market together, but
many others remain: managing agents are permitted to own members' agents,
for example.
Traditionally, this intimate involvement has been seen as one of Lloyd's
strengths. And with good reason: since brokers were forced to divest their
managing agents a decade ago, their involvement in the Lloyd's market has
become notably less intimate, and a steadily rising proportion of their
business is now funnelled elsewhere, bypassing Lloyd's entirely. A market
which severed all its internal links might well be one which served its
members and its customers less well. The nature of the relationships between
working Names, however, makes them vulnerable to accusations of favouritism.
In the good years, the marked contrast between the intimately entwined world
of the working Names and the essentially passive, long-distance involvement
of the outsiders causes no more than the occasional grumble. In the bad
years, it becomes explosive. The issue has been exacerbated by what in
retrospect is generally agreed to have been a misguided campaign to promote
membership of Lloyd's to people whose finances could not stand the risks
associated with unlimited liability.
In the late 1980s, many of these undercapitalised new members were sucked
straight into the rapidly growing LMX syndicates, which insure other
syndicates against unexpectedly high losses. These had been very profitable
in the mid 1980s, and thus appeared particularly attractive to the new
joiners - but they were among the worst money-losers when a series of
disasters struck the market at the end of the decade.
Many of the Names worst affected by these losses have been campaigning for
some form of 'market settlement' - a sharing out of the burden across the
market as a whole. They had waited, with scarcely concealed impatience, for
the Rowland task force report, which they hoped might lead to such a
proposal. Instead, Rowland set its face against the retrospective
mutualisation of risk, partly on principle, and partly because such a
proposal would have split the working party - and the market leadership -
beyond repair.
Once it became clear that loss-making Names could not expect to be rescued
by the Rowland task force, the activists among them highlighted the issue of
the relationship between working and outside names. By focusing on
allegations of improper dealing, they hoped to attract the attention of
press and politicians to their cause and to strengthen the case for a market
settlement. If improper actions have taken place, their argument goes, then
the market as a whole is responsible for the failure of supervision that has
allowed some members to profit at the expense of others; and the market as a
whole must therefore shoulder the financial burden.
The issue has become so divisive that Lloyd's has asked Sir David Walker,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board and an ex-officio member of
the Lloyd's Council, to investigate. His report, due later this spring,
should resolve the truth or falsity of the allegations.
The heat that the issue has generated, and the scale of the losses of the
worst-affected Names, mean that even if Sir David's report is an exoneration
of the market's practices, pressure for a market settlement will continue.
If there is no such settlement, the issue will continue to gnaw away at
Lloyd's, hampering the market's ability to respond to other serious
problems, draining its liquidity (because many Names will feel entitled to
delay or withhold payment needed to meet losses), harming its reputation,
and damaging credibility in the eyes of politicians.
Even if these problems can be overcome - by a market settlement or some
other solution - the hue and cry of the last few months may well ensure that
the 'entwined' nature of Lloyd's does not survive the next few years, as the
framework of regulation changes, and the market starts to admit corporate
capital. Such changes may end the complaints over the way insiders treat
outsiders - but it will ensure that much of Lloyd's distinguishing character
will disappear also.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (4): It's no
longer such a cosy club - The agencies are undergoing a rigorous shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MR Eric Dugdale, running his family's members' agency consisted of
lunching two or three times a week with Lloyd's Names at The Savoy - a
pleasant diversion from time spent building up his art collection.
That was over 20 years ago. Now Mr Dugdale's agency is at the core of a
growing business, the Octavian Group, which is one of the most powerful on
the Lloyd's market. Skandia, the giant Swedish insurer, has a significant
minority stake.
Octavian is a combined agency, running both a members' agency - which
handles the affairs of the market's underwriting Names (whose assets provide
the market's capital base) - and a managing agency which administers the
affairs of groups of Names organised into syndicates.
Its transformation epitomises broader changes within Lloyd's as a whole
whose cosy, clubbable atmosphere is gradually disappearing.
Lloyd's agencies are becoming significant businesses in their own right.
After making a series of acquisitions in recent years, Octavian's members'
agency is in 1992 the seventh biggest at Lloyd's, channeling some Pounds
307m of capital provided by Names into syndicates. Its managing agency looks
after the affairs of 10 syndicates which insure marine, aviation, energy,
property, liability and other risks.
The management team which bought out the Dugdale family agency in 1986 has
replaced the old easy going style with a much tougher professional approach.
Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director, says that 'the business principles
operated by all successful commercial enterprises apply equally to Lloyd's
syndicates'.
Mr Rogers, an accountant, says that the managing agency management team  -
whose acronym Fear (financial efficiency and review) symbolises the shift in
mood - monitors the performance of syndicates and provides management
information for underwriters.
Groups such as Octavian are holding increasing sway within the Lloyd's
market as a whole, with hard work, hard skills and professional management
becoming vital for success. Generally, too, bigger agencies and syndicates
are beginning to dominate.
The tough trading conditions - Lloyd's reported its first loss for over 20
years last year - are precipitating the changes. Figures released recently
by the Lloyd's Corporation - which provides back up and regulatory services
to the market - indicate the extent of the rationalisation already under
way.
In the 1992 underwriting year just 278 syndicates will underwrite business
at Lloyd's in 1992 compared with 354 in 1991, 401 in 1990 and 437 in 1980.
There were also 38 syndicates which ceased trading - among them several who
have been devastated by losses arising from spiral reinsurance business in
which syndicates and London market companies insure each other's catastrophe
exposures. Another 38 were merged by managers anxious to generate cost
savings.
Some agency groups have also bitten the dust, continuing a trend throughout
the 1980s in which numbers have fallen, with many smaller family-owned
agencies falling victim to takeover. The number has fallen from 301 in 1981
to 199 last year.
The number of members' agents fell from 137 in 1990 to 111 in 1991, while
the number of managing agents was reduced from 152 to 138. This year, the
trend has continued.
Larger members' agents have forced rationalisation by starving inefficient
syndicates of capital. By making the allocation of Names to syndicates
dependent on the adoption of management changes, members' agents pushed two
managing agents - HG Chester and Secretan - into difficulties.
Chester ceased trading in mid-March. A number of agency groups have taken
the opportunity to expand. Sturge Holdings, Lloyd's biggest managing and
members' agency which manages more than 10 per cent of the market's capital
base and has grown rapidly through a series of acquisitions in recent years,
took control of Secretan Agency last October.
Octavian acquired the Evennett &amp; Partners agency. Castle Underwriting -
whose activities until recently have revolved around the highly successful
syndicate 839, which specialises in financial and liability risks, has
launched an ambitious expansion programme, taking over Devonshire and JH
Davies Agencies. It now manages underwriting capacity in excess of Pounds
200m.
A fourth agency, Hayter Brockbank, has also increased its capacity strongly
but this has been largely by building up its existing syndicates. The
leading 10 managing and members' agents control nearly half the market.
In 1992, the leading 10 managing agency groups will manage about 42 per cent
of the market's capacity, while the leading 10 members' agents will handle
over 46 per cent of the capital supplied by Names. Three combined agencies
manage a fifth of Lloyd's capacity and about 18 per cent of the capital
supplied by Names.
These developments should allow greater efficiency in the market. The task
force identified the fragmentation of the Lloyd's market as one of the
reasons for its high and uncompetitive cost base.
Its report, Lloyd's: A Route Forward, showed that between 1982 and 1990
direct syndicate expenses grew by an average of 19 per cent per year to
reach Pounds 770m in 1990, compared with Pounds 200m in 1982. The task force
estimated that Lloyd's costs overall - which in 1990 also included Pounds
1.37bn paid in brokerage commissions - were a third too high and inhibited
the market's ability to underwrite business profitably.
The task force calculated that a reduction in the number of syndicates at
Lloyd's to 225 could reduce overall expenses from 6.2 per cent to 5.2 per
cent of gross written premiums.
It said Lloyd's costs had risen for several reasons. The introduction of a
more rigorous system of self-regulation after the Lloyd's Act of 1982 led to
improvements in the record-keeping of both syndicates and agents, increased
paper work and a rise in staff employed.
Across the market, agents have made significant investments in computer
technology. Underwriters' salaries - which agents were obliged to publish
for the first time by Lloyd's last year - are too high. More than a third of
the 354 syndicates active in 1991 paid underwriters more than Pounds 100,000
a year in 1987, the first year for which figures have been published. Some
underwriters worked for two or more syndicates earning extra money.
During the boom years of the mid-1980s these problems were obscured by the
growth and the profitability of the Lloyd's market as a whole. Since the
fees paid to agencies by syndicates reflect the amount of premium income a
syndicate receives and its profitability, the income received by agents rose
sharply from 1980.
Since 1988, when the market slid into the red and the total number of Names
began to leave Lloyd's, syndicate managers have become much more conscious
of the need to control and reduce costs, but the change in management
thinking has been slower than necessary, partly because the impact of the
losses has been delayed as a result of the three year accounting system used
at the Lloyd's market. It was unclear, for example, until early last year
that losses would be recorded in 1988.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (1): In the
eye of the storm - Mounting losses at Lloyd's threaten to ruin some of the
people who back its insurance activities with their personal fortunes. Amid
criticism over the apportionment of these losses and calls for radical
overhaul, it faces its biggest ever challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London is about to enter the most testing period in its 305 year
history buffeted by waves of criticism after reporting insurance losses last
year, the first for more than 20 years.
During the next few weeks agents will be telling Names - the individuals
whose assets back underwriting at the market - how much money they need to
pay as a result of insurance losses run up in 1989. Losses will amount to
more than Pounds 1.35bn. Names face more pain next year when 1990 losses -
which could be at least Pounds 400m - are reported. Many more Names will
leave Lloyd's as a result, joining the exodus of 10,000 who have quit since
1988 and hundreds could be obliged to sell houses and other assets to meet
liabilities. The impact is bound to revitalise the political controversy
that has swirled around the market over the past 12 months and which became
most intense in February when MPs raised allegations that market insiders -
Names who have jobs with Lloyd's agents and brokers - were avoiding the
worst losses and that the burden was falling disproportionately on outside
Names.
It is also likely to increase the pressure on the Lloyd's Council, the
market's governing body, to implement a series of reforms proposed in
January by the task force, a committee made up of leading underwriters and
brokers and led by Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Sedgwick, the
international insurance brokers.
The task force's report proposed a series of reforms which aim to strengthen
the market's capital base, cut costs, improve competitiveness and help
Lloyd's increase its declining share of the international market for
specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance.
Among the recommendations are a proposed modification of the principle of
unlimited liability as well as an overhaul in the system of governance,
designed to strengthen the independence of regulation and to improve the
management and the development of centralised back-up services.
In the longer term the report envisages the participation in the market of
corporate capital and advocates the creation of a system whereby Names'
participations on syndicates could be traded.
It reflects the thinking of a new elite of professional insurance managers -
loosely grouped around the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association - which
has emerged during the 1980s and which is less attached to tradition, more
professional and more outward looking than the Lloyd's establishment has
been in the past. Privately some task force members accept that the
introduction of corporate capital will pave the way for the physical
integration of the whole of the London insurance market - in which the
modernist glass and steel Lloyd's building would eventually house an
international insurance exchange made up of Lloyd's syndicates - backed by
corporate capital as well as Names - and the subsidiaries of London market
companies.
To move towards this radical vision, however, the market must surmount a
series of short and medium term difficulties, stemming largely from
insurance losses which have been made between 1988 and 1990. Lloyd's must
still deal with the fall-out from two areas of loss. Names on syndicates
specialising in catastrophe reinsurance - especially those which
participated unsuccessfully in the spiral, where syndicates and London
market companies insure each other's high level exposure to loss  - are the
immediate casualties.
Catastrophe losses such as Piper Alpha, hurricane Hugo and the European
storms of 1990 have affected a sizeable minority of Names
disproportionately.
But Names on four groups of syndicates face losses of Pounds 700m in 1989 -
about half the total losses expected by the market as a whole. Hundreds of
other Names also face potentially huge losses as a result of claims on US
liability insurance policies, stemming from court awards to victims of
asbestosis and government-ordered clean-ups of polluted sites.
More than 1,000 Names have launched legal actions - alleging negligence by
their agents, and in one case by Lloyd's itself - in a bid to recover
losses. They have been encouraged by the Pounds 116m out of court settlement
in February by another 1,000 Names in the Outhwaite case, a result which
could also encourage more Names to sue.
The legal actions generate bad publicity, which could damage the market's
standing. Efforts by about 800 Names seeking to prevent Lloyd's from drawing
down on their assets to pay insurance claims are causing cash flow problems
for some agencies and syndicates.
Ultimately there are fears that the market could become gridlocked by
criss-crossing disputes between Names and their agents. This would increase
the urgency of attracting corporate capital, further underlining the
importance of the rapid implementation of the task force's reforms.
In the meantime immediate prospects for profits in 1992 are improving as
rates in the key marine, aviation and reinsurance markets rise following a
reduction in the supply of capital to the market. Summing up the mood Mr
John Wetherell, a leading non-marine underwriter, says 1992 will see 'the
high tide and the turn'.
Even so no one is underestimating the difficulties that lie ahead. Mr Robin
Warrender, the chairman of London Wall Holdings, one of the biggest agency
groups at Lloyd's, says that the results for 1989 and 1990 - which Lloyd's
will report in June this year and June 1993 - are like 'two trenches full of
black vipers'.

FORMER Communist leader Alexander Dubcek has been elected chairman of the

yesterday, Reuter reports from Prague.
Mr Dubcek, 70, joined the Social Democrats only two weeks ago and was
elected at a party congress in Bratislava on Saturday, CSTK said.
Living in disgrace since his 'Prague Spring' reforms were crushed in August
1968, he returned to public life only after the peaceful overthrow of
communist rule in late 1989.
Mr Dubcek told the congress the main planks of his party policy were to
achieve an environmentally-oriented and socially just market economy.
'Our aim is a united Europe and a dignified place for Czechoslovakia in it,'
he said.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Call for resignation of German defence chief: Stoltenberg
embroiled in tanks export scandal
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE second German arms export scandal in six months has led to calls for the
sacking of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, defence minister, and has undermined the
CDU's prospects in next Sunday's state election in Schleswig-Holstein.
Pressure from the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) grew after it
became known that 15 Leopard I tanks had been shipped to Turkey last autumn
in defiance of a parliamentary committee ban in place since last year. The
minister was embroiled in a similar row late last year when armoured
vehicles, labelled as farm machinery, were discovered in Hamburg docks on
route to Israel.
News of the shipment emerged on Friday after the Bonn government suspended
all military dealings with Turkey, its Nato partner, because German arms
were being used against Kurdish communities.
Mr Stoltenberg, a close cabinet ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former
chairman of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein, said at the weekend he was
'disturbed' by the news, although refused to comment on the calls for his
resignation.
His parliamentary state secretary, Mr Ottfried Hennig, has also come under
heavy fire for allowing exports discipline to slip.
He is the party's leading candidate in the Schleswig-Holstein poll, standing
against Mr Bjorn Engholm, chairman of the SPD and prime minister of the
state.
The mood in the SPD, which took 54 per cent of the votes in the last state
election in 1988 and was already clear favourite to maintain power after
next week's vote, was bolstered by the disarray in Mr Kohl's government and
the likely reinforcement of Mr Engholm's status as a leader.
Mr Engholm is the opposition candidate for the chancellor's post in the 1994
federal elections.
The CDU, meanwhile, is more concerned about the loss of face for Mr Kohl if,
as the polls suggest, the CDU loses its absolute majority in the southern
state of Baden-Wurttemberg, which also votes next weekend. The state is the
last one in former western Germany where the conservatives rule alone.
CDU Bundestag members said at the weekend that it was unlikely that either
Mr Stoltenberg or Mr Hennig would go before next week's election.
The chancellor is planning a cabinet shuffle later this year, and has
promised several 'new, young faces'.

State radio reported no incidents as voting proceeded in the run-off races,
all in the south or centre of Europe's poorest country.
The Democrats captured 79 of 89 seats in first-round elections a week ago.
The Socialists, formerly called the Communists, won only six seats.
Four other seats went to smaller parties that could prove crucial to the
Democrats' goal of unseating President Ramiz Alia, the successor to
Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha in 1985 and the last ex-Communist left in
power.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, has made hay with the
travails of his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr Bill
Clinton, quoting or misquoting every press investigation into Mr Clinton's
record as governor of Arkansas and dubbing him the 'scandal a week'
candidate.
But Mr Brown's sudden rise to prominence after he narrowly defeated Mr
Clinton in last week's Democratic primary in Connecticut has also turned the
investigative spotlight on his own record.
The Washington Post reported that Mr Brown had accepted a Dollars
20,000-a-year board seat on a bio-medical company whose parent had to pay a
Dollars 400,000 fine to settle charges that it had falsely promoted a drug
as a treatment for the HIV virus and Mr Brown said he had telephoned a
prominent congressman to intercede on the company's behalf.
The story not only turns back against Mr Brown the charges of
influence-peddling that he has levelled at anyone within firing range, but
also carries a double edge because of the prominence with which the
Californian politician displays his sympathy with Aids victims, in the shape
of a red ribbon in his buttonhole.
While the Washington Post report contains no evidence of any kind of
wrong-doing or even ethically questionable conduct by Mr Brown, it is
exactly the same kind of story that has dripped inexorably on Mr Clinton,
eroding his apparent invincibility.
Mr Brown, however, continues to wage unabashed warfare against Mr Clinton in
the run-up to tomorrow's Vermont primary and to the high-stakes primaries in
New York, Wisconsin and Kansas on April 7.
But Mr Clinton still has 1,013 of the 4,288 delegates who will meet at the
party's nominating convention in July committed to him, compared to only 152
for Mr Brown.

VENEZUELAN President Carlos Andres Perez has appointed Mr Gustavo Roosen, a
prominent business executive and minister of education since 1989, as
president of the country's national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA).
Mr Roosen, 47, replaces Mr Andres Sosa Pietri, who resigned last week. In
his letter of resignation, Mr Sosa sharply criticised aspects of the
government's petroleum policy.
The appointment ended weeks of speculation over who would get the post,
which is of great importance in Venezuea. The company, which had gross sales
revenues of Dollars 22.3bn last year, provides the government with most of
its tax revenue and foreign exchange.
Mr Roosen, like Mr Sosa, comes from outside the industry. While he possesses
excellent managerial credentials, Mr Roosen's appointment represents a
rebuff to veteran oil industry executives who see their access to the
company's top job cut off by presidential decision.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dollars 500m typing error that moved
the market - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST week of spring should be a time of rejuvenation, an opportunity to
embrace the new season with enthusiasm. Not in New York, where four inches
of snow last week persuaded almost everyone, Wall Street's investors
included, to remain in hibernation.
It says something about the dullness of the week that the main, indeed only,
excitement on the stock markets was generated by a clerical error  -
admittedly one of impressive proportions.
The blunder was committed late on Wednesday by a clerk at Salomon Brothers,
the beleaguered Wall Street securities house that must be wondering if fate
has anything else in store, so accident-prone has been the last year.
The unfortunate clerk's mistake was simple. The repercussions were anything
but. He mistook a customer's order to sell Dollars 11m of shares as an order
to sell 11m shares - a much bigger trade, and one that could move the
market. The error might have been spotted if the order had been executed the
old-fashioned way, with the broker telephoning the marketmaker on the
exchange floor. The Salomon order, however, was for a computerised program
trade. As soon as the clerk pressed the button on his terminal at 3.58pm the
block of 11m shares began to be automatically sold by the Stock Exchange's
computer.
The impact was dramatic. In the final two minutes of the day's trading, a
12-point gain on the Dow Jones industrial average was wiped out. When the
closing bell rang, the index showed a net decline of 1.57 points. The near
14-point turnaround was the second biggest move in share prices during an
unusually quiet week.
It could have been a lot worse. Salomon traders spotted the mistake while
the computers were selling millions of dollars of smaller shares. They
halted the trade before some of the biggest stocks in the order were
reached. Even though Salomon managed to salvage something from the mess -
the firm says it quickly 'neutralised' the trade by some fancy footwork in
the derivatives markets - the fuss will take longer to die down.
Opponents of computer program trading have wasted no time in using the
Salomon blunder as ammunition in their fight to persuade regulators to
impose tougher restrictions on computer trading. Program trading is already
proscribed when the market rises or falls beyond a certain limit, a rule
introduced after the October 1987 crash to prevent computer trading of large
blocks of shares from exacerbating market volatility.
Wednesday's debacle led a range of 'experts' to raise a bigger issue in the
press and on television: how Wall Street uses its latest trading technology,
the development of which some critics believe may have outstripped peoples'
ability to control it.
They are missing the point. No amount of regulation or hi-tech wizardry can
prevent a clerk from misreading 'Dollars 11m' as '11m shares' and acting
accordingly. The foul-up at Salomon was the result of human error. Yet, more
importantly, it was also because of a failure of internal control systems at
in the firm's trading department.
Salomon needed a safety system to catch big orders and ensure their
verification before execution. The most worrying aspect of the affair was
not the power of computer technology in financial markets, but the fact that
a clerk could initiate a sale of 11m shares, worth as much as Dollars 500m,
without senior colleagues knowing what he was doing.
Aside from Wednesday's trading glitch, the week was quiet. New York's
investors and traders would have better spent their time frolicking in the
spring snow on Vermont's ski slopes, so uninspiring was trading.
The little news on the economy proved mixed. On the debit side there was
another rise in weekly jobless claims, a poor set of mid-March car sales and
a small decline in February durable goods. The good news came from the
housing market. Existing home sales rose sharply last month to a three-year
high, and construction contracts, both residential and commercial, also
advanced handsomely in February. The conclusion: the recession is probably
over, but the recovery looks as if it will be both shallow and slow.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Shell plans North Sea job cuts: Union attacks proposals to
shed up to 4,000 workers by end of decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SHELL UK plans to shed up to 4,000 North Sea jobs by the end of the decade,
as it replaces old production platforms with more modern ones which will
require fewer staff.
The company said yesterday it would cut 40 per cent of its offshore
workforce and 25 per cent of North Sea jobs onshore by the year 2000. Only
negligible profits could be made in the North Sea, Shell said.
Between 2,000 and 4,000 jobs will go, as the company reviews all of its 32
platforms.
The cuts angered union officials. Mr Roger Lyons, general-secretary-elect of
the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union, which represents offshore
workers, said: 'Shell is rushing this announcement through before the
general election without any consultation. Shell clearly fears a Labour
victory on April 9 will force them to consult on their plans as happens in
every other civilised country.'
Mr Chris Fay, managing director of Shell Exploration and Production (Shell
Expo), said he was 'flabbergasted' that news of the cuts threatened to cause
a pre-election storm. 'I was surprised such a big issue could be made of
what is an evolutionary process,' he said.
Jobs would go because the company had to cut costs on its older, more
expensive platforms, which were only marginally profitable, he said.
Reports of the cuts emerged after Mr Fay told visitors to the new Gannet oil
platform earlier this week that it would have a crew of less than 40,
compared with 200 on older platforms.
But he stressed yesterday this did not necessarily lead to 4,000 job losses.
Although he confirmed the percentage size of the planned cuts in offshore
and onshore workforces, he said the bulk of its 8,700 offshore staff are
already contractors, many of whom work only half time.
Cuts were more likely to be between 2,000 and 4,000 over a 10 to 15-year
period with most of the losses coming towards the end of the decade. Only
about 400 jobs would be lost this year and a similar figure next year.
Mr Fay also said Shell would be creating many new jobs as development of the
North Sea continued. These would help offset the losses.
The main reason for the cuts, Mr Fay said, was that there were few large
oilfields left to develop. 'People should recognise the increasing
marginality of the North Sea,' he said.
This meant Shell had to cut its costs, he said. Cuts of Pounds 150m to
Pounds 180m were planned for 1992, from a total operating cost of Pounds
900m. Only a small percentage of the cuts would be job losses.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Boost planned for Japan's economy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is to introduce a package of measures next week in an effort to boost
the economy and revive flagging business sentiment.
The package, due to be announced by ministers on Tuesday, is expected to
bring forward planned public works spending.
Speculation in Tokyo intensified yesterday that the package would be
followed by a further cut in the official discount rate from the current 4.5
per cent.
The public works plans would bring forward to the first half of the 1992-93
financial year - which starts in April - 75 per cent of the capital spending
planned for the whole 12 months.
Government officials acknowledge that bringing forward such a large part of
the programme would create a hole in the budget later in the year which
could only be filled by a supplementary budget.
Economists said the government's immediate proposals would make a modest
contribution to boosting growth, though the effects would not be apparent
until later this year.
However, the measures would have little impact on business confidence unless
they were accompanied by an unexpectedly large reduction of 1 percentage
point or more in the official discount rate.
This seems unlikely - investors in the stock market have resigned themselves
to a cut of only 0.5 points, the same as the Bank of Japan's previous three
reductions. The Nikkei index yesterday fell 248 points to 19,636.99 - a new
five-year low.
Mr Susumu Taketomi, the chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan,
said: 'The government's package will be helpful but it will not be
all-powerful. The cumulative effect of interest rate cuts will create room
for future recovery but will take time.'
Apart from the government, big public and semi-public institutions also plan
to advance part of their investment programme. They include Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone, which is Japan's biggest company, and electric power
generating groups.
Other measures in the package could include proposals for the Japan
Development Bank, a state-owned bank which makes low-cost loans, to increase
its funding and special measures for the hard-pressed house-building
industry.
Further evidence of the economic slowdown came yesterday with the
publication of figures showing that industrial production fell in February
by 4.2 per cent compared with the same month last year.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast that industrial
output for the financial year ending in March would be down by 0.6 per cent
 -the first decline since 1986.
However, production cuts are beginning to result in reductions in
inventories - a sign that companies are getting to grips with the slowdown.
Inventories rose by 10 per cent year-on-year, down from a 12.2 per cent rise
in January and 13.1 per cent in December, the peak month.
Mr Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming, the securities
company, said: 'Full-scale inventory adjustment is under way but the economy
is not crashing.'

FT  28 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Overseas losses serve to
drive Dow downward
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
LOSSES on overseas markets set the tone for early weakness in US equities
yesterday, and in spite of some broadly positive economic news, share prices
ended sharply lower amid talk that some big funds had switched from equities
into bonds, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 36.24 at 3,231.44.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 4.36 at
403.50, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slumped 10.73
at 604.67. Turnover on the NYSE was 167m shares.
There was no particular trigger for the selling and the current perception
among investors and traders is that the market is in a period of transition.
Amid the uncertainty about the near-term outlook, trading remained cautious,
and there was talk that some big investors were making a short-term tactical
switch from stocks to bonds. The market ignored news of a 1.1 per cent rise
in personal income and a 0.9 per cent rise in personal spending last month.
Both figures were slightly higher than forecasts.
Technology issues bore the brunt of the selling. Digital Equipment fell
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 after Smith Barney Harris Upham, the broking
house, lowered an investment rating on the stock and increased its forecast
of how much the group will lose in 1992.
Hewlett-Packard slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 79 7/8 , Unisys gave up
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 9 3/4 , Motorola, which announced plans to build a
factory in Beijing, China, dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 75 3/8 , and IBM
fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 83 1/4 .
Household International slumped Dollars 9 1/4 to Dollars 46 3/4 in turnover
of 2.1m shares after the financial services and manufacturing group warned
that first quarter earnings would be 40 per cent to 50 per cent below
analysts' estimates. These have ranged between Dollars 1.10 and Dollars 1.35
a share.
Catalina Marketing enjoyed a successful debut. The issue of 2.2m shares of
common stock was priced at Dollars 20 a share, and at the close they were
trading at Dollars 28.
On the over-the-counter market, technology stocks also took a beating. Intel
was by far the most actively traded issue, dropping Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars
55 1/4 in turnover of 11.7m shares after Bear Stearns downgraded the stock
from a 'buy' to a 'hold'.
Also lower were Apple, Dollars 3 weaker at Dollars 61, Microsoft, down
Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 121 1/4 , and Borland International, Dollars 2 3/4
lower at Dollars 54.
Profits warnings affected Handex Environment, down Dollars 7 1/2 at Dollars
14, and Alias Research, down Dollars 2 at Dollars 11 1/2 . Both companies
said next quarter earnings would be lower than a year ago.
Canada
IN TORONTO, stock prices moved lower throughout the day, closing sharply
down in moderate trading. The composite index fell 31.73 points, or 0.92 per
cent, to close at 3416.78, with declining issues leading advances by 327 to
254. Volume was 27.770 shares, down from Thursday's 30.105 and trading value
fell to CDollars 239.5m from CDollars 297m. On the week, the index was off
about 23 points, or about 1.5 per cent. Thirteen of 14 stock groups lost
ground, led by the mining group, off 1.7 per cent.

FT  28 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Polling news triggers market slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE three-day rally in London's equity market was effectively knocked on the
head by the latest opinion polls and fears that Labour may emerge with a
clear lead over the Conservatives in a batch of polls published tomorrow.
Topping a generally miserable session was news that Heron Corporation, the
privately-owned conglomerate headed by Mr Gerald Ronson, may have run into
financing problems, adding to the seemingly never-ending list of worries for
the big banks.
The Heron news came hard on the heels of a recent announcement of problems
at international property developer Olympia &amp; York, controlled by the
Reichmann brothers, and builder of the massive Canary Wharf development in
London's docklands.
There was no respite for the Gilt-edged market, where long-dated stocks
retreated around a half-point, despite a relatively stable performance by
sterling against the D-mark.
Some of the equity market's big dollar earners were given a rough ride as
the US currency retreated against Europeans on hints from Germany that rates
will not be cut near-term.
The pressure was on equities from the outset with the stock market
responding on the downside to reports of a poll giving a substantial swing
to Labour in London, indicating a 2 points-plus lead over the Tories.
This story triggered a widespread mark down of share prices by dealers
anxious to maintain level books over the general election campaign period.
The footsie future gave no real support to the cash market, remaining at a 4
to 5 point discount throughout the day with traders in this market reluctant
to undertake big trades ahead of next Tuesday's expiry of the March series.
Opening over five points lower the footsie retreated in the face of some
determined selling pressure, partly caused by the opinion poll worries but
also by selling from local and overseas institutions said to have decided
that the most likely outcome to the general election will be at best a hung
Parliament or more likely a Labour-dominated government.
The market mood deteriorated substantially as the session wore on, hit by
more election nervousness and latterly by a poor opening performance by Wall
Street.
At its worst, the footsie showed a fall of 30.4 at 2,441.8, but it later
eased off the bottom to close a net 24.3 down at 2,447.9.
Retail, or customer, volume, in equities picked up over the week as
institutions began to rethink their portfolios as election day nears.

FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Apple and Sharp join forces

<TEXT>
APPLE Computer will join forces with Sharp of Japan to produce the first of
a new class of pocket-sized electronic devices. The trans-Pacific
partnership gives substance to the much-heralded convergence of the computer
and consumer electronics industries, both of which are looking for new
sources of growth.
'Strategic partnerships like this one will be the key to business success as
the gap between personal computers and consumer electronics products
continues to close,' said Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief
executive.
The two companies have set up product development teams and are aiming to
put their first personal electronic devices on the market early next year,
with different versions to be sold under both Sharp and Apple brand labels.
Details of the planned product, dubbed as 'personal information management',
remain a closely guarded secret. However, the device is expected to
incorporate an electronic calendar and phone book and be capable of sending
and receiving messages.
It will be a hand-held device and will probably incorporate a pen, rather
than a keyboard, for entering data. It is expected to sell in the US for
less than Dollars 1,000.
The joint development effort will combine the strengths of both parties.
Sharp is a leader in personal electronics products such as its Wizard
electronic organiser. The Japanese company also has expertise in key
technologies such as flat panel displays. Apple is known for its innovative
software that makes computer technology easy to use.
Under the agreement signed in Tokyo on Friday by the two companies, Apple
will grant Sharp a licence to use new software specifically designed for use
in its new family of personal electronics products.
Terms of the agreement were not revealed, but Sharp is expected to pay
royalties to Apple for use of its software.
Apple also plans to license this as-yet unreleased software to other
parties. Sony of Japan is said to be another potential Apple licensee.
Apple announced in January that it intended to enter the consumer
electronics field with a new class of products that bridge the gap between
personal computers and consumer electronics.
These products would essentially be single-function, hand-held computers and
could include , for example, electronics books, electronic organisers,
multimedia players, electronic note takers, display telephones or personal
communicators.
Apple has formed a new business group to pursue the consumer electronics
market, separate from its established Macintosh personal computer business.

FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y asks its lenders for freeze
on debt repayments
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the financially-pressed property developer, has asked its
lenders to freeze its debt repayments pending the presentation of an interim
restructuring plan on April 6.
The Toronto-based company also announced at the end of a meeting with about
20 of its largest creditors yesterday that it is forming a Bank Advisory
Committee, led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citibank and Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
An O&amp;Y official was unable yesterday to estimate the amount of maturing debt
obligations which lenders are being asked to roll over. They include a
significant portion of two commercial paper programmes which the company was
in the process of winding up before it was hit by a liquidity crisis earlier
this month.
About CDollars 380m (USDollars 319.3m) of commercial paper is still
outstanding. The company's total debts are estimated at over CDollars 20bn,
and the restructuring process is expected to last at least two years. O&amp;Y's
banks earlier this month provided Pounds 50m (USDollars 86.5m) emergency
facilities to enable work to continue on the Canary Wharf project in
London's docklands.
The official said yesterday's meeting, held at the company's head office in
Toronto's Exchange Tower, lasted 'a few hours.' Extra security precautions
were evident at the building yesterday.
The bankers were addressed by Mr Paul Reichmann, senior member of the family
which owns O&amp;Y, as well as by Mr Thomas Johnson, the US banker who was
appointed president of the company earlier this week. O&amp;Y said the two men,
as well their recently-appointed financial advisers, described the company's
financial situation in general terms 'and the process by which management is
addressing it'.
The O&amp;Y official said a European bank is also expected to join the steering
group, and that other institutions will be invited to join the committee.
Besides banks, O&amp;Y's creditors include a large number of pension funds,
insurance companies and other institutional investors, mostly in North
America.
Olympia &amp; York failed two weeks ago to make a payment of more than USDollars
30m due to Merrill Lynch, the New York securities house, adds Alan Friedman
in New York.
The payment was part of O&amp;Y's plan to retire its CDollars 380m (USDollars
319.3m) of outstanding commercial paper.
Merrill Lynch, according to bankers involved in O&amp;Y's debt talks, was
supposed to take receipt of the funds in its role as agent to investors who
hold O&amp;Y commercial paper.
It emerged yesterday that Merrill Lynch considered calling in its lawyers to
place O&amp;Y in technical default, but in the end recommended to investors that
the commercial paper be rolled over.
One adviser to O&amp;Y sought to play down the episode yesterday, saying: 'That
was an example of their liquidity crisis.'

FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Paribas expects provisions to
remain high
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARIBAS, a leading French investment banking group, yesterday announced that
it expected provisions to remain high this year because of the poor economic
outlook in France and the UK.
Paribas was forced last year to make a special provision of FFr2.8bn, mainly
due to its exposure on loans made by its Paribas Suisse subsidiary. Most
were property loans although it was also exposed to the collapse of Mr
Robert Maxwell's media empire.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, yesterday warned that Paribas faces another
year of high provisions in 1992.
The group also confirmed an earlier forecast that it had slipped from net
profits of FFr2.54bn (Dollars 448.7m) in 1990 into a net consolidated loss
of FFr184m in 1991.
Meanwhile, the banks within the Paribas group were forced to raise their
provisions by 28 per cent to FFr6.3bn because of the adverse environment in
France, the UK and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Europe.
'The trend in France during the opening months of 1992 has not been good
because of weak demand,' said Mr Levy-Lang, emphasising Paribas' concern
about the effect of the economic slowdown on small companies.
He added that the situation in the UK, where the Compagnie Bancaire unit is
active in the consumer loans and mortgage market, was clouded by recession
and uncertainty over the general election.
Mr Levy-Lang warned that the banking sector faced fierce competition and
pressure on margins, and Paribas planned to counter this by continued
cost-cutting and possibly by selling some of its investments in 1992 and
1993.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, the French commercial bank, is to move out of its
prestigious central Paris office and into a new FFr5bn (Dollars 883.3m)
headquarters, in the city's largest property transaction.
The spectacular deal gives a lift to the flagging property market in La
Defense, the modern business district on Paris' western boundary.
Societe Generale's new headquarters, to house 5,400 staff, will be two
38-storey tower blocks behind the Grande Arche, the square white marble arch
which forms the focal point of La Defense.
The move is to take place in three years.
However, the deal casts a shadow over the central Paris property market,
through the prospect of the 200,000 sq metres to come vacant as Societe
Generale's central services move out of their 50 offices spread across the
city.
The bank will keep a branch in its present headquarters in the Boulevard
Haussman, Paris' traditional banking district, but has not yet decided what
to do with the rest.
'This will certainly dynamise the market in La Defense, but it will increase
stocks in central Paris, even if over a long period,' said Mr Philippe
Bastien, analyst at James Capel.
Societe Generale's central Paris property portfolio was worth between
FFr10bn and FFr12bn, he estimated. That is roughly 30 per cent down on its
worth 18 months ago when the commercial property market started to go into
decline.
Recent transactions are at around FFr60,000 per sq metre, against around
FFr90,000 in mid-1990, sometimes rising to FFr120,000 for the best
locations.
Societe Generale could be expected to await an upturn and sell its
properties in small amounts so as to avoid weakening the market.

FT  28 MAR 92 / A case of wine on the rocks: French stocks are too high at a
time when demand is falling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend concludes an historic event in Burgundy. In the past week this
traditionally introverted French wine region has for the first time ever
ceremonially opened its cellar doors for the world's wine writers and wine
buyers. But this is a sign not of hospitality - it is one of anxiety.
Next week many of Burgundy's guests will troop off to Bordeaux for the
launch of that region's latest vintage. For the past few years the Bordeaux
chateaux have had to fend off a wine world impatient to taste their new
wares. This year they have been trying to persuade the key palates to sample
the 1991 vintage at all.
Bordeaux and Burgundy, like most of the French wine industry, are in
financial difficulty. The combination of three years of bumper crops,
over-ambitious pricing and the recession has created a cycle of rising
stocks and falling demand. These problems are aggravated by the longer-term
trends of growing competition from other countries and changes in consumer
tastes which could lead to big alterations in the scale and structure of the
industry.
The current crisis is all the more acute for following a decade of
prosperity. French wine flourished in the 1980s thanks to a blend of
wonderful weather and buoyant demand, notably from newer markets like the US
and Japan. By the end of the decade France's wine producers and the
negociants, which distribute their products, revelled in three glorious
vintages - 1988, 1989 and 1990. By 1990 the French wine industry generated
record exports of FFr23.2bn (Pounds 2.4bn) with a workforce of 330,000.
This prosperity created its own problems. The negociants paid higher prices
to the producers for the prime vintages of 1988 and 1989. They then found it
difficult to pass these prices on to their own customers, the wine
merchants, because so much wine had been produced in those years and demand
was already weakening in recession-struck markets such as the US and UK.
Demand declined further as the recession deepened. Since last autumn,
consignments from the US and Belgium have been flooding back to France. One
importer in the US, where the effect of the recession was until recently
reinforced by the weak dollar, reputedly returned a cargo of 48,000 cases.
Some of these returns have resurfaced in the French supermarkets, which had
started selling crus classes, the very best Bordeaux wines, when the
much-vaunted vintages of 1988 and 1989 depressed sales of the much less
successful 1987 vintage. Meanwhile some negociants have been forced to sell
off stocks cheaply. Some of the finest French wines, Chateau d'Yquem and
Chateau Cheval Blanc, are being sold in supermarkets sometimes for less than
the negociant prices.
'It's purgatory,' says Mr John Kolasa, commercial director of Ulysse
Cazabonne, Chateau Latour's negociant. 'Supermarket prices have got
completely out of hand. Crus classes are being used as loss leaders to sell
packets of biscuits and cans of peas.'
While the fine wine trade has been disrupted by the incursion of the
supermarkets, the market for French table wine at the bottom end of the
quality spectrum is described as 'catastrophic' by Roger Piquet, owner of
Chateau de Gourgazaud. These are the products that have been worst affected
by the recession in the export sector, and production still exceeds demand.
Even Bordeaux, France's most famous fine wine region, is showing signs of
financial strain. Two small merchants have closed and some of the grandest
chateaux are up for sale. Suez, the giant French industrial group, hopes to
sell Cordier, a large negociant which also owns Chateau Gruaud-Larose, as
part of its restructuring. Chateau Rausan-Segla, part of a trust belonging
to Mr George Walker, the British businessman recently ousted as chairman of
the stricken Brent Walker leisure group, is also said to be on the market.
The difficulties are likely to intensify this year. The 1991 grape harvest
was a disaster thanks to severe frost in April and a poor summer, which
produced a vintage of erratic quality. On one level this is what the wine
industry needed - the low volume of 1991s should help to clear the high
stocks of 1988s, 1989s and 1990s. But low volume also means low turnover for
the negociants, which could cause cashflow problems this spring.
There are some positive signs. The dollar's recent rise, coupled with signs
of economic recovery in the US, should stimulate sales to that market.
Moreover the influx of investment into the industry in the 1980s - there
were 17 foreign acquisitions in Bordeaux alone between 1983 and 1991,
notably from global drinks groups such as the UK's Allied-Lyons - has helped
to stabilise the industry: these investors often take a longer-term view
than the old family owners.
Some companies have been taking radical action to tackle their problems.
Louis Latour, a leading Burgundy negociant, slashed the prices of its 1989
whites by 25 per cent late last year. Others followed suit and have since
experienced a slight improvement in sales.
But the industry's difficulties go beyond the immediate economic problems.
International competition from Australasia, Spain, South Africa, eastern
Europe and South America is increasing. These regions, with their aggressive
export strategies, represent a growing threat to French wines.
French attempts to battle back will be hampered by the changes in consumer
taste, most of which are unfavourable to France. The bulk of French wines,
for instance, are reds, but the strongest demand worldwide is still for
whites.
'This is a difficult time,' says Mr Jean-Marc Dulong, commercial director of
Dulong Freres, a Bordeaux negociant. 'Our customers outside France want easy
wines with lots of fruit, which is different from the traditional French
style.'
In France itself there is a discernible shift, particularly among younger
consumers, away from the 'classic' French wines from Bordeaux, Burgundy and
Beaujolais towards more adventurous southern wines, such as Corbieres,
Minervois and the better-made vin de pays.
Moreover, French wine, like the rest of the international drinks industry,
faces the challenge of the swing against alcohol. Wine consumption continues
to fall in France, where per capita consumption has declined by almost a
third, albeit to a heady 73 litres a year, in the past decade.
The logical consequence of these pressures will be concentration of
ownership within the industry into a smaller number of larger companies. 'We
have to be realistic,' says Mr Philippe Hernandez, director of Societe de
Distribution des Vins Fins in Bordeaux. 'Eventually there may be as few as
20 negociants left in this region compared with 300 today.'
The structure of the market is also likely to alter. Traditionally the wine
producers, the viticulteurs, have been independent of the distributors, the
negociants. This is changing. Some top Bordeaux chateaux - Lafite, Latour
and Mouton-Rothschild - already own negociants that handle part of their
distribution.
Producers are reluctant to discuss the issue for fear of upsetting their
negociants, but most admit privately that they plan to expand their
distribution activities. Conversely, some negociants are increasing their
investment in viticulture and in marketing initiatives such as brand
development.
As for the wines themselves, the drive towards higher quality that started
in the 1980s is certain to continue. Lower-grade producers, notably the
subsidised smallholders and co-operatives producing plonk in the south, may
be forced out of business. These peasant producers are the main French
targets of a European Commission initiative to reduce Europe's wine-growing
area by 500,000 hectares - five times the size of Bordeaux - over the next
five years.
In the meantime the industry is waiting to see how the 1991 vintage is
received and what sort of harvest it reaps this year. 'Everything depends on
1992,' says Mr David Orr, president of Chateau Latour. 'What we all want is
a small harvest of super quality. If we get it, the market will be much
better. If we don't, life will get even tougher.'

FT  28 MAR 92 / Tories in a race against time: The state of play at the end
of the campaign's second week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There comes a moment during an election campaign when one side begins to
recognise that it is facing defeat. The Conservatives are perilously close
to that point.
Mr John Major and his colleagues have not given up. Nor do the opinion polls
support Mr Neil Kinnock's claim that Labour is set to win an outright
majority on April 9. After a faltering first two weeks, Mr Chris Patten has
been refocusing the Conservative strategy. The party chairman is promising
an unremitting assault on the opposition and its leader until polling day.
Tax, economic competence and leadership will be kept centre-stage. More will
be made of the Conservative record on defence and foreign affairs.
In Mr Major's speeches around the country ferocious attacks on Mr Kinnock's
judgment have been added to the vision of caring Conservatism that were once
judged the key to victory. After 10 days on the stump, the prime minister
has settled into a more comfortable stride.
Mr Norman Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, has been
rehabilitated alongside Mrs Margaret Thatcher in a drive to win back the
skilled working classes who delivered victory in 1983 and 1987. Mr Michael
Heseltine, the environment secretary, has shown he retains a formidable
instinct for the political jugular.
Mr Kinnock, shielded for much of the time from a largely hostile tabloid
press, has looked uncomfortably vulnerable when it has caught up with him.
The election, fired into life by the row over health, is set to get rougher
still.
For much of this week, the heat generated by Labour's emotive election
broadcast on the National Health Service obscured the light shed by the
opinion polls on the progress of the campaign. The dramatisation of a young
child's predicament on an NHS waiting-list moved Mr William Waldegrave, the
health secretary, to summon up comparisons with Nazi propaganda in pre-war
Germany. His opposite number in the Labour party, Mr Robin Cook, was
unrepentant and the election was diverted into a sterile debate about leaks
and the murky world of tabloid witch-hunts.
Neither side knows what impact it has had on the electorate. One cabinet
minister, convinced at first that the row had at last got Mr Kinnock on the
run, was worried a few hours later that Mr Major might be implicated
(wrongly) in central office 'dirty tricks'.
One of the minister's Labour shadows insisted that the controversial
broadcast had succeeded in its central objective of taking health - his
party's strongest card - to the heart of the election battle. Then he
recalled with acute discomfort the television images of his leader's angry
exchanges with the tabloid 'rat pack'. Most voters probably were bemused.
For their part Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, forced out of the news
for much of the campaign and facing a squeeze on their vote, must hope that
the row will reinforce disenchantment with both main parties.
But, overall, it is the Conservatives who are worried. The threat of
permanent opposition has taught the Labour party how to run election
campaigns. The Conservative effort has looked outclassed and outdated. After
13 years in office, ministers seem to have forgotten how to fight hard
elections.
Mr Major's campaign stumbled at the outset. It started with a Budget that
aimed to steal Labour's clothes by demonstrating a commitment to the
low-paid and with a manifesto designed to distance him from Mrs Thatcher.
But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, deflated the expectations of those -
including his cabinet colleagues - who had believed that a more handsome
bribe was available to cheer a disgruntled electorate.
The Conservatives were caught off-balance by Mr John Smith's alternative
package. The shadow chancellor reassured the skilled working classes - the
so-called C2s on whose votes the election outcome may hinge - that they
would pay no more in tax.
Mr Patten wasted nearly a week directing his fire at Mr Smith's threat to
the incomes of those earning more than Pounds 20,000 a year. Mr Richard
Ryder, the chief whip and the man charged with knocking heads together at
central office, was not alone in judging that wavering supporters in the
much larger Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 income bracket would be
unimpressed.
The campaign has been recalibrated. Mr Major's soft-focus vision of the
1990s now runs alongside a Thatcherite onslaught on Labour's 'socialist'
agenda. A costing of Labour's spending pledges has provided the figure -
Pounds 1,250 a taxpayer a year - needed to 'frighten' the C2s.
But the cabinet members who line up daily alongside the prime minister at
Conservative central office are showing signs of strain. They offer
confident claims to the television cameras that the new message will get
through. But the images that stick are those of men who have fired their
ammunition and cannot quite understand why it has not yet reached its
target.
There is a defensive mood. Asked if there were signs of panic, one senior
minister replied simply: 'Not yet.'
There are mutterings among some of his colleagues that Mr Patten has spent
too much time defending his slim majority in Bath and not enough holding
together a shaky operation in the party's Smith Square headquarters.
He has learnt quickly how hard it is to fight an election in the middle of
an economic slump. The sharp rise in living standards during the 1980s has
not tempered the voters' anger with a government that gave them first the
poll tax and then the recession.
The media, once persuaded of the impregnability of his party's reputation
for economic competence, has been unreceptive to the constant attacks on
Labour's strategy.
When the party chairman issued a dire warning this week that a Labour
government would wreck economic recovery, the first question from the media
circus was entirely predictable: 'What recovery?' Conservative canvassers
are finding that the promise of zero inflation does not play well against
the reality of rising unemployment.
Apart from his occasional spats with the Tory tabloids, Mr Kinnock has had a
relatively easy ride. The dire state of the government's finances has
allowed him to escape so far the searching scrutiny of his party's tax and
spending plans which damaged Labour so badly in 1987.
Mr Smith's clever conjuring tricks have obscured the hard truth that the
resources available to an incoming Labour government would not come close to
matching the party's aspirations for the welfare state. Occasional 'gaffes'
by members of the shadow cabinet have provided glimpses of that fundamental
tension. But they have largely been lost in the deepening economic gloom.
Mr Patten and his colleagues have answers for the prophets of doom. They
point to the volatility of the opinion polls, regional variations in the
swing to Labour, dislike of the opposition leader, and a large reservoir of
floating voters. Mr Major believes that commentators have failed to
appreciate the 'incumbency' advantage of Conservative MPs defending marginal
seats.
From canvass returns across the country, the message being conveyed to Mr
Patten is that resentment of the government's handling of the economy is
matched by dislike and distrust of Mr Kinnock. One senior minister returned
from two days' campaigning with the simple message that: 'They just don't
want him (Mr Kinnock) in Downing Street.'
The opinion polls indicate that Mr Major's more aggressive persona on the
campaign trail has taken the shine off his image. But while his ratings have
fallen they remain far ahead of his main rival.
A steady Labour lead in the polls - its standing has remained remarkably
constant at 41 per cent against the Conservatives' 39 per cent - must be
seen alongside panel surveys suggesting that a sizeable slice of the
electorate has yet to make up its mind.
The Conservatives believe that the waverers include large numbers of
disenchanted supporters who can be recaptured closer to polling day by the
onslaught on tax and on Mr Kinnock's judgment. In the phrase of one cabinet
minister, a 'more red-blooded' campaign could detach support from the
Liberal Democrats.
Despite Mr Ashdown's energetic campaigning, his party has yet to make the
impact needed to pitch it into the campaign limelight. Mr Patten will seek
to squeeze its support by warning that a vote for the third party could let
Mr Kinnock into Downing Street.
But the fine print of the opinion polls also has bad news for the
Conservatives. The assault on Labour's plans has not pushed tax above fifth
or sixth in the list of issues uppermost in the voters' minds. Unemployment,
health and education all rank higher. Mr Major's protestations that the
health service is safe in his hands has convinced only a third of the
electorate.
There is time still for the Conservative case on tax, the economy and Mr
Kinnock to sink in. Labour strategists concede they are worried that it may
have a delayed impact. The closer Labour edges towards victory, the more the
voters may worry about their wallets.
But Mr Kinnock can win if Labour does no more than hold on to its present
standing in the opinion polls: a 'hung parliament' would count as victory.
To be certain of remaining prime minister Mr Major needs an overall
majority. He does not have much time to demonstrate that it is still within
his grasp.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Demand for tax advice up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMANDS ON accountants for tax-planning advice far exceed those received at
this time in previous years, many in the profession said yesterday.
Labour's tax proposals mean that a married man on a Pounds 100,000 salary is
contemplating a loss of Pounds 13,000 a year, a fall in after-tax income of
20 per cent.
Many people in the UK are adopting 'tax-efficient' measures so that they
receive income in the current financial year. Some financial institutions,
such as James Capel, the stockbroker, have brought forward the payment of
bonuses to employees.
The real question is whether investors will be sufficiently panicked to take
their money offshore.
A UK resident is liable to be taxed on all his or her worldwide income.
There were reports yesterday in offshore centres such as Gibraltar and the
Isle of Man reflecting nervousness that stopped short of capital flight.
One leading Gibraltar lawyer said yesterday: 'What we have been getting in
recent days is quite a number of accountants coming to us who are
anticipating capital flight and who want us to be ready for it. But the
capital from the UK hasn't arrived yet.'
For individuals, the safest way of avoiding British tax involves removing
oneself as well as one's money.
Mr Keith Kerruish, chartered surveyor and partner in Chrystals Royal Life
Estates in the Isle of Man, estimates that between 20 and 30 people may have
moved to the island in anticipation of a Labour government.
Meanwhile, the Inland Revenue is ready for any British taxpayers seeking to
place assets offshore to avoid UK tax liability.
Mr Dennis Parrett, principal inspector of taxes from the Revenue's
compliance and collection division in London, said: 'It isn't worth evading
tax. You could end up paying more than Pounds 1 in the pound.'
Numerous Revenue staff are involved in tracking people and companies seeking
to conceal untaxed assets overseas, from district tax inspectors in local
offices around the country to Section 739 in Hinchley Wood, Surrey, which
specialises in examining transfers of assets overseas by individuals.
For those caught in tax evasion, the penalties include full repayment of all
tax plus interest, and a further sum up to the value of the tax evaded,
depending on the level of co-operation given to inspectors.
There is nothing illegal in creating an offshore trust, if either the assets
it controls are no longer under the control of the taxpayer placing them
there, or those assets are disclosed to the Inland Revenue.
If they are disclosed, though, recent legislative changes mean there is no
longer any tax advantage in holding them offshore.
If the assets sit offshore untouched they may often go undetected. They may
not come to light until the taxpayer dies and heirs attempt to take on the
inheritance. But many people do need access later to money they have hidden
away.
However, there is evidence that clauses in the 1991 Finance Act closed most
options for UK-resident taxpayers to create offshore vehicles for their
assets. It will in any case be some months before the Revenue is able to
track and measure evasion conducted in the run-up to the election.

THE BANK of England is to seek the winding-up of Jackson Financial Services,
an accountancy partnership in Sutton, south London, on the ground that it
has been acting as an unlicensed deposit-taker, David Barchard writes.
A petition for winding-up is to be heard in the High Court in June. Mr
Philip Wedgewood Wallace and Mr Roger Smith, both partners in KPMG Peat
Marwick, have been appointed joint provisional liquidators.
A tip-off led Bank investigators to the discovery that Jackson was taking
deposits from more than 100 customers. It is the 35th case in less than a
year in which the Bank has moved to close an alleged unlicensed depositor.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Accountants to give evidence on BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PARTNERS and a senior manager in Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm,
are to give evidence to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation about Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, which was closed by the Bank of England
last July.
Price Waterhouse, former auditor of BCCI, yesterday declined to identify the
three men, saying it was the firm's policy not to give out in-dividuals'
names for security reasons.
The three were involved in the Bank of England's investigation of BCCI.
The FBI wants their evidence as part of the US Department of Justice's
investigation into BCCI's involvement with three US banks - First American,
Independence Bank of Encino, California, and CenTrust Savings Bank in Miami,
Florida.
At Bow Street magistrates' court yesterday Mr Philip Sales, counsel for the
three witnesses, said they and PW were anxious to fulfil their public duties
and co-operate with the investigators, but they were bound by duties of
confidentiality.
They were therefore obliged, for their own protection, to give evidence
under compulsion, and accordingly witness orders had been made under the
1990 International Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act.
Earlier yesterday PW had cleared the way for the witnesses to co-operate
with the FBI by obtaining variations of High Court injunctions made against
BCCI restricting the provision of information to third parties.
The injunctions were granted last August to Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi
financier, Sheikh Kamal Adham, a former head of Saudi intelligence - both of
whom have been identified by the Federal Reserve as front men for BCCI in
its attempts to buy into the American banking industry - and Mr Elsayed
Eljawhary.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Spitalfields market project comes nearer fruition
</HEADLINE>

   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT of Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market in the City of London
has moved a step closer with the granting of outline consent by the London
Borough of Tower Hamlets.
The project, which involves building offices, shops and restaurants on the
12-acre site, now needs final approval from the environment secretary.
The plans for the first two buildings of the scheme, one of which is
designed by Sir Norman Foster, designer of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank
headquarters, were welcomed by the Corporation of London's planning and
communications committee. Sir Norman's building is designed to be a gateway
into the Spitalfields site. It has a series of external terraces that
provide a visual link between the big buildings on Broadgate and smaller
ones on the rest of the site.
Smithfield Development Group, the developer, is a partnership of BICC
Developments, Costain and London &amp; Edinburgh Trust. It says its plans to
build 1.1m sq ft of offices, 68,000 sq ft of shops and 165 flats would
generate jobs for 7,000 people.
The community benefits offered by the developer in return for planning
permission include 118 flats and houses and a public leisure centre. The
Corporation of London has approved the first phase of Smithfield market's
Pounds 50m refurbishment. Work will start in the next couple of months on
bringing the market up to the standards required by EC hygiene rules.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Clarke pledge on CTC programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE city technology college programme will expand if the Conservatives form
the next government, Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said yesterday.
The proposal, which features in the Conservative manifesto without any
detailed commitment, took educationalists by surprise. If it is to be more
than cosmetic, it may cost several hundred million pounds to implement. At
present only 15 such colleges are open or planned.
When the CTC initiative was launched in 1988 by Mr Kenneth Baker, then
education secretary, the cost of setting up the colleges was intended to
come largely from business and industry. Few private sponsors were found,
however, and more than three quarters of the start-up cost has come from the
Treasury. The cost to the government so far has been nearly Pounds 100m,
against Pounds 30m to the private sector.
Until yesterday, ministers had played down ideas of establishing new CTCs,
and talked instead of devoting extra technology funding to existing schools.
But Mr Clarke said in an interview in yesterday's Times Educational
Supplement: 'CTCs have been a great success and we shall be able to get
more.' On cost, he said he was 'attracted to the 80/20 split' between public
and private-sector funding. 'I shall be able to get more sponsors,' he
added. 'I don't think it was possible when the Labour party was threatening
the schools.'
Labour and the Liberal Democrats are committed to ending the CTC initiative
and placing the colleges under local education authority control.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, accused Mr Clarke of 'making up
policy on the hoof'.
Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'Mr Clarke is
stubbornly refusing to let a failed policy drop. CTCs are the key to the
two-tier system the Conservatives are creating, which involves extra funding
for some schools at the expense of the rest.'

FT  28 MAR 92 / Lautro pins hopes on training to cure life industry ills:
Why 500 sales agents have been barred from touting for customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING has become the battle cry of the life industry's regulators. In the
past two months, about 500 sales agents at two firms have been barred from
soliciting customers because regulators have decided they are simply not
competent to do so.
Regulators are increasingly taking the view that inadequately trained sales
agents cannot offer customers the 'best advice' required under the 1986
Financial Services Act, or even 'suitable advice'.
Consider the case, cited by the insurance ombudsman earlier this week, of
the 18-year-old with no dependants who was sold a life assurance policy with
no savings component. In his defence the sales agent said he made the
recommendation after receiving one week of training in which he was not told
about endowments and other savings-type products. Not until five months
later, during further training, did he hear of the alternatives.
Mr Kit Jebbens, chief executive of Lautro, the self-regulating body for the
life industry, said: 'It is the oral presentation and the discussion that is
the most powerful means of persuading someone about the advantages of a
product.
'We believe that there is a strong correlation between the standard of
training and the behaviour of sales representatives in the oral
presentation.'
The stiffest regulatory action by Lautro in its three-year life have focused
on training. 'I believe this will have more effect than any other thing we
could do,' Mr Jebbens said.
The matter of training goes to the heart of the most troubling consumer
complaint in life assurance. Far more common than outright fraud are
instances of 'mis-selling' - the purchase of products unsuitable for the
client. Unsuitable policies are more likely to be cancelled within the first
few years - an act that can cost consumers a large portion of premiums paid.
Within the past two months Lautro has formally suspended the 140-strong
sales force of Oaklife Insurance and asked Windsor Life to 'voluntarily
suspend' its 350-strong sales force until they can be properly retrained.
Lautro declines to comment publicly in detail what the sales agents were
doing. However, in the case of Windsor, where shortcomings were uncovered
during a routine compliance visit last December, it is believed that sales
agents were unable to answer questions about such basic matters as the
charges on the unit-linked policies they were selling. Windsor's sales
agents are paid no salary and earn a commission on each policy sold.
Also, at both companies, compliance reviews were said to have shown the
inadequacy of training when the so-called 'fact finds' were examined. Those
are records, required to be kept on each client, which contain personal
details of the individual's financial and tax circumstances and an
explanation of why a particular product was recommended as the most
suitable.
In the case of the 'fact finds', information was either found to be too
limited for the sales agent to have been able to assess the client's actual
financial needs, or else the information contradicted the recommendation of
the most suitable product.
Of course, regulators acknowledge that the best training is not going to
deter an unscrupulous sales agent from closing a deal, particularly if a
commission is at stake. Mr Jebbens acknowledges that 'integrity' is as
critical to the tendency to offer best advice as training. For many
companies, moreover, much of what has traditionally been described as
training is little more than instruction in sales technique.
Lautro rules simply require that sales agents be 'competent and suitable'.
But after publication in May 1990 of the McDonald report which examined
standards of competency in the sale of financial services products, Lautro
and the other self-regulating bodies were ordered to set training standards.
The rules are not due to take effect until April next year, but Mr Jebbens
says companies are already revising their training programmes to take
account of the new framework.
Meanwhile, life houses, responding to recent rules requiring them to
disclose expenses, point out that the new training requirements set out by
the Financial Services Act have sharply increased sales costs.
Mr Tony Jackson, assistant director of sales and training at Allied Dunbar,
said the company spends about Pounds 11m a year on training, nearly double
the total of five years ago.

FT  28 MAR 92 / CBI reports 'patchy' rise in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for goods manufactured in the UK has increased slightly this month,
indicating that recent falls in production are beginning to flatten out.
The March monthly industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British
Industry said UK manufacturers reported a small rise in home and export
orders while total order books remained depressed.
The survey, one of the last significant economic indicators before the
election, found that only 8 per cent of the 1,439 companies surveyed said
their orders were above normal while 55 per cent said they were below.
The difference between the two figures - which measures the overall state of
order books - was -47, the smallest negative result since January 1991.
Balances were -60 in January this year and -52 in February.
Mr David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's economic situation committee,
said: 'Total order books are at their best levels since January last year,
although improvements in demand are patchy.'
Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, said the improvement in
home and export order books was an encouraging confirmation that the economy
was set to grow again.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the high
proportion of companies reporting orders below normal confirmed that Britain
remained in recession.
Stocks of finished goods have been further depleted this month. More than
three in five companies - 63 per cent - said their stocks were adequate,
while 21 per cent said they were more than adequate. Only 5 per cent said
their stocks were inadequate.
Textiles, aerospace and mechanical engineering were particularly affected by
high stock levels, which continued to hold back output.
The CBI said output was expected to flatten out over the next four months.
In that period only 20 per cent of companies expect an improvement against
22 per cent predicting a decline.
The CBI said the March expectations were consistent with the results of the
previous six months, some of which pointed to a marginal increase in output
while others suggested a small decline. A year ago, output was expected to
decline significantly.
The survey, which covers roughly half of UK manufacturing employment and
exports, found that fewer than one manufacturer in five expected to be able
to raise prices in the next four months. The CBI said these were the weakest
price expectations in a March survey since 1975.
'Intense competition is continuing to constrain price increases,' Mr
Wigglesworth said. 'This is clearly good news in the fight against
inflation.'
Export order books also improved in spite of slower growth elsewhere in
Europe, but remained below a high reached last November. Many British
manufacturers have concentrated on improving exports as long as the British
economy remains depressed. Thirteen per cent of companies said their export
order books were above normal, against 45 per cent saying they were below.

FT  28 MAR 92 / BA avionics plant to be built in Wales will create 400 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is to build a Pounds 23m avionics servicing plant at
Llantrisant near Cardiff which will eventually employ 400 people, it was
announced yesterday.
Simultaneously General Electric, the US aero-engine maker, forecast that the
workforce at its Cardiff-area engine maintenance centre would rise from
1,000 to 1,350 by the end of this year.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, announced both developments during an
election visit to south Wales. He said the region had become a powerful
magnet for inward investment.
Work on the avionics centre will begin in September and the unit should be
in operation two years later. Lord King, chairman of British Airways, who
accompanied the prime minister during the first part of the day, sought to
reassure the 300 workers now employed by the airline on avionics at London's
Heathrow airport.
Transfer of the plant to Cardiff would not involve any redundancies at
Heathrow, he said. 'The 300 workers there will be offered the chance of
moving to Wales or continuing their employment with the airline in other
sections at Heathrow.'
The avionics plant will be BA's second big investment in the Cardiff area.
Two years ago the airline announced that it was to build a Pounds 70m
aircraft maintenance base next to Cardiff airport to service its fleet of
Boeing 747 airliners, again moving the work from Heathrow. The base will
employ 1,200 people, and recruiting is expected to begin soon.
General Electric bought its engine maintenance centre from BA last December.
Mr Brian Rowe, senior vice-president of GE aircraft engines, said the plant
would become 'the European centre for maintenance for this part of the
world'.
It expects to overhaul some 500 engines, mostly Pratt &amp; Whitneys and
Rolls-Royces, and some 200 auxiliary power units this year.
It will eventually also handle the new generation of engines which the US
company is to supply to BA for the latest model of the Boeing 747.
Holgates, a north Wales-based confectionery manufacturer, yesterday
announced a management buy-out led by its managing director, Mr Peter
Saunders, from its parent Nestle. The move safeguards 75 jobs. Mr Saunders
bought Holgates in 1976 and sold it to Rowntree Mackintosh 1983.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Political leaders lose the limelight - Media
Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WAS the week a frustrated media stormed the platform of a dull election
campaign and seized the microphones from the politicians.
Surrounded by cameras, Mirrorman interviewed Expressman. The editor of The
Independent coyly declined to be pressed further. Mr Kinnock's press officer
made an emotional address. If Jennifer's ear didn't ache before, it must be
throbbing now.
All the serious papers, of course, found it a shocking distraction from the
important issues facing Britain. Then they piled into the fray - it's not
just the voters of Great Grimsby who were tiring of an election composed
entirely of debates about tax tables.
Political experts say that anything which puts health in the headlines helps
Labour, which all goes to show how little the media affects public opinion.
Polls regularly show strong public opposition to the government's health
service reforms, even though all the daily broadsheets think Labour would be
wrong wholly to reverse them.
As for the whodunnit, the Tory tabloids were loud and vicious, News at Ten
boldly said the Conservatives had come off best on day one and the Guardian
assailed Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, for double standards. 'Will
Mr Hattersley now propose privacy legislation to prevent the identity of
5-year-olds in Labour party broadcasts from being revealed?' the paper
asked.
Into this chaos an ancient knight did stride: it was Sir Robin Day's turn to
interview the prime minister, for Thames's This Week. Sir Robin could not
have looked more uncomfortable as he reshuffled his cue cards to lead in
with questions on what he called 'this wretched row'.
By the time the interview reached the important issues facing Britain, it
had lost pace and direction. Sir Robin is no longer match-fit for this sort
of thing, but his regular spots on BBC Breakfast News with Norman Tebbit,
Denis Healey and Lord Jenkins offer one of the campaign's few oases of
crafted political discourse.
The best-conducted big television interview so far was that between David
Dimbleby and Paddy Ashdown on Panorama this week. Dimbleby's opening
strategy for the interview - to identify the fact that the sweet-smelling
Lib Dems are the highest tax party in this election - was delivered with
impressive precision.
An altogether different technique was at work when Brian Walden met John
Major last Sunday. Walden had decided that Mr Major will always meet
reasoned inquiry with plodding, reasoned response and set out instead to
extract emotion. The prime minister refused to apologise for the poll tax or
to express personal grief at the plight of the unemployed. It was like
watching killer bees buzzing around the head of the man smoking the Hamlet
cigar. I thought Mr Major was badly stung.
On the whole, though, Mr Major has given a prodigious number of interviews
and made few errors. Mr Kinnock's minders will be nervous as he faces Walden
on Sunday, Dimbleby on Monday and Day next Thursday.
Don't worry if you're bored by all this. The viewing figures for Week One of
the campaign show that, as usual, TV news is less watched in elections than
at any other time. Which leads me to Des Wilson.
Mr Wilson, who calls himself the Lib Dems' general election director (others
call him, through gritted teeth, Mr Ashdown's deputy), is angry that his
party has not been getting its theoretically allotted 28.5 per cent of
airtime. In a letter to The Independent, he lamented this media squeeze. But
he noted that - in spite of this neglect - polls show Mr Ashdown has been
the campaign's most effective leader.
Think again, Mr Wilson - you have accidentally discovered the secret of
success. Keep your man off television and win the election. Leave the podium
clear for journalists.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher flagship about to enter breaker's
yard - The Issues: Local Government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH POLL tax demands landing on doormats this week and next, Mrs Thatcher's
flagship is set to make a last blazing appearance on its way to the
breaker's yard. This is ironic because the parties are less divided on local
taxation than on most other aspects of local government.
By next April, local taxation will return to a system of property rates,
whoever wins. The Liberal Democrats are campaigning on a local income tax,
but in a hung parliament they would be in a weak position to demand a third
change to local taxation in as many years.
The argument is about the form the rates should take. Mr Michael Heseltine's
banded council tax keeps down the cost for more expensive houses, with
single-person discounts to safeguard those who, he argues, were penalised by
the old rates.
Mr Bryan Gould, his Labour shadow, intends to retain neither banding nor
discounts in his 'fair rates', and is also threatening to go back to 1973
valuations, which would yield a peculiar crop of winners and losers. There
is also broad underlying agreement on the other local-government issue in
the election limelight - the move towards single-tier authorities. All three
parties favour a unitary system based largely on existing district councils.
Whoever wins, next year's county council elections will probably be the last
for most of England and Wales.
The manifestos offer starkly different visions of the role of town halls. If
the Tories win, it will be more of the same - tendering, annual
rate-capping, efforts to reduce spending, erosion of powers - with schools
clearly the next target for removal from council control.
Under Labour, capping and compulsory competitive tendering would go, the
business rate would be returned to local control, councils would once more
become housebuilders, they would keep their schools - although devolved
budgets and local management would continue - and would be given a general
power of competence to take on other functions as they wish. The Tories
oppose the all of this.
Labour's packaging and many of its policies are radically different to
pre-1979, let alone the 1980s. To counter the London and Liverpool 'loony
left' image which used to dominate Labour's local-government profile, the
party has been successfully marketing the likes of Oxford, Manchester, York
and Islington in north London as studiously progressive authorities.
York is Labour's model council, boasting a Citizen's Charter years before
John Major thought of the idea. Launched in 1989, York's charter comes
complete with a tenants' charter and customer contracts for refuse
collection and street-cleaning, making the staid minster city a plausible
Labour riposte to Wandsworth, the Conservatives' showpiece borough in south
London.
It brings in the votes, too. The council, run by the Tories until 1983, now
has a crushing Labour majority which the party's candidate Mr Hugh Bayley, a
former Camden councillor, is confident will help eradicate the 147-vote
majority of the sitting Tory, Mr Conal Gregory.
Mr Gregory derides York's charter as PR glitz with no teeth, and points to
this year's 33 per cent rise in the poll tax as the 'real face of York's
hard left'. Yet few buyers could be found for that bogey: the parties
broadly agreed on spending plans, and the decision about the level of the
poll tax came down to a complex argument about the use of reserves. As to
glitz, Labour counters with opinion surveys which show that more than three
quarters of voters are satisfied with cleaning and collection services.
Ms Karen Anderson, the Liberal Democrat candidate, said:'Yes, the bin men
have improved, but most people still think it's all too glossy.'
Glossy or not Mr Rod Hills, the council leader, plans to extend customer
contracts across the range of services, and to give neighbourhoods a greater
say in their management. 'We already have four area committees, but we want
to get down much further than that,' he says.
Tendering of local services is another source of local dispute. The council
was forced to re-tender for its street cleaning after refusing to accept a
private-sector offer lower than that of its direct labour force. Mr Gregory
wants a future Tory government to shift control of the tendering process
from the council to the district auditor. Mr Hills insists he acted in good
faith, but is unenthusiastic about competitive tendering and would not
continue it 'as a matter of course' if Labour were to win.
Council housing produces a less clear-cut division. Mr Gould would release
part of the council's accumulated receipts for housebuilding, although the
exact amounts are not clear. Nationally, the Conservatives are opposed. But
Mr Peter Brown, leader of the city's Tories, would favour it for York. 'It
would benefit housing here - the restrictions are only there because of a
small minority of extremist councils.' So much for the hard left.
Both sides agree that councils should not be the sole providers of social
housing. Mr Brown wants nothing other than sheltered accommodation for the
elderly built by the council itself, and believes that the rest should be
done in partnership with housing associations. Mr Bayley would let the
council take the lead, but says he is 'open-minded' about joint schemes with
private developers.
Both sides also want to end the dominion of Tory-controlled North Yorkshire
county council and restore the city's county borough status. As Mr Brown
says: 'When all's said and done, the county council is foreign.'

Baker appeared in the constituency on Wednesday to dismiss Coe's locally

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The election in Scotland is attracting record coverage in Scandinavia. At
Scottish National party meetings away from Edinburgh and Glasgow,
representatives of foreign media often outnumber their UK counterparts three
or four to one.
'People in Denmark aren't interested in the NHS,' said one Danish reporter.
Scotland's possible independence, on the other hand, is almost on a par with
the breakaway Baltic republics.
The Scans have been watching the SNP's progress closely because the party
says Scotland could be part of a future Nordic bloc in the European
Community. Some of their potential partners remain sceptical, however.
'Independence isn't going to happen,' said a Swedish TV commentator, 'but
it's fun watching them try.'

Norma Major, the prime minister's wife, must have wondered whether she had
caught the wrong bus yesterday. On her husband's visit to a General Electric
plant outside Cardiff, the local host welcomed everyone on the platform
party except her. A few minutes later Lord King, chairman of British
Airways, who accompanied the party, similarly ignored her presence.
While the prime minister spent half an hour touring the US company's engine
works, she was left behind among the throng in the reception centre. At one
point she looked quite forlorn, leaning against the wall on her own.

<TEXT>
Lord Weir, chairman of the engineering company Weir Group, yesterday
launched an organisation called Save the Union to fight against devolution
and independence for Scotland. He is among 20 leading Scots, including
several senior businessmen, who signed a letter in yesterday's Scotsman and
Herald newspapers. They have taken large advertisements in tomorrow's
Scottish Sunday papers.
Weir says that there has been so much propaganda 'of a biased and populist
kind' on the future of Scotland that objective discussion has been almost
impossible. Devolution would bring 'dangerous uncertainty to Scottish
industry and business'.
Other signatories include Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle,
David Murray, chairman of Murray International and of Glasgow Rangers, Nick
McAndrew, chief executive of fund managers Murray Johnstone, Sir Ross Belch,
chairman of Ferguson Shipbuilders, and Sandy Struthers, chairman of
Caledonian MacBrayne.
Haven't they left it rather late? 'On the contrary,' says Lord Weir. 'The
whole issue isn't going to disappear with the election. We want to be a
rallying point for the future.'

For the business community of Swindon, one of Britain's archetypal 1980s
boom towns, Labour's plans for a national minimum wage and increased taxes
on higher incomes seem to be causing few palpitations. A question-and-answer
lunch debate with election candidates and the local chamber of commerce
produced not one hostile question to the Labour challenger Jim D'Avila, a
bearded Rover toolmaker.
Nick Davies, the chamber's president, said he was surprised nobody brought
up the tax issue. A bigger surprise, however, was that Simon Coombs, the
incumbent Tory MP, failed to turn up. He sent an apology saying that he had

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories facing a pasting - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative Central Office seems remarkably relaxed about the fact that it
is losing the window-poster war.
The Tories have plastered billboards across the country with paid
advertisements in the largest campaign of its type ever launched. But across
the country's window-panes from marginal Tooting to Birmingham Yardley - a
Liberal Democrat target - they appear to be trailing.
The Tory line is that their supporters are modest souls who are 'not big
poster displayers'. According to an official: 'They are the silent majority,
but they will turn out on polling day.' In the next breath he adds that it
was 'always my policy in a general election to put up posters in the final
week of the campaign.' The reason for this is what he calls 'the boredom
factor'.
So far it is rare to find a street in which more than one in 10 of the
houses has a poster. In Islington South, however, there is a touch of
nostalgia. A window poster has gone up saying 'Vote Alliance', the grouping
which disappeared after the 1987 election.

'Conservative gainers' dropped by less than a third of that and 'Labour

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: War of Jennifer's ear ends in a draw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUND and fury over the fate of Miss Jennifer Bennett at the hands of
the National Health Service looked set to end with a whimper last night as
both main political parties exhausted their supplies of righteous
indignation.
As early as yesterday morning both Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr John Major
appeared to be sending lightly coded messages through their news conferences
to each other that it might be best to call a draw.
Barring fresh revelations, the melodrama, complete with comic scenes of
journalists interviewing journalists before the television cameras and
behind-the-scenes spin-doctors taking walk-on roles, had become too
incestuous a soap opera to merit endless repeats.
Two big questions remain unanswered. Perhaps it will never be known how The
Independent and the Daily Express obtained the name of Jennifer, whose
delayed ear operation was presented by Labour as a symbol of the
inadequacies of the NHS.
Yet the more self-critical analysts were yesterday asking: who really cares?
The central justification for the lashings of moral outrage that the case
engendered was, after all, entirely false. This was that Jennifer's life had
been ruined by the press attention that was, it was alleged, gratuitously
triggered by a leak from a political party as yet unidentified.
This argument was weakened by the cheerful face of the child before the
cameras and her parents' relaxed, even amused appearance on Channel 4's
Midnight Special programme.
But what of the political impact of it all? Sunday's opinion polls may give
answers, but some assumptions can be made.
The mud-slinging, for example, must have confirmed the prejudices of
anti-politician sentiment - a response that must augur well for the Liberal
Democrats.
The protests of Mr Patten and Mr Major that the film was inaccurate must
equally have found a resonance with the party faithful, just as Mr Kinnock's
occasional intemperate attacks on the government and the Tory tabloids will
have fuelled the prejudices of those who dislike him.
Add to this the sloppy provision by Walworth Road of other examples of NHS
delays or slip-ups, later proved inaccurate, and the 'You Can't Trust
Labour' slogan was given added weight.
The official Conservative Central Office theory that the row successfully
obscured Labour's promise of an extra Pounds 1bn for the NHS must also carry
some credence, though how much it is hard to gauge.
On the other hand, the Tories suffered from losing time to push their own
agenda.
The media clamour blew once and for all the government's chance to tell its
side of the NHS story.
Mr Waldegrave's chorus line of distinguished doctors, gathered to promote
the Tory reforms, were also rendered redundant.
Many neutral observers agree with Labour that the mere mention of health in
an election, whatever the circumstances, is a bonus for their campaign. And
that the 'two-tier' NHS charge is now common currency.
For the Conservative party, whose prime electoral pitch is competence and
the integrity of its leader, it was a poorly managed affair.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Bickering gets on family's nerves - The
Martins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Martins, the FT's family of floating voters, give their views on the
second week of the campaign
HEALTH matters trapped the Martin family this week.
By the end of it, Keeley and Westley, the youngsters, had bad throats but
wanted pastilles and sympathy rather than an operation. Lyn started work
again at the Yardley Green complex of East Birmingham Hospital after a
lengthy sick leave and joined the preparations for merging two wards into
one. And, with growing distaste, the family watched Conservative and Labour
politicians wage the War of Jennifer's Ear.
Clearly the politicians and their treatment of the health issue this week
have done little to encourage the Martins - Lyn, Tony and their elder son,
Russell - to come off the fence of their indecision about voting.
'The bickering is getting on everybody's nerves,' said Lyn.
Tony said: 'It's the two parties, but it's not a two-party fight. The Lib
Dems are the only ones who have come out of this with any credit.'
Russell added: 'Diabolical harping on it (the case of Jennifer Bennett) and
Labour keeping on bringing it up as a slur on the Tories. It's like two kids
in the street arguing - 'you done this, you done that'.'
The Martins were moved by the Labour election broadcast, though dubious
about its taste. The aftermath left them cold. 'Where do we put our trust?'
queried Lyn.
Tony replied: 'The only one so far is Paddy Ashdown. They've not led anybody
up the garden path,' he said of the Liberal Democrats.
The Conservatives and Labour have been doing themselves no good, argued
Russell. 'Both parties set out their goals and what they want to achieve.
They're just hindering themselves with this silly bickering.'
In any case, the Martins' perception of the National Health Service, like
that of many others, is coloured more by their own experience than the
political bandying of statistics. Lyn thought the issue of waiting lists had
been blown up out of proportion. 'Three years ago Keeley had tonsillitis.
The out-patients department saw her on January 29, she was in at Easter and
operated on.'
'It was the same with me,' continued Lyn. 'I was referred and seen within
six weeks for a major operation.' That was last year, at Solihull District
General.
'It was the same with the other girls in the ward. One of them had paid a
consultant initially: she didn't get in any quicker.'
'They said 10 to 12 days (to be sent home) and I was out in seven,' Lyn
commented.
'But if you're trying to cut waiting lists, they need the bed,' Tony came
back. 'There always will be a two-tier system. You won't stop people paying
consultants. No government will change that.'
The family agreed that funding the NHS was like pouring money into a
bottomless pit: there never would be enough.
'They've all promised to put money into the NHS, but where's it going to
come from?' Lyn asked.
Tony replied: 'Only one party said you'll have to pay for it.'
'Paddy Ashdown,' chimed Russell. 'He's kept himself aside from this,' he

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: True blue shires on defensive as tide
threatens to turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BESET BY the recession, Tory candidates have been forced on to the defensive
across a swathe of true blue England.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats remain vulnerable to Conservative charges
that their plans for increased spending would require higher tax rises than
they admit.
Yet the Conservative runners in three highly disparate Tory constituencies -
John Biffen in the safe seat of North Shropshire, David Amess in Basildon
and John Taylor in Cheltenham - are aware that the electoral tide may be
turning.
Mr Biffen, chief secretary to the Treasury in Margaret Thatcher's first
government, is the only member of the 1979 cabinet standing for re-election.
He has been MP for the constituency since 1961.
Ensconced in his comfortable house near Offa's Dyke, Mr Biffen speaks with
the frankness of an iconoclastic elder statesman defending an impregnable
14,415 majority.
He senses a swing away from the Tories, especially in the commuter towns
closer to the industrial outcrops of the Midlands to the east of his
constituency. 'I suspect the polls are right in assessing a revival of
Labour fortunes.'
The government has 'blotted its copybook' over the economy, health,
education, crime and, above all, the community charge, says Mr Biffen, who
was among about 30 Conservative MPs who voted against the poll tax in the
Commons. In the eyes of constituents, he says, 'this has done me no harm'.
He expresses mild surprise that Labour is not farther ahead in the opinion
polls.
Cutting the figure of a Victorian parson, Mr Biffen tours his patch of 60
villages with his wife and shooting-stick. He avoids asking householders
their voting intentions as this would be 'an intrusion'.
In Essex, the campaigning style is more brusque. Mr Amess, who won Basildon
in 1983 and had a 2,649 majority in 1987, travels round his constituency
with a team of clipboard-carrying canvassers. His motorised caravan blares
out the jingle 'David is the man for you'.
Basildon, a new town which at 42 is two years older than Mr Amess, has
suffered a sharp downturn in the local economy, both in manufacturing and
services. Unemployment stands at 10.2 per cent, more than double the level
of two years ago.
Lionel Webber, vicar of St Martin's Church in the town centre, who helps run
the local unemployment advice office, says that the hopes of many have been
'knocked flat' by the downturn. But many Tory voters who achieved prosperity
during the 1980s will stick to the Conservatives 'even though it's beginning
to crumble all around them', he says.
Pressed about the effects of the recession, Mr Amess says he is happy to be
the 'underdog' in the tussle with the Labour candidate, John Potter, a
former computer manager in Ford's nearby research centre.
Ragged Tory nerves are also on display in Cheltenham, a Conservative fiefdom
for most of the post-war period, where Mr Taylor, a barrister of Jamaican
origin chosen as Tory candidate following the retirement of the long-serving
MP Sir Charles Irving, faces a struggle to hold on to the 4,896 majority.
The principal challenge comes from the Liberal Democrats, who run the
borough council.
Mr Taylor tours the shops telling voters that the downturn in the local
economy - where many jobs in companies such as Smith's Industries and Dowty
are defence-related - has been caused by the world recession and 'the end of
the Cold War'. He accuses Nigel Jones, the Liberal Democrat candidate, of
being 'a socialist'.
Mr Taylor has made an impressive effort to put down roots in Cheltenham, but
the national mood and some Conservatives' antagonism towards a black
candidate may count against him.
General elections are frequently lost by governments rather than won by
oppositions. The contest on April 9 looks likely to be decided not by the
persuasiveness of opposition policies, but by the government's tarnished
record.
If there are signs of fraying nerves among the Tories in the shires, it may
be because they are starting to ponder how to allocate the blame.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Polls show leads for Labour in regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR has taken a two-point lead in the battle for London, according to a
Harris poll for London Weekend Television published last night.
The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent and the Conservatives on 40 per cent.
This represents a remarkable turnaround since the 1987 general election,
when the Conservatives led by 15 per cent, and indicates a swing of 8.5 per
cent, which would give Labour 21 Conservative-held seats in the capital.
Repeated nationally, that would put Mr Neil Kinnock on the edge of a
parliamentary majority. The poll sample was 846, and was conducted between
Monday and Wednesday.
Neither of the Conservatives' trump cards seems to have impressed Londoners.
Although Mr John Major has a 14-point lead over Mr Kinnock as 'best prime
minister', only 4 per cent cited party leaders as one of the 'most important
issues'. Just 11 per cent of the poll sample mentioned taxation as 'the most
important issue regarding the national economy', with 37 per cent of the
sample naming unemployment as the most important.
This latest regional poll shakes a traditional Conservative assumption that
their strength in crucial parts of the country might prevent Labour from
translating a national poll lead into parliamentary seats.
National polls are snapshots of voting intention, accurate to within 3 per
cent. They are, however, inadequate as a guide to the likely outcome of the
general election, because the key marginal seats are unevenly distributed
across the country.
A total of 65 of the 94 Tory-held seats which Labour probably needs to win
to gain a parliamentary majority are in London, north-west England and the
Midlands. It is in these three regions that the outcome of the election will
be decided.
Any translation of national polls into terms of prospective regional voting
trends come with psephologists' health warnings. Sample sizes are not
designed to be representative of the particular region. However, from three
of the most substantial breakdowns, a hazy regional pattern emerges.
A 'Gallup 9,000' poll interviewed nearly 12,000 people between February 19
and March 17. The BBC political unit has twice compiled regional patterns
from its 'poll of polls', using figures only when 1,000 people were
questioned in each region. The first covered polls from March 11-18, the
more recent March 19-25.
All three analyses indicate a national Labour lead of about 1-2 per cent.
The 'Gallup 9,000' and the earlier BBC breakdown offered some comfort for
the Conservatives in London and the north-west.
The BBC found an 8.5 per cent swing to Labour in the Midlands, netting Mr
Kinnock 24 Conservative-held marginals, but its suggested London swing of 6
per cent would have seen only 12 of Labour's 21 desired seats in the capital
change hands. That tallied with Gallup's findings.
The most recent BBC regional breakdown, broadcast last night, supports the
Harris poll finding that London is now moving more substantially to Labour.
It puts the swing to Labour in the capital at 8 per cent.
The BBC political unit now projects that Labour will win at least 83
Conservative-held seats, leaving Mr Kinnock as leader of the largest party
but about 14 seats short of an overall majority. With 12 days left to
polling, Any small shift in the regional pattern may still be crucial in
deciding who occupies Downing Street.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown to stand firm on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night stressed his
party's commitment to a single European currency and criticised Britain's
delay in joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary
system.
Because Britain was late to join the ERM, 'we were late in the battle
against inflation and under Mr Major and Mr Kinnock, we will be late to join
a single European currency. But join we must,' he told a rally in Leeds.
He is expected to make clear at the weekend that the Liberal Democrats would
insist on a more pro-European stance if they were to form a government with
either Labour or the Tories.
The Liberal Democrat leader will use a trip to Bologne tomorrow, where he
will meet other European Liberal party leaders, to set out his party's
policy on Europe and indicate how he would use any negotiating muscle he has
after April 9 to push for Britain to back a single European currency.
Mr Ashdown also heightened yesterday the priority he would attach to
Scottish devolution in a hung parliament. 'It is inconceivable that we would
agree to a programme for the next parliament which did not include a
commitment to legislate for a Scottish parliament,' he said.
He described Scottish home rule as 'the first step' in the reform of the UK
political system. But he again insisted that law for PR at Westminster
remained the overriding condition for a post-election pact.
His comments at a press conference in Edinburgh came as opinion polls showed
a further slip in Liberal Democrat support in Scotland to 7 per cent
compared with 19 per cent at the 1987 general election.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major builds momentum on hostile ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR took his campaign into the Labour heartland of south Wales
yesterday with jokes about Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary,
whose very name provokes a laugh in Tory audiences.
In a confident performance before 200-300 Tories, Mr Major mocked Mr
Kaufman's low profile. 'Where's he been? Where's he gone? Will he ever come
back? Do we care?'
Since the soft sell of a visit to a primary school in Grantham that opened
his travels, the prime minister's campaign has moved some way down the road
of political relevance, but still has a lot further to go.
Yesterday's visit to inaugurate a new engine maintenance centre in Nantgarw
at least had a clear reason, in the 400 new jobs announced for the occasion.
Elsewhere, from a road-rail freight yard in Melton Mowbray, in one of the
country's safest Tory seats, to a garden centre in Poppleton, North
Yorkshire, the purpose of parts of the Major roadshow in this second week of
campaigning has been more obscure than the origins of the phrase 'double
whammy'.
The schedule seems based on Keynesian politics. Every time there is momentum
after a rousing speech or a good reception on a walkabout, the brake is
applied with a pause or an un-newsworthy visit.
Travelling in the hermetically sealed capsule of the Major-mobile produces a
sense of dislocation. Even with the portable computers, fax machines and
mobile telephones, the team is distanced from the rest of the Tory campaign.
That may be an advantage. Mr Major's performance in set-piece rallies and
question-and-answer sessions has become sharper.
The attacks on Labour are gaining in virulence: apocalyptic language of
destruc-tion, calamity and disaster has become commonplace.
Alongside the onslaught on Labour's tax plans, the assault on its 'strikers'
charter' has escalated. The suggestion that Labour is 'soft' on crime is
also rising up the agenda.
It is perhaps a more positive trait that wherever the prime minister speaks
he continues to sound passionate about the impact on all of the UK of
separation for Scotland (and Wales), even though it scarcely registers as an
issue in England.
Mr Major seems to enjoy getting out of London and finds campaigning fun.
He appears pleased by the genuinely warm and largely enthusiastic welcome he
receives on tour, both in party rallies and meetings and on walkabout.
But it would be a politically naive assessment, uncharacteristic of Mr
Major, to translate a friendly reaction to a famous figure surrounded by
television cameras into a clear majority for the Tory party.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hopes fade for big swing to SNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SCOTLAND the signs are that Labour is consolidating its traditional
position as the leading party and that the Scottish National party is not
making the big breakthrough it had hoped for, James Buxton writes.
The Tories are static and support for the Liberal Democrats appears to be
falling to dangerously low levels.
Opinion polls suggest that Labour has the support of at least 42 per cent of
the Scottish electorate. A System Three poll for The Herald newspaper,
published yesterday, showed Labour on 44 per cent, a rise of 6 points since
February.
The same poll, taken between March 19 and 24, showed a 2-point drop in
support for the SNP to 26 per cent, a level roughly consistent with other
polls.
Two polls this week put the Tories on 22 per cent, while System Three put
support for the Liberal Democrats down 2 points at only 7 per cent. Other
polls have put them on 9 per cent.
That means Labour might win 50 of the 72 Scottish seats, as it did in 1987.
Backing for the SNP is running at twice its 1987 level, but majorities in
Labour-held seats are mostly so large that the nationalists stand little
chance of taking more than one or two seats from it.
The outcome in terms of seats for the SNP, the Tories and the Liberal
Democrats depends on the shift of relatively few votes among four parties in
marginal seats.
Nevertheless, broadly speaking, the SNP stands to gain a few seats (it has
five, although one came through a defection from Labour), the Tories to lose
a few (they have nine) and the Liberal Democrats to lose some (they have
10).
The Conservatives and the SNP are campaigning mainly on the constitutional
issue, with the Tories upholding the status quo and the nationalists
proclaiming independence.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Opposition to focus London attack on Tory
marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will start with-drawing party workers from its safe seats in London
this weekend to concentrate its attack on Tory marginals in the capital.
The tactical switch comes in the wake of a Harris/LWT poll giving the party
a two-point lead in the capital and indicating that it is within striking
distance of making the gains it needs in order to put Mr Neil Kinnock into
10 Downing Street.
The Labour party will withdraw workers from seats that it holds with a
comfortable majority and from safe Tory seats to campaign in the 25 or so
marginals which it has identified.
The move was described by the Tories as 'the decision of a party that is
desperate'. Conservative Central Office said Labour had 'conceded defeat' in
the capital by admitting there were 'vast swathes' of London it could not
win. 'What they are saying is the best they can ever do is just scrape into
power.' The Conservatives hold 58 seats and Labour 23 of the 84 Greater
London seats.
The Tories - working, they say, to a preordained plan - will also step up
their efforts, putting emphasis on face-to-face contact with voters and
aiming to 'peak at the right time'.
The Liberal Democrats plan to conduct a weekend examination of canvass
returns to determine whether their list of targets should be modified.
The party's decision to concentrate on seats where it has strong council
representation has produced a set of priorities in which Sutton &amp; Cheam
(Tory majority over Lib Dem 15,718) is a top-drawer target, but Islington
South and Finsbury (Labour majority over Lib Dem 805) is not.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: An effort to make some capital in vital
marginals - The Conservatives are on shaky ground in south London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Smith, a cleaning inspector with Merton council, has always voted
Conservative. But not this time. 'There's every danger of me losing my job
next year,' he says, explaining the Labour poster above the wistaria in his
front-room window.
If enough recession-hit Tory voters break the habit of a decade and follow
Mr Smith's example, Mitcham and Morden (Conservative majority 6,183) will
fall. Such a result would not be without irony: it was on the back of the
last recession that Mrs Angela Rumbold, home office minister, won the seat
in 1982, in the Conservatives' only by-election gain during 13 years in
office.
Mrs Rumbold is one of three ministers in marginal south London seats facing
stiff challenges from Labour. A 6.5 per cent capital-wide swing to Labour
could account for her, Mr Colin Moynihan, a junior energy minister, in
Lewisham East, and Mr John Maples, the number five in the Treasury, in
Lewisham West.
Although Mitcham and Morden has more of the air of suburbia than the partly
inner-city Lewisham seats, what will largely determine the outcome in each
contest is who most strongly appeals to the C2s, the skilled working class.
Many of these people have been hit hard by the recession, by unemployment -
which has risen sharply over the last year in all three seats - or by
tumbling property values, coupled with unmanageable monthly mortgage
repayments. It is hardly surprising that Mrs Rumbold is 'extremely anxious
to see a stable lowering of interest rates'.
The three campaigns will accordingly be linked by several common threads.
Labour's strong suits will include the state of the south-east economy and
the decrepitude of much public transport - the constituencies are home to
thousands of commuters.
The people's party will also seek to play the health card by highlighting
voters' concerns about the centralisation of hospital facilities. It will
hammer away, too, at its popular proposals for a strategic London
government, which the Tories are portraying as tantamount to reviving the
Greater London Council.
Constant Conservative themes will be charges of inefficiency in the
Labour-run Merton and Lewisham councils and the perniciousness of opposition
tax proposals as set out in the shadow Budget.
As a sub-text, the Tory campaigns are all likely to impress upon voters that
having a minister as your MP has its privileges. 'We are trying to get
across to people that it helps to have a voice in the lobby,' says a
Moynihan aide. The proof, both Lewisham MPs will argue, lies in the
re-routing away from their constituencies of the planned Channel tunnel rail
link.
The three contests throw up intriguing contrasts of style.
In Mitcham and Morden, Labour's Ms Siobhain McDonagh is as cheerfully
personable as Mrs Rumbold can sometimes appear forbidding. She is steeped in
the local politics of the neighbourhood, but cannot match Mrs Rumbold for
gravitas or authority.
A housing consultant, she is well placed to attack the government's record
on this potent local issue. The value of homes in Merton is estimated to
have fallen 11 per cent in the last three years.
In Lewisham West, the urbane and telegenic Mr Maples faces Labour's Mr Jim
Dowd, who has been a local councillor for 20 years, exudes local knowledge
and is clearly a practical politician down to his fingertips. 'We are the
only London borough with wheeled dustbins,' is a typical claim. He contends
that the Channel tunnel link fiasco has put back on the agenda Lewisham's
lack of Tube stations.
In a contest that may turn personal, Mr Dowd will attack his opponent's
north-of-the-river residency: 'The way he tells it, you would think it was
the transarctic expedition to get here.'
In Lewisham West, the energetic Mr Moynihan's campaign is picking up after a
slow start. Confronted by Ms Bridget Prentice, a wry Scot whose husband is
contesting Pendle for Labour, his strategists say he will similarly question
his opponent's commitment to Lewisham.
In 1987, Ms Prentice ran in Croydon Central against Mr John Moore, one of Mr
John Major's predecessors as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's heir-apparent.
Having won more than 20 per cent of the vote five years ago, the Liberal
Democrats may be more of a factor here. The party held on to a seat in a
council by-election last week in spite of what Mr Julian Hawkins, the
party's candidate, describes as a real improvement in the other parties'
campaigning.

THE US yesterday added 46 foreign companies to the list of those it regards
as agents of the Libyan government and bars from business with Americans, AP
reports from Washington.
'This action is part of ongoing Treasury efforts to tighten enforcement of
the US economic embargo against Libya,' the Treasury said.
The additions brought to 106 the number of companies on the US list of
'specially designated nationals' of the Libyan government. The list also
includes 20 individuals.
Most of the companies were based in Libya but the list also included some in
other North African countries, Italy, Britain, Germany, Spain, Switzerland
and Hungary, several with non-Libyan names.
Inclusion on the list brings the companies and individuals under the embargo
and asset freeze ordered against Libya by former President Reagan in 1986 to
undermine Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi's ability to promote and finance
terrorism.
The announcement said the companies included key Libya-controlled
organisations in the international banking, petroleum, investment and

FT  28 MAR 92 / NY cancels Dollars 12.5bnpower contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE state of New York last night cancelled a Dollars 12.5bn (Pounds 7.2bn)
contract for the purchase of 1m kW of hydro-electric power from
Hydro-Quebec, the Canadian utility that has come under harsh criticism from
environmentalists.
Hydro-Quebec said the cancellation of the contract would not endanger the
company's plans to expand its capacity by constructing generating stations
on the Great Whale River near Hudson Bay, Canada, but it could delay the
project's completion.
The contract was originally signed in 1989 by the New York Power Authority
(NYPA). Mr Richard Flynn, chairman of NYPA, said the contract  - which was
set to run from 1995 until the year 2016 - had been cancelled for economic
reasons. NYPA had made use of an escape clause in its contract because New
York's electricity needs were going to be less than expected and the
forecast price of oil and gas had fallen sharply.
A spokesman for Mr Flynn said that Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York, had
recommended the hydro-electric contract be cancelled. Last night Mr Cuomo
said that circumstances had 'changed dramatically' since the contract was
first signed.
Hydro-Quebec said that it had been unable to meet NYPA's request for a 30
per cent price cut.
The cancellation was taken as good news by environmentalist opponents of the
Great Whale generating project. Ms Judith Enck, an environmental activist
from the New York Public Interest Research group, last night forecast that
the project would collapse because of the cancelled contract.
However, Hydro-Quebec said it hoped to reopen negotiations with New York in
about two years time on the basis of new estimates of energy demand.

FT  28 MAR 92 / US and France in last-ditch effort to solve air row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French and US governments are to make a last-ditch attempt next week to
resolve a deadlock over dividing capacity on transatlantic air routes. If it
fails, there could be restrictions on flights in the next few weeks.
The row is over US demands for a more than 40 per cent average rise in the
number of seats alloted to US airlines this summer on routes between France
and the US.
France's Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) says this is far too
much to ask, on the grounds that air travel between the two countries is
expected to rise by only 10 per cent this year and that US airlines already
have the lion's share of Franco-American transatlantic travel.
The DGAC and the US Department of Transport will meet in Washington early in
the week to try to settle the row, which has been building up since their
annual talks on the share-out of transatlantic air route capacity began in
December. France will apply from tonight the 15 per cent average increase it
is prepared to accept in transatlantic flights from the eight main US
airlines, said a senior DGAC official.
However, France will not apply the 15 per cent rise evenly to all US
carriers. It is planning to freeze flights by TWA and Continental Airlines
at last year's levels, on the grounds that they are trading under Chapter 11
protection from creditors, considered an unfair advantage.
Other carriers would accordingly get more generous treatment, within the
overall limits. Failing agreement, any flights from the US above these
levels could be refused landing rights in France, said the official.
US airlines already occupied 70 per cent of the routes between France and
the US, a steep rise over the past eight years, because of their greater
capacity. Air France and its subsidiaries take the rest.
This is roughly in line with the share-out between Germany and the US,
though Britain has achieved a more favourable share of routes with the US.
A bigger swing in the US favour would make it harder for Air France to
allocate capacity to independent French airlines, a condition of EC
deregulation, said the DGAC. Industry officials accuse US airlines of
dumping, using high internal fares to subsidise transatlantic routes and
undercut European competitors. Air France was unable to comment.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Turks confirm armour used on Kurds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY said yesterday that Turkey had acknowledged using German-supplied
armoured cars in clashes with its minority Kurds, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said the Turkish government had
confirmed that vehicles from the former East German National People's Army
had been deployed in the Anatolia region 'for monitoring, surveillance and
observation'.
Bonn on Thursday accused Turkey of using German weapons against civilians
and halted arms sales to Ankara.
In Lisbon, the Portuguese presidency of the EC said it was seeking further
clarification from the Turkish authorities and EC diplomats in Ankara about
Turkey's attacks on Kurdish villages, before deciding on a common response
by the Twelve.
'There are indications that the situation is much more serious than has been
reported,' the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
EC diplomats refused to comment on what an EC declaration might contain, but
an EC-wide suspension of military equipment to a Nato member is thought
unlikely.

<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS of medical devices in the US will soon be required to trace
systematically their products through the distribution chain to the patient
if proposals put forward yesterday by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration
(FDA) become law.
Mr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, said: 'Tracking will help the FDA
protect the public by providing the information necessary to quickly remove
dangerous and defective devices from the market. Identifying and following
patients who receive these devices is also critical, so that the patients
can be notified promptly of any problems.'
The proposals would apply only to permanent implants and life-sustaining or
life-supporting devices. Manufacturers would have to develop a system of
tracing, identifying and reporting patients' names and locations of devices
to the FDA within three days.
The FDA said its new rules would apply to all devices approved after May 28.
The proposals come as concern grows that the government agency is incapable
of ensuring public safety. It has come under attack for being slow to remove
potentially unsafe medical devices, ranging from silicone gel breast
implants to heart valves, from the market.
Many experts believe that part of the problem with long-term product safety
is that the FDA has no power to monitor devices once they are on the market.

NINETEEN people were reported killed yesterday in fighting between Serbs and
Croats in Bosnia-Hercegovina, after its government warned that law and order
was on the verge of collapse throughout the central Yugoslav republic.
A three-member commission from Bosnia's collective presidency comprising
Moslems, Serbs and Croats - the main national groups - yesterday arrived in
Bosanski Brod, northern Bosnia, in an attempt to secure a ceasefire.
The fresh fighting could jeopardise the resumption of European
Community-brokered peace talks on Monday in Brussels, where the national
leaders will try to hammer out a plan for an independent republic divided
into three ethnic units.
Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said 14 Serbs were 'massacred' in
Sijekovac, near Bosanski Brod. The report could not be independently
confirmed. Croatian radio said an unknown number of people were killed in
artillery and mortar battles around the town of mostly Croats and Serbs. A
spokesman for the emergency council of Bosanski Brod, which is made up of
Croats and Moslems, said three Croats died in the fighting.
The council said the attacks were being launched by Serb irregulars backed
by the Serb-controlled Yugoslav army, which has ignored the Bosnian
presidency's order to withdraw from the town.
General Milutin Kukanjac, commander of the second federal army district
based in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, in a televised interview accused
Croat paramilitary units of massing in the northern Bosnian town. His
statement follows claims by Bosnia's Serb leaders that Croats are occupying
the town, which is reminiscent of Serb accusations before the war in
Croatia.
The situation in Bosnia has sharply deteriorated since March 1, when Moslems
backed by Croats voted for an independent Bosnia. Serb leaders, who say
Bosnia's Serbs want to stay with Serbia in a Yugoslav federation, yesterday
promulgated a constitution for the 'Serb republic of Bosnia'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND'S central bank should declare a floor rate for its ailing franc
in relation to the Deutschmark, a leading Swiss economic research institute,
Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF), has suggested.
The controversial proposal brings into focus a wider debate raging in
Switzerland over whether the country can or should still conduct an
independent monetary policy, given the trend towards stabilising currency
exchange rates in Europe. By implication, the debate is also over whether
the franc can be maintained as a stable haven currency.
If the Swiss National Bank (SNB) set a target exchange rate, as KOF
suggested, the franc would in effect be pegged to the D-Mark, thereby making
it no more or less stable than the German currency. Swiss interest rates
would then rise to German levels.
The KOF proposal comes at a time when the franc is weak in foreign currency
markets in spite of intervention by the SNB. Yesterday, it traded at
SFr0.9115 to the D-Mark, compared with SFr0.89 at the beginning of the year.
KOF suggested the central bank should set a target exchange rate of SFr0.91
or SFr0.92 to the D-Mark.
In its spring forecast published yesterday, KOF said the bank was in a
difficult position because of uncertainty over Swiss participation in
European institutions and the weakness of its economy. KOF is forecasting
GDP growth of only 0.9 per cent this year, after a decline of 0.6 per cent
last year.
KOF shares the SNB's concern about imported inflation, claiming that 'a
strong devaluation of the Swiss franc would pose a very difficult problem'.
It says that in 'this special situation', the SNB 'would be well advised to
aim at stabilising exchange rate expectations'.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Budget rejected in battle over Russian reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian parliament, raising the stakes in its battle against the
government's harsh market reforms, yesterday rejected a draft budget for the
second quarter and beyond.
It ordered first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar, who is trying to
restore the country to financial health by balancing the budget, to come
back with a new plan on April 20.
But the choice of that distant date suggests the standing parliament hopes
Mr Gaidar's government will either be thrown out of power or forced into
less austere financial policies by the Congress of People's Deputies, which
opens on April 6.
Reiterating claims that Mr Gaidar's policies were leading to ruin, Mr
Alexander Pochinok, chairman of parliament's budgetary committee, accused
him of misleading parliament with over-optimistic estimates of future tax
revenues and capital investment by the state.
The government's latest budget proposal - the parliament is refusing to
adopt a budget for the whole of the year in one go - provided for a deficit
of Rbs108.31bn in the second quarter, and of Rbs245.34bn for the whole year.
Expenditure is projected at Rbs555.6bn for the second quarter, and at
Rbs2,103bn for the whole year.
Mr Gaidar told parliament that the first two months of the year had shown a
budget surplus of Rbs12.2bn, suggesting that subsequent concessions on
social spending, among other items, had been responsible for a first quarter
deficit of about Rbs80bn.
Mr Gaidar said the government could afford to loosen budgetary policy for
the second quarter of this year because unpopular price liberalisation
measures had eliminated the monetary overhang - or surplus of roubles in
circulation - which has consistently undermined the rouble.
Although apparently conceding that a totally deficit-free budget was no
longer on the agenda for this year, he said budgetary policy would again
have to be tightened in the third quarter.
President Boris Yeltsin is understood to have ditched the official draft
Russian constitution following attempts by parliament's constitutional
committee to reduce his emergency powers, Leyla Boulton reports.
Although a new constitution has been one of Mr Yeltsin's chief political
goals, he has effectively killed the prospect of endowing Russia with a new
one to replace that inherited from the old communist empire at a sitting of
the Russian parliament on April 6.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PERSONAL income rose 1.1 per cent in February, the largest monthly gain
for three years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The surge in
incomes, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations, helped explain the
surprisingly robust recovery in US retail spending since Christmas. The
higher spending has sparked speculation that the long-awaited recovery from
recession is under way.
In real, inflation-adjusted terms, yesterday's figures showed a 0.6 per cent
rise in personal consumption spending last month. Revised January figures
showed a gain of 0.9 per cent.
Many economists expect higher consumption spending to underpin a modest
growth of gross domestic product in the first quarter. Revised figures
published on Thursday showed GDP growing at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent
in the final quarter of last year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 per
cent growth.
With personal savings rates low, the recovery of consumption spending is
likely to be sustained only if employment continues to grow.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government yesterday said it would buy a Russian experimental nuclear
reactor designed to power space travel, as part of a Dollars 14m (Pounds 8m)
Russian space technology purchase.
The White House said the Topaz reactor from Moscow's Kurchatov Institute
would give the US access to its technology, which many scientists believe is
not matched by any current US reactors, at a significantly lower cost.
However, for the past 15 months its purchase has been held up the Defence
Department.
The disagreement encapsulates a contentious debate within the US government
over what attitude to adopt towards the space, nuclear and military
industries of the former Soviet Union.
Some argue that the US should buy equipment and services from Russia, both
to obtain new technologies cheaply and to provide gainful employment for
crucial scientists and engineers who might otherwise be tempted to sell
their services elsewhere. Others argue, however, that such purchases
strengthen the Russian military complex through the injection of cash.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Rio's Earth Summit may have trouble getting off the ground:
Preparations for the environmental conference underline North-South tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREPARATIONS for the world's largest environmental conference in Rio de
Janeiro this summer are in danger of running into the sand. Delegates from
the 160 countries that will attend the Earth Summit are grappling with an
immense agenda and deep disagreements between rich and poor countries over
who should pay for the world's green problems.
After four weeks of its final five-week preparatory meeting at the United
Nations in New York, members have agreed little more than 10 per cent of the
agenda. Many of the discussions on the main documents have become bogged
down in detail.
Although the organisers have resorted to late-night sessions to deal with
the backlog, the meeting will start its final week on Monday with a mountain
of work still ahead.
'We were up till 1 am arguing over commas and brackets,' moaned a weary
delegate earlier this week.
On the face of it, the preparatory meeting has been overwhelmed by the sheer
size of the task put before it. Delegates are being asked to approve
thousands of pages of agreements and action programmes covering everything
from greenhouse gases to the role of children in protecting nature. This was
part of the democratic process whereby every member of the UN was entitled
to put its green concerns on the table.
But observers say the torrent of words conceals deeper tensions - deadlock
even - between national interests, in particular between the rich countries
of the North and the poor countries of the South.
The Third World sees the summit as an opportunity to press the
industrialised world for more aid. Thus, the summit agenda has been expanded
far beyond immediate green issues to include the eradication of poverty,
liberalisation of world trade, and large-scale transfers of technology from
North to South. The Group of 77 Third World countries with Pakistan as its
spokesman has proposed a new 'green fund' as a conduit for fresh aid.
Although the North is prepared to make some fresh funds available, it is
equally determined to resist what it considers to be unreasonable demands
for money. And that, in turn, is jeopardising proposed agreements to
safeguard the natural environment - biological diversity, forests, oceans,
the atmosphere - all of which will require large amounts of money and
technology.
Mr Maurice Strong, the summit's Canadian organiser, presented delegates at
the outset with detailed estimates of environmental clean-up costs running
to more than Dollars 100bn (Pounds 58bn) a year. But he now concedes that
the New York meeting is unlikely to agree any document with hard money
numbers in it.
'There will be agreement on the basic principle of new and additional
resources,' he says, 'and some broad agreement on the framework and
mechanism that will permit decision on final commitments - which can only be
made at Rio.'
It will certainly be an achievement if the agreement includes the words 'new
and additional resources'. These are the buzz words which would imply that
the North has accepted the need to provide new money specifically for the
environment - which is likely. But the North will avoid committing itself to
actual sums, whether in dollars or as a percentage of GNP.
Mr Curtis Bohlen, the representative of the US, which has been taking the
toughest line at the talks, injected some excitement into the proceedings
when he used the magic words for the first time on Tuesday. But he hedged
the US commitment by stating that new money would have to come from 'public
and private sources', and would have to be efficiently used.
The fact that President George Bush has not yet even agreed to attend the
summit points to the depths of US reservations, about not just money but
economic measures to curtail harmful emissions which might also stifle the
US economy in this election year.
The expectation is that the North will end up agreeing to make an extra
Dollars 3bn-Dollars 6bn available for Third World aid specifically tied to
environmental goals. But it will insist that the money be channelled through
an existing institution, such as the World Bank's three-year-old Global
Environment Facility. This is far from the figures Mr Strong proposes. But
as a concession, the North may also agree to give the Third World a greater
say in how the GEF spends its money.
'It's not as bad as it looks,' says a delegate from an EC member country.
But this is not a view shared by the wider ranks of country representatives
and lobbyists.
Mr Gordon Shepherd, an official with the World Wide Fund for Nature, decries
'a lack of political will' by summit participants to get to grips with a
looming environmental crisis. Mr Martin Khor Kok Peng, a member of the
Commission on Developing Countries and Global Change, says: 'The South is
rather disappointed.'
It is always possible that the urgency of the final week's deadline will
hasten the pace. But it is unlikely to alter the fundamentally opposed
positions which have been exposed by the talks so far.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Heron tells banks it wants Pounds 1.3bn debt rescheduling:
US losses prompt Gerald Ronson's group to seek deal with lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON INTERNATIONAL, Mr Gerald Ronson's international property and finance
group, surprised its banks yesterday by announcing that it was seeking to
reschedule its net debt of some Pounds 1.3bn.
In a meeting earlier this month with Credit Suisse, a leading Swiss bank,
Heron gave no indication of any problems. The bank said yesterday: 'We were
astonished by yesterday's announcement.'
The move comes a week after Canada's Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest
property developer and backer of the Canary Wharf development in London's
docklands, ran into financial difficulties.
Heron, Britain's second largest private company, said last night: 'This is
no last minute crisis . . . the company initiated this move, not the banks.'
The company has also suspended the trading of its bonds on the Swiss,
Frankfurt and Luxembourg exchanges until after a meeting next Friday, at
which it will ask its bankers to extend the maturity dates on some of its
debt and bonds.
The announcement was made three days before the end of Heron's financial
year, in which, for the first time in its 26-year history, it is likely to
show a loss.
Heron said last night that 'one of the main elements' of the decision was
losses from its US financial services and property businesses, an ill-fated
expansion of the mid 1980s, which has cost it about Pounds 200m over the
past four years.
At the same time it is fighting recession in its key markets of property,
housebuilding, and luxury car sales.
Heron has no publicly-traded shares but has financed itself by debt and
bonds, denominated mainly in Swiss francs.
Its last accounts at March 1991 showed net debt of Pounds 1.3bn, including
Pounds 447.8m in bonds. The company said yesterday that its present debt was
'roughly in line' with that figure.
The rescheduling plan will propose that the principal and interest on
Heron's loans will be paid in full 'over some period'.
However, Heron is expected to ask banks to defer interest payments. The
company will not seek more loans, and will start selling investment
properties.
The Bank of England has been kept informed about the restructuring but has
so far been little involved. One banker said last night that he hoped the
rescheduling would prove to be 'more straightforward' than other recent debt
reconstructions.
The bank lenders to Heron are being led by Barclays, the UK's biggest bank,
which has been kept informed of the property group's plans. Barclays'
exposure is understood to be less than Pounds 150m, but it saw its shares
slip from 335p to 322p yesterday on worries about the loans' safety.
When Mr Ronson was tried and convicted in August 1990 for his role in the
Guinness affair, Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, gave him a glowing
testimonial, saying that Mr Ronson 'had the reputation of being perhaps the
most successful businessman of his generation', and that his
creditworthiness was 'as high as it had ever been'.
Bank of America and National Westminster are next in order of exposure.
Credit Suisse is both a lender to Heron and lead manager of some Swiss franc
bonds. It said yesterday: 'We met Heron's executives earlier this month and
they said nothing about this.'
The company's 11 bond issues - six in Swiss francs, two in Ecus, one in
D-Marks, one in French francs and one in US dollars - will remain suspended
until April 6.
Recent concerns about Heron's indebtedness, combined with the property
slump, have been reflected in the bonds' price.
At their suspension prices yesterday the Swiss bonds were at between 30 per
cent and 43 per cent of their face value, a 'junk' rating, and offering
buyers yields of between 31 per cent and 47 per cent if the bonds were held
to maturity.
None of bonds mature until next year. Heron said yesterday that an interest
payment on the SFr105m bond dated 1989-98, which is due on Monday, would
still be made.
Heron said that it had detected the need for rescheduling in February and
had called in Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, which had previously
had no links with the company, to do a 'full independent review'.
Heron said yesterday it had 'positive net worth, substantial liquidity (cash
and liquid investments) of over Pounds 100m and no cash flow problem'.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Discontent surfaces in Tory election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, GARETH SMYTH and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE strategists were once again under pressure last night to revamp
the party's election campaign as City jitters pushed share prices down
sharply and discontent surfaced among party activists.
As Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, returned to the offensive with a
claim that the government's National Health Service reforms would create a
'patchwork quilt of profit centres', Tory campaigners were also faced with
new poll data suggesting for the first time that Labour might be in sight of
outright victory.
With less than a fortnight before polling day, a Harris poll conducted for
London Weekend Television put Labour on 42 per cent in London, the
Conservatives on 40 and the Liberal Democrats on 17 - an 8.5 point swing to
Labour against the 1987 election result in the capital.
Its broad findings were confirmed by a BBC poll of polls showing London
swinging by 8 points to Labour.
An accurate measure of the national outlook, taking in the impact of this
week's fiercely fought battle over the NHS, will not be available until
tomorrow, however, when up to seven polls are expected to be published.
Reports are growing of disquiet among Tory activists at the lack of impetus
in the campaign. Among them, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime
minister, and Mr Brendan Bruce, the party's former communications director,
hint that the party should project its message with more 'clarity and
conviction'.
Evidence of new thinking in the Tory camp came at yesterday's morning press
briefing when a fresh attack on Labour's tax plans was replaced by a more
'positive' presentation of Mr John Major's personal political philosophy.
The party's plan now seems to be to play up the starkness of the choice
before voters in areas such as taxation, defence and role under a Tory
government in shaping a wider Europe of nation states, he said: 'I do not
believe any other party could build it. This golden chance might slip away
unless we can raise people's imagination.'
He also underlined the Conservatives' determination not to give up
campaigning on the health service, calling on Tories to emphasise the vast
numbers of cases dealt with satisfactorily.
'I would like to hear a bit of that on the radio, I would like to see a bit
of that on television,' he said.
Party strategists said last night that they will now hammer the positive
message, that only the Conservatives can deliver a sound economic recovery.
On the negative side, Mr Michael Heseltine stepped up the assault on Mr
Kinnock, calling him the 'artful dodger' with a proven record of misjudgment
on important issues. He claimed that Labour's campaign was being
stage-managed to keep the Labour leader under wraps, well away from probing
journalists, thus enabling him to dodge questions about his past.
Speaking in south London, Mr Heseltine said Mr Kinnock's 'only consistent
policy is advocating causes today that he betrayed yesterday'.
Mr Kinnock, meanwhile, attempted to steer Labour's campaign away from the
two-day row over its party broadcast.
In a presentation, backed by a group of doctors, he stressed Labour's
opposition to the 'Americanisation' of the NHS.
Though the parties are still at loggerheads about the leaking of details of
the case used in Labour's broadcast, the issue has slipped down the
political agenda partly under the weight of its own complexity.

SIX-YEAR talks aimed at liberalising world trade may 'collapse', says
President George Bush. He called for 'a political push from whatever
source'.
The extraordinary comments, expressing more pessimism than the White House
has previously shown over a long-standing stalemate in the Uruguay Round of
talks on world trade reform, were delivered yesterday by Mr Marlin
Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman.
'We are very concerned about the (Uruguay) round, concerned about its
possible collapse,' Mr Fitzwater said.
'We want a successful round. We think the world needs that kind of trading
arrangement, and so we will encourage a political push from whatever
source.'
The comments followed secret talks in Washington between Mr Arthur Dunkel,
director-general of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), and Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative.
Mr Dunkel also met Mr Clayton Yeutter, a former US trade representative who
is now an adviser to the president.
Mr Dunkel tried to break the deadlock in December last year by publishing a
draft Uruguay Round agreement. This was rejected by the European Community
in January, largely over its proposals on the reform of the EC's fiercely
protectionist Common Agricultural Policy.
The US and the EC remain at loggerheads over farm trade reform, and it has
become clear that without compromise on farm trade, no agreement will be
possible.
Mr Dunkel is understood to have talked of deepening frustration and
disillusion among negotiators in Geneva.
There are fears that immense potential gains for the world trading system
are being put in jeopardy.
Meanwhile, Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said yesterday: 'Failure
has a high cost. The more people think about this, the more they should be
motivated to reach an agreement.'
He nevertheless echoed the sense of 'impuissance' widespread in Geneva when
he said that differences could no longer be resolved by the negotiators in
Geneva. 'It has to be solved in the capitals,' Mr Yerxa said.
Mr Dunkel also met in Washington the MTN Coalition, a private sector group
formed to support the Uruguay Round. Mr Harry Freeman, the group's executive
director, interpreted the White House statement as a message to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany.
A meeting between Mr Kohl and President Bush at Camp David two weeks ago
raised hopes of a breakthrough on the Round. However, the meeting between
the two leaders failed to make any significant progress on the issue.
Mr Kohl is known to want to resolve the deadlock on trade talks before a
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations which he is hosting
in Munich in July.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Leading US investor worriedby Lonrho's deal with Libya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S second-biggest shareholder, US-based Fidelity Management and
Research, yesterday voiced concern that it might be forced to disinvest from
the international trading group if the United Nations imposes economic
sanctions against Libya.
FMR's worries follow Lonrho's announcement on Thursday that it had sold a
one-third stake in its Metropole Hotels chain for Pounds 177m to the
state-run Libyan Arab Investment Company.
The warning came as a UK-based institutional shareholder, which asked not to
be identified, said it was reviewing its holding of about 2 per cent
following news of the Libyan deal.
Libya faces the growing possibility of economic sanctions and asset seizures
over its alleged role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie.
FMR has recently increased its holding in Lonrho to 65m shares, almost 10
per cent. Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, is the biggest
investor, holding 92.1m shares or 14.6 per cent.
Along with Fidelity International, its UK operation, FMR bought 4 per cent
in Lonrho last month after the shares plummeted from more than 170p to just
over 100p. The shares yesterday fell 8p to close at 87p.
The UK institution which is reviewing its investment in Lonrho said it
feared the deal was part of a 'poison pill' to make it less attractive to
potential predators since no other company would wish or be able to deal
with the Libyans.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said institutional investors had
expressed support for the deal at a lunch hosted by the group after its
annual general meeting on Thursday.
In light of the warnings from Lonrho's chairman, Mr Rene Leclezio, that 'the
current half year will be a further disappointment', analysts yesterday
again downgraded their forecasts of pre-tax profits for the year.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, one of Lonrho's own brokers, cut its forecast for the
second time in a month, this time by Pounds 25m to Pounds 125m. It also
forecast a 20 per cent cut in the dividend to 8p.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Placing the guilt on the victims: The courts are becoming
too lenient in cases of murder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HAS been a most unusual election campaign: at no point have the
Conservatives mentioned the lady dubbed 'Laura Norder' by the author and
barrister John Mortimer. Laura Norder used to accompany Margaret Thatcher on
all her election campaigns, but Mr Major seems less keen on bringing her
virtues to the attention of the public. This may just be, of course, because
crime, both petty and serious, has shown no sign of abating under the
Conservatives' long period of rule - very much the reverse, in fact.
I was not surprised therefore when last week a leading policeman decided
that if the Conservatives could not bring themselves to mention Laura, he
would. Lyn Williams, the deputy general secretary of the Police Federation
said politicians of all parties are putting the interests of criminals
before those of victims. He blamed courts for 'travesties of justice', for
'not punishing violent crime' which 'disgusted both victims and police
officers.' He said: 'homicide is treated in our courts today as a rather
serious form of bodily harm.'
I think that Williams understates the case. Last week June Scotland who beat
her husband to death with a rolling pin - having first failed in her attempt
to poison him - and then buried the body in the garden, was freed, cleared
of murder. Thomas Scotland was slain in 1987 but the slaughter remained
undetected for four years because his widow - the term seems bizarre in the
circumstances - and his daughter, Caroline, managed to convince neighbours
that he was alive and well and working in Saudia Arabia. The truth emerged
only last Easter Sunday when a neighbour putting up a fence discovered Mr
Scotland's remains. The daughter had assisted Mrs Scotland in burying the
body at midnight the day after the killing.
Mr Justice Garland told Luton Crown Court that no good would come of jailing
Mrs Scotland. I am prepared to believe that no custodial sentence ever did
any criminal any good. But the point of prison is not to benefit the
criminal. It is to punish the criminal, and to satisfy society. It is also,
as Williams implied, to remedy the insult to the victim. But if the insult
is terminal, is there no need of such a remedy? Does a dead man have no
rights? I cannot imagine that if Mr Scotland, rather than being killed, was
left by his wife's beating a gibbering, brain-damaged incontinent wreck that
a court would not have wished to pass a custodial sentence. Or perhaps the
court would have been told that the assailant had shown rare mercy in
halting the beating before its effects became fatal.
What is still worse for the victim is that the judge, seeking to justify a
non custodial sentence - in this case two years probation - told the court
what a terrible man was the deceased. So the Luton court was told that the
late Mr Scotland 'was a severe disciplinarian with his children, once
throwing his daughter's toys on a fire after she wrote on a wall. He would
hit his children across the back of the head if they were not doing their
homework properly.' It was also alleged that Mr Scotland abused his
daughter; the evidence consisted of the statements of mother and daughter.
But who would speak for Mr Scotland? Was he really as bad as painted? He
could not be in court to defence himself against these charges. He had no
defence lawyer.
This is only the most recent of a spate of such cases. Last month a former
nun, Elizabeth Line was cleared of the murder of her 'drunkard' husband.
Again, her husband was not in court to answer the charges against him,
identified by the judge as 'violence and sexual abuse of the worst kind.'
At the end of January a businessman who strangled a 'nagging' wife in front
of their three children was freed at the end of a trial at the Old Bailey.
Judge Neil Denison told Rajinder Bisla: 'you have suffered through no fault
of your own a terrible existence for a very long time. You bore it better
probably than most people would have done, until finally your self control
snapped.' The court was told that the late Mrs Bisla was 'a very domineering
lady who wanted to rule the roost over the family, hurling insults in
Punjabi and English.'
Who will speak for the dead. For Mr Scotland, Mr Lines and Mrs Bisla, all
killed with the sympathy and understanding of the courts? Where is Laura
Norder, when we need her? Perhaps she has been secretly buried at dead of
night, killed - quite understandably of course - by a spouse driven mad by
her nagging.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: With the ladies at Annabel's - Playboy Taki
Theodoracopulos romps with the rich and famous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TAKI THEODORACOPULOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF CIVILISED society is measured by the quality of its parties, restaurants
and nightclubs, we can all rest easy in our beds. London is still the most
fun capital in Europe, the separation of Fergie and her prince
notwithstanding. Even the prospect of Neil Kinnock becoming Prime Minister
has not quite overwhelmed the high life. This past week Annabel's was
conducting business as usual, as were Tramp, Christopher's, Le Caprice,
Harry's Bar and so on . . .
After 29 years Mark Birley's creation is still the numero uno nightclub not
only of London, but of Europe. (American nightclubs are considered theme
parks.) Whether one is a gourmet, a gambler, or simply a drinker, and I'm
all three, the evening is not complete without a visit at 44 Berkley Square.
Upon arrival one is greeted by the smiling countenance of that walking death
machine, Nando now nearing 50 but still a very good man to have on one's
side during a brawl. After being admitted by Ted, the greatest Pole since
General Sikorski, one is immediately taken care of either by John, premier
barman and maker of drinks extraordinaire, or shown to a table by Louis, the
greatest Italian since . . . Mussolini.
Oh yes, I almost forgot. If one is a lady, one is taken care of by Mabel,
the grande dame of Annabel's, who even takes precedence over a duchess. (If
you see a man or two in the ladies, don't be alarmed. It is either an
Irishman by the name of Galagher, or your's truly. I believe we are the last
two men left who are members of the ladies, a club created by Mabel on a
whim which allows gents to enter the ladies.)
The membership of Annabel's is a mixed affair. I don't know many nobs who
don't belong, nor any Greek shipowners who Louis doesn't address by name.
There are also some of our rich Arab brethren, but - amazingly - they do try
and stay away during week nights, and only attend on weekends, when the rest
of us are away. I have never understood if this is part of the deal struck
between them and management when the camel drivers join, and whenever I have
attempted to find out I have been told in no uncertain terms to drop it.
One thing is for sure. Of all the great nights I have had in London these
past 25 years, most of them have finished up in Annabel's, standing in the
hallway next to the bar, hearing Harry Worcester ululating, and watching
John trying to control the more amorous members of the British upper crust
who want to make fools of themselves.
And speaking of amorous souls, if one likes girls - or pre-women, as the
politically correct Americans refer to them nowadays - Tramp is the place
for you. The owner and prime mover behind Tramp is, as every model, rock
star and groupie knows, Johny Gold, the hardest working owner, certainly the
friendliest, of any club in the capital. Johny knows everyone who has ever
been in the newspapers or on the telly, and going to Tramp is like a bit
like watching a Nigel Dempster column on video. Tramp attracts the most
beautiful girls in London, and even its competitors admit the fact that
Tramp has an exclusive on the fairer sex.
Now this is how one finishes the evening. Before going to Annabel's or
Tramp, one needs to eat. The hottest restaurant of London this year has been
Christopher's - of which I'm part owner - although I have as much to do with
the running of it as Gerald Kaufman has with the election campaign.
Christopher's caught on immediately because of timely publicity, and because
it does serve great food at very reasonable prices.
Both the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret attend regularly, as do most wet
Tory politicians. Christopher Gilmore, son of retiring Sir Ian is the Fuhrer
of the place. Needless to say, Tory MPs flock to the place, as do
journalists, mainly of the conservative complexion. I have managed to spot a
couple of Labour politicos, both of whom happened to be moving their lips
while reading the menu. There are also many artists coming in from across
the street, where the Royal Opera House is (on Wellington Street).
One of the funniest remarks I have heard in a long time came from a Japanese
gentleman last week in Christopher's. Looking at Amanda, the lovely girl who
seats people, he remarked in all seriousness that 'Ah, vely, vely difficult
eat salad with election . . .' I happened to agree.
By now of course, however backwards, one also needs to eat lunch. Until
Christopher's opened, Harry's Bar, was THE place to lunch. It probably still
is.
One day I spotted the ex-king of Greece and the present king of Spain
lunching, and behind them, hidden away by the posts, the diminutive king of
Jordan. Oh yes, and on the other side of the room, sitting tall above the
risotto, the Princess of Wales. Nobody except for a few Americans seemed to
be aware of their presence.
After a two-year pursuit of Kate Reardon, the prettiest girl of London, I
chose Harry's Bar as the venue of our first lunch. The trouble was I ran
into Nigel Dempster - which scared Kate - and my old friend Charles Benson,
England's greatest gambler, who scared me for a loan. In spite of these twin
catastrophes, I still love the place.
And do not ask me about breakfast. That's to be taken in bed, served more
often than not by lovelies.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London (Private View): A life on Thames' cleansing
tides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RON BARNES, freeman of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen of the River
Thames, is a refuse collector. Five times a fortnight he comes upriver from
Erith on the tide to collect the City's rubbish - shredded memos, sandwich
wrappers, champagne bottles, old copies of the FT - from a dock beside
Southwark Bridge.
He is a river dustman who goes to work in a white shirt and tie and polished
black shoes. He feels undressed without them, he said - and I detected the
signs of a strict upbringing.
Crows were scavenging from the decks of the empty barges, Marie, Ursula and
Muriel, that we picked up from the Rainham Marshes dumping depot. There was
a pleasant whiff of decay in the breeze.
This is one of London's cleanest jobs. The tug we were aboard today, the Jim
Higgs, was immaculate. A plastic owl was perched above the wheelhouse to
stop the seagulls messing on the deck. Inside, the brasswork glistened and
there was pile carpet on the floor.
The engineer, a shy young man with a pale face and long blond hair, went
below to start the engine, a six-cylinder, 1,000 hp affair capable of
handling twice the permitted limit of six laden barges of some 350 tonnes
each.
Ron Barnes is first mate. He has worked on the river since the age of 15 and
has seen the number of Thames lightermen (meaning 'unloaders') dwindle from
4,500 to around 200. 'Where I grew up, in Greenwich, everybody derived their
living from the river. But the river is dead compared with when I came on
the water.'
He is looking forward to the freedom of retirement so he can spend more time
on his vegetables, flowers and bees.
'Actually, I should have been a farmer,' he said with a laugh. 'I'm free
enough here. But getting off the boat to go ashore is a pleasure, an immense
pleasure. In fact, in the mornings I have been known to come down that
causeway backwards] No, really it's not that bad.'
I said many office workers would envy his job of driving a boat up and down
the Thames.
'Yeah, but you've come today.' Ron pointed to the patchy blue sky and the
river as flat as glass. 'How would you feel walking down that causeway at
quarter to six in the morning and there's an easterly wind blowing? I don't
want you to burst into tears but it isn't always as pleasant as today.
'Having said that it's better now than it was. I mean, when I was
journey-lightering there were times I'd leave home at 5.20 in the morning
and get home at eight, nine at night, soaking wet. Now we've got radio
telephone, flush toilets. Oh yeah, this is Utopia what we're doing now.'
Our convoy had passed through the Thames Barrier and was reaching the
fringes of the metropolis. The river was deserted but for the occasional
police launch, an orange tender which pulled alongside to pay a social call
and, incongruously, a trawler from Lowestoft netting fish for a survey.
'Eels, flounder and two soles,' the trawler skipper reported over the radio.
It was early afternoon now and I scanned the mish-mash of buildings on
either bank in vain for signs of life. A banner on a warehouse at Wapping
advertised space at Pounds 2.50 a square foot - 'Beat that for value]' it
said. The radio reported a man in the water off Greenwich pier; but it
turned out to be a false alarm.
A few Lowry-like figures appeared far above us as we shot Tower Bridge.
Above Southwark bridge the Jim Higgs turned into the current, his three
maids-of-honour swinging dutifully behind, and moored beside a driftwood
barge containing beer kegs, a black sofa, a mangled domestic freezer and
some dead Christmas trees.
While we waited for high tide, I asked Ron about river families.
'The river may seem vast to you but it's a small area to work. Everybody
knows everybody else. I've been here 43 years and there's nowhere from
Teddington round to the Medway that I haven't been. Even for National
Service you all went in as a group.'
Do you meet socially?
'Lots of 'em do. I don't. If work is your whole life you might want to
socialise with people at work. You won't believe it, but we've got people
here go for their holidays on a narrow boat. Depends what turns you on, I
suppose.'
Ron sets high standards for himself and others. Though scarcely a fervent
trade unionist, he will have no truck with those he regards as blacklegs and
he regrets the loss of solidarity among the watermen.
He cheerfully admitted to 'Victorian standards', inherited from a strict
father, a maker of surgical boots who turned docker. 'Maybe you think I'm
cranky, just old fashioned. But I think I've had a happy life despite my
high standards.'
He makes no secret about how much he depends on his wife, Rita, whom he met
when they were at infant school. He likes her to stay at home, and they do
everything together.
'I don't care how long my life is so long as I go before my wife.'
What does she say to that?
'She says I'm selfish', he laughed.
Their son Mark went to Southampton University (Ron was not sure about
Oxford) and is a research chemist in Vancouver. Debra, their daughter, is an
assistant manager for the National Westminster Bank.
I asked about the hazards of his job.
'I'm not being blase, but I personally don't feel there's any dangerous part
to the job provided you know what you're doing and provided you're
observant.
'There are Do's and Don'ts. All the ropes are made fast the same way so you
can untie in the dark, you can undo them quickly if need be.'
What about falling in?
'We had a chap three weeks ago fell in; it was dark and raining but he had a
lifejacket on. It was a bit of a trauma, but other than that . . .'
If you fall in without a jacket?
'The tide goes at fair lick, so within minutes you're yards away. You can
get trapped under the barges.'
His worst experience was falling into a dock at Tilbury while loading tea.
It was January, between shifts, nobody was about and he had no lifejacket
on.
'The sheet snagged on a tea chest and I went into the water. As I came up I
just missed the barge to grab hold of it, and there I was floundering
around. I was in the water for half an hour. I was very, very lucky to get
out. In fact I didn't think I was going to get out. But it's surprising
where you get the energy from when you have to.'
The tide was nearly full now, the office workers were starting to go home,
and the Jim Higgs moved across the river to the rubbish dock. Her crew
jumped aboard the barges to begin the complicated series of ropetricks
needed to shuffle these 85ft-long monsters, one by one, into a narrow
opening at right-angles to their path. It was like herding stubborn cows on
slippery feet into a milking shed, only more difficult.
We picked up three new barges, Jayne, Susan Anne and Lynda, heavy with
rubbish under their modest deck-covers. Dusk settled, the lights came on and
the river turned a dark Mediterranean blue. A group of bond dealers stared
from The Banker wine bar under Southwark bridge and, on the other shore,
shadows moved behind the tinted windows of the Financial Times head office.
The river dustmen were sailing home in a night painting by Whistler. I found
the skipper, Bill Smith, humming at the wheel; we stared at the office
lights and the distant beacon of Canary Wharf, its ugliness made invisible.
'The river can be quite enchanting at times,' he said.
As we passed under Tower Bridge again, the radio re-opened. Someone had
jumped from London Bridge, it said, and there were two witnesses. It seemed
pointless to look for a body in that black water. 'Jumpers', as the police
call these suicides, occur all year round but are more common at Christmas.
Bill said a body had been found the day before, strangled but not dead.
Jumpers like Westminster Bridge best, apparently, because it is the lowest.
Starving by now, I went below. Ron cooked up a high tea of crumpets,
mushroom soup and Spam sandwiches. The crew explained how, after 450 years,
the Company of Watermen and Lightermen, unusually among the London guilds,
still organised apprenticeships and issued licences.
Many watermen are still involved in rowing, as fundraisers for charity,
organisers of the annual wooden boats regatta, or as coaches for sculls and
racing eights.
We had been afloat for more than seven hours when the depot at Rainham
Marshes loomed. Ron had taken the wheel. He swung the barges round to face
the tide, running fast down to the sea, spurred the Jim Higgs into the gap
between the jetty and the shore and, at a crucial moment, ordered the three
barges to be let go.
Jayne, Susan Anne and Lynda seemed to shoot ahead but then suddenly lost
momentum and glided noiselessly to a halt as if they had nosed out their own
berths. The tug slid backwards, gave Lynda a final shove to straighten her
up, and made off for the south shore. The crew parted with a few words and
hurried away into the night.

I DO NOT want to blind you with science, to befuddle you with arch
demographics or slick computer print-outs. But I have to tell you this: in
the view of Britain's political leaders, the UK election on April 9 is
likely to prove so close that the outcome will be determined by four
floating voters living in Westminster North. And one of them is me.
I live in St Stephen's Gardens, on the Notting Hill-Paddington border. This
is not as smart as it sounds, though my next-door neighbour is frock queen
Zandra Rhodes. (So encoiled is Zandra in the linaments of her own genius
that it never occurs to her that I am more famous than she is, but do I fret
and fuss?).
St Stephen's Gardens is in the Westminster North constituency, where the
Conservative MP finds himself waging a frontline battle against those who
would dethrone him. For reasons too complex to explain, the latest equations
being used by the party strategists tell them that the April 9 election now
hinges on the say-so of . . . four particular floaters living in four
adjacent streets in this particular constituency . . . me and three others.
This has shocked our political leaders. All these press conferences] All
this advertising] The blarney and ballyhoo] When all they needed to do was
concentrate their firepower, their flattery and promises, on four floating
voters in Westminster North.
On Wednesday, Wing Commander Paddy Ashdown phoned me from the Liberal
Democrat helicopter. He was somewhere over Birmingham, or somewhere equally
ghastly. Swiftly he came to the point. Dispensed with foreplay entirely. Was
there anything special I wanted in return for my vote on April 9?
'More traffic humps', I said promptly. 'A complete overhaul of London's
transport. The immediate scrapping of our nuclear weapons. Better weather.
Less money for the Royal Opera House and the silencing of its uppity
director, moaning Jeremy Isaacs. Then there's Margaret Beckett. Cheaper
books. Better food. More trees and window-boxes. Proportional
representation. A new mega-tax on the wretchedness that is ITV, and hands
off the BBC. An end to fox hunting and National Hunt racing. A tax on music
critics and other artsie-barksies. A state pension for poor Fergie. The
gagging of Margaret Thatcher. Rupert Murdoch outlawed. Harlequinades and
circuses. John Major fired from a cannon.'
'All those shall be granted you', said Wing Commander Ashdown.
On Thursday, Neil Kinnock rang, as jovial as an undertaker during a time of
cholera. Actually called me boyo. Not that I'm a snob. 'Is there anything
the Labour party can do for you, Michael boyo', he said, as glutinous as a
pudding, 'because we need your vote, desperately and passionately, with all
our fervour and soul, with all . . .'
'. . . Stop it, Neil', I said sharply. 'I have no time for that. I know why
you are calling. Your computers have identified me as the floater nonpareil,
the floaters' floater's floater, the key to the whole election. Here is a
list of the things I want.'
I will not bother you with it. It was a far longer list than the one I had
improvised for Wing Commander Ashdown, but Neil accepted it instantly, every
tittle and jot.
Later, shame engulfed me - shame that I was abusing my fulcrumatic role in
the election by concocting lists of petty favours, trinkets, pay-offs. I
knew I must sharpen my act, so when John Major rang last night I told him
there was nothing that I wanted, just four simple answers to four easy
questions:
'One: why, each month, is part of my salary confiscated to help pay for
nuclear submarines?
'Two: why does the state subsidise my ownership of an expensive London flat
when so many other people are living in poverty? When, in short, will you
acknowledge that the allocation of resources between prosperous and poor has
grown seriously askew?
'Three: is Margaret Thatcher a disgraced ex-leader of the Conservative party
or not? If not, why was she evicted from office? If she is, why won't you
apologise for the mistakes that prompted her downfall?
'Four: which dozen ministers do you plan to sack on April 10 if you win the
election?'
As usual, John Major was dignified and courteous. He promised to get back to
me. I do not believe that he will.

EDGAR A. POE: MOURNFUL AND NEVER-ENDING REMEMBRANCE by Kenneth Silverman
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 25, 564 pages
'EA POE - Ho] Ho] Ho] . .' chanted Noel Coward to roars of laughter from his
Las Vegas audience. Poe was teased about his name in his lifetime too. This
is one of the few glimmerings of humour in Kenneth Silverman's new
biography. It clears up many misconceptions about, and is the fruit of years
of research into, Poe's sad strange life. Name apart, there can never have
been less cause for mirth in the life of a writer.
Tragedy struck in Poe's infancy and rarely let him be till he died at the
age of 40 in 1849. His mother Eliza Poe was a leading lady in a provincial
touring company. She had great success playing Shakespearean heroines in
places as far apart as Boston, Mass. and Richmond, Virginia. Poe was her
darling. His father, David Poe, as poor an actor as his wife was starry,
absconded one day never to be heard of again. In 1811 Eliza contracted a
fever and by the end of the year she was dead. Poe was only three.
John Allan was a dour Scottish immigrant to America, a partner in a then
flourishing tobacco-exporting business. He and his wife were keen
theatre-goers. They had admired Mrs Poe and they took responsibility for her
boy - hence his middle name - without formally adopting him. Like that other
successful story-teller, Somerset Maugham, the young Poe was an orphan
transplanted to an environment from which he soon felt alienated and which
he was determined on becoming adult to put permanently behind him.
Precociously clever and brilliantly imaginative, he began at an early age to
compensate by concocting poetic fantasies. By the age of 20 he had published
a slim volume of dreamy romantic poetry; like his later, more celebrated,
verse this early stuff contains an intense longing for an earthly paradise,
a preoccupation with death and the return to life of the dead.
Poe's turbulent youth, and ever-worsening relations with Allan, particularly
when trying to sponge off him, are well described by Silverman. They follow
a pattern of Poe's failure to sustain any form of work or training outside
his writing. His career at the University of Virginia came to an abrupt end
in a pile of unpaid gambling debts. Concerned to prove his manliness, Poe
gained one of the coveted cadetships to West Point, only to chuck it
half-way through. Here the analogy with Maugham - whose West Point was St
Thomas's Hospital - ends. Maugham accepted the world on its own terms;
something, as this book makes painfully clear, Poe could never bring himself
to do.
Poe married his cousin Virginia Clemm when she was 14. To this often sick,
ethereally lovely girl, Poe seems to have been more of an admired big
brother than a husband. He called her Sissy and her mother, Marie, who
always lived with them, was Mabby. Ten years later Virginia was dead. By one
of those numerical ironies with which the work and life of Poe is riddled,
24 was the age at which his own mother had died. He made one or two
determined attempts to re-marry among female poets and bluestockings but,
still a widower, he was dead himself a few years later - a classic example
of a literary genius ending his life as a burnt-out case.
Until the end his output was prodigious. Poems, stories, essays, a novel -
The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym - together with endless streams of
ephemeral journalistic items, poured out of him and into the various
magazines for which he wrote. The only interruptions to his flow of work
were those extended periods when he took to drink. They became quite
frequent in his latter years.
In spite of his immense industry, his many successes and his eventual
world-wide fame, there was no breakthrough into affluence. Poe was often his
own worst enemy; even so one cannot but feel he was cruelly done by. He
reaped little benefit from having pioneered many of those genres of
literature that have flourished commercially as popular entertainment since
his death. Historians of the detective story like Julian Symons agree that
Poe first gave it a definitive form in tales such as The Murders in the Rue
Morgue, The Mystery of Marie Roget, The Purloined Letter. His investigator
C. Auguste Dupin anticipated the methods of Sherlock Holmes. In another
famous tale, The Gold-Bug, with a detective element and concerning buried
treasure, he gave a lead to RL Stevenson. But the bulk of Poe's tales were
gothic horrors or spine-chillers. As a master of the macabre Poe is without
a peer.
Less well-known to the general public is his work as a literary theorist.
His essays on poetic composition were influential, particularly in France
where Baudelaire became a disciple. Poe was an early and vicious exponent of
the hatchet-job in criticism and reviewing. He laid into Longfellow and the
other New England writers whose hegemony he resented with savage ferocity.
The 'Frogpondium' was his contemptuous collective name for them.
Had he lived 50 or so years later when the laws of copyright became subject
to international agreement and authors began to receive royalty payments
instead of surrendering their work for outright fees, Poe would certainly
have become a rich man. Merely the royalties from his poem 'The Raven' - its
reception 'might be compared to that of some uproariously successful
hit-song today', Silverman says - would have kept him and his wife in luxury
for years. As it was it earned him only a few dollars initially with further
paltry fees for public readings of it.
His limitation - and this ultimately debars him from being classed with the
truly great - is also his strength: his obsession with literary mechanism,
his love of the ornately calculated effect, of what he called in his 'tales
of ratiocination' (the word detective was not then in use) the operation of
acumen in solving the mystery. As Alfred Kazin has written in A Writer's
America, 'Poe is the only American classic of whom it can be said that his
landscapes issued from his mind alone . . . He never quite overcame thinking
of landscape as a problem or situation.'
Even so, Poe's influence was lasting and it remains, whether in the fiction
of novelist-cryptographers like Nabokov and Umberto Eco, or in serious
horror-film directors like Roeg and Cronenberg. Silverman has performed a
valuable task. He presents all the ascertainable facts about Poe's life and
art as a coherent narrative.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Drama in strange places - The London theatre
scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON theatre is not just the traditional West End. If you want a
comprehensive view, you will have to be prepared to move around, often to
unlikely places.
There are three broad categories and an ideal visit would take in something
from each. First, the great subsidised theatres: the Royal Shakespeare
Company at its London home in the Barbican, and the Royal National Theatre
on the South Bank. Second, the West End which still accounts for around 50
theatres; then the fringe.
Not everything at the RSC and the RNT is good. The RNT, in particular, can
go overboard in putting too many resources into unworthy material. What you
will find, however, is an impeccable standard of acting, staging and
production.
The National, which is really international, began 1992 in spectacular form.
Declan Donnellan's direction of Tony Kushner's Angels in America on the
small stage at the Cottesloe is an intense a production of a play about
homosexuality and AIDS. Subtitled A Gay Fantasia on National Themes/Part
One: Millennium Approaches, it is also political and witty. On the same
small stage is Uncle Vanya, with Sir Ian McKellen in the title role. It was
sold out before it started, but you can sometimes get tickets on the day of
the performance.
On the bigger stage of the Lyttelton is a new production of The Night of the
Iguana, Tennessee Williams's last good play and, on this evidence, one of
his best. It is worth seeing for the staging alone - sub-tropical rain
falling in the theatre - and again for the performance of Eileen Atkins as
the east coast spinster.
The RSC's new season at the Barbican is just beginning with imports from its
other home in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production to look out for is the the
two parts of Shakespeare's King Henry IV. Without seeing Part Two, you will
never appreciate why the play is called Henry IV and not Prince Hal or
Falstaff. The dying of the king, the passing of an era, is magnificently
performed by Julian Glover.
You could quite happily spend a week moving between the National Theatre and
the Barbican: only purists would do that, however. The old West End is much
maligned by some. A group of musicals like The Phantom of the Opera have
become landmarks, though in longevity none of them are likely to match
Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, now in its 40th year.
Recently there has been a trend to smaller, cheaper musicals - derivatives
rather than the real thing. Visitors from New York or Paris will scarcely
recognise the London version of Sophisticated Ladies in celebration of Duke
Ellington. The musical Moby Dick at the Piccadilly has been the talk of the
town, but was almost universally panned. Based on Herman Melville's novel
and performed by the equivalent of Ronald Searle's girls of St Trinian's, it
has been hailed as the downfall of Cameron Mackintosh, the impresario. I
recommend it as sheer fun. The music is not sensational, but the stage
effects are multi-dimensional.
The West End still has its straight plays. A new production of George
Bernard Shaw's Heartbreak House opened at the Haymarket last week with a
cast of stars including Vanessa Redgrave and Paul Scofield, directed by
Trevor Nunn. If you want the luxuriance of the old London theatre, this is
it (though you may notice that the standard of dress in the audience has
declined).
There is sterner, shorter stuff at the Duke of York's in Arnold Dorfman's
Death and the Maiden, a play about the transition from dictatorship to
democracy in Chile. That description should not deter; the underlying theme
is about nuances, compromises and adjustments in personal and professional
life.
Dorfman's play brings us towards the fringe. Death and the Maiden's first
London performance was at the tiny Theatre Upstairs at the Royal Court,
Sloane Square. It moved downstairs to the main theatre, then to the West
End. It is part of the unpredictability of the London scene that it has been
such a success. Juliet Stevenson, now of screen fame as well, is
outstanding.
The fringe has its subdivisions. The Almeida in Islington is closer in style
and spirit to to the Royal Court than to the pub theatres, where some of the
most exciting productions now take place. Recent performances at the Almeida
have been Diana Rigg as Cleopatra in Dryden's All for Love and revivals of,
and even a new play, by Harold Pinter. At its best, it is superb.
The most prominent of the pub theatres are The Gate at Notting Hill, the
King's Head, Islington and The Bush at Shepherd's Bush, the latter with an
excellent record of bringing new Irish plays to London. Others keep
springing up. I like especially the Duke's Head in Richmond, a place which
like Hampstead and Greenwich has several theatres. Pick up a copy of a
magazine like Time Out for the details.

<TEXT>
WE ARE really quite well off for sculpture on the streets of London although
too often we go past without looking. Consider Lutyens' Cenotaph in
Whitehall, discreet enough to nag away at the collective subconscious but
wonderfully elegant and dignified the moment it comes into focus; and
Landseer's Lions at the foot of Nelson's Column are still seen more as
national pets than anything. Jagger's magnificent Artillery Memorial,
marooned at Hyde Park Corner may be seen only from the bus. Best of all is
Le Sueur's small equestrian monument to Charles I that has looked down
Whitehall to the fateful Banqueting Hall ever since 1675.
With Modern Art we have done less well, though things improve when
developers commission works of art directly from the artist. 'Chalice'
(pictured above) William Pye's huge fountain sculpture for Greycoat London
Estates at 123 Buckingham Palace Road, is the spectacular fruit of just such
a collaboration.

<DATELINE>
   THE world of the London art dealer
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
more village than world - may seem to the outsider closed and private, the
preserve of the initiate, forbidden ground. Trespassers will be humiliated,
says the unwritten notice on the door. Well, only up to a point.
Art in galleries is there to be sold, and therefore there to be seen. Every
dealer in the world knows that appearances can be horribly deceptive. That
man in the shabby mac, admiring the Boucher, may well be the Duke up from
the country, a property millionaire, or a pop star, for all he knows. The
serious point is that the individual with a genuine interest in the work, of
whatever kind, is welcome. To change the image for a moment, the London art
world is a sort of club, unusual only in being one you join by joining, by
turning up, by electing yourself. Push through the door and the invitation
follows.
But back to the village. There are several wards within the parish that
overlap somewhat: St James's and Old Bond Street for the old master trade;
Cork Street and Mayfair for the established contemporary and international;
and the modern British and smaller contemporary galleries scattered at large
where space and rent allow. These are notional territories, with the Lisson
Gallery, for example, the perfect stereotype of the high-flying Mayfair
Modern, tucked away in a back street between Marylebone Station and the
Edgware Road.
Whereas plush and pile characterise the conventional old master gallery,
clear white walls and bright lights are the rule for the contemporary - and
it is a personal bone I would pick with most, that they are grossly
over-lit. Even so, they include many of the most handsome showing-spaces in
London, custom-built and perfectly adapted to the business, neither to large
nor, as is the commonplace of Rome or Paris, cramped and small. These are
public spaces and ample enough for the largest works, yet intimate enough to
preserve the personal scale.
The best of this type was the sadly-missed Rowan Gallery in Bruton Place,
but the Lisson Gallery at 67 Lisson Street NW1, the Grob Gallery, Annely
Juda and Anthony d'Offay, all cheek by jowl high above Dering Street W1, and
the several Waddington spaces in Cork Street, are all remarkable.
But even better are the galleries that positively retain their domestic
scale and feeling. They embrace the entire range of work, from the oldest to
the newest, with most of them comfortably in between. Gillian Jason, at 42
Inverness Street in Camden Town, NW1, is the perfect example, still quite
literally the private Georgian terrace house, where a knock at the front
door is still necessary to gain admission to a choice range of Modern
British and occasional contemporary shows.
In the West End, The Fine Art Society, at 148 New Bond Street (Victorian to
contemporary) and Agnew's, at 43 Old Bond Street (old masters to
contemporary) preserve something more of the preoccupied bustle of the
country-house than the quieter town. Around the corner in Clifford Street,
Jeremy Maas has the tiniest gallery stuffed full of Victorian, occasionally
contemporary, art. In Cork Street, the Mercury, Stoppenbach &amp; Delestre and
Piccadilly Galleries all cover the same ground, from early modern to
contemporary, are all domestic spaces still, despite the public front.
The same is true of JPL Fine Art, in Davies Street W1, (impressionism and
the School of Paris), of Michael Parkin (modern British), Christopher Wood
(Victorian) and Christopher Hull (contemporary) virtually side by side in
Motcomb Street SW1, and of the Fine Art Centre in Sloane Street (modern
British and St Ives), and Crane Kalman in the Brompton Road (modern British)
 -the list is endless.
In Westbourne Grove, at 255 Portobello Road W11, there is Anderson O'Day,
and Sue Williams at 320. There is Vanessa Devereux round the corner at 11
Blenheim Crescent, the Todd Gallery in Needham Road and Sue Rankin at 40
Ledbury Road (all of them contemporary British). In Lexington Street in Soho
there is Jill George, and in Windmill Street, off Charlotte Street, Rebecca
Hossack, the New Academy and the Curwen Galleries (all modern British)
and,in Charlotte Street itself, Karsten Schubert (contemporary
international). Austin/Desmond is in Pied Bull Yard off Great Russell Street
(modern British), Francis Graham-Dixon in Great Sutton Street in
Clerkenwell, Pomeroy Purdy at Jacob Studios, Mill Street SE1, Flowers East
in Richmond Road in Hackney, the Eagle gallery at 159 Farringdon Road EC1,
The Pike Gallery, St John's Hill at Clapham Junction, Cadogan Contemporary
in Draycott Avenue (all contemporary British).
This list must stop. There must be many I have forgotten, more I should
mention. The range of work is enormous, the quality inevitably variable. But
in none of these galleries would the visitor find himself unwelcome or
abashed, or in any sense under any pressure to buy.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Jazzing it up in pub and club - Steamy
basements and top-shelf pizza joints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RONNIE Scott taps the end of his microphone and, feigning astonishment at
the sobriety of his audience, squints through the cigarette fug in the
direction of the sound desk: 'Is this f****** thing on?' Turning to the
hapless couple at the front table, he says, 'You should have been here last
night. A fellow rang to ask what time the first set started. I said, what
time can you get here?
'Somebody asked a waitress if she could change a Pounds 20 note the other
night. We made him a partner . . . ' The spiel, little changed in his 32
years of running London's premier jazz club, still raises a laugh and belies
the fact that the tenor-playing Ronnie packs them in six nights a week (he
stays closed on Sundays).
The Soho club stands at the centre of a colourful and varied jazz scene,
which extends from the West End into the nicotine-stained fabric of the
city's pubs via fringe clubs which scratch a precarious but exciting living
in the less-wealthy boroughs. Recession has bitten, but attendance at live
jazz has increased more significantly (by 17.8 per cent) than for any other
performing art form over the past four years in the UK, according to the
Arts Council.
It is a more or less useless fact, although borne out by the abundance of
hot and cool jazz which can be heard on any night of the week in
surroundings that vary from subterranean to post-modern. This month you
could have tracked the extraordinary harmonics of Tal Farlow, the
usually-reclusive American guitar legend, as he moved residencies from the
East End's Tenor Clef, to the beery back room of the Bull's Head in leafy
Barnes, south-west London, via Soho's low-key Pizza Express.
Bass man Peter Ind's Tenor Clef is the sedate room above his steamy basement
Bass Clef club and restaurant. Jammed between bombsites and grimy,
Dickensian warehouses, the East End location gives a speakeasy atmosphere to
a main room where the walls run wet with condensation on steamy salsa
nights.
Peter Boizot's pizza joints - the Express, down the stairs in Dean Street,
and the more top-shelf Pizza on the Park in Knightsbridge, near Harrods -
are strictly for the supper-club set and a knife and fork accompaniment
prevails. The Bull's Head, a regulars' pub, mixes Young's ale with modern,
mainstream sounds every night in its back room. It is worth the long journey
west to watch elderly, middle-class beatniks hunched and shaking over their
pints.
To the north in NW1, stranded amid the heaps of down-and-outs from Europe's
biggest doss house, is the financially-beleaguered Camden Jazz Cafe. As
Farlow was making his way across town, the Cafe was playing post-modernist
host to the abstract tenor of Pharoah Sanders. By the river, on the bunker
walls of the South Bank complex, posters for the shiny techno-fusion of
Chick Corea, the most famous acolyte of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard,
vied for attention with the Nordic blandishments of Jan Garbarek's soprano.
But if London is on the circuit for the big names of jazz, it also home to
inter-connected local scenes fed by home-grown talent and fuelled with beer.
EMI's famous Blue Note label has recognised the London effect and tomorrow
night showcases six of the country's most promising young musicians at the
Camden Jazz Festival. The original compositions, which be premiered in the
Technics-sponsored event at the Bloomsbury Theatre, will be recorded.
Featured Londoners Tony Remy (guitar), Michael and Mark Mondesir (bass and
drums) and Orphy Robinson (vibes) are easy to catch on the club and pub
scene - and that scene is not hard to find. Take Stoke Newington, a
superficially unremarkable part of north-east London inhabited by Turks,
West Indians, Orthodox Jews, 'meeja' bohemians and jazz musicians.
A walk from our house to the High Street will take you past one, then
another, saxophone running through scales in competition with the rolling
thunder of reggae bass lines. Across the main road, by the mosque, is a
Victorian pub called Rumours where the upstairs sash windows rattle to the
avant-garde sound of Howard Riley's piano and Elton Dean's squealing sax.
Beyond, in Church Street, is the Vortex Jazz Bar, an artists' supply shop
with an airy, whitewashed loft open five nights a week to all schools of
jazz, from a John Etheridge duo to the Stan Tracey octet. Take a left to
Newington Green and, by the China Inland Mission, is the Latin Jazz Cafe,
forerunner to the Camden club. A little further along is the Weaver's Arms,
a friendly pub which resonates to the accordion-led strains of zydeco -
swamp music - which has become an incongruous but important part of the
London blues scene.
A similar trail of pub and club can be followed into Islington, and on to
neighbouring Camden and Kentish Town. Across the river, too. All are safe
and none has complex rules over cover charges: you pay to get in and then
buy as few drinks as you like (unlike New York, where the Blue Note club
often kicks out the punters between sets; or Paris, where only an actuary
could fathom the relation between cover charges and drink prices).
The London scene does not, of course, stand up to close comparison with New
York; it does not have the history. But only in London could you find such a
great US brass man as Art Farmer in a school hall (at University College
School in Hampstead) where tea and sandwiches were served by the boys at
half-time.
Live music in London is not as exotic as Paris where different musical
cultures have happily collided since the war. But only in London will you
find Ronnie Scott telling pre-war jokes in a cod-Japanese accent, or
assuring diners that the chef's rash has cleared up.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Musical jewels in tawdry settings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT

<TEXT>
'London - classical music capital of the world': the phrase has by now a
familiar ring. No doubt its coining is owed to the number of regularly
active bodies and places that make all the music happen: the five symphony
orchestras; the numerous chamber orchestra, and choirs large and small; the
six central concert halls - seven if you count the Albert Hall, home of the
summer Proms; the plethora of events in churches; and much, much else.
In recent years the concert scene, unlike the operatic, has become a good
deal less rich in terms of novelty (old-musical no less than new-musical),
variety and chance-taking; but it is still possible to catch a big Mahler or
Bruckner symphony conducted by one of the current Big Names, a substantial
choral masterpiece, a prestige solo or chamber recital, most weeks of the
year.
I have been a London music-follower for 25 years, as (successively) tourist,
music student and critic, and I wince whenever the phrase crops up.
'Capital', after all, means not just 'head town of country, county, etc.'
(OED) but also 'important, leading, first-class' or even '(colloq.)
excellent, first-rate'. The ingredients - programmes, interpreters - may
indeed often be first-rate, but the receptacles are almost all unworthy, in
one way or another, and the final product is too often tinged, even tainted,
by the unworthiness.
It is an extraordinary situation: a city of London's musical importance
possessing not a single fully satisfactory concert hall but, rather, a
collection of them, each with flaws and faults capable of limiting an
audience-member's delight in performance.
My categories of measurement require a brief run-through: acoustics,
sight-lines, seat-comfort, but also ease of access and egress; quantity and
quality of the facilities for food, drink and pre-concert or interval
ablution; and general ambience. All these things contribute to the total
experience of concert-going, pleasurable or otherwise.
The success, acoustical above all, of Birmingham's new Symphony Hall,
provides Londoners with a chastening set of comparisons. Only one of our
halls rides high in at least the first three of my categories, providing
satisfactory basic requirements for listening: the Wigmore Hall,
home-from-home for all followers of chamber music, instrumental recital and
song. The acoustics shed a bloom, particularly on voices; no audience-member
feels too distant from the platform; it is a cosy and a welcoming place.
In the narrow, poky antechamber, however, feelings of cosiness have been
known to diminish drastically. This may change by October, for the Wigmore
is currently midway through an eight-month period of closure for renovation
and extension; the plans were undertaken with the aim of giving a
concert-hall jewel the suitably spacious setting it has always lacked.
For the South Bank complex - comprising the large Royal Festival Hall,
medium-sized Queen Elizabeth Hall, small Purcell Room - more far-reaching
overhaul plans have been drawn up, and will be put into action in (it is
hoped) 1995. These include pulling down the building containing the QEH and
the PR and re-siting both in unattached positions adjacent to the Festival
Hall, which will have its web of hideous grey walkways removed.
It is hard to know which hall causes the visitor the deeper misery, the
Queen Elizabeth or the Purcell. The depression induced by their sullen
concrete casing, gloomy lighting and unclearly-numbered black-leather
seating is common to both; the acoustics of both make all but the most
finely poised and focused performers sound tinny and dynamically uncertain,
as if heard through the wrong end of a telescope. I plump for the Purcell as
the greater horror.
The Royal Festival Hall, which will survive intact in the re-development
scheme, is not exactly misery-inducing; but the neutral environment offers
no lift to the spirits, the lack of leg-room is penitential, and the dry
acoustics, notwithstanding their electronically added resonance, wrinkle the
lineaments of all the bigger works performed there. The drive to attract
increased numbers to the bars, restaurants and exhibition spaces of the
foyers has proved all too successful, and put a strain on the building's
upkeep that has become unpleasantly obvious, particularly at weekends.
In view of all the self-satisfied crowing that has recently accompanied the
10th-birthday celebrations at the Barbican, it is perhaps salutary to point
out yet again the many things that make the place so profoundly unlovable,
such a trial to visit. Arrival by tube necessitates a foot-slog along mean
elevated paths and grim pavements; arrival by car, a nightmare search for
parking.
Inside the concert hall, the feeling of comfort, physical and visual, does
at least work toward soothing of sensibilities already ruffled by all the
external irritants and failings. The acoustics have been noticeably improved
by the removal of the glass roof-hangings, though big climaxes still tend to
clot.
I shan't dwell on St John's, Smith Square, which seems to have lost its way
as a front-ranking concert-hall, for reasons which (to me at least) are all
too plain: the hall, though handsome, is coldly uncomfortable, the
excessively reverberant acoustics suit few types of music, and the prices of
the crypt restaurant are discouragingly high. It is an alienating
environment. During the Proms, the Albert Hall develops a festive atmosphere
which it lacks at other times.
Does all this matter? I believe it does. A capital's housing of its musical
life surely reflects a nation's attitude to culture in general. In London
much music is on offer, but in places that do it - and its audiences - less
than justice. Piecemeal, there are many things worth celebrating; but as a
whole, the picture is not enticing.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Arts: Murder most foul - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORSE, Maigret, Taggart and Wexford lead the pros and hard behind them come
the amateurs - Holmes, Poirot, Wimsey and the rest, heading the charts on TV
screens and radio, nowadays often both. Not only has TV Morse been promoted
to Chief Inspector and his films extended to two hours, here he is tonight
on Radio 4, same personality but new voice, solving (from a hospital bed)
Colin Dexter's The Wench is Dead, a case that happened a century ago.
Detective plays rely mainly on their solutions, so no more about that.
We had a real murder on Monday, Darling Peidi, the case that, as aficionados
know, ended with the hanging of Freddy Bywaters and Edith Thompson. Half
Shelagh Stephenson's treatment told of Edith's adulterous love for Freddy,
eight years her junior, and director Jeremy Mortimer kept this as
sentimental as Edith's letters. But the last half-hour covered the murder
and trial, and there was nothing sentimental about either. Rachel Joyce as
Edith made true horror of the last scenes, which included the hanging - not
in detail, I am happy to say. For the record, Edith's guts fell out on the
scaffold and Ellis, the hangman, who had had to make special body straps to
get his distressed subject to the trap, killed himself shortly after.
Radio 4 also gave us two sudden deaths in Fatal Reaction on Thursday, only
this time the police were the killers. Twice recently there has been
argument when armed police have shot men who appeared to be threatening them
with firearms: in Ian Gordon's case because he was mentally unstable; and in
Ian Bennett's because he was helplessly drunk. Both firearms proved to be
potentially harmless - one a toy, the other a reproduction.
This programme suggested that additional training for armed police might
enable them to deal less lethally with such cases. No procedure can fit
every case; but it was interesting to hear the discussion.
Official reaction is more severe in Iran, to judge from Prometheus in Evin
by the Iranian writer Iraj Jannatie Ataie, (Radio 3, Tuesday). A dissident
writer is imprisoned in the notorious gaol Evin, flogged, tortured, his wife
raped by an 'interrogator'. His ultimate punishment is publicly to renounce
all his beliefs on television. As with Prometheus, unacceptable education is
punished by permanent display of defeat, while enemies tear at the
intellectual vitals. It was a horrifying play, well done by David Rintoul as
the writer and Vivien Heilbron as his wife. Matthew Walters directed
Radio 3's Sunday production of Pinter's No Man's Land was good enough to
challenge the matchless original. Dirk Bogarde as Spooner and Michael
Hordern as Hirst were not like Gielgud and Richardson; they were simply
Spooner and Hirst. What is the play about? 'You are in No Man's Land, which
never moves, never changes, never grows older, remains for ever icy'. That
is what it is about, and to my mind Pinter has never written anything
better. Janet Whitaker directed.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Bland architectural monuments to Mrs T - The
fruits of market-driven building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL CITES around the world bear the marks of their governments and
rulers. In Paris, Presidents of France have always followed in the footsteps
of Louis XIV and found architectural ways of expressing 'la gloire'. In
Bucharest, President Ceaucescu used architecture to wipe out the past in
Romania and to build avenues to the empty triumphs of socialism. Today in
Spain, a World Fair and the Olympic Games are both producing monuments that
celebrate the end of restrictive government and the arrival of democratic
freedoms.
Where do you look in London for the monuments of the Thatcher era? As a
leader not entirely immune to a touch of 'la gloire' herself, she seems to
have been happy to let the market produce the monuments rather than dictate
her own vision in architectural terms. There were many occasions in the last
decade when Mrs T could be seen at the wheel of a bulldozer launching the
construction process surrounded by mere men in their hard hats.
Any Thatcher tour would have to begin at Broadgate by Liverpool Street in
the City, where the Prime Minister, after driving the earth mover a few
yards, shouted at the assembled power brokers of the property world that she
would be back to declare the finished development open.
The Broadgate development and the new Liverpol Street station form one of
the better monuments of the era. They also show off perfectly the
architectural and stylistic debate of the times. From the restraint of the
early phases designed by Arup Associates and Peter Foggo, the whole scheme
moved into the overscaled post-modernism of the Bishopsgate buildings
(designed by the American firm of Skidmore Owings and Merrill) that tower
over bedraggled Spitalfields.
Travel further East and you are soon in the heart of Thatcherland. Her
government's idea of the Enterprise Zones where planning and rating
procedures were suspended to encourage development, can be seen in its built
form in London's Docklands. Here is the habitat of that endangered species,
the yuppy: carefully designed brick boxes where he and his mobile telephone
lay down to rest for few hours between deals. Here is the leather chair in
the loft where the Nescafe was sipped while property prices boomed and
burst. Here in Mrs Thatcher's dreamland, the view from the yuppies' window
is a sad expression of non-planning and virtually non-architecture.
Far away from the City, on every yuppy's horizon, is that strange empty
giant obelisk of Canary Wharf. This is perhaps her biggest monument and the
most poignant. It stands in the only part of Docklands that has been well
planned but it is as isolated from the reality of London as Ceaucescu's
dreams of a socialist heaven were from the reality of daily life in
Bucharest.
Canary Wharf remains a practically unreachable dream: who knows whether the
Tube will ever get there or whether the Docklands Toytown railway will ever
stop breaking down?
To rival the easy-going development of Docklands in Mrs Thatcher's years,
the City of London encouraged massive quantities of office building.
Architecturally, almost all of this commercial development is without
distinction. Perhaps Lloyds of London's high-tech dream by Sir Richard
Rogers is the only significant, advanced architectural monument from those
heady years. But Lloyds is not without its enemies. It has the controlling
power of a great machine and many people find its demanding environment hard
to work in.
To see the great commercial explosion in London - the 1980's South Sea
Bubble of architectural development - conducted Thatcher tours would have to
go down the Thames. At almost every bridge from Vauxhall to the Tower,
nondescript office blocks wearing veneers of granite gaze blankly into the
waters.
Stylistically varied from Aztec post-modernism to juvenile undigested
classicism, the new Thatcher city is a visual nightmare of indifferent
architecture. Perhaps the saddest monument is the crumbling landmark of
Battersea Power Station - which was also the scene of a stage-managed
appearance by Mrs Thatcher. Here, at a launch for its refurbishment, she
spoke of her hopes that the powerhouse of the 1930's would be rejuvenated as
a great leisure centre for the capital. It is now a collapsing ruin. Lector,
si momentum requiris, circumspice. . .

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: A snare for film-makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN FOREIGN movie hands, London has suffered the fate of a dozen great cities
across the world. The film-maker from abroad takes one look at the unknown
urban maze and decides to concertina the whole thing into a few Instantly
Identifiable Landmarks.
Big Ben, the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace . . . to non-British eyes
the city's crimes, passions and misunderstandings have long tended to take
place under the collective shadow of these monoliths; just as the Eiffel
Tower watches over everything in Paris, with accordion accompaniment, and
all roads lead past the Colosseum in Rome.
There is something special about London, though, and the cinema has mined
it, even unwittingly, since the silent days. The city is dark, large and
formless enough to swallow passing innocents. For the first 30 years of film
history, London was almost invariably Gothic. From American spinecurdlers
like Lon Chaney's London After Midnight (1927) and Bela Lugosi's Dracula
(1931), to subtler European fare like Leni's Waxworks (1924) and Pabst's
Pandora's Box (1928) - both featuring Jack the Ripper - Britain's capital
was a maze of dismal streets and alleys in which evil shadows reared out of
fog and pounced on helpless waifs.
World perception of the British capital was so unflattering that it finally
took a resident foreigner, Alexander Korda to make a series of movies which
graciously reversed the canvas.
Korda and others gave us a London big with empire, royalty and tradition.
Actor-knights like Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier were drafted to
play prime ministers or members of parliament; fog was banished and in
movies like The Private Life Of Henry VIII, That Hamilton Woman and Henry V,
the city was a gleaming chunk of history patrolled by the great and famous.
It was still a maze in which one could get lost but, this time, new turnings
led to historical revelation rather than hysterical terror.
One of the ironies of cultural history is that Korda numbered among his
friends the writer Graham Greene. As a film critic, Greene regularly spilled
venom on Korda's cinema, not least on his patriotic visions of Britain and
its capital. Greene's own emergent and distinctive vision of London was
being shaped by the downbeat menace of films like Alfred Hitchcock's The
Lodger, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Sabotage.
As Greene was to do in his novels, Hitchcock took London by the scruff of
its skyline and shook it free both of Gothic fog and Korda-esque pretension.
It was 'seedy' but clear-visioned. And although it was full of Instantly
Identifiable Landmarks, they were exploited for surprise and subversion. A
lord mayor's parade was an overture to murder (Sabotage); the British Museum
hosted a hair's-breadth chase (Blackmail); and Westminster Cathedral,
accustomed to raising citizens to God, obliged Hitchcock by plunging a man
to his death (Foreign Correspondent).
Hitchcock's was not the only voice raised in a counter-Korda spirit. David
Lean, in his magnificent adaptation of Dickens' Oliver Twist, gave us a
period London shorn of period glamour. Since that poetic high point in
cine-portraits, it has been, if not all downhill, a fairly bumpy ride.
First, the 1950s gave us a sparkling picture-postcard London, courtesy of
Hollywood: it was the decade of shopping-at-Harrods movies starring Deborah
Kerr and Doris Day. Then, Swinging London put everyone into shock, since the
idea of London as 'fashionable' was as startling as a tramp announcing he
was about to buy his clothes at Armani.
It could not last, we thought, but it did. Julie Christie and a host of New
Age stars rushed about the town colonising it for mini-skirts and Beatles
hair-dos, purple eye-shadow and flaring trousers. Georgie Girl, Alfie,
Help], The Knack, Blow Up - it was like an outbreak of St Vitus' dance in an
old people's home.
Some 30 years have passed since then, during which London, mercifully, has
resumed its proper, time-honoured identity - which is to have no particular
identity at all save a tendency to sprawl and confuse. This means that the
archetypal London movie motif - strangers getting lost - continues and those
lost strangers often include the film-makers themselves.
But then, what would be left of London's character if visitors could find
their way around? London prides itself on being all things to all people. In
recent films, having abandoned the empire, it has found the empire coming to
it. Swirling multi-ethnic films like My Beautiful Laundrette and London
Kills Me show that topographical diversity is now matched by cultural. We
have outgrown the clean divide between movies glorifying London a la Korda
and those de-glamorising it surgically a la Hitchcock. Like Britannia,
London, having given up ruling the waves, now allows the waves to wash
wildly and multifariously over it.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: The city that only the visitors see - The
London reserved for tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HUDDLED like sheep in the lee of the Albert Hall in west London, the wind
whipping at our legs. It was 8.45 on Saturday morning. 'Bath overnight]'
someone shouted. 'Third coach down, please]' 'Windsor and Hampton Court,
follow me]' We milled about, stamping our feet.
'West End? Tour Number One. Bus at the end.' The bus was warm and we sank
gratefully into the upholstery. Outside, a group of Japanese girls in
windblown gymslips were taking each other's photos. (Just what do they do
with all those pictures when they get home to their tiny flats in Tokyo?)
The guide was humorous and his breath smelled of drink. He ejected a group
of Spaniards ('You're Salisbury and Stonehenge, you lot'); then he counted
us.
It felt good to be counted. Now there was nothing more to worry about. All
the stresses of being in the great metropolis melted away, our brains
disengaged, and we were able to watch the scenery float by like some
half-remembered travel movie.
'All this was country, once,' the guide confided to his microphone. 'On your
left you will see Hyde Park where the kings used to hunt stags and deer.' We
thought we remembered watching, at the age of three or four, the bigger boys
sailing their toy boats on the Round Pond. But that must have been in
another life. We were seeing Hyde Park for the first time now, and we sighed
appreciatively.
It is a cliche to say that London is not one place, but many. Today, we were
discovering a London we had never encountered before, a London that only
visitors see. Its outlines were familiar but its substance was very
different.
Did you know, for example, that the city was founded in the spring of AD 43?
Or that English history ended, more or less, with Queen Elizabeth I?
A few things happened later, to be sure, like Harrods, the Duke of
Wellington and Charles and Di. There was also Downing Street where the
former prime minister, Mrs Thatcher, used to live, but no mention of the IRA
which forced her to put big steel gates across its entrance.
The statue of Abraham Lincoln in Parliament Square interested the Americans
among us. The name Jan Smuts rang no bells. Beyond Smuts was the effigy of a
large man in a bronze overcoat, staring grumpily at Big Ben: but they didn't
tell us who he was.
We were Japanese, Taiwanese, Chilean, Portuguese, Italian and American, a
tour of Babel, unencumbered by prejudice or the slightest knowledge of
England's past. However, we liked our guide a lot: he was not bossy or
greedy like the ones we had in Europe last week.
Also, you could tell he knew his stuff (he had an official badge like the
bus conductor's, and we found out later he had done two years' training). He
certainly knew enough not to weigh us down with boring detail.
He took us to Westminster Abbey, which was built on an island in the river
and is paved with the tombs of dead celebrities. 'Don't bother walking round
them,' our guide said. 'You can't help stepping on somebody.'
Oddly enough, there were no chairs or pews in the nave; we supposed they
just put those in for coronations and royal weddings. Disappointingly, the
facade was covered in scaffolding and sheeting, like many of London's famous
buildings.
The abbey was confusing, not only because of all the kings and queens buried
there but because of the one-way traffic system which kept taking us back
through the brass-rubbing cloister. But we were lucky, too, because we
arrived on one of the few days in the year when they lift the carpet from
the High Altar and show you the Cosmati mosaic underneath - 'the best
example north of the Alps,' the guide said.
Put down in 1268 for King Henry III, this pavement from Rome is studded with
porphyry, onyx, serpentine and glass, has a mystical meaning and forecasts
that the world, or primum mobile, will end after 19,683 years.
We did not have time to ponder all this. Our guide had warned us to stay
close or we would not find the coach again and would miss the Changing of
the Guard.
We were driven to St James's Palace (also covered in scaffolding) and
watched the Grenadier Guards march up to the Palace. A young policewoman,
very haughty in skintight jodhpurs, cleared the way for them.
When some of us, eager to get pictures, refused to stay on the pavement, she
gently backed the rump of her mare into them. The guide told us that this
girl stands in for Her Majesty the Queen for rehearsals of Trooping the
Colour.
The sentry outside St James's provided a wonderful photo opportunity. He was
very tall and tight-lipped and didn't seem to mind. Someone told us that
young women sometimes write their hotel telephone numbers on bits of paper
and stick them in the guardsmen's belts. Nobody did that today, so far as we
noticed.
Later, while we waited for the other detachment of guards to march out of
Buckingham Palace, we talked to the American next to us. He was pretending
not to be impressed.
'You should see Atlanta, Georgia,' he said. 'Capital of CNN Television. They
won the Gulf War]' Ah, but who did they win it for? we asked.
We hoped our friend didn't notice when the guardsmen, emerging from the
palace gates at a slow march, made a shambles of breaking into quick time.
This part of the tour was over, so we tipped the guide and repaired to a
typically English restaurant for lunch: Green's, in Duke St, St James's. On
the walls were hung some unfunny cartoons by someone called Jak. There were
no English people there.
Behind us sat a large Italian family. In the corner was a well-ironed
American businessman with a reconditioned, Ivana Trump-style wife. Beside us
sat another American, a doleful man with a very fat and spoilt son aged
about nine who made cute comments between gargantuan mouthfuls. Deprived of
real English people to eavesdrop on, we ordered native oysters, which were
very good, and fish and chips, which were a disgrace to a great nation.
Luckily, or so we thought then, we were saving our appetites for the
evening. The brochure given us by two of the smartest hotels in London
contained several suggestions: 'a rollicking evening at the court of King
Henry VIII' in the cellar of a warehouse at St Katherine's Dock; a
'spectacular cabaret in the luxury venue' of the Talk of London in Drury
Lane; and a Cockney Cabaret in Tottenham Court Road.
Fortunately, perhaps, all three were sold out that night so we plumped for
the Elizabethan Banquet at Hatfield House, 30 miles out in Hertfordshire.
And a rollicking evening it turned out to be, too.
We were a different lot on the coach that left Trafalgar Square at dusk, but
as polyglot as ever. Our driver clearly had decided we were therefore
mentally deficient, and wearied us all up the A1 with his Ladybird Book
version of Elizabethan England. But our spirits were lifted by what greeted
us on arrival: a genuine Tudor hall with vaulted roof, hung with stags'
heads and tapestries (less genuine).
Long wooden tables ran up to a red-carpeted dais in the centre, on which
stood a throne occupied by a jester in a goatee beard and red-and-white
striped tights. Opposite him sat a harpsichordist and a ruffed-and-gowned
lady who played on the recorder, shawm and crumhorn.
A prancing Earl of Leicester entered, followed by the Virgin Queen herself,
robed magnificently and punning as horribly as her Blackadder counterpart.
Wenches with big jugs (so the Queen put it) poured out mead and wine,
bouncing on our outstretched knees as they passed. Who said the English were
reserved?
By the time the juggling fire-eater had done his turn, the place resounded
with the drumming of male fists and the shrieks of their womenfolk. Then, a
small and smiling Italian named Luigi was hustled to the podium to play
Hunt-My-Lady's-Garter (more shrieks) and receive a knighthood.
A young man from our table, overcome with fumes of mead - or was it
pre-match ale? - lurched outside and tried to assault the prettier of our
wenches. Her friends overpowered him, stripped him to the waist and returned
him, daubed with lipstick but unrepentant. The climax was reached with a
general sing-song, a conga round the tables, and wenches pouring water down
each other's cleavages. So our banquet ended, at 10.45 precisely.
And the food? We nearly forgot to mention it. But who would come to London
to eat when there is so much history to gorge upon? Actually, the food was
dreadful.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Tips for tipplers - Advice on London's pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a curious tendency for drinking establishments to call up a mental
picture of what they ought to look like. Thus, the French cafe has stripey
awnings and Pernod on the pavement. The Bavarian beer hall has blonde
waitresses and men in funny hats. So it is with the London pub. Inside are
the cheery Cockneys, singing along with old Lil on the piano. Beer is
fourpence a pint and everyone is on first-name terms. Outside, it is foggy
and there is a distant shriek as Jack the Ripper strikes again.
The vexing thing about such images is that they are not so much wholly wrong
as misleading in practice. There is such a thing as the sociable London pub,
where families and friends get together, the bar staff know the customers
and conversation is general. Statistically, such establishments are
outnumbered heavily - in the city centre, especially - by pubs where the
social life is reminiscent of a motorway cafe halfway up the M1. The
clientele is transient and largely solitary; the decor is unvarying; the
prices are extortionate; and the absence of conversation is masked by the
juke box.
In seeking out pubs of the first category, I suggest applying what I will
call the law of negatives. I cannot claim to have invented this. Some years
ago, the head of one of the big UK brewers remarked to me that all its
market research showed people defining the kind of pub they liked in purely
negative terms. A good pub is not too noisy or, alternatively, too quiet. It
does not have live music, pop videos or exotic dancers. It does not have too
many old men in flat hats playing cribbage and dominoes.
For our purposes, the same principle can be expressed in a few simple rules.
Avoid pubs with a view of the Thames. These are gold mines for their owners
and, generally, run accordingly. The typical clientele consists of
coachloads of Continental tourists clutching tickets entitling them to a
half-pint of genuine English bitter. The bar staff are harried Australian
juveniles who will always serve you last - unless you are female, in which
case they will not serve you at all.
Avoid pubs near railway stations, especially the main line termini. Some
very odd people travel to the metropolis, and some even odder ones are there
to meet them. Be careful of any pub with a piano: someone might start to
play it. The days of the competent pub pianist are long gone. What you will
get now is either a piano bar pianist, which is a very different thing, or a
self-taught enthusiast who believes every known melody can be fitted to the
harmonic structure of Pop Goes the Weasel.
Watch out for pubs offering karaoke nights, live sport coverage by
satellite, or bottles of Mexican beer with a chunk of lime wedged in the
neck. Their presence argues that the pub round the corner will be reasonably
free from the kind of people who actually like karaoke, Mexican beer and so
forth.
Positive ways of identifying the right kind of pub are harder to come by.
There are large tracts of 19th century London where the only worthwhile
architectural features are their pubs and warehouses. South London, in
particular, still has a number of vast old Victorian gin palaces with gilt
mirrors, red plush curtains and ebony elephants on either side of the
fireplaces. The snag is that they are mostly in remote regions like
Wandsworth and Tooting Bec.
Above all, it is worth remembering that even the sociable kind of London pub
is not at its best during the week. Conceivably, there was a time when
cheery Cockneys did go with their families to the pub on weekday evenings,
If so, they stopped when television arrived.
Weekends - Sunday lunchtimes, especially - are another matter. All that is
needed is the kind of pub with a varied and interesting population living
around it, where at least a reasonable number of the regulars know each
other and women - preferably children, too - feel at home. As it happens, I
know such a pub not far from where I live in North London. I shall probably
be popping in there this weekend. But, to borrow a line from Jerome K.
Jerome, I am not going to be idiot enough to advertise it.

<TEXT>
JOHN BRENNAN, whose informative and entertaining analysis of the residential
property market became one of the cornerstones of the Weekend FT, died last
week.
John, who was 42, wrote with flair, insight and authority on a subject
attracting more than its fair share of armchair experts.
An intensely professional man, he was a journalist of absolute integrity.
John never regarded his column for the Weekend FT, which he contributed
while running his own publishing business, as an opportunity merely to pen
graceful prose about stylish country mansions.
The topics he served up for weekend readers ranged from the problems of
first-time buyers to the challenge of coming home to find it taken over by
squatters. He never lost sight, however, of property's entertainment value,
keeping track of the latest craze for golf or marina developments or
occasionally telling readers what they could buy for Pounds 10m in central
London.
After university, John started his working life as a tax inspector before
entering financial journalism with the Investors Guardian, where he became
features editor. He joined Investors' Chronicle, becoming property editor,
and left to join The Times, where he was appointed insurance correspondent.
In 1977 he moved to the Financial Times as the paper's commercial property
corre-spondent. He left the FT in 1979 to become the first news editor of
Financial Weekly. After a spell as co-editor, he joined Bill Davies at
Headway Publications, acting as launch editor for several titles.
He left Headway, and with Ross Davies jointly founded Inc Publications,
where he was editorial director. He also created The London Magazine.
He is survived by Holly, his wife, and three young children.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Still feeling the after-shock of a boom -
The question is not 'when?' the London property market will pick up but
'where?'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRA BAR HILLEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the first things which will strike a visitor to London is the huge
number of For Sale boards festooning its finest streets. Indeed, in
Westminster the local council has taken stern measures to limit the number
and sizes of the boards as vendors' desperation had begun to hide the very
properties they were trying to shift.
After three years of stagnant or falling prices, London's houses are
becoming much more reasonably priced in comparison with several other
capital cities.
In spite of the uncertainties of the market, there has not been, in recent
memory, a better time to buy or rent in London. But some courage may be
needed, because few agents are predicting an immediate revival in prices,
and they may yet have some way to fall, depending partly on the result of
the General Election on April 9.
John Thorogood, a Wandsworth agent, says there is 'quite a lot of viewing
but no sales' because bargain hunters are making offers 'well below
acceptance levels.' But others are finding vendors prepared to accept very
low offers 'on the understanding that they can get a similar reduction on
the property they are buying'.
This suggests that buyers and vendors are adjusting to new conditions,
although the process could depress prices further.
The prospects, however, are markedly different in the many 'villages' of
London. A favourite guessing game is to predict not so much when the
recovery will begin - but where. The smart money is on Battersea, Chiswick,
Barnes, Putney and West Kensington. These are areas which are either
well-established or soundly up-and-coming - but which did not go over the
top during the last property boom as Clapham, Ealing and Fulham did.
In Chiswick, values have fallen relatively little, specially for fine
traditional family houses, down about 4 per cent from last year (to an
average Pounds 250,000) while small flats lost 6 per cent (to about Pounds
68,000). In Putney family houses lost about 3 per cent (to Pounds 188,000)
while small flats stayed steady at about Pounds 67,000. Similar prices and
movements apply to Battersea, while in Barnes both houses and small flats
dropped about 4.5 per cent (to Pounds 187,000 and Pounds 74,000).
In Clapham, which was almost level pegging with Battersea two years ago, all
but the family houses lining the common have dropped. Gentrification, which
pushed up prices in Ealing and Fulham as well, has virtually stopped as home
owners realise that pumping money into property is no longer a guarantee of
profits.
Some of the cheapest flats in London, in the Pounds 40,000-Pounds 45,000
range, are in Croydon, Mitcham and Morden. This end of the market is being
kept low by the the tidal wave of re-possessions coming up for sale.
Whatever they may claim, measures taken by the Government and the mortgage
lenders have done little to stem this tide. The number of lenders' actions
for repossession coming to London's County Courts is, if anything, up on
last year. Relatively prosperous areas are suffering, such as Barnet (129
actions for repossession in February 1992 compared to 73 in February 1991);
Wandsworth (199 up from 133) and Kingston-on-Thames (108 up from only 22).
Some first-time buyers are still waiting for further price falls or
repossession bargains, but those looking for a place to live rather than a
short-term investment should not wait much longer, especially if they are
paying rent.
Unusually, it is London's best-known areas which seem likely to stagnate as
the rest of the property world settles down round them. Properties in
Chelsea, Dulwich, Hampstead, Highgate, Kensington, Knightsbridge, St John's
Wood, Richmond and, of course, Mayfair and Belgravia have held their values,
mainly thanks to overseas investment. But in the absence of a lively market
at home, they are unlikely to rise in the near future.
At the top of the market you need to be very rich to make the big notional
'savings'. It is open to question, for example, whether 19 Upper Phillimore
Gardens, now on the market for 'only' Pounds 9.75m (about Pounds 1m per
bedroom) was ever worth its previous asking price of Pounds 12.5m.
On the other hand, Janet Holmes a Court has not reduced her asking price of
Pounds 17.5m for Grove House in Regents Park.
Also in Regents Park the Crown Estate have chosen to delay the marketing of
the completed Gothick (sic) Villa, the third in their Nash-style classics,
rather then reduce the price of the Pounds 9m Villa Veneto for the sake of a
quick sale.
The Government has proposed to allow leaseholders of high-value houses to
buy their freeholds, a right denied them under existing leasehold law. Flat
leaseholders excluded from the new right to buy would be entitled to have
their leases extended.
These proposals would affect hundreds of thousands of properties in London's
prime areas: Mayfair, Belgravia and Kensington. The leaseholders'
association is delighted. But the Grosvenor Estate, owned by Britain's
second richest man, the Duke of Westminster, warns that if it ceases to be
the landlord, properties would soon deteriorate. 'This could be a very sad
day for historic London,' the Estate said.
Grosvenor property certainly has a special cachet. Margaret Thatcher
recently paid Pounds 700,000 for a 10-year lease on a flat in Chester
Square.
The former residence of Lord Aberconway, 38 South Street in Mayfair, is
another Grosvenor leasehold. The asking price for the remaining 75 years has
recently been reduced from Pounds 12m to Pounds 8.45m. The selling agent,
Paul Taylor of Savills, admits that it would cost a further Pounds 3m to
Pounds 4m to renovate it in the style to which prospective occupiers would
be accustomed. In addition, the rent for the first 20 years alone - Pounds
200,000 - would nowadays buy a pleasant family house almost anywhere else in
London. Will the new owners have enough left over to buy the freehold?
The Grosvenor has also warned that the proposed leasehold reforms in central
London will have 'dramatic consequences on the housing market'. But so
inscrutable is the current market that even experts such as the Grosvenor
are not sure whether the result will be a collapse in values, or the
opposite.
The latter could only result from an onslaught on the market by foreign
buyers and investors.
'London residential property is excellent value compared with places such as
Vancouver and Sydney,' says Robin Paterson, managing director of Banard
Marcus. 'It is attracting inquiries from Hong Kong and Europe'.
Trends aside, historic one-offs can still cause a flutter in the current
doldrums. A City financier has just decided to spend Pounds 25m to convert
Crosby Hall in Cheyne Walk, which contains a medieval banqueting hall dating
to 1475 and associated with names such as Sir Thomas More, Richard III and
Sir Walter Raleigh, into a family home.
At the other end of the scale, an old listed cottage 'in awful condition' in
one third of an acre of wilderness was on offer in Newbury. 'In just three
weeks we had 57 viewings and 11 offers' said the astonished agents, Dreweatt
Neate. 'There's no accounting for taste'.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: The most civilised place in town - The
Wallace Collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS to London who also read the FT's art pages will know already that
each of London's Big Four - the British Museum, the National Gallery, the
Tate Gallery and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum - has acquired new galleries.
And yet, when the tourist season is well under way, you might not fancy the
idea of heading the same way as thousands of other people. Which of London's
many dozens of other museums offers the hope of first-rate entertainment for
the mildly misanthropic?
The first choice is absurdly obvious. Two minutes' walk from the hell of
Oxford Street, you will find Manchester Square and the grand brick facade of
Hertford House. This 18th century mansion, restored beautifully in the
1980s, houses the Wallace Collection: in all London, there is not a more
civilised place.
The marquesses of Hertford, members of a colourful family, amassed the
collection between 1750 and 1890. Much of its character comes from the
fourth marquis, who lived at the chateau of Bagatelle in the Bois de
Boulogne, Paris; his collection of paintings by Boucher, Fragonard, Watteau,
and Lancret has no equal in Britain. Almost as notable is the 19th century
French collection, particularly strong in Orientalist and historical scenes
such as Delaroche's Princes in the Tower.
The house is full of sumptuous, 18th century French furniture, among it
pieces made by Riesener for the empress Marie Antoinette. There are masses
of clocks and three rooms of magnificent Oriental and Renaissance arms and
armour plus bronzes, maiolica and porcelain, miniatures, boxes, and
fascinating little 17th century wax portraits.
As an art collection, the Wallace is first rate and wonderfully varied.
Nothing is ever lent, so you must either go to Manchester Square or miss the
masterpieces by Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Velazquez, Van Dyck, Reynolds -
and, of course, Frans Hals's Laughing Cavalier.
Sir Richard Wallace, the marquess's illegitimate son, was also a passionate
Francophile. His widow, who had once been a Parisian perfume-seller,
bequeathed the contents of Hertford House to the nation. Entry is free and
there are many guided tours. Tel: 071-935-0687.
Until the end of October, a natural pair for the Wallace is the exhibition
at the little Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace (071-930-4832). It
features paintings and furnishings collected by George IV as prince regent.
His close companion in mischief was none other than the disreputable third
marquess of Hereford, each spurring the other to fresh extravagances. Sadly,
Carlton House, for which George laid out such a fortune, no longer survives
but the exhibition, hung in rich red, well captures a society of dazzling
opulence.
You will have to wait until 1993 to see Apsley House, another grand mansion
with a magnificent collection, because it is closed for repairs. As for the
Courtauld Gallery's collection of Old Masters and Impressionists, it is too
well-known to need introduction. Remember that it has moved from Bloomsbury
to Somerset House on the Strand. But if this is your first visit to the new
home, prepare for a shock. To my eye, at least, the colours of the new
galleries are bilious and the lighting and general standard of decor
decidedly peculiar.
For beautiful paintings in a classic country house setting, you should visit
Kenwood House in Hampstead Lane, on the north edge of Hampstead Heath. The
great white building was remodelled by Robert Adam in the 1760s but was to
have been pulled down after the First World War. Mercifully, the Earl of
Iveagh saved it and also bequeathed his collection, which includes
masterpieces by Vermeer, Gainsborough, Rembrandt and Reynolds. Approached
through rhododendron woods, the house looks south across parkland. If you
have children who are allergic to art galleries, one partner can take them
down to the lake or feed them ice cream in the outdoor restaurant while the
other enjoys the collection. Kenwood is very popular with Londoners but
during the week it should not be too crowded (tel: 081-348-1286).
You should also head in the opposite direction, to south-east London and the
Dulwich College picture gallery. It is reached easily, first by train and
then a short walk along a leafy road. Built by architect Sir John Soane in
1811, this fascinating building was the first purpose-built art gallery in
Britain. It contains fine 17th and 18th century paintings, including works
by Poussin, Claude, Rembrandt, Rubens, and Murillo.
Soane's own house, at 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields just off the Strand, was made
into a museum (tel: 071-405-2107) and remains an inspiring example of what a
talented architect can do to create the illusion of space. In Henry James's
novel The Reverberator, a pair of adulterers choose the Soane museum on a
wet afternoon as their place of assignation, down by the famous sarcophagus
of Seti I. Those with more innocent intentions will find paintings by
Hogarth and Canaletto, among others, and Soane's fascinating collection of
antiquities.
My final recommendation is another great man's house - without artistic
pretensions, it is true, but with a remarkable atmosphere. Like Soane,
psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud was a great collector. However, most people who
visit the Freud Museum at 20 Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead, are as attracted
by the famous couch and the green tub chair as by the antiquities.
Freud spent his last year in this house, and Anna Freud lived and practiced
here as an analyst until her death in 1979. The study is intensely
evocative, as are the home movies screened upstairs in which the elderly
Anna describes the life of the household (tel: 071-455-2002).

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Just a little street of shabby chic - A look
at the legendary Portobello Road, the main axis of born-again Notting Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYBODY knows the Portobello Road. It is not a street where most people
would spend much time; instead, it is a one-day-a-week place where, every
Saturday morning, a good part of affluent London (and much of the rest of
the world besides) seems to want to congregate.
By 9 o'clock, it is so full of Belgravia matrons, Hampstead householders,
and the young and trendy from all over London that there is scarcely room
for the hordes of foreign visitors to swing a video camera. Tatty and
ill-groomed - but, at the same time, fashionable and frequented - it is the
best-known street of shabby chic in London.
What is it that draws the crowds across Notting Hill Gate, along Pembridge
Road and into Portobello's narrow, pedestrian-clogged artery? Much of the
appeal, no doubt, has to do with the scores of shops and sidewalk barrows
that line both sides. Stuffed full of antique furniture, objets d'art,
Victorian bric-a-brac and all kinds of uncommon articles old and new, cheap
and expensive, there is something for all tastes. But if buying such
delicate objects as eggshell-thin, 200-year-old tea cups for Pounds 800
apiece is one part of the thrill, the other is the distinctly indelicate
atmosphere in which the browsing and dealing takes place.
The market looks battered and run-down but it is also colourful, vibrant and
raffish. It is full of easy banter, rough talk and gesticulation. Brash and
energetic, it is alive with curious people and odd sights: blind beggars
singing, jugglers and ambulating magicians, ladies with baby prams full of
small dogs, soapbox orators out to save the world from acid rain or the
Conservative party.
What happens, though, when the Saturday market closes down and the
bargain-hunters drift off? Walk along the empty upper stretches of
Portobello Road on any other morning of the week and you might not recognise
it. The antique shops are shuttered and padlocked and barely a cat stirs.
For all its apparent desertion, however, life has not come to an abrupt
halt. Portobello Road has simply reverted to its more usual existence as the
main axis of Notting Hill, the community that surrounds it.
Quite apart from the visitors and the antiques, Notting Hill leads an
interior life wholly its own. Throughout the week, it remains one of the
most active, distinctive and appealing parts of London. It is a highly
sought-after residential address, a place where you will find businessmen
and bankers, professionals and media people.
Recessions notwithstanding, house prices have doubled and tripled in the
past 10 years; and although the area has the highest density of private
rented accomodation in south-east England, it is so popular that this is now
almost impossible to find.
In the 1960s, Notting Hill was a badly run-down area of cheap bed-sits
maintained by slum landlords, a refuge for the poor and for large ethnic
minorities of black, Spanish and Irish immigrants. Drugs and the hippy
counter-culture moved in. Poverty, unemployment, drugs, crime and
overcrowding combined to give Notting Hill a rough, dangerous and unsavoury
reputation.
Look further into the area's past, however, and you will find some of the
reasons for its present appeal. In the 1820s, London's suburbs, fast
expanding west, began encroaching on a large agricultural estate surrounding
Portobello Farm (so named for a British victory over the Spanish in the Gulf
of Mexico). The estate's owner, James Ladbroke, saw the opportunity for
creating a 'garden city' - a planned, orderly suburb of sweeping, terraced
crescents and broad expanses of greenery.
By the end of the Second World War, though, the once-gracious houses were so
neglected that you could buy one for as little as Pounds 1,000. Through the
late '50s and '60s, Notting Hill's low prices attracted many thousands of
Afro-Caribbean immigrants. Rapacious landlords, racial tension and
occasional explosions of violence kept property developers and investors
away. Today, re-converted from bed-sits into single residences, these same
houses will not leave a great deal of change from Pounds 1m.
It is, however, not just the architecture that has attracted affluent
outsiders to the area. For many, in fact, it is just the opposite. Notting
Hill over the years has developed a tolerant, bohemian, live-and-let-live
atmosphere. Inevitably, it has attracted escapees from the conformity and
constraints of white, straight, middle-class London.
The Portobello Road, as well as being lively, can also be rough and
dangerous. But for those who have grown up in dull suburbia, the frisson of
fear that comes with encountering, say, an aggressive drugs dealer on a
deserted corner late at night can, in a perverse kind of way, have its
attractions - it is cool to be hip, young and street-wise, to court the
risky, the illicit and the thrilling.
Notting Hill's atmosphere has always attracted painters, writers and
musicians as well as myriad schools of youth sub-culture and fashion. There
are life-styles in the area more alien to most Englishmen than those of
tribal Africa.
If you want the latest in Thrash or Grunge music, you can buy it in shops
there. You could scrape an aquaintance with the Crusties, the most recent
variety of aggro-anarchists, although you are better advised not to. Or
perhaps you would like to eat in a cyber-punk restaurant. You can find them
all in Notting Hill.
The most significant newcomers, though, are that large tribe of invaders
already familiar in many formerly less-favoured but convenient and
accessible parts of London: the young and upwardly mobile. Like most people,
they find the Notting Hill atmosphere lively and liberating and go on to
inject it with their own energy and tastes.
More importantly, they also inject it with money. No one can walk around the
streets adjacent to the Portobello Road without noticing the tapas bars and
art galleries, book shops and bistros, florists and restaurants that have
followed the yuppie migration. Slowly, such shops and businesses are
transforming the area and may well, one day, tilt the balance of neglect and
fashionability that makes this part of town special.
For the moment, though, the streets are safe from any such demise. In the
Portobello Road, going down-market still remains the up-market thing to do.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Optimists who take their cue from Greenland
 -The capital's gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPTIMISM of Londoners exceeds their circumstances: they are the
Greenlanders of British gardening. When Peary encountered the most northerly
Eskimoes in Greenland, they told him that all the rest of the world lay in
darkness but only there did light still shine for half an hour on a winter's
day. Clinging on, they thought themselves the most fortunate people on
earth.
In London gardens, the dark factors are obvious: dirt, cars, neighbours'
trees and cats, a heavy clay soil, and access only through the main rooms of
the house. London gardening involves incongruous through traffic, shifting
manure over rush matting and designer carpet. By way of compensation, its
few rays of light are shelter from severe frost and a legacy from great
planters in the past 100 years.
Against the frost, there are walls everywhere, some of them sunny and many
heated from behind. Yellow Banksian roses will run from the basement to the
eaves; little pittosporum will survive beside a flight of steps; myrtles
will usually make it through the winter. As for the legacy, it continues to
increase in public places: a massive new roof garden in Cannon Street and
the new Japanese water garden in Holland Park. The best of it is much older
and will be wonderfully visible during the next two months.
In spring, London still has its areas of sudden loveliness, suggesting a
Chinese hillside among thick traffic and impatient men with briefcases.
Early in the year, crocusses are marvellous from Marble Arch to Kew. There
is a rare form of Ceanothus impressus which flowers even in December in the
charming Physic Garden in Chelsea.
Against the old orangery in Holland Park, the tall pink and white camellias
are looking spectacular; while the garden's box-edged beds of blue, mauve
and yellow polyanthus are a dramatic background for the start of the spring
season's skateboarding and public breast-feeding. On the edge of summer,
lilacs are sensational in W2; when the heat rises I head for the limes in
Hyde Park, buzzing with bees and, consequently, more free from pesterers
than the plane trees in Berkeley Square. I try to avoid Kew because the
bedding-out and border plantings are rather tasteless; I prefer surprises
where gardens have excelled their settings, now or in the past.
The great gale of 1987 caused havoc among many of London's best groups of
trees. Instead, at The Hill in Hampstead, you can admire the very long
pergolas of Portland stone which were constructed for Lord Lever in 1905.
Tree-like, they are a fine memorial to a golden age of gardening before the
onset of socialism and world wars. Throughout June and July, private havens
are thrown open on Sundays to the public for charity. The yellow book of
Gardens Open in 1992 is now on sale: anything marked with a botanical flower
is worth visiting, especially the smaller gardens with an individual use of
restricted space.
Between these expert oases, there are optimistic window boxes, dreaded
hanging baskets, and the great acreage of gardens in London's squares which
committees keep under lock and key. Select groups of residents
disenfranchise those who live near them, and then run these green gardens
with varying degrees of horticultural sense. Members have to own property
within the specified area. My local square has disqualified me: perhaps they
are afraid I will ride in with my horse.
The rest of us can only peer through the privet or off the top of a tall
bus: our public gardens are the royal parks instead. This year, many of them
are being turned over to privatised management with fears that they may lose
their character; my experience is that privatisation speeds and improves
results. Meanwhile, we can sprawl and enjoy them in the lunch hour, shoeless
and nearly topless.
London's great belts of greenery are not a legacy from public-spirited
'amenity' planting. They began as areas of royal field sports. We owe them
to two cultural forces which are loathed by the political left: hunting and
the monarchy. Thanks to both of them, distressed gardeners, trapped in
London, can head south for relief to Richmond. This park has a scope and
wilderness which central spaces lack: it is a network of small woods where
birds, flowers and autumn colours are an encouragement to keen walkers.
Despite the gorse and heather, the happiest patch of former hunting ground
is the Isabella plantation, which is one of the few gardens worth visiting
from the countryside beyond. Since January, there have been great bushes of
flowers among the camellias and rhododendrons in this sheltered wood,
re-planted since the 1950s. April and May are its special moments of glory
and entrance is free, making it London's number one for gardeners who are
feeling frustrated.
What, lastly, about the ultimate secret, the gardens of Buckingham Palace?
Yes, I did go once to a summer garden party; and although I thought that the
display of cherry pie made effective bedding, I felt the borders lacked
flair and class. On an earlier visit in the 1960s, my grandmother was
luckier. She found the ultimate relic of a sudden social crisis: a discarded
meringue in a flower bed, in which was still embedded the upper half of a
set of false teeth.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Streets paved with second-hand clothes - Fun
and bargains in street markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF SHOPPING as a sport has lost its thrall, if you are tired of
air-conditioned malls, of stores selling nice, predictable, sensible
clothes, of careful pedestrianised enclaves and conservation areas full of
manufactured charm - take heart, all is not lost, writes Lucia van der Post.
In the run-down corners of London, markets still flourish, chaos reigns and
the dead hand of the urban planner seems far away. Here, where the natural
vitality of the market-place is allowed to flourish, shopping becomes more
than just a serious search for life's necessities, it becomes a journey into
the heart of a local community.
Markets offer more fun, better value and, most magically of all, they offer
risk which does wonders for the adrenalin.
You could (easily) pay more than is sensible or wise for a dodgy vase or you
could find the perfect grubby picture that gives pleasure for the rest of
your life. You simply never know. That is what markets are all about.
They are a lucky dip, a chance to savour a bantering, more robust way of
doing commerce. They also offer some of the best free entertainment there
is. Listen to the barrow-boy trying to flog his flagging fuschias, take in
the whelk-man at his stall selling his wares, spare a thought for the old
woman trading cabbages just as she has done for the last 30 years.
There are markets of every sort - from the best-known, such as Portobello
(so big and famous that foreigners who can muster scarcely a word of
English, mutter it like a mantra as they pour into town) to small ones,
scarcely worth crossing town for, but a part of the lives of those who live
there.
Some, such as Berwick Street and Whitecross Street, Leather Lane, Lower
Marsh and Strutton Ground are really lunchtime markets, a boon to those who
live and work in those areas.
Others sell a broader range of goods and draw in customers from far and
wide. So if you feel that shopping is not what it used to be head for your
nearest market.
There are bargains to be found and fun to be had.
Portobello Market, Portobello Road, London W11.
Saturdays from 7 am to 5.30 pm. Okay, so everyone has heard of it, that does
not mean there are no bargains left. You do not have to buy a piece of
fragile porcelain at Pounds 800 - keep your eyes skinned and you are bound
to see something you like for a price you can afford.
According to a young fashion student friend it still has some of the best
secondhand clothes in London. Recently, she found someone selling the entire
contents of a fine 1920s wardrobe. Then there is Sold Out - one of the many
shops which are almost as much of a draw as the market itself - which not
only sells secondhand clothes but regenerates them, fashioning old things
into some new and wonderful.
There are lots of specialist shops selling everything from jewellery,
antique glass, antiquarian books and pictures to old kitchen equipment
textiles and toys. Still crowded, still great fun and, although more
expensive than Bermondsey, its traders, too, have been feeling the pinch and
so prices are more negotiable than ever.
New Caledonian Market, Bermondsey, SE1.
Fridays from 7 am to 5 pm. This is where the serious seeker of bargains in
furniture, ceramics, silver and other household items heads for. This is
mainly a dealers market and what you see there today may well appear
tomorrow in Fulham Road or Camden Passage.
You have to be serious because if you aim for a proper bargain you need to
be there well before light. Customers say (although I have never made it
myself) that serious trading starts from 3 am onwards. Anything before 6 am
is probably quite serious enough for most of us. After that some dealer has
probably seen it and discounted it.
Anyone wanting to furnish a house will probably find Bermondsey the cheapest
way to do it well but it requires persistence and a good eye as well as the
temperament to enjoy the chase and the bargaining.
Church Street, NW8.
Tuesdays to Saturdays, 9 am to 5 pm. One of my favourites this. Alfies
Antique market at 13-25 is where I go if in need of a special present -
jewellery of all sorts from Miriam Haskell and Schiaparelli to fantasy
pieces from the 1950s, old, proper leather and crocodile shoes and handbags,
old-fashioned luggage and other small pieces. Recently, prices have been
good. The rest of Church street has other antiques and a dealer specialising
in rugs and carpets. The Gallery of Antique Costumes and Textiles is one of
the best old textile shops in London - go for old curtains, pelmets, quilts,
embroideries and some wonderful old clothes. Camden Lock, Commercial Place,
off Camden High Street, NW1.
Saturday and Sunday 10 am to 6 pm. Although many surrounding shops are open
during the week, the place comes to life at weekends when most of London's
under-30s seems to be crammed together either to buy or to sell. The
Electric Ballroom is a covered market where on Sundays you will find lots of
little stalls manned by the young. They are often people who take a stall
once a week and sell what they have made during the week - anything from
jewellery to handmade candles, hand-knitted sweaters, kitschy candlesticks,
printed scarves or silverware. If you ever have it in mind to commission
something special, this is a good place to check out the work of a whole
host of craftspeople. No need to starve here - food stalls are everywhere
and eating seems to be a full-time occupation - if it is not samosas, it is
kebabs and if it is not kebabs it is quiche or hot soup.
The surrounding shops are mostly fun, too, although getting posher by the
day. Greenwich Market, corner of Greenwich High Road and Stockwell Street,
SE10.
9 am - 6 pm Saturday and Sunday. Nothing grand or posh (although the special
indoor market is filled with rather respectable things like pots of jam,
scented candles, pot-pourri) but lots of stalls filled with things like old
records, coins, bric-a-brac as well as smaller items of furniture.
A young fashion student at the Royal College of Art, tells me that this is
where she comes to buy the second-hand clothes she collects. 'You probably
won't find anything earlier than the 50s but I buy here a lot because I'm
basing my own collection on second-hand clothes. In the past few weeks I've
bought a Jackie Onassis-style day dress for about Pounds 8 and a blouse
probably originally put together in the 1970s from 1920s scarves for Pounds
4.' She thinks prices are definitely more reasonable than in the central
London markets.
Columbia Road, E2. Sundays from 8 am to 12.30 pm. Sundays are when this
normally unassuming little East End road comes to life. It is where you go
for anything and everything horticultural, from big bunches of daffs (I
bought 16 bunches for Pounds 2 last Sunday) to bedding plants, packets of
seeds, herbs and all manner of indoor and outdoor plants. It is so busy you
need to push your way through the crowds but it is all well worth the
effort. Prices are around 40 per cent less than you would find elsewhere and
it is a lot of fun.
The little shops on either side of the market are well worth exploring. They
are old-fashioned in the sense that they reflect the tastes and interests of
the individuals rather than the safe and sensible principles of some central
buying office.
They tend to verge on the quirky and unpredictable. Idonia van der Bijl at
122 sells an eclectic mix of goods that have caught her eye - anything from
Indonesian steel baskets to mirrors from Rajasthan and hand-painted pottery
from Devon. Next door at Ukwenza are hand-made steel model toys (windmills,
bicycles) typical of work from South African townships. Angela Flanders'
Aromatics at No. 96, sells fragrant burning oils, pot pourris and boxes of
plain creamy candles in every size.
On a horticutural theme again there are several shops, all within a stone's
throw of each other, selling inexpensive pots and cache-pots of every size
and colour - plain terracotta, plain glazed (13 in by 10 in for Pounds 14)
or elaborately hand-painted or decorated.
Nearby are Brick Lane and Petticoat Lane - which also seem to come alive
chiefly on Sundays. Brick Lane is the place for cheap t-shirts, clothes,
electrical appliances (do not expect a guarantee), tinned food, cheap
crockery and household goods. In spite of a huge infusion of Bengalis these
markets still retain something of an authentic down-at-heel working-class
market. Some of the things sold are so depressing you wonder that anybody
could need, let alone want, them.
But, even if you do not find a bargain, you can console yourself by feasting
for well under Pounds 5 at one of the many Bengali restaurants in the area.
Lots of gaudy Bengali sweet shops and even a Bel Phoori (South Indian)
restaurant. A few bits of bric-a-brac as well. Do not miss Beigel Bake, at
195 - 15 bagels for Pounds 2 and open 24 hours a day (except for Jewish
holidays). It is busy all night nourishing cabbies, disco kids and
late-night shift workers.
Leadenhall Market, off Gracechurch Street and Leadenhall Street, EC3.
Old-established it may be, cheap it is not. Here, surrounded by hot-shot
laywers, city slickers and affluent bankers, are sold fine salmon, trout,
mallard, grouse, oysters, crab, fruit and veg, in and out of season. They go
for the kind of price traders know they can get. At Ashby's ask for their
own sausages.
New Covent Garden, Nine Elms Lane, SW8.
Monday to Friday, 4 am to 11 am. Saturdays as well in summer. Modern, rather
like a vast warehouse and, in spite of the authentically rough and ready
traders, lacking real atmosphere. However, the flower halls when filled with
the sweet smells and bright colours of vast buckets and trestles of flowers
is heady stuff. Not as cheap as you would expect. You have to buy in bulk -
exhausting to visit often but well worth it for a wedding, a party or a
special occasion.
Brixton Market, Electric Avenue, Atlantic Road, Brixton Station Road, SW9.
Monday to Saturday, 8.30 to 5.30 pm (closed Wednesday afternoons). Very
colourful fruit, vegetable, fish and meat market. Well worth a visit for the
liveliness contributed by the West Indian community. To the sound of Bob
Marley records, they find the essentials that remind them of their Caribbean
roots. Foodies make the journey for fresh whole fish, sweet potatoes, yams,
green bananas and lots more.
Shepherds' Bush, between Uxbridge Road and Goldhawk Road, W12.
Open from 8.30 am to 6 pm, Tuesdays to Saturdays. Primarily a food market,
it is really worth visiting because of its exotica, one of the most
cosmopolitan of all the food markets in London. Jostling round the stalls
are Arabs, Indians, Cockneys, Africans, Jamaicans and Kensington yuppies
which means you can buy anything from a plantain to a piece of African
fabric, proper patna rice or a beaded Indian curtain.

DESPITE the recent renaissance of the British chef/restaurateur London can
still boast some gastronomic outposts which combine a sense of history and
good British food. For the quintessential fish and chips, Grahame's Seafare
W1, The Sea Shell NW1 and Brady's SW18. For the true lover of eels, any
fashion, FE Cooke E18. For simple roast meat, often the most difficult dish
in any restaurant, Simpsons in-the-Strand WC2. For game, Rules in Covent
Garden, WC2. For its beef cobbler, The Goring Hotel, SW1 and, for
traditional British puddings, Gilbert's SW7 and The Greenhouse W1. Two
personal favourites are Wilton's, W1, and for supper pre- or post-theatre,
The Upstairs Bar at the Savoy Hotel, WC2.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Dining room with a view - Le Pont de la Tour
near Tower Bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF COURSE you should visit Le Pont de La Tour. Its position on the south
bank of the Thames, beside Tower Bridge, should be sufficient attraction for
any proud Londoner or visitor to the capital.
The approach, from the north bank of the river, is captivating. On my first
visit, the Tower was spotlit. Just walking across the bridge is a boost to
the appetite.
But the conversion of Butler's Wharf, a former tea warehouse, into flats,
offices and a substantial restaurant hides more than appears. The complex
almost encapsulates London's present financial and transport difficulties.
Its conversion preoccupied Sir Terence Conran from the mid-1980s.
Unfortunately, even his copious talents could not buck the financial and
property markets: Butlers Wharf Ltd, the property company which has
developed the site, went into administrative receivership, following
London's property slump. Outline plans for the rest of Butler's Wharf, which
include cafes and a small hotel, remain a memorial to the optimism of the
late 1980s.
And London itself has done little to add substance to Conran's vision.
Butler's Wharf is badly served by public transport. Car parking, although
cheap and adjacent, is hard to reach. Pont de la Tour has been trying to get
its own stop on the underused Thames riverbus service - the simplest, and
most environmentally sound solution to the transport problem in this area -
for some time, without success.
Yet it is not as if London has so many first-class eating establishments -
and Le Pont de la Tour created 120 new jobs in the middle of a recession -
that the city can afford to be so indifferent.
And though Pont de la Tour boasts a restaurant seating 104, a 65-seater bar
and grill, and a private dining room for 20, it also offers a wine shop
which a leading wine merchant describes as 'a delight' (I bumped into him,
lunching with his supplier from Alsace), and a food shop where you can buy
wonderful bread baked on the premises.
But you should not visit Pont de la Tour with too high expectations of the
food.
So much thought and effort has gone into the restaurant design, its wines,
its bread and improving its service (shaky at the beginning), that its
cooking has been left behind.
I have not eaten badly there - just not as well as I expected and the prices
suggest. Two renditions of crab mayonnaise were bland; the fish soup was
anaemic; a herring salad was amateurish. Two other starters, Piedmontese
peppers and a tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad, lacked bite and flavour.
Main courses provided a little more excitement. The roast sea bass was fine,
but the cod portion was small - even for our recessionary times. A grilled
Dover sole was burnt on one side. Chicken and rabbit dishes lacked
conviction, and the calves liver was over-cooked. The star was the pastry
section. The three desserts - lemon tart, a chocolate cake and creme brulee
 -were first class, although the waitress tried to spoil their flavours by
serving coffee first, American-style.
The problem faced by the Pont de la Tour kitchen is that it is being asked
to do too much too often. Preparing large quantities of shellfish (the
'plateau de fruits de mer' is excellent) requires a great deal of careful
preparation before the restaurant doors open. Selections from the menu then
demand a wide range of very rapid cooking techniques, particularly for the
grills. At the same time, some dishes need long, slow cooking - the osso
buco Milanese, for example. To do just one of these styles of cooking
spectacularly well requires great skill - but the Pont de la Tour now serves
2,000 customers a week.
Still only in its sixth month of business, the restaurant is serving so many
customers not only because of its attractive location, but also because it
is responding to rising fixed costs with longer opening hours. It offers
lunch and dinner seven days a week; last orders are not until midnight. This
gives the kitchen little pause for thought and reflection.
The situation will scarcely improve as summer approaches and the restaurant
adds 100 to the seating capacity with tables outside.
Sir Terence Conran has equipped the restaurant with an experienced
management team which should overcome its problems with time. And for anyone
with a sense of history and an interest in the best wines of the world at
fair prices, Au Pont de La Tour is worth a visit.
Le Pont de la Tour, Butler's Wharf, London SE1. Tel: 071-403-8403. Bar,
Pounds 20 for three courses; restaurant set lunch, Pounds 21.50; dinner,
Pounds 35 plus wine and 15 per cent service. Access and Visa cards only.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Cookery: The licenced Lenten binge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW is Mother's Day, a commercial bonanza spawned by the gift and
greeting card trades to take over from what was once celebrated as Mothering
Sunday.
In medieval Britain, Mothering Sunday was a day when the Christian faithful
flocked to their 'mother' church, the cathedral of their diocese for special
services.
Later, Mothering Sunday celebrated human as well as spiritual aspects of
motherhood. It became the day on which servants were released from domestic
service to go home to their families. The young women took cakes to their
mothers which were baked in their employers' kitchens using fine ingredients
from the larder.
Mothering Sunday falls on the fourth Sunday of lent, mid-lent Sunday or
Refreshment Sunday as it is also called. This was the day on which the
lenten fast was lifted briefly. Time for a mini binge. The little feast came
as a welcome reward to lenten penitents. Also the relaxation of the fast
conveniently allowed use to be made of the eggs, cream and other fresh
produce that had accumulated since the beginning of lent.
Simnel cake, rich with fruits and heavily marzipanned, was a favourite
choice for daughters to bake and take home. Very practical: it was solid,
easily portable, and once the ingredients were baked the cake would keep
until Easter Day.
I am afraid I do not care for marzipan, not even the real home-made stuff.
In fact, I am generally not much of a cake eater. So, perversely, I offer a
couple of pudding suggestions instead.
OAT AND ALMOND TREACLE TART (serves 8)
A modern twist on an old favourite, this should appeal to today's trendy
young wholewheat society. The filling is as chewy as muesli and the
sweetness of the syrup is sharpened by a generous dash of lemon.
Shortcrust pastry made with 6 oz flour (preferably half wholewheat and half
plain white flour); 4 oz porridge oats; 2 1/2 oz flaked almonds; the finely
grated zest of 2 lemons and the juice of 1 lemon; 1 x 1 lb tin of golden
syrup.
Use the pastry to line a deep 8-in flan tin, fluted or plain. Blind bake it
until well cooked and crisp. This is important, particularly if you do not
plan to eat the whole of the tart at one sitting. Few things are sadder than
a soggy - bottomed tart with pastry which collapses as you serve it.
Crush the almonds with your fingers to break them up a little, then mix them
with the porridge oats and lemon zest.
Tip the golden syrup into the top part of a double boiler. Place over
simmering water and heat until the syrup is warm and runny. Add the lemon
juice, stir and warm again briefly.
Away from the heat tip the oat and almond mixture into the syrup and stir
vigorously for at least one minute to mix everything well.
Turn the filling into the prepared pastry case, levelling it gently. Slip it
onto a pre-heated baking sheet and cook at 350`F-375`F (180`C-190`C) gas
mark 4-5 for 40-45 minutes or until deep golden and set.
Serve tepid or cold, alone, with cream or with a bowl of lemon syllabub as
sauce.
ENGLISH CUSTARD PIE (serves 8-10)
This, on the other hand is decidedly old fashioned, the kind of very rich
pudding that was made with gay abandon in those happy bygone days before the
word cholesterol had entered common parlance. It is the sort of pie that
clowns might have chucked at one another (whence the expression 'egg on your
face', maybe) but it is far too good to waste on pranks - a pie to savour
occasionally in slow and appreciative mouthfuls.
Shortcrust pastry made with 8 oz flour; 6 eggs;  3/4 pt single cream; 1 1/2
 2 oz sugar (cubes for preference, granulated will do); 2 oranges; 1/2
teaspoon cornflour; 1 teaspoon triple distilled orange blossom water; whole
nutmeg or ground cinnamon.
Use the pastry to line a deep 9 1/2 -10in flan tin, fluted or plain, and
blind bake it until well cooked and crisp. Be sure to cook it very
thoroughly and do it well ahead as the crust is best baked at fairly high
heat, whereas the filling needs to be cooked at a very gentle temperature or
the texture of the custard will be spoiled by bubbles and the taste will be
eggy instead of delicately creamy and silky smooth.
Rub the sugar cubes over the oranges to pick up the fragrant oils from the
skin (or grate the orange zest and whizz it with the granulated sugar in a
coffee or spice mill). Then crush with a fork and cream together until
smooth the orange-scented sugar, cornflour and orange blossom water.
Scald the cream and pour it onto the sugar mixture. Stir well until the
sugar is melted. Then mix the sweetened cream into the lightly beaten eggs,
pouring the liquid in a thin stream and beating the eggs with a wire whisk
all the while.
Pour the creamy concoction into the pastry case and bake at 275`F-300```F
(140`C-150`C) gas mark 1-2 for 45 minutes or until set.
Dust the top of the pie lavishly with freshly grated nutmeg or ground
cinnamon as soon as it emerges from the oven, and cool to tepid, or leave to
become completely cold before serving.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Top vintners go underground - Why London is
the focus for the world's wine trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON TUESDAY Henri Jayer, the most famous winemaker in Burgundy, will be
celebrating his 70th birthday at a smart French restaurant. Nothing
remarkable in that, perhaps, except that the restaurant he has chosen is not
in Saulieu, Chagny or even Paris. It is Le Gavroche in London.
Last Monday the most influential man in the Medoc, Jean-Michel Cazes,
trekked across the Channel to convince Sotheby's customers of the worth of
his wines.
On Thursday it was the turn of Christian de Billy of Champagne Pol Roger,
while two of Germany's best-rated wine producers, Ernst Loosen and
(Gunderloch's) Fritz Hasselbach, have been buzzing around London all week.
To the busier bees of the wine world, London is the honey pot. Only Germany
imports more wine in total than the UK (950m litres of wine in 1990 to the
UK's 640m) but most of it is pretty basic stuff. And Britain, as well as
being the prime market for good quality bordeaux, burgundy, Loire, sherry,
port and antipodean wines, has just one obvious centre of connoisseurship,
London.
Words have to be chosen carefully here because London cannot claim a
monopoly on Britain's top quality wine merchants. East Anglia and Edinburgh
have more than their fair share of first-rate vintners, but most wine
activity takes place in the capital.
This sort of slurping and spitting is at its most obvious at the tastings,
lunches and dinners that the wine world takes so much for granted.
The London Wine Trade Diary is crammed with these godsends for the thirsty,
sometimes as many as seven a day in the high seasons of early summer and
autumn (although in August it is blank).
The Diary, aimed at preventing the most frustrating clashes, is kept by the
Wine Promotion Board in offices next door to Vintners' Hall in Vintry Ward,
the medieval wine quarter of the City of London. Only wool was traded more
than wine when the king of England was also king of Aquitaine.
The wine trade moved gradually east and west of Southwark Bridge. And
nowadays the international conglomerates soused in wine have decamped from
London altogether to bottling plants and bonded warehouses in places such as
Worksop and Southampton.
But subterranean London is still shaped by its wine trade history. Below the
pavement, much of St James's is or was a wine cellar. The Stafford Hotel in
St James's Place has particularly atmospheric cellars which can be hired for
anything from a serious wine tasting to a teetotal reception.
Ultra-traditional wine merchants Justerini &amp; Brooks and Berry Bros &amp; Rudd,
both still employing cellar staff, face each other across St James's Street,
their landmark premises signalling very obviously which was founded in 1749
and which in the 17th century.
Berry Bros in particular, with its bare boards, mostly bare shelves, ledgers
and Beau Brummel's weight records is worth a place on the least bibulous
tourist's London itinerary.
On particularly busy days in the Wine Trade Diary a network of inter-tasting
tunnels would be useful, for there are more cellars, in varying stages of
their working life, around Trafalgar Square, the City and, typically, in
dank railway arches, notably around Tooley Street just south of London
Bridge.
One of these rattling, tenebrous warehouses, Trapps, houses the 'cellars' of
thousands of wine collectors, some as far afield as Hong Kong and San
Francisco, as well as the constantly changing stocks of the auction houses
Christie's and Sotheby's which have been crucial in maintaining London's
supremacy in the wine world.
Christie's has fine wine sales on April 6 in the City at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants 11 Copthall Avenue, EC2 and on April 9 and 16 in King
Street, SW1. Sotheby's main April sale is on the 8th at New Bond Street W1.
James Christie's very first sale in 1766 included 'a large Quantity of
Madeira and high Flavour'd Claret' and the dominant wine auctioneer would by
now have 225 years of continuous wine sales under its gavel were it not for
restrictions on auctions after the second world war.
Today, if first-growth Bordeaux chateau owners want to send a ripple of
their claret round the world of wine, they are most likely to begin it in
London, either by organising a high-profile auction of some particularly
rare older vintages, or with a tasting or dinner.
The sadness for many of us is that we are too busy justifying our place on
the invitation list to take full advantage of every glass available. My
dream is a retirement not so complete that the invitations stop.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: A l'anglaise? Not in this city - A look at
the London restaurant scene for the best of British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 2.15pm four American tourists sit down at one of the communal dining
tables in Sweetings, the 100-year-old City restaurant. In deep southern
accents they order from an Italian waiter pints of Irish stout in silver
tankards and traditional British seafood - fish pie, salmon fishcakes and
smoked haddock with poached egg - which comes up from the kitchen on a
Dickensian 'dumb waiter'.
In the East End, just around the corner from a large mosque, in a former
synagogue hall is the Kosher Luncheon Club (instant membership 50p). This is
the last in the line of soup kitchens established in the 18th century to
feed a wave of Jewish refugees. Now with waitress service the food is
excellent and just as filling: bean and barley soup, fried fish and lokshen
pudding all for Pounds 9.
London is full of such gastronomic variety. A political safe haven, it
boasts German, Polish, Czech and Afghan restaurants; as a major port it
allowed Chinese sailors to jump ship and open their own restaurants in what
is now Docklands; as the centre of the British Empire it attracted cooks
specialising in the dishes of most Indian and Pakistani regions. There is
even an Australian restaurant. The oil crisis of the early 1970s was
wonderful news for lovers of Middle Eastern cuisine and at one time the
Fakhreldine, a Lebanese restaurant on Piccadilly was busier than Langan's,
London's most successful post-war restaurant.
During and after the 1950s came Italians, Spaniards and the French came
initially to work in the big hotels. It was however, not long before they
had opened their own trattorias and bistros as foreign holidays made foreign
food acceptable to the British. In the 1970s London was introduced to the
American hamburger and the Japanese sushi bar as the Japanese made London
their European business capital.
Is there is a nationality missing? Only one of significance. Where is the
British input into the London restaurant world?
Sadly, absent until late. For the past 150 years we have been only too
willing to abandon our culinary highspots to the good and the great so long
as they come from overseas: Alexis Soyer at the Reform Club; Auguste
Escoffier at the Ritz; Silvano Trompetto at the Savoy; and most recently,
the Roux brothers at Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn.
But London has not made life easy for the restaurateur, whatever the
nationality. It is a hard profession but in the capital it requires almost a
streak of masochism. Take the case of one of the city's most successful
restaurants which, in spite of the recession, is looking to expand. It would
like to take over two adjacent shops, create an extra 20 jobs, spend Pounds
200,000 on capital works and risk a further Pounds 10,000 on its planning
application. It has, however, been told that it has little chance of success
 -the council will not condone a restaurant in place of a retail outlet.
It is part of a small restaurant empire which employs 90 in total and is
owned by a quintet of British managers and chefs. So too are almost all the
most currently successful London restaurants.
These restaurants have not only created a new social class in London - at
last, the esteemed British chef and restaurateur - but also threaten the
supremacy of their French counterparts. Today, London's top French
restaurants - L'Arlequin, Chez Nico, Le Gavroche and Tante Claire - find
their customers wanting to eat more simply and drink less expensive wine.
They are also beginning to lose customers to other rivals, hotel dining
rooms, where income from bedrooms can be used to bolster thin food profit
margins.
At the turn of the century London's leading restaurant writer, Colonel
Newnham-Davis, of the Pall Mall Gazette, ate most of his memorable meals -
seven courses and champagne - with a bill for two of under Pounds 3, at
Claridges, the Ritz, the Savoy or the Hyde Park. Their fame still lingers,
but today the most exciting food in London's hotels is to be found in places
which did not exist 100 years ago. Try Philip Britten's cooking at the

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: The right side of the tracks - The
importance of neighbourhood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE THE Prime Minister, I am part of London's most significant ethnic
minority - those who were born and brought up in the capital - and maybe
even still live there. We are the sort of people who can remember horses at
Alexandra Palace, dogs at Harringay, and success for Chelsea Football Club.
It is an increasingly rare distinction.
Like many Londoners, I live close to where I grew up - just a mile from
where my parents' three-storey terraced house stood, off Wood Green High
Road. The dominant feature of the area is north London's most distinctive
land mark, Alexandra Palace, surrounded by 1100 acres of parkland. From here
you can see the best and most complete view of London anywhere in the
capital. And the view that is offered from the top of the long winding hill
to the palace is not just a pretty skyline. It is a revelation of what is
happening to the city.
From the top of Ally Pally you can see two completely different Londons.
Ironically the line of division is the railway track that takes City
commuters to and from Hertfordshire's dormitory suburbs. Crossing the tracks
by the narrow railway footbridge is literally a transition from one social
and economic world to another.
To the north and west, on the right side of the tracks lies the place I now
live - civilised, comfortable, affluent Muswell Hill, a suburb of
irreproachable solid Edwardian semis, only occasionally afflicted by
subsidence. The people who live at the top of the hill are mostly white
families with au pairs, second homes and terminal angst over the tax breaks
they enjoy under the Tories.
Its major celebrity is the actress Maureen Lipmann, now famous for her
portrayal of Beattie, the Jewish housewife in BT commercials; its bard is
Ray Davies of the Kinks - and the nearest thing to a scandal is catching
sight of local girl Mandy Smith, former teenage wife of the ageing rocker
Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones. Muswell Hill has been a model to all
suburbia for decades.
To the south and east is a different world, the place I came from: Wood
Green and Tottenham. Up to 40 per cent here are non-white. The area is poor
and crime-ridden. This is home to the underclass. Up to a fifth are lone
parents, poverty is rife, in some parts a half of the residents are on state
benefits. Among young black men unemployment rates are above one in three.
Tottenham's best known feature is the bleak concrete structure called
Broadwater Farm. First famous in the 1960s as a design triumph in public
housing, it became notorious in the mid-1980s as the site of the decade's
most vicious and prolonged riot on the British mainland, during which a
London police constable died, in full view of his colleagues, virtually
decapitated by a mob.
The celebrities here are fewer and far more obscure. Sam Fox, the raunchy
singer and sometime Page Three girl came from that side of the tracks, as do
several black rappers with names like Rebel MC and Ranking Errol. I would
explain what these names mean, except that they are meant to be
indecipherable to a non-black audience - this is a world with its own
private language designed to exclude those such as FT readers.
The west fears the east. We 'know' this is where the people who steal our
expensive car stereos and burgle our homes are from. The local police tell
us that drugs are on the streets of Muswell Hill, and hint that they come
from the other side of the park.
The east envies and despises the west, which it thinks of as soft,
privileged and out of touch with the 'real' world. My burglar friends say
that the 'fat' houses on my side of the park deserve everything they get.
Social division is not peculiar to this city or this area. But what is
disturbing is that the traditional valve for tension - social mobility  -
has disappeared for many Londoners.
If they have any advantage, cities offer the poor the chance to better their
station in life - to find work, promotion, to escape the condition into
which you were born. To many young men and women in London, crossing the
railroad tracks now seems to have become an impossibility.
One reason is the state of London's education system. Few would pine for the
old grammar school system now, but for the poor a good school was a way up
and out. The primary school which served me well is just ten minutes walk
from my present home, and 200 yards from my childhood house. I have no
reason to suppose that the teachers are any less dedicated than the
outstanding women who taught me to read.
However, like most schools in the borough, it was unable to guarantee my
elder daughter uninterrupted schooling, because of teacher shortages and, at
the time, industrial action. As a result both of my children attend school
elsewhere, on the right side of the tracks. The proportion of children in
private education has doubled in the past 10 years - and in north London a
good primary can take its pick of children from literally hundreds of
applicants.
The children who have no choice will be under-educated and unable to
compete. They will also contribute to London's lamentable skill shortage.
A second is that the traditional vitality which immigrants bring to cities
is increasingly vitiated by recession and by prejudice. The city itself
exists side by side with Spitalfields, a largely Bangladeshi quarter. A
survey by the South Bank Polytechnic revealed that not a single Bangladeshi
from Spitalfields worked in the City.
My local baker, a Moroccan, is popular and does a roaring trade at weekends
among the people from the top of the hill. Yet his bank is less than
forthcoming with support - a complaint shared by many minority businessmen.
He finds it hard to attract the kind of young low-paid shop assistants he
needs. He is too nice to say it, but white-run businesses seem to have
little difficulty in these times of high unemployment.
But there is always the park itself. In a great city's public spaces no-one
asks where you come from. Children meet on the slides and swings as equals.
Alexandra Palace, like Wandsworth Common, Clapham Common and the capital's
other great parks are great levellers and buffers.
But, characteristically for London, this too is under threat. In 1980, after
much of the Palace burnt down, it received a huge insurance windfall of more
than Pounds 40m which could have transformed it into a major regional
leisure attraction. A combination of poor management and profligacy by the
local council, Haringey, has resulted in the windfall being squandered and a
debt of Pounds 35m.
Many fear that in order to pay the debt the Palace will have to do what it
did in 1905 - sell off valuable acreage for housing development.
If it does so, the distance between the two sides of the tracks will in one
sense become smaller; but there is no sign that the gulf between the
communities will be any closer to being bridged.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Just a walk on the mild, wild side - Antony
Thorncroft knows a place where you can pretend to be Carmen Miranda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE life in London after dark? On the surface it is doubtful; by
midnight, the Tube is creaking to a halt, waiters and barmen are reaching
for their coats and the streets are emptying. Below the surface, though, the
lively young - and not so young - are preparing for a good time.
Here is a partial guide for those who have had enough of London's obvious
evening dramas - the theatre, and confronting a restaurant bill - and fancy
a walk on the mild, wild side.
The buzz word is clubs. London clubs, from the anonymous palazzos in Pall
Mall to the latest disco, are discreet - but not exclusive. The recession
has opened many doors. The most elusively exclusive are the peripatetic
disco clubs, which scratch their presence on lamp post and walls with a code
sign letting the elite know time and place. The secret usually gets out and
the clubs become fixed weekly or monthly events.
The most celebrated at present is Kinky Gerlinky, where you are encouraged
to dress to your fantasies, especially if you are a man who would prefer to
be Carmen Miranda. The club attracts drag queens by the score but is by no
means gay; rather, a happy meeting of poseurs and voyeurs.
Kinky Gerlinky has hit the spot so squarely that it surfaces monthly at
London's largest - and, until now, least trendy - disco, the Empire in
Leicester Square. Whether it can remain a cult in such a public place is
doubtful.
There are clubs which stay rooted. Gaunt Road at the Elephant and Castle is
probably the most boring one-way street in London during the day. But pop
down around 3 am on Saturdays and Sundays and it becomes wonderland. For
hidden inside a disused warehouse is Ministry of Sound. It is all of six
months old but still just about smart: London's answer to the legendary
Paradise Garage in New York.
This is strictly a place for dancing, for straight-down-the-middle house
music, although there is a video lounge and (very New York), a VIP room. The
owners, bright young men from the City, reckon the sound system the best in
the land and none of the 1,500 people enjoying their private nirvana on the
dance floor seemed to disagree.
Ministry of Sound is an alcohol-free zone, except for vodka and tequila
flavoured jelloes. The brooding bouncers, who will search you for drugs, do
not look kindly on groups of young men, but generally there is a relaxed
door policy, although you will have to join the club.
North of the river, under Westway, is Subterrania, a club which makes a
virtue out of variety. Each night, there is a different feel. You could
catch the Songwriters' Network, young singer-songwriters trying out new
material backed by top session musicians; or a disco handled by the latest
hot-mixer, Jeremy Healey; or even a hit band, like Shakespear's Sister,
paying homage to its roots. This is a relaxed, laid-back kind of place,
where you need not starve or die of thirst.
Both Ministry of Sound and Subterrania would be surprised to see tourists,
but they are commercial enough to cope. There are clubs, like Wag in Wardour
Street and Milk Bar in Charing Cross Road, where you have to convince the
bouncers that you have the right attitude - sometimes a difficult trick if
you have queued for a couple of hours.
Heaven at Charing Cross is still the main haunt for gays. Other clubs, like
Quiet Storm at Ormonds in Mayfair on Friday nights, probably need
sounding-out during the day. This is very hot at present, with a disco
downstairs and a quieter space upstairs for backgammon. It appeals to that
ageing generation, convinced by their aching bodies that they are bored with
disco sounds, who really just want a club where they can meet friends and
have a quiet snack and drink in the early hours.
This move towards late-night private clubs (which can be relaxed when
strangers drop in) is concentrated in the Notting Hill Gate district where
Beach Blanket Babylon, the Globe, and 192 Kensington Park Road attract media
types and theatricals.
The main discos for visitors in London are the Hippodrome, Limelight and the
Empire Ballroom, all within hip-hop distance of Leicester Square. Nearby, in
Charing Cross Road, is another large dance space, the Astoria, which
attracts a tougher-looking crowd into heavier metallic music. If you can
take the pressure, the customers are considerably more interesting. All
these open, and close, earlier than the hippier clubs.
But what if you think dancing is a bore? Are there no alternatives? Yes,
alternative comedy. The past few years have seen a flowering of comedy clubs
in the capital.
They are often based over a pub and provide much of the camaraderie of a
good pub, plus licensing extensions into the early hours and the chance to
catch the acts of younger, irreverent comedians. Even when they have
progressed to television stardom, many - such as Josie Lawrence, Paul
Merton, Sean Hughes and Jack Dee - still work the circuit regularly.
The Comedy Store in Leicester Square is the most sophisticated venue but
there is, perhaps, more fun at Jongleurs in Clapham, south London, or the
T&amp;C 2 at Highbury Corner, north of the river.
The routine is the same: a succession of, say, four comedians chosen
(ideally) because one is a ballsy woman, one political, one deadpan and one
who thinks he is a Martian. The audience is experienced enough to reward
quality and to hammer pretension. Comedy clubs are as escapist as discos,
but much cheaper, and get the night over with before 2 am.
London after dark is something of a closed oyster for many visitors, but
persevere and you can turn up pearls. There is much to be said for heading
for a lively 'village' - Notting Hill, the Angel Islington, the Fulham Road
and Earl's Court are the best bets - and then flowing with the tide, taking
in the tapas bars (invariably providing Latin music), the pubs with
entertainment (anything from karaoke singalongs to punk) and the late-night
bars.
Acquire a copy of Time Out, the best listings magazine, which tells you
which clubs cater for house music or funk, for gays or rhythm and blues
freaks, and take an all-night bus map. The Tube might close early but, these
days, there is a network of all-night buses which will get you home to
Bromley before dawn.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: There is more to Soho than sex - Kieran
Cooke revisits Meard Street and finds it a sadder and emptier place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLAT was in Meard Street, Soho, above the Golden Girls' Club. The girls
were not so golden. They were rather beefy transvestites, mostly from
Newcastle. They would sit behind chicken netting in the window, tempting
potential clients. 'Any business, sir?' or 'Like a pleasant time, sir?' were
chants that would echo down the narrow street.
Once hooked, the clients - 'punters' to anyone in the sex business - would
get a good deal more than they bargained for. Their money would disappear
rapidly on sickly, make-believe champagne. There would often be fights. But
the 'girls' seemed a nice-enough lot. One gave me a big kiss as I came back
with the milk early one morning.
Modern Soho covers about 50 acres stretching from Leicester Square in the
south to Oxford Street in the north, Charing Cross Road in the east to
Regent Street in the west. Once, it was woodlands: the word Soho derives
from an ancient hunting call. But ever since it was settled in the 17th
century, it has had a reputation for behaviour that ranges from rather
roguish, bohemian and sometimes odd to downright lewd.
John Meard, a prominent Sohoite of the early 1700s who built the main body
of the street that bears his name, spent much of his time escaping the
clutches of his creditors. Among Meard's first tenants were an east European
harpsichord-maker, a future bishop of London, and Elizabeth Flint, who was
described as 'generally slut and drunkard and occasional whore and thief.'
One of the lease conditions of our flat was that the inhabitants should be
working on a film script of Ulysses or the Odyssey - no-one ever was quite
sure which. Soho Mary lived opposite. At 5 pm every day she would open her
ground-floor window and for 10 minutes launch a tirade of four-letter words
at people passing by, assisted by her dog which would bark beside her. Then
she would shut the window and go about her business.
We were forced out eventually. The Golden Girls went back to Newcastle or
moved to trade elsewhere. Soho Mary is no more. The man down the street who
made shoe trees and gave us offcuts of wood for the fire has gone. The sex
shop on the corner, run by an obese Maltese, has shut. Meard Street is now
thoroughly clean. Even the telephone box, always smeared with advertisements
for the most imaginative forms of bodily services, has been moved.
Soho has always been an area set apart from the rest of London. It is the
oldest immigrant sector of the city; Greek traders and the Huguenots,
victims of repression in France, were the area's first foreign settlers,
late in the 17th century. In 1739, one essayist wrote: 'Many parts of the
parish so greatly abound with French that it is an easy matter for a
stranger to imagine himself in France.'
Theodore, king of Corsica, was buried in 1756 in St Anne's church (only the
tower remains since its bombing in the second world war). Soho cast its
doubtful spell on Theodore, who had to give up his kingdom to his creditors.
More immigrants came to Soho over the years. In the 1860s and 1870s there
was an influx of Germans, Swiss and Italians. A few years later, large
numbers of Polish and Russian Jews moved in. But not until the 1960s did the
Chinese arrive in force; the south of Soho today is the capital's Chinatown
district.
In 1851, Soho had more than 17,000 inhabitants; today, there are only 4,000.
But influences from successive waves of immigration have remained.
We used to drink in either the old Dog and Duck pub on Frith Street or the
York Minster - now renamed The French House - on Dean Street. The latter was
the drinking venue for General de Gaulle and the Free French during the war.
It always had a curious clientele, ranging from puffy-faced retired boxers
to former striptease artistes.
Since the retirement of the patron, Gaston Berlemont - an imposing figure
with blue blazer and handlebar moustache - the 'French' has gone down
somewhat; it is now full, like everywhere else, of loud-talking youth who
'Yah, yah' at each other and drink American beers out of bottles. In
off-peak hours, though, the 'French' still has a certain risque atmosphere
and the restaurant upstairs is recommended.
Lust and lasciviousness started strutting down Soho's streets late in the
1950s and through the 1960s. The Windmill Theatre in Great Windmill Street
had the first British nude show. The girls had to stand completely still, in
poses like Roman statues. One attendant had the job of tightening the seats
worked loose as keen theatre-goers leap-frogged over the rows to gain a
closer view. Another attendant recalled that binoculars were not allowed.
'One old man came in wearing the thickest glasses you've ever seen. Fell
down in the foyer and broke his arm.'
Raymond's Revuebar in Soho has been offering 'the world's most erotic
striptease entertainment' for 35 years. Paul Raymond, the Revuebar's
founder, started his theatrical career with a mind-reading act; he now has a
considerable business empire based in Soho. As well as his clubs, he is one
of Soho's biggest landlords, and claims he publishes 70 per cent of what he
describes as the 'acceptable men's magazines' in Britain.
'They'll never make me Lord Raymond of Soho,' he says. 'But I do find
attitudes to sex in this country very strange.'
Soho sex is really very tame compared with that in Amsterdam or Bangkok. It
is also badly regulated.
An official clean-up operation, together with a better economic climate,
with more business enterprises moving into Soho, forced many of these
establishments out of business early in the 1980s. But with the recession,
sleaze is returning. The other day I noticed that the old fishmonger's shop
had become an 'erotic bed show' - about as exciting an act as being hit over
the head with a kipper.
With sleaze, though, there is at least life. Empty shop-fronts and office
blocks pose a greater danger to the character of old Soho. The Soho Society
is fighting to save the area's vitality but its head, Bryan Burrough, says
the lack of rent controls has caused enormous damage.
Many small restaurants have had to close. There has even been talk among the
Chinese community of moving Chinatown south of the river to Battersea, or
elsewhere. 'There have to be controls on rents and more controls on
office-building or else there will be only sterility and no life left in
Soho,' Burrough warns.
Despite this, he says that people who have lived in Soho are never quite the
same again. 'The other day, I had a letter from an old Chinese man who lived
here 30 years ago. 'Soho was where I belonged,' the letter said. 'Nowhere
has been the same since'.'
Soho still knocks the spots off anywhere else in London. But it's not quite
the same without our flat. There are no Golden Girls to watch any more.
These days, Meard Street goes to sleep early.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: A plum for foreign correspondents - As they
say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON does not rank high on European quality-of-life lists, but for foreign
correspondents it is a plum. Some offer surprising reasons: 'In Paris you
can have a flat or a flat,' says Patrick de Jacquelot of Les Echos. He lives
in a house in Hammersmith. 'You can be in the Chilterns, in lovely
countryside, in 40 minutes - impossible in Paris.' Reiner Gatermann of Die
Welt says the cultural life is almost too much to cope with.
Alfonso Sole supplies Spanish papers and radio stations with items from all
over the world. He has been in London for 21 years: 'London is not like the
concrete cities of Europe, it is green, you can have a garden.'
Gardens mean a lot, especially to the Latins. 'Only the super-rich have
gardens in Milan,' says Alessandro Merli of Il-Sole-24 Ore.'
He lived here as a bachelor and is now married with a small daughter. 'It is
much better to be married in London; in Milan, Barcelona or Buenos Aires be
a bachelor.'
One reason is the difficulty of meeting Londoners. Merli lives in South
Kensington and says there are none there anyway, but even if you do come
across them, 'they aren't interested. They can't stereotype foreigners so
they don't want to talk to you. Maybe it's better than in America where they
pretend to be interested in you for 30 seconds. Here nobody pretends. But
people leave you alone which is nice.'
Sole concurs: 'You do not have to show off, you can be yourself in London.'
Gatermann has been in Fulham for seven years, but only last Christmas did he
think he could invite the neighbours in for gluhwein. He had come from
Scandinavia so found the housing a bit of a disappointment, whereas the
Latins like it.
'Bad and getting worse' is the verdict on the worst aspect of London -
public transport. 'Even the metro in Madrid is air-conditioned, cheap and
efficient,' says Sole.
Taxi drivers are a bone of contention, 'They know where they are going,
which is amazing,' says Merli, but he objects to what he calls the laid-back
attitude. 'Only here have I missed aeroplanes because of slow taxis. If you
tell them you're in a hurry, they say, 'You should have left earlier'.'
Merli adds that the British will always queue even if there is no queue - 'a
taxi driver will avoid an empty lane and land up behind five cars at traffic
lights.' But de Jacquelot says it is better than in Paris, because 'you can
always get a cab and be at any appointment in ten or 15 minutes.'
But what about the news? De Jacquelot: 'When I arrived and people asked me
what I was expected to write about, I said, 'Everything except royalty,
sport and crime.' But in fact I've been writing more about crime than
anything else. It's fascinating.'
'Crime' means Maxwell, BCCI and City scams. There is universal agreement
that no other news centre anywhere provides such grand and colourful
stories. Yvonne Esterhazy of Handelsblatt says: 'Everything is so dramatic,
presented as a revolution. The City is full of rumours.'
She says City people are great to work with but British industry can leave
much to be desired. She had to fight to get a ticket to the recent British
Aerospace meeting. 'They are all right on the gin and tonics but people call
back long after your deadline.'
Spaniards do not like business stories, but Sole has no trouble selling them
from London because of their louche quality.
In Germany, British stories rate high. In Die Welt last Saturday there were
three: the Yorks, Scottish devolution and Richard Branson's tussle with
British Airways. Gatermann sees his job as giving a steady diet of UK news
but says the exotic turns up often enough to dominate the output.
For Merli, London offers a high profile at home: 'Many Italian deals are
done through London so I hear about them before they know anything in
Milan.'
Access to politicians is awful: 'They naturally care about readers in their
constituencies,' says Gatermann.
There are signs of improvement: for the first time this year a few
foreigners attended the briefing by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the
budget. Early in the election campaign, John Major gave an unprecedented
briefing for the foreign press - but it was declared off-the record and was,
therefore, useless.
The British addiction to secrecy grates on the foreign press corps.
Relations with officialdom resemble the old system in Eastern Europe rather
than a modern democracy: no access to civil servants, no individual
interviews with ministers - or even Glenda Jackson, the actress turned
Labour Party candidate.
And there are other disappointments: 'No indoor tennis courts,' says Merli.
But he learnt why quite quickly: he was playing in a park, the rain came
down but his was the only game to cease. 'Everybody else carried on; they
have endurance here. That's why they win wars.'

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Old barbers' shops by the boat load - A look
at a company selling antiques by the room full
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELEEN DE GRAAF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST MICHAEL'S Church nestles among old warehouses and workshops in
Shoreditch, an old furniture manufacturing district just north of the City
of London, Today, visitors to the church do not come to pray, but to worship
antiques.
They come to buy Victorian doorknobs, marble bathtubs, even complete
barbers' shops. The old Anglican church, built in 1865, has been home to the
The London Architectural Salvage and Supply Company (LASSCo) since the
company started up in 1978.
The church is filled with objects. By the entrance stands a cuirass; next to
it are four marble pillars. The collection can range from 19th century
firebacks to Victorian lamp posts, from bronze entrance doors to a capital
from London's Waterloo railway station.
'The rich will always be with us', says Tony Brook, director of LASSCo.
'Even in recession.' The foreign rich, especially - no bad thing, for the
state of the UK economy has brought the domestic antique market to the point
of collapse. LASSCo's international contacts help it survive. 'A lot of our
customers are foreign. We also have contacts with other dealers abroad, and
we travel ourselves to look for trade,' says Brook.
Even so business suffered: turnover fell from Pounds 850,000 in 1989 to
Pounds 450,000 in 1991. LASSCo cut staff from 12 to eight.
But, says Brook there have been benefits. 'Sales have dropped by 40 per
cent, but the prices we pay for our goods have gone down dramatically, while
our selling prices have stayed the same. Furthermore, the cost of
professional restorers' work has dropped, because of unemployment.'
Most of LASSCo's stock is bought from demolition sites; some comes from
people clearing out their sheds. Recently Brook followed an advertisement in
a local paper and bought a complete 1930s US barber's shop. The shop was
transported across the Atlantic and rebuilt in St Michael's.
Sales of timber make up 50 per cent of turnover. 'People want something
stylish and classic on their floors. Strange, though, that demand did not go
up until we started spending more time and energy on getting good floors,'
says Brook. Wood for the floors is imported from all over the world. LASSCo
also takes flooring from old houses.
The church contains small items for sale; but most customers have their own
projects, and come to browse. 'People designing their restaurants'
interiors, for instance. The obsession with style has survived the
recession.'
Some buy on impulse. 'A Japanese lady once fell in love with a complete 1890
chemist shop, and bought it for Pounds 16,000. But now it's in storage
because she can't think of a way to re-use it. In the end we might buy it
back,' says Brook.
The Japanese have taken over from Americans as LASSCo's most important
customers. 'In the begining they bought everything without a clue what to do
with it. Now they are learning to buy more carefully,' Brook says. 'But the
average Japanese buyer does not know whether to put it up or down.'
One Japanese company bought an arch from a synagogue for a discotheque.
'Because it did not fit properly, they cut a piece off each of the columns.
Of course that completely destroyed the whole thing.'
Brook is cautious about the Japanese hunger for antiques. 'We care about
what happens to our trade - often it is part of the English heritage.
Sometimes we really feel that some of our pieces should go to a museum, but
museums have no money, and we're no charity. But it's one reason we do not
always sell, and may ask a customer to leave.'
LASSCo can afford to do that. It has little competition in the UK; none at
all in London. 'About four years ago, when the market was at its peak, there
were a lot of people in the business,' says Brook. 'We called them
'runners'. They drove around in vans looking for old buildings which were
being demolished, so that they could buy stuff and sell it to us. They
started their own business wanting quick and easy money, but they didn't
realise what they had got themselves into: storage, repair, and sometimes
months or years of waiting before you sell an important piece. This
recession, like a good frost, killed them off.'

I HAVE a number of unit-linked retirement annuity policies with different
insurance companies under Section 226 ICTA 1970. The investment performance
of some of these policies is dismal compared with the others and I would
very much like to transfer the funds in the poorly performing policies into
the care and control of the insurance companies responsible for the better
performing policies.
Can this be done as a right in the absence of any contractual provisions to
the contrary in the policies applicable to the funds I would wish to
transfer?
Unfortunately, you will usually find it difficult, if not impossible, to
transfer from one 226 policy to another. Some insurance companies operate a
number of different unit funds within the same umbrella policy and allow
lateral transfers from one unit fund to another. It means doing the homework
of what other funds that particular insurance company has to offer.
At retirement you will normally be able to take the money from existing
policies and use it to buy an annuity with whoever may be giving a good rate
at that time.
On the broader issue, however, of getting money back from one insurance
company to pay to another, you are usually face a brick wall obstacle.
While there may be no solution for money paid in the past, there is a lot to
be said for putting new money into what is described as a self-administered
personal pension. This is written under trust and a bank has to be accepted
by the Inland Revenue as a provider. You can then choose whichever unit
funds or direct investments in shares you want and instruct your trustee to
sell the ones that are doing badly and invest the money elsewhere.
This has only been possible during the last few years and only a few
organisations are offering it. In due course we see this solution replacing
standard insurance policies for the majority of discriminating investors. It
has the further advantage of cutting out the high insurance company mark-up,
including commissions, so not many people are trying to sell such plans.

MY HOUSE will be subject to a compulsory purchase order in the near future
as it is in the path of a motorway which is being built.
I employed a surveyor to estimate the price I will obtain. The figure was
about half of what the house is insured for. I have no desire to part with
the property and intend to remain as long as possible.
I realise that I cannot win and will eventually have to move.
I am expecting threats and demands. I intend in turn to appeal. What stages
are involved and where will I be able to direct these appeals?
The acquiring authority will serve a notice to treat on you and will then
try to come to an agreement with you over the price which ought to be paid.
If you cannot agree the question of price is referred to the Lands Tribunal,
and appeal lies from the Lands Tribunal to the Divisional Court in the
Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. An unsuccessful appeal would
involve you in having to pay the respondent's costs (as well as your own).
The value for insurance is mainly composed of the cost of rebuilding the
property. This does not necessarily coincide with the value on the market.

CO-OPERATIVE banks across Europe and Canada have come up with a new and
cheaper way to transfer money from one country to another.
Tipa - Transferts Interbancaires de Paiements Automatises - will allow
consumers and small businesses to transfer one-off payments, pensions,
salaries, trade payments, insurance premiums and subscriptions. It is made
possible by the close links between co-operative banks in different
countries, which give them an edge over rivals in establishing a cheap and
reliable system of cross-border payments.
Payment instructions are made directly into the clearing mechanism of the
bank in the recipient's country. The exact amount the recipient will get is
stated in advance, in the currency in which it will be paid, and charges are
paid only at the time of the order.
Terry Thomas, general manager of the Co-op Bank, says payment can be
collected within four days. A more expensive, same-day payment service -
operated through Swift, the international bank electronic payment system -
will be available for emergencies. However, you will not be able to send
from the UK via Tipa until mid-May, although payments from France to
accounts in the UK start next week. Payments between Belgium and France are
already up and running.
One snag is that payment must be made in advance through a co-operative
bank, although it is not necessary to be a regular customer of one. In most
continental countries, co-operative banks have large networks with thousands
of branches, but the UK Co-op bank has only 207.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Precautions against Labour - Diary of
a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ACTIVE private investors, my family has been preparing over the past few
weeks for the general election. On March 13, my wife and two young daughters
sold their shares in Southern Electric for 249p each. We took the view that
City fears of tighter regulation by a Labour government of prices and
profits of utility companies would cause Southern Electric and other utility
companies' shares to fall.
Indeed, the recently-published Labour party manifesto promises families and
businesses 'power at prices they can afford.' Control of the National Grid
would be restored to 'public control.' Southern Electric shares are now less
than 240p.
My wife and I still retain a tiny shareholding in Scottish Hydro-Electric,
partly because it is uneconomic to sell the shares and partly because that
company ought to benefit from all the parties' support for a clean
environment. I have also held on to a small number of shares in Southern
Electric just in case its services decline. In that case, as one of its
customers, I might need to jump up at its annual general meeting to
complain.
Apart from that, my family has no other utility company shares - although,
if something dramatic happened between now and the election date to make it
overwhelmingly obvious that there would be a Conservative victory, we might
buy some in anticipation of a share price 'bounce.'
However, the outcome of the election looks very uncertain. Many people have
speculated that the worst outcome would be a hung parliament with no one
party with an overall majority. In my view, much worse would be a party
elected with a tiny majority. With a hung parliament, at least deals might
be struck between the parties and some uncertainty removed as to future
policies.
But suppose a party wins with a majority of one. Everything might be fine
for six months or so, with the majority party forming a government and
putting its policies into action. Then, one of its MPs dies. There would
then have to be a by-election. Suppose the government lost. A new government
with new policies would probably be formed.
To gain some protection against this risk, I managed a few weeks ago to
place bets with a bookmaker on the new government having a majority of
between one and six seats. The bet on the Conservatives being in that
position was at odds of 10/1; on Labour, 12/1. Recently, for bets like
these, the odds have been reduced considerably.
All these election uncertainties have made me examine my family's finances
closely. We have each sold as many of our shares as possible to take
advantage of the Pounds 5,500 capital gains tax thresholds, and to raise
some cash - in case there is a Labour government.
Should there be, the CGT allowances may be reduced and we could need extra
cash to increase tax-free investments, like National Savings Certificates,
or even to buy foreign currencies should it appear that currency speculators
and/or a declining economic situation cause the pound to be devalued or
'realigned within the ERM.' (A strong case could be made for devaluing the
pound, anyway, as it would make imports more expensive and encourage
exports, so (hopefully) helping to reduce the overseas trade deficit).
It would also be easy for a Labour government to go back on some of its
manifesto promises if it claimed that the Conservatives had 'doctored the
books' and that the country's real economic state was far worse than it had
realised.
If there is a Labour government, then house prices are unlikely to rise.
Indeed, they could continue to fall. Why? Because Labour plans to 'increase
the number of homes for rent' and encourage council house-building.' More
housing would, thus, be available.
Increases in taxation will hit particularly those on reasonable incomes who
traditionally have tended to 'trade up' to bigger houses and larger
mortgages. Increases in tax mean they would be more likely to stay put; so,
at best, the housing market would stagnate. This would have serious
repercussions for building societies and their thousands of branches. If
fewer people take on larger mortgages, and if more people rent instead of
buying, societies would be competing for even less business than exists even
in these difficult times.
This would force more societies to merge. My wife and I have benefited
already from one such merger - in 1990, when the Portman merged with the
Regency and West of England society and a bonus of 4 per cent for all
investors (up to Pounds 100 for each account) was paid to Portman
account-holders.
My family has spread cash around a number of building societies - including
the Chelsea and the Lambeth societies - in the hope of future mergers and
bonuses. Another advantage of spreading money between a number of societies
is that the Investor Protection Scheme covers only the first 90 per cent of
the amount deposited, up to a maximum of Pounds 20,000.
While uncertainties remain about the election outcome, I am holding back
from stock market investment. If Labour wins, advertising and PR companies
could suffer as there would be no lucrative privatisations and fewer large
contested company takeover bids.
But Labour's proposed increases in family allowances could give some appeal
to shares in companies like United Biscuits and Cadbury Schweppes, once the
market has settled down and the takeover speculation removed. People will
still buy sweets and chocolates, and those companies also have some overseas
earnings which could benefit if the pound is devalued.

THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in February. To
use it, multiply the original cost of the assets by the figure shown for the
month in which you bought them.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the difference
will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in January 1985 and sold
them in January 1992 for Pounds 12,500. Multiplying the original cost by the
January 1985 figure of 1.494 gives a total of Pounds 7,470.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 12,500 gives a gain for tax
purposes of Pounds 5,030 - below the 1991-92 Pounds 5,500 CGT allowance. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profit should be tax-free.
If you are selling shares bought before April 6, 1982, use the March 1982
figure.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Legal right is under threat - Agents
try to erode cooling-off rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EROSION of the statutory right to cancel investment policies appears to be a
growing side-effect of the slow housing market, with salespeople finding
various ways to claim lost commission from customers who change their minds
during the cooling-off period.
Dr Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, said he had dealt with a number
of complaints concerning tied agents. Typically, they involved someone who
was buying a house from an estate agent being invited to step into the next
room for advice on a mortgage - from an agent selling exclusively for one
insurance company.
Invariably, the agent would recommend an endowment policy. As part of the
formalities, he would get the buyer to sign an agreement to pay a mortgage
arrangement fee, to be waived provided he kept up the policy. When the
cooling-off notice arrived and the buyer decided to cancel, the agent began
pressing for payment of the mortgage fee, sometimes threatening to sue.
'The view I have taken is that it is contrary to the spirit of the
cooling-off notice to have any financial penalty attaching to the
cancellation,' said Farrand.
'I don't have any jurisdiction over mortgages; but if a tied agent is
selling an investment product that is so wrapped up with a mortgage, the
insurance company should be responsible for all of it.'
Farrand explained that these rulings did not feature in his annual report
(see Page IV) as the complaints had never become formal cases. When
contacted by the ombudsman's bureau, the insurance companies concerned
agreed to tell their tied agents to drop the claims against customers.
Late last year, the regulatory bodies Lautro and Fimbra both put out
guidance to members on mortgage arrangement fees and fee waivers. Fimbra,
which covers independent salespeople, stressed that members should make sure
any waiver agreements were not perceived as prejudicing an investor's right
to cancel any investment contract under the SIB rules.
'Members must satisfy themselves that the terms of the agreement and the
sales practices associated with it are consistent with their over-riding
obligation to ensure fair treatment of investors,' said Fimbra.
But there are more ways of making up for lost commission than simply
substituting a mortgage fee. In a county court claim filed at the beginning
of last month, Abbott Financial Services of Farnham, Surrey, based a claim
for Pounds 1,535 commission from a client on its terms of business which
explained:
'We retain . . . commission (from companies with which investments are
arranged) and therefore make no charge to clients for our advice and
services . . .'
'In the event of you ceasing payments of premium on these policies within
the commission period, we reserve the right to claim from you that
proportion of commission reclaimed from Abbott Financial Services.'
The client concerned is expected to point out that the policy was cancelled
within the cooling-off period - before the commission period  - and that no
premium was paid.
Alan Newell, deputy director for membership at Fimbra, said that members did
not have to tell the organisation what their arrangements with clients were,
and added that lost commission was a difficult area as a firm might have
been involved in a lot of preparatory work.
'They have the right to charge, provided they make it quite clear to clients
what their terms are - not necessarily in the terms of business,' he said.
But Newell stressed that members must not interfere with the cooling-off
process or withdraw the right to cancel.
Without commenting directly on the position of Abbott Financial Services,
Newell said he thought it would be difficult for an intermediary to sustain
a claim referring solely to a commission element unless there were some
other arrangement involved - perhaps verbal.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stop loss policies hitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NAMES AT Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, have been experiencing
difficulties in obtaining stop loss insurance policies, which provide them
with reinsurance.
Valentine Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Names, which
represents more than 9,000 Names, says his organisation has been receiving
inquiries from worried Names who - with nearly a quarter of the underwriting
year already gone - have been unable to obtain cover.
Underwriters have been shying away from the policies - because of heavy
losses. Nevertheless some cover is or should become available.
Four schemes are being marketed.
Brokers Holman Wade and Steel Burrill Jones still assembling underwriting
support for the market's most comprehensive scheme and hope to be able to
offer quotes to Names within the next few weeks.
Last year the scheme provided three year policies for about 8,000 Names
offering cover of Pounds 500,000 in excess of an amount equivalent on
average to 18 per cent of a Name's premium income limit.
This year brokers expect to be able to offer the facilities but on a one
year basis with cover reduced to Pounds 250,000 excess of 15 per cent. Rates
are expected to rise by about 50 per cent. A Name underwriting Pounds
500,000 would pay up to Pounds 8,000 against about Pounds 5,500 last year.
Brokers Robert Frazer and Fenchurch also offer a one-year facility with less
cover - Pounds 100,000 - but over a lower excess - of 10 per cent. Rates are
roughly up 25 per cent on last year and capacity is still available.
Stop Loss Mutual, a venture founded by Charles Taylor &amp; Co, says it has sold
3,000 policies of a kind which provide Names with more limited cover.
The facility, which was made available for the first time last year, does
not provide Names with a contract of indemnity but mutualises the excessive
losses of all Names backing the scheme.
Premiums paid by Names are invested in a fund out of which all claims are
paid. Once the fund is exhausted all claims are scaled down - with all Names
claiming on the fund receiving only a proportion of their claims.
Charles Taylor offers two policies. Class 1 is provided on the basis of a
four year commitment, and entails payment of Pounds 875 a year for cover up
to Pounds 25,000 per year, once losses exceed Pounds 300,000.
Class 2 policies offer cover up to Pounds 100,000 in excess of an amount
equivalent to between 7 1/2 per cent and 20 per cent of allocated premium
income.
The premium for class 2 involves an advance premium of Pounds 1,615 a year
but if losses in any year demand it, a supplementary premium, not exceeding
Pounds 1,615 is levied.
Seascope, the brokers, have been offering quotes for two facilities since
last December but now have very little capacity available.
One policy offers cover of Pounds 100,000 in excess of a minimum of 12 1/2
per cent, for a premium of Pounds 5,000. Cover can be increased to Pounds
150,000 for an extra Pounds 1,000 in premium.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Considering the pursestrings - How to
. . . cope with the end of the tax year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH five working days left before the end of the tax year, there is still
time to act on financial matters, particularly if you are worried that there
might be a tougher regime after the general election on April 9. The areas
to think about are: Pensions. Additional voluntary contributions are a
tax-efficient way of increasing pension benefits. If you can afford it,
top-up AVCs to the maximum limit for the year: 15 per cent of your total pay
(subject to a cap of Pounds 71,400 this year).
Tax relief can be claimed on AVCs and also on premiums paid into a personal
pension plan. The maximum contribution varies with your age: from 17.5 per
cent of your earnings until the age of 35, up to 40 per cent if you are
between 61-74.
These contributions can be carried back one year for tax purposes, and
accountant Price Waterhouse says it is worth doing this if your tax rate was
higher in 1990/91. You must pay the contributions by April 5 and make a
formal carry-back election by July 5.
Deposit accounts. If you receive interest gross, it might be to your
advantage to claim interest in the present tax year, when it will be taxed
at a maximum of 40 per cent. To do this, you will have to close your account
before April 5 and reopen it on April 6, which is the beginning of the next
tax year. Check that the bank or building society does not impose penalties
for immediate closure. Also, remember to transfer investments which produce
income to a lower-income spouse if you can make use of the latter's 25 per
cent band.
Capital Gains Tax: To use up the full allowance of Pounds 5,500 for the
current tax year, you may need to 'bed-and-breakfast' shares by selling them
on the market and repurchasing them to bring gains up to the tax-free
allowance. Your taxable gain next time you sell will be lessened, since you
will be starting from a higher base.
An allowance is made for the effect of inflation on asset prices between
April 1982 and the present. This indexation allowance varies, depending on
the month in which you bought your shares (page VI).
If you have reached your CGT threshold but your spouse has not, you can
transfer assets to them so that they can use their Pounds 5,500 allowance.
Share options: If you think tax rates are going to rise in the next tax year
and you are entitled to exercise share options, you may wish to do so before
April 6, since CGT is payable on their disposal.
Inheritance Tax: You can make 'potentially exempt transfers' free of IHT
provided you survive for seven years after making the gift. In addition,
husband and wife each has an annual exemption of Pounds 3,000 which can be
given as a lump sum or split between beneficiaries in any tax year.
Accountants Binder Hamlyn point out that those who did not use up last
year's gift allowance, can still do so by the end of this tax year, although
they must have used up this year's Pounds 3,000 first. Only one year's
exemption can be carried forward - after that it is lost. So husband and
wife can transfer Pounds 12,000, potentially free of IHT, if they have made
no transfers in the 1990/1 tax year or after.
You can also give small gifts of Pounds 250 to as many people as you like
free of IHT in any tax year.
Joint mortgage: Interest relief on a joint mortgage is now allocated equally
between husband and wife. Higher rate tax relief has been abolished for the
year 1991-92. However, Price Waterhouse says it is still possible to claim
mortgage relief in respect of the tax year 1990-91 so long as this is done
by April 5. If either of you is a higher rate taxpayer and the other is not,
you can elect to have the interest paid in 1990/91 to be allocated against
the higher rate payer's income.
Charities: Gift Aid scheme will allow you to give Pounds 600 or more to
charity tax-efficiently by the end of the tax year. If you are a 40 per cent
taxpayer, you can claim relief of Pounds 120 on Pounds 600. So it will only
cost you Pounds 480 net to give Pounds 800 because the charity can claim a
further Pounds 200 of tax.
Personal Equity Plans: The normal seven day cooling off period means that
you now cannot receive advice and get a PEP for this tax year. However, you
can use an execution-only service to obtain a Pep until April 2, or at a
push, by midday April 3. Those offering execution-only services include
Chamberlain de Broe (tel: 071-235-5999) for a flat fee of Pounds 50 and
Boyton Financial Services (0787-61919) charges Pounds 60.
Trusts: Income from a discretionary trust or an accumulation and maintenance
trust suffers tax at a flat rate of 35 per cent. However, Barry Stillerman,
of Stoy Hayward, says that if payments are made to a child who is over 18
years old and does not pay tax, the child can use his or her personal
allowance to reclaim tax, so long as the settlor of the trust is a parent.
The trustees should make out a cheque to the child by April 5 and a
repayment claim can be made after that date.
If you are a settlor and beneficiary of an overseas trust (and are a UK
resident), you are liable for CGT when payments are made. Trustees often
defer payment, allowing income to accumulate in the trust instead. However,
from April 5, the government is imposing a 10 per cent surcharge for each
year between the realisation of CGT and the beneficiary receiving income
from the trust for a period of six years.
Caroline Garnham, of solicitors Simmons and Simmons, says if your trust has
made a gain and you are thinking of having income paid out to you within the
next six years, it would be cheaper to do so before the end of this tax
year. Business Expansion Scheme: There are still some schemes open until
April 5 so it is not too late to invest a maximum of Pounds 40,000 in this
tax year to receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount invested. To keep
the tax relief you will need to maintain the investment for five years.
Enterprise Zone Trust: After the collapse of Cabot Square scheme over a week
ago, virtually all the available EZT schemes are oversubscribed.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Last chance - if it's Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME cliches make sense: 'Invest in haste, repent at leisure' is a good
example. The Labour party, which has a good chance of forming the next
government, has pledged to abolish the Business Expansion Scheme for assured
tenancies if it becomes the government next month. But there is a chance to
invest in the BES between April 6, the beginning of the 1992-93 tax year,
and April 9, the election date, and most big BES sponsors have launched
schemes to allow you to do this.
There is a strong tax logic in favour of this, but it may become much weaker
in the context of your other financial plans. These are points you should
bear in mind:
Tax shelter investment usually happens at the end of a tax year when you
know quite clearly how much you have earned. How certain are you that you
can afford to shelter so much money for five years?
The increase in top tax rates if Labour wins has been well-publicised. This
would cut monthly disposable income. BES is a non-income producing
investment, so check that the opportunity cost of doing without the income
from Pounds 40,000 in a more liquid investment would not damage your
standard of living.
Many property analysts believe that a Labour government would be bad news
for the residential property market. Some would disagree, but this is
another point to bear in mind.
Although this is only a faint risk, Labour could abolish the BES
retrospectively. It is not at all likely, but it is possible.
If a BES investment next year still adds up for you, the following companies
are on offer; Election Hedge, sponsored by Capital Ventures, will aim to
arrange covenanted 'buy-back' schemes with universities or colleges, at a
price of Pounds 1.35 in five years for every Pounds 1, before tax relief,
paid now; IMPRESS II, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, will offer a similar deal
buying property for Imperial College, London; Artesian Performer II, open
until April 17, will buy properties for growth, with no attempt at setting a
guaranteed buy-back price; 6-10 April BESSA Cash Backed, sponsored by Close
Brothers, involves a buy-back deal, backed by a special cash deposit, with a
North Sea support ships company, at a price of Pounds 1.32 for every Pounds
1 spent now, and; Election Protection Cash Backed, sponsored by Johnson Fry,
which is structured to stay open until the day the BES is abolished. It aims
to fix up cash-backed deals offering Pounds 1.25 in five years for every
Pounds 1 spent now.
A different animal, the non-property trading company is making a comeback.
The adventurous might like to sample the following; Nevada Bob, sponsored by
Williams De Broe, is financing a new golf superstore for the City of London,
which will be part of a larger worldwide chain; Spittoon, sponsored by
Gouldens solicitors, is raising money to make Spitting Image-style
television programmes, First Standard Media will raise money for film
production - its founders include a former director with both BBC and ITV;
and HarleyScreen, sponsored by Matrix Securities, will fund a private
pathology laboratory working on screening for AIDS.

IF LAST week's volume of selling reflected boardroom concern at the
uncertain political outlook, this week's volume is even more emphatic. With
Labour ahead in the polls, the selling is unlikely to let up until after
April 9.
In December last year, Racal Electronics was fighting off the unwelcome
attentions of Williams Holdings. In an impressive display of solidarity,
nine of the 12 main board directors bought a total of 5m shares at prices
between 50p and 53p. Three months after the failure of the Williams bid,
Martin Richardson has sold considerably more than the 40,000 shares he
bought in December.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATED Life is offering an annual income bond guaranteed to outlive
the next government. The seven-year bond offers income of 9 per cent per
annum net (equivalent to 12 per cent gross). Minimum investment is Pounds
2,000 and maximum Pounds 100,000.
It is unusual for insurers to offer bonds over such a long period, says
Colin Jackson of Baronworth Investment Services, and the rate suggests that
actuaries expect base rates to rise. The figures for one-year bonds, have
also risen since last week, showing that a Labour government, with higher
base rates in its wake, is seen as a strong possibility.
*****
IN THE run-up to the election, several lenders are offering fixed-rate
mortgages. Equity &amp; Law has a portable 9.95 per cent (10.9 per cent APR)
mortgage, fixed for 10 years. There is an arrangement fee of 1 per cent and
a Pounds 25 booking fee. Borrowers must take out insurance through the
lender. Only endowment and pension mortgages are available.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is offering a five-year fixed mortgage at 10.6 per
cent (11.4 per cent APR). There is an administration fee of Pounds 250.
*****
BONUS rates from life insurance companies are showing a strong downward
trend for the year following announcements from several large companies.
Scottish Amicable cut both reversionary (annual) and terminal bonuses across
its range of endowment policies. On the standard industry assumption that
policies were taken out by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month,
10-year pay-outs are down from Pounds 8,092 to Pounds 7,331, below the 1990
levels, while 25-year pay-outs dropped from Pounds 63,270 to Pounds 62,531.
The Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has also cut both forms of
bonus. Its figure for a 25-year policy, on the same assumptions, is Pounds
60,075, down from Pounds 61,359. This keeps the Pru outside the top ten
performing offices.
Equitable Life, a leader in the pensions market but less active in
endowments, reported small increases in pension pay-outs. - the retirement
fund after 25 years of paying Pounds 500 annual premiums would be Pounds
120,825, compared to Pounds 118,285 last year. Pay-outs on its 10-year
endowment fell from Pounds 8,399 to Pounds 7,812, but over 25 years rose
from Pounds 51,823 to Pounds 53,444.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The strange case of the frozen
chickens - Last year complaints to the insurance ombudsman rose 64%. John
Authers gives advice on making a fuss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU feel like complaining about insurance companies, you are not alone.
The insurance ombudsman disclosed in his annual report this week, that he
had to handle 4,334 cases last year - a rise of 64 per cent.
Meanwhile 13,899 people made inquiries in writing and 26,048 by phone.
In two thirds of cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld, and the
report includes examples of dishonest claims. But 32 per cent of the time,
policyholders were awarded money. A total of Pounds 5m was awarded, ranging
from Pounds 500,000 (over the unusual case of a disputed death benefit on a
life policy) to two awards of Pounds 5.
The ombudsman's scheme includes more than 340 companies, and is used as the
complaints resolution mechanism by Lautro, the life assurance and unit trust
regulator.
How should you go about complaining if you have an insurance problem? The
ombudsman's office should be regarded as a destination of last resort. Your
complaint must first have been referred to the senior management of your
insurer, which must be given an opportunity to resolve the complaint.
Once you have received a final judgment from the company, you must contact
the ombudsman within six months. It is also important that the matter
concerns you personally (not someone else's policy) and that your policy or
contract was issued in the UK, Isle of Man or Channel Islands.
The ombudsman will not step in if the complaint is already the subject of
legal proceedings or arbitration, or if it concerns a policy in the name of
companies or partnerships rather than individual people. You cannot complain
to him about commercial risks, or levels of premiums. Importantly, given the
volume of letters to the Weekend FT which this area generates, complaints
about surrender values, bonuses and rates of return on life policies are
also off-limits.
If your problem passes all these tests, write to the ombudsman. You will
then be asked to fill in a form, and provide relevant documents (you will,
deservedly, be scuppered if you have not bothered to keep them).
There is no charge and you do not need legal or other professional
representation. Should you employ a solicitor, it will be at your own cost.
The ombudsman has wide powers to command the insurers to produce
information, and can hold investigations. The average case takes four months
and 24 days to clear up. The chief virtue of the scheme is that it is
cheaper and quicker than going to court. This tends to be longer in
financial services disputes where there are allegations of mis-selling by
salesmen - a common problem.
Dr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, was not optimistic that the Securities and
Investments Board's proposals on disclosure and the publishing of 'key
features' documents about products would significantly cut complaints about
life assurance and investment products.
He welcomed the suggestion that sales representatives should be forced to
write to clients explaining exactly why they had recommended one product
rather than another. By the end of this year, this could be a legal
requirement, and would provide an extra defence when policies have been
wrongly sold.
This might clamp down on some of the outrageous selling tactics mentioned in
the report. One salesman explaining why he had sold a whole-of-life policy
to an unmarried 18-year-old with no children, who wanted to save, said: 'The
reason I did not attempt to sell a Capital Accumulation Plan (a 10-year
endowment) is because in February 1988 I was unaware the Capital
Accumulation Plan existed. In fact, my first CAP sale was not until July
1988. Perhaps if my training had included the plan, I would have marketed it
more often. However, at the time, my training had only included the
Financial Security Account and the Personal Retirement Account.'
The ombudsman decided that the entire sale had been unsuitable. It is
alarming that a salesman was let loose on the public while still
insufficiently trained to give suitable advice.
Half-truths are also used. One salesman denied assuring a widow that she
would receive at least 10 per cent income a year from an investment bond.
However, he admitted he had said, in response to repeated questions, that he
was sure it would do better. It did not. The sales were set aside, and she
was paid interest.
These cases suggest the dangers for consumers, and show why it is worthwhile
to complain. But Dr Farrand also suggested a list of three 'don'ts' for
policyholders who want to complain:
Do not be dishonest. Plenty of people are. The report cited the example of a
pensioner who claimed that a refrigerator breakdown ruined 93lbs of meat in
his freezer compartment - allegedly a week's supply for the claimant and any
guests that might drop by. Investigation showed that the freezer could only
hold about 42lbs, and so the ombudsman found in favour of the insurer.
Dishonesty can also attach to claims about disability. According to Dr
Farrand: 'A video showed an allegedly disabled roofer hammering nails into
tiles and gutters. After the show, despite commenting that it had been one
of his better days, he was able to appreciate the insurer's stance without
further argument.'
Do not be reckless. The test that claimants show that they used 'reasonable
care' has been relaxed, according to Dr Farrand, but is not finished
altogether.
For example, there was no joy from the ombudsman for the man whose car was
stolen after he had knowingly left it unlocked with the keys in the ignition
while he ran back into his house to collect something.
However, this test is subtle. There was a pay-out for the parents of the boy
who fell to his death while trying to jump from one hotel balcony to
another, because he did not realise there was any danger, but not for the
teenager who died after a daring dive from a high bridge, who it was thought
must have realised the risks he was taking.
Do not have unreasonable expectations. Read the small print, the minutiae
can often be distressing. For example, a woman being treated with hormone
implants for menopausal symptoms appealed to the ombudsman when her insurers
gave notice that they would only pay for another six months.
The policy covered costs of treatment for 'medical conditions' which were
defined as 'any disease, illness or injury'. As the menopause plainly does
not qualify under any of these headings, the ombudsman ruled that the
insurers need not have paid anything at all.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, is likely to
announce a further decline in half-yearly profits on Monday. Indeed, some
brokers are predicting only break even, although it is thought the 2.1p
dividend will be maintained.
Harassed, on the one hand, by poor demand in the automotive and aerospace
industries, but under pressure, on the other, to keep up research and
investment spending, Lucas is trapped between recession and creating a base
for its future fortunes.
Full-year figures from MB-Caradon, the building products group, on Monday
are expected to show pre-tax profits edging ahead to perhaps Pounds 104m
(Pounds 101.7m) in 1991, in spite of the recession. After a 12 per cent
profit fall at the interim stage to Pounds 47.2m, this would suggest a
better second half.
The group's quarter share in CMB Packaging, the European packaging group,
will contribute more following management changes there, but the proceeds of
the Pounds 149m rights issue launched last October will barely have arrived
by the year end.
Also on Monday, Inchcape, the international motor distributor, marketing and
business services group, is expected to report annual pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 174m to Pounds 180m, in line with the forecast made in December
when it had a Pounds 376m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Tozer
Kemsley &amp; Millbourn (TKM).
Interest will focus on how the motor distributor and retailer is being
bedded in and what effect the Budget's halving of car tax has had on sales
by Inchcape, one of the UK's biggest car distributors.
London Weekend Television, which retained its franchise at the bargain
basement price of Pounds 7.58m, is expected to unveil a good set of results
on April Fool's Day.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 19m and Pounds 21m
for 1991. The outcome could be at the high end of expectations and perhaps
even modestly up on last year's Pounds 20.7m. Such a result would be a
considerable achievement in a recession.
Harrisons and Crosfield, the chemicals, building supplies and feedstock
conglomerate, is expected to show a further fall in pre-tax profit to
roughly Pounds 75m, from Pounds 106m, when it announces its 1991 results on
Wednesday.
But the big question is: will it maintain an uncovered dividend, and the
betting seems to be yes, just about.
Sun Alliance, the biggest of the composite insurance groups, is set to post
a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 420m and Pounds 470m when its reports its
1991 results on Thursday.
Sun is the market leader in domestic Mortgage indemnity insurance and has
been forced to make increased provisions as a result of rising
repossessions.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tories or Labour, what the dealers
think - A look at the mood of the City in the run-up to the April 9 general
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, JOHN AUTHERS and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES
STOCKBROKERS always look forward to Conservative governments and the
performance of share prices has usually, although not always, borne out
their confidence.
As the graphs show, the two periods of 13-year Tory rule both saw
substantial real and nominal gains for the FT-30 index. But the Heath
government of 1970-74 - which presided over the Barber boom, the secondary
banking crisis, the three-day week and the quadrupling of oil prices -
resulted in a fall in the index in inflation-adjusted terms.
The graphs flatter the Conservatives slightly since they have had much
longer periods than Labour in which to display gains. There were big bull
runs, in nominal terms, under the Labour government of 1974-79.
Whatever the historical record, though, there is little doubt that the
markets would like to see a Conservative victory in this election.
Bob Semple, equity strategist at County NatWest, says a Tory triumph would
restore the missing factor of confidence to the UK economy, with GDP growth
in the second quarter. Meanwhile economic growth in the US, the prospect of
lower interest rates in Europe and low inflation in the UK would form a good
background for share prices.
Semple sees the FT-SE 100 index reaching 3,000 by the end of the year should
the Tories win. He says base rates should fall to 9.5 per cent and long gilt
yields to 8.5 per cent.
Bill Smith, an equity analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, also sees the
release of pent-up consumer demand as an important consequence of a Tory
victory. That would be good for housing-related stocks. He also feels
utility shares, which have been depressed by fears of Labour re-regulation,
would benefit swiftly from John Major's return to office. He expects that
Footsie would be around 2,900 by end-1992 under the Conservatives.
Smith says a re-elected government probably would move sterling into the
narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism; that should reduce the 'risk
premium' attached to sterling in the minds of international investors. As a
consequence, base rates should fall to 9-9.5 per cent by the year-end.
HUNG PARLIAMENT
WE ARE already seeing how the City would react to a hung parliament.
Analysts, fund managers and dealers believe this to be the most likely
election outcome, and so they are trying to build this into the market.
Share prices have accordingly gone down.
A hung parliament is easily the City's least favoured option, mainly because
it would bring destabilising uncertainty in its wake.
However not all the 'bad news' is yet in the price. Dealers are taking up
defensive positions - which generally means giving themselves as much
exposure to the US and other international markets as possible.
Economists now believe that America should come out of recession first, and
it also provides a good place to shelter from the sterling crisis which is
expected if the Tories do not win. Base rates may be forced up as the
minority government seeks to defend the pound.
Opinions vary on the precise permutation of a hung parliament. Some think
that a Labour coalition with the Liberal Democrats would emerge following
the minimum of horse-trading. This would be worse for equities than a Labour
government.
Mark Walton, equity strategist with James Capel, says that this could lead
to the market 'tracking sideways' between 2200 and 2400 for a year or more.
This compares with a Capel forecast of 2750 by the end of 1992 under a solid
Labour government.
This is not particularly due to uncertainty. Walton points out that the Lib
Dems have pledged to put a penny on income tax. He said: 'The Lib Dems would
want some form of say on the first budget of the Labour government, so you
might expect to see a couple of changes made to the shadow budget.'
It is the other concessions the Lib Dems might extract which really worry
the City. If a form of proportional representation were adopted, and the
Conservatives maintained their attitude to making deals, then there might
never be another Tory government, according to Walton. This would be
sufficient to depress sentiment.
Another popular version is that there would be no clear outcome, followed by
another election by the end of the year. This is the nightmare scenario.
Investment decisions would be postponed, and with them any recovery.
International stocks would have a great time, but no others would.
Andrew Gregory, investment director of Kleinwort Benson private bank, sees
this as the worst possible case, which would probably limit the FT-SE to
around 2400 (compared to 2850 by the end of the year under Labour, and 3200
under the the Conservatives).
Mark Brown, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, sees a level of 2350 as being defensible
for the FT-SE in any situation. Unlike Walton, he prefers a minority Labour
government with Lib Dem support to a Labour majority because the immediate
economic impact on confidence should be much muted.
Brown counsels caution in buying, even though on most standard fundamental
measures the market seems generously valued. Walton disagrees, suggesting
that the average yield of 5.6 per cent which would be available if the
market disliked the election result is excellent value.
LABOUR
THIRTEEN years of Tory rule, and the sweeping changes in the former Eastern
bloc, have led the Labour party to tone down its commitment to socialism.
Thus, City houses such as James Capel and Warburgs now agree that the
macroeconomic differences between Labour and the Conservatives are so narrow
that the longer-term effect on the markets of a Kinnock government would not
be as great as many investors might think.
For one thing, Labour has said it is committed to the ERM, which would act
as a brake on inflation. Warburg says residual fears of increased inflation
due to the introduction of a minimum wage have receded because Labour has
indicated this would not be introduced until 1993.
Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburg, says of a Labour victory: 'The
downside for the market would be modest.' He predicts the FT-SE 100 index
would fall to about 2,400 initially, but would rally later in the year to
around 2,900. Capel also predicts an initial fall in the Footsie, to
2,200-2,300, and a recovery by the end of the year, to 2,750. Both emphasise
that these predictions depend on Labour honouring its commitment to the ERM,
and to the economic recovery being under way.
Gardiner thinks a Labour victory would see interest rates increasing by a
point to calm the fears of the foreign exchange markets, but dropping below
present levels by the end of the year as confidence in sterling rises. As
for gilts, he thinks yields would fall slowly to about 9 1/4 per cent by the
end of the year, compared with 8 3/4 per cent under a Conservative
government. Both he and Capel expect inflation to be higher under Labour,
but not substantially so. Indeed, Gardiner puts it at only a maximum of  1/2
percentage point higher than under the Conservatives. The graphs show it is
possible for stock markets to perform well under Labour. They fell heavily
when Labour was returned in 1974 but recovered by the time the Conservatives
took over in 1979. However, the effect of inflation meant that returns were
down in real terms, as they were during the Wilson Labour government.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Whatever happened to the wall of
money? - London markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY WAS one of those days when even the most swashbuckling equity
investor suddenly sees the attractions of a building society pass-book. The
FT-SE index dipped below its level of nearly five years ago, closing at
2,441.0, two points below the last decade's peak in July 1987.
If you had switched from big-company shares to cash four and a bit years
ago, you would have been able to buy back into the stock market this week
more cheaply than when you left it - having enjoyed double the FT-SE's yield
in the meantime, and missing out on a few heart-stopping crashes,
mini-crashes and false dawns on the way.
The argument is even more compelling if you look at the wider market,
reflected in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. It is now under 1,200 - well
below its peak in July 1987, and not far off the level at which it was
selling on the day of the last general election.
Looked at purely in terms of stock market performance, therefore, the
outgoing government's record is at best flat, at worst a serious
disappointment.
One reason, of course, is that the heady equity market of the summer of 1987
stemmed partly from the belief that a 'wall of Japanese money' was waiting
to hit the UK stock market once a Conservative election victory was assured.
Even at the time, that seemed a pretty shaky argument; now, the most it
deserves is a hollow laugh.
Bubbles apart, the deeper reason for the equity market's poor performance
since 1987 is the same as the basic argument for buying equities: they
represent the most direct way of participating in the long-term growth of
the economy. If there is no long-term growth, the case for equities is much
diminished.
In the fourth quarter of 1988 the UK's gross domestic product was 0.6 per
cent lower than it had been in the corresponding period three years before.
Between the third quarter of 1987, when equities reached their short-lived
peak, and the last three months of 1991, the UK economy has grown at a
compound annual rate of 0.9 per cent.
Under the circumstances, the performance of the stock market is scarcely
surprising.
Those years of slow average growth are partly an arithmetical illusion: they
consist of seven quarters of rapid expansion followed by six quarters of
recession.
Similarly, the outlook for growth over the life of the next parliament hangs
in part on how long the recession continues. On that, good news: 'The
recession has about run its course,' said Gavyn Davies of Goldman, Sachs,
this week, illustrating his point with the charts alongside.
Retail sales volume is trending up, and labour force statistics are heading,
broadly, in the same direction: the stage is set for growth to resume.
On Wednesday, two businessmen close to consumer trends - Kingfisher's
Geoffrey Mulcahy and Sir Lawrie Barratt, the newly returned chairman of
Barratt Developments - took opposing tacks on the issue. Mulcahy said his
retailing chains had received 'no significant indication of any upturn in
consumer confidence'. Sir Lawrie said that a slow recovery had begun in the
UK. This should continue, he said, irrespective of the outcome of the
election, provided interest rates did not rise by more than two percentage
points.
Sir Lawrie was not the only person with post-election interest rates on his
mind. Throughout the week, short-term interest rates stayed high, reflecting
concern that an incoming Labour government might have to raise base rate to
protect the pound.
There was some ostentatious calming of the money market by the Bank of
England on Tuesday, but at the end of the week three month interest rates
were stuck at around 10.8 per cent, more than a quarter-point clear of the
10 1/2 per cent base rate.
Still, a post-election wall of pessimism may prove as illusory as 1987's
wall of money.
One big institutional investor argued this week that the market would
probably go up after the election regardless of the result - as long as the
vote produced a clear winner.
To find out which politician is a winner the market will have to wait for
another 12 days. It seems to have taken rather less time to decide on one of
1992's big losers: the award goes, by an overwhelming vote, to Tiny Rowland,
of Lonrho.
There were ominous signs at the Lonrho agm that even his perennial
supporters among small investors may now have developed second thoughts. The
shares closed the week at 87p, down another 15p - partly influenced, no
doubt, by reports that Lords Hanson and White have given Lonrho the
once-over and backed away shaking their heads ruefully.
It is hard not to sympathise with Tiny Rowland. Who else would have had the
wit to respond to institutional pressure to unlock shareholder value by
choosing Colonel Gadaffi as a suitable partner?
Selling Libya a minority stake in Lonrho's Metropole hotel subsidiary is the
stock-market equivalent of telling critics: 'Don't touch me or I'll shoot
myself'.
If institutional shareholders keep up the pressure, we can presumably expect
to find Cuba a co-investor in Lonrho's sugar plantations and Saddam Hussein
taking a minority stake in Western Platinum.
As an investment medium, the building society pass-book may have its
investment attractions. But for pure amusement, the stock market wins hands
down.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cautious societies are building solid
profits - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES MAY be bad in the mortgage market, but those headlines about a few
building societies in trouble may not be the best pointer to what is
happening in the industry.
Most large building societies emerged from the results season with increased
profits and strong capital ratios. Only a few large societies  - Alliance &amp;
Leicester was the chief example - suffered substantial falls in pre-tax
profits. Those that increased profits did so in spite of a huge increase in
their bad debt provisions.
Last Tuesday's profit figures from Halifax, the largest UK building society,
are a case in point. Pre-tax profits went up by 6 per cent to Pounds 628m.
This was achieved despite a jump in bad debt provisions from Pounds 107m in
1990 to Pounds 229m.
This was far from being the industry's best performance. Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, the sixth largest society, reported a 27 per cent increase, from
Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 183.8m, in pre-tax profits in spite of a rise in bad
debt charges from Pounds 20.5m in 1990 to Pounds 108.4m.
Some societies based outside the south east did even better. Profits rose 29
per cent at Northern Rock to Pounds 54.5m.
Those societies whose profits plunged seem to have been punished for
straying from their tradition core business. The real problems at Alliance &amp;
Leicester, where profits were halved after bad debt provisions of Pounds
215m, came from its large portfolio of commercial lending, a market from
which it has withdrawn.
The same was true at Skipton, a medium-sized society regarded until now as
one of the industry's stars. Even its competitors were discomfitted to watch
its profits plunge 64 per cent in 1991 to Pounds 11.5m. But Pounds 15m of
its Pounds 23m bad debt provisions were for commercial lending. It too has
stopped lending in that market.
Similar points could be made about those societies which have been forced to
merge after making a loss. The casualties of the last few years, Town &amp;
Country, Leamington Spa, Lancastrian, Cheshunt, and Portsmouth were also
societies which experimented with risky forms of lending, such as
'non-status' lending to people without a guaranteed income, and in some
cases failed to insure their risks property.
This suggests that societies which stick to their knitting on their property
lending (losses on estate agency, credit cards and the like are embarrassing
but affordable) can be trusted not to go the way of the US savings and loans
associations.
Set against the results of the 'Big Four' clearing banks, those from Abbey
National (now a PLC and a bank but still operating in the building
societies' market) and Halifax look very healthy. They made pre-tax larger
profits than every bank but Lloyds in 1991.
So why did the typical building society do so well in such a miserable
market? Anyone who has been reading the personal finance pages of the
newspapers over the last year should have a good idea.
Societies were quietly cunning as interest rates fell, manipulating their
products and deliberately mis-matching their rates between savers and
borrowers, old customers and new. The savings accounts in which old
customers were trapped at a lower rate of interest are a good example of the
techniques employed.
Overall this sort of balance sheet management is probably to be welcomed
rather than frowned on. Everyone knows that the difference between saving
and borrowing rates widens when interest rates are falling. After 1988 the
societies narrowed the margin between lending and savings rates to an
unprecedented extent. They are holding prevailing interest rates for
borrowers at 10.95 per cent, within half a percentage point of the banks'
base rate of 10.5 per cent.
If societies had been prevented by law from widening their margins, they
would certainly have had to pass the cost on to their customers as higher
interest rates and the housing market would have fared even worse.
The endurance test for the societies is not over yet. The housing market is
even worse than it was a year ago, and after the election if Labour wins, we
could see a further house-price plunge. At the moment, the large societies
look well-capitalised and equipped to deal with anything short of an
extraordinary disaster in the market.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: In the black under the red menace -
Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF OPINION polls are a reliable guide, then there seems to be a fighting
chance that Labour will form the next government, if only with Liberal
support.
After 13 years of Conservative rule, many may be suddenly panicking about
what a Labour government will do to their savings. Savers really fall into
two categories.
Those retired and living off their savings will only be affected by John
Smith's alternative budget if their investment income is over Pounds 40,000.
(Of course, they may well suffer in later years if Labour has to increase
taxes to finance its spending plans.)
The main difficulties will be faced by those saving while in high-paid
employment. First, the abolition of the 9 per cent national insurance
threshold, and the new top rate of 50 per cent, will reduce their net income
 -and thus their ability to save. Secondly, those on over Pounds 40,000 a
year will find that savings income will be taxed at 50 per cent. They will
be very lucky, after inflation, to see any real return at all.
What should such people do to reduce the tax burden on their savings? Many
will be tempted to break the law and hide their money offshore; however,
there are plenty of legal ways of cutting tax bills.
The first principle may well be to emphasise capital gains rather than
income. Given the fact that many Britons keep the bulk of their savings in
the building society, and that only 165,000 paid CGT last year, it seems
likely that few make use of their current CGT threshold.
Labour repeated this week that it would not be lowering the CGT threshold to
Pounds 1,000, as Tory-supporting newspapers have been suggesting. Margaret
Beckett, a Treasury spokeswoman said that the CGT exemption would be indexed
for inflation and the top rate would be 40 per cent.
In the longer term, the plan seems to be that the threshold would come down,
however, probably to the level of the personal income tax allowance (which
would be Pounds 3,625 under Labour in 1992-93). This would be part of a
reform in which capital gains were taxed on a sliding scale, with lower
rates for long term holders. (A good idea in theory, but in practice, one
suspects, a bonanza for accountants).
The upshot is that, in the short term, capital gains under Labour will be
taxed at a lower top rate (40 per cent) and with a higher starting threshold
than income.
The second principle is deferment. If you are really saving for the long
term, then you do not need to take return in the form of income. The snag
with building society interest is that, even if you only let it roll up in
your account, it is still taxed as if you had received every penny. Any
investment that defers the return is a good deal, provided your own, or the
country's, taxes will be lower then.
The third principle will be tax efficiency. Transferring money between
spouses could save a great deal of tax if one is paying 50 per cent on
investment income and the other 25 per cent.
Which investments could achieve these objectives? Individuals needing
specific recommendations would do best to consult an independent (and
ideally fee-charging) adviser, but here are some suggestions:
Low risk
Tessas offer tax-free income if held for five years. A husband and wife who
have not already opened Tessas could put in Pounds 6,000 this year; those
who started in 1991 can add a further Pounds 3,600.
National savings certificates. The 36th issue offers 8.5 per cent tax free
for a top rate Labour taxpayer. The fifth index-linked issue offers 4.5 per
cent plus inflation. Both need to be held for five years to achieve quoted
returns. Husband and wife can put Pounds 40,000 in total in these issues;
more if held in trust.
Index-linked gilts. Most of the return comes as tax-free capital gain. The
current real yields of 4 per cent (assuming 5 per cent inflation), will
still be 3 per cent real after tax.
All the above can be realised reasonably quickly with small risk of capital
loss (though loss of investment return), which could be important if
Labour's taxes require you to eat in to your savings.
Medium risk
Offshore roll-up funds. These funds allow you to accumulate income, which is
only taxed when realised. There is a risk, however, that Labour could find
some way of withdrawing this privilege.
Zero coupon shares of investment trusts. These offer steady growth till
maturity and profits are treated as capital gain for tax purposes. There is
a risk, however, that they will not be repaid in full, if markets or the
trust's managers perform badly.
High risk
Personal equity plans. Many readers seem dissatisfied with their PEPs to
date. But if the top rate is 50 per cent, the tax benefit/charges equation
should look better. Labour says it has no plans to abolish PEPs immediately,
so it might be worth waiting and letting the market fall after a Labour
victory before investing. The risk of capital loss is obviously there,
especially if you cash in your plan early. Up to Pounds 6,000 can be placed
in a general PEP (this will include both unit and investment trusts in
1992-93) and Pounds 3,000 in a single company PEP in a tax year (see page
V).

Midland Bank is making changes to the rates on its Orchard current account.
The lower interest rate payable on balances below Pounds 500 is being
abolished. From April 21, the 1.5 per cent gross band (1.1 per cent net) is
being replaced by the top rate of 3 per cent gross (2.25 per cent net). At
the same time, the monthly fee for agreed overdrafts rises from Pounds 5 to
Pounds 7, and for other overdrafts from Pounds 10 to Pounds 15.
Midland recently announced lower rates on its savings accounts, including
the Exchequer, Meridian savings, Saver Plus, Orchard Savings and HICA.
Its Tessa is now paying 10 per cent, reduced from 10.25 per cent.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Trust sales exceed
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors sold more unit trusts than they bought in February, with sales
exceeding purchases by Pounds 30m. Gross sales for the month, at Pounds
569.6m, were less than half the figure for the same month last year. The
Unit Trust Association blamed election uncertainty for the lack of investor
interest.
The five year performance record of unit trusts also looks poor, and will
continue to do so until the stock market crash of 1987 drops out of the
statistics in November this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news this week of the financial difficulties which have hit Olympia &amp;
York, the world's biggest property developer, did nothing to help the ailing
fortunes of shares in the UK property sector.
These have been in decline for three years with only a false hope that a
recovery might be underway bolstering the sector about a year ago.
Both residential and commercial property have been badly hit by the
recession with little prospect of an upturn in the near future.
Most quoted property companies have a large exposure to London offices which
have suffered particularly sharp falls in value. A surge in building work at
the end of the 1980s has created a large oversupply of office space.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: The city that lost its way - But is
Britain's capital facing a crisis? Ian Hargreaves finds strong disagreement
on what should be done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON IS in crisis. That is what it says on the cover of a new book by
architect Sir Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher, the Labour Party's spokesman
on the arts. They are not alone in their view.
'The quality of life is improving for the majority of people, but there's a
minority for whom it's going the other way. You have two Londons, side by
side. It breeds discontent.' So says Sir Peter Imbert, commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police, whose officers patrol the cardboard cities of Waterloo,
Charing Cross, Lincoln's Inn Fields and a score of other spots where
London's homeless shelter.
Or, as the London Evening Standard's planning correspondent put it the other
day, Londoners must endure 'transport crumbling and squalid; dereliction and
destitution stare them in the face.' A London Weekend Television survey
conducted in the autumn of 1990 - before the recession set in - found that
59 per cent of Londoners thought the quality of life had got worse in the
past 10 years. Almost half said that, given the chance, they would live
somewhere else.
Perhaps it was always so. London has inspired elation, frustration and
despair in broadly equal quantities. On Westminster Bridge, Wordsworth's
spirits soared. As TS Eliot watched commuters flow over London Bridge, he
wondered that death had undone so many. William Blake, driven by poverty and
visions, walked 'where the chartered Thames doth flow' to 'mark in every
human face, marks of weakness marks of woe.' Today, his words are inscribed
on a concrete paving slab on the south bank of the river, opposite the
Strand, where the poet made his last London home.
But when James Boswell romanced about his country seat in Scotland, Dr
Samuel Johnson instructed him, famously, that the man tired of London is
tired of life. Nomadic Henry James detested the stench and the fogs but
experienced in London 'the most possible form of life.'
Perhaps it is just that Londoners always have required their city to
accommodate the spectrum of their emotional life and political
sensibilities. And yet, as London entered the 1990s there was a pervasive
anxiety, reflected in a renewed outbreak of schism about the way it is
governed and not helped by the longest recession since the war, the fruits
of which have included a spectacular property crash and a series of
financial scandals which have damaged the engine of the city's prosperity.
The most famous London novel of the past decade, Martin Amis's London
Fields, is set in a wasteland of gridlocked traffic, mechanical sex and
barbarian moral values. If Amis is Tom Wolfe without the compensating
exuberance, so London sometimes seems to have New York's problems without
its zest for life.
When statisticians try to plot these anxieties, they come up with items like
these: reported crime up 11 per cent last year, with mugging up a fifth;
registered homeless more than doubled in a decade; 250,000 properties
'difficult to let' because they are in such poor condition; a clogged road
system, cutting central London traffic speeds by 15 per cent in little more
than a decade; and public transport underperforming on every measure.
There are those who think the problems can be blamed on Margaret Thatcher's
heroic anti-planning, anti-interventionist political culture, the monument
to which is east London's Docklands, developed luxuriantly in a boom but now
mauled by recession and blighted by elementary failures of infrastructure
provision. It was also Thatcher who, in 1986, abolished the Greater London
Council, a bragging citadel of town hall socialism; not even the Labour
Party campaigns for its return.
The Rogers-Fisher book calls for a strong planning regime for the capital,
along Parisian lines. Everyone, it seems, prefers Paris. Europe, Rogers
argues, is again becoming a continent of city states and London, the only
capital without a metropolitan government, is mired in mediocrity.
But it is not only from the left that a torrent of tracts has poured. From
the London Chamber of Commerce has come a series of thick, buff books
worrying about the collapse of the capital's manufacturing base, its patchy
record on training and its shell-shocked public education system.
'People haven't thought enough about the challenge to London from other
European cities,' says Jacqueline Ginnane, the chamber's chief economist,
'but there is no doubt that the lack of government is weakening London's
identity.'
Probably the most ambitious attempt to gauge the capital's difficulties is
the London: World City report published last year by the London Planning
Advisory Committee, a rump agency with just 22 staff based in Romford - a
dowdy borough on the city's eastern fringe. The committee is all that
remains of the GLC planning juggernaut and is run on a tight leash by
London's 33 borough councils, Its report seeks to rank London's performance
against Paris, New York, Tokyo, Frankfurt and Berlin.
Although the study notes the capital's formidable strength in financial
services, telecommunications and air transport, as well as its sometimes
under-re - only Berlin has more parkland - it concludes gingerly that
'somewhere along the line, London appears to have lost direction and a sense
of its worth.'
The committee's 'agenda for action' includes better links between business
and education; dramatically-improved transport; more co-ordinated training;
more housing for the lower paid; and a promotional agency for London,
designed, no doubt, to avoid revisiting the sort of debacle which made
Manchester Britain's bidder to host the Olympics. But the proposal that dare
not quite speak its name is concealed in this sentence: 'Current
institutional arrangements are unsatisfactory and the world city initiatives
of other cities all indicate that a serious review of, and some changes to,
current arrangements are desirable.'
This is a masterpiece of draftsmanship from a body with members including
high-Tory Westminster, still-loony-after-all-these-years Lambeth, the rich
but archaic City of London Corporation, sensible Labour boroughs, and
resolutely suburban Tory strongholds like Croydon.
Behind the report lies the fact that the capital's political, business and
cultural establishment agrees, very largely, on what needs to be done -
better transport, housing and 'a voice for London.' But it disagrees
violently about the best form of government to achieve these things.
Rogers, whose vision includes burying miles of London roads inside tunnels
in order to open up new squares and parks at the city's heart, says: 'I
would like to see a new partnership between business, politics and citizens.
Market forces aren't sufficient - our big slabs of glass are a direct
response to market forces.' To which shopkeeper and restaurateur Sir Terence
Conran adds, gazing from the balcony of his Thames-side offices at Butler's
Wharf: 'The concept of an organisation on this scale without a board of
management is ridiculous, But I would love it to be non-political.'
A similar thought seems to have motivated the Confederation of British
Industry, which has proposed that London be overseen by a giant development
agency made up of business leaders and others appointed by the Environment
Secretary.
This debate has now taken its place in the general election campaign. Labour
has made the running by proposing a directly-elected Greater London
Authority, with only supervisory responsibility for transport, planning,
economic development, policing, fire services, environment, promotion, arts
and culture. The GLA, it is promised, would be much nimbler than the GLC; it
could have proportional representation and professional councillors. Labour
also wants to strip the Corporation of London of its local government
powers. The corporation's crime appears to be that it is too rich, too
obscure in its democratic procedures, and an impediment to the broader
reforming purpose.
The City's defenders say it provides the best services in London, essential
to nurturing the international financial community. Critics say the only
reason it can remove rubbish from Cheapside, a main commercial thoroughfare,
five times a day, when other parts of London can scarcely remember when last
they saw a cleaning truck, is because it is privileged financially.
The Conservative prescription is to formalise existing arrangements whereby,
in effect, central government is London's strategic governing body. In
future, there would be a cabinet sub-committee for London, with the
Environment Secretary in the chair and a junior minister for London public
transport at his right hand. A promotional agency also is proposed.
Londoners will know soon which of these two approaches they are to
experience. The polling evidence suggests they desire 'a voice for London'
strongly, but Labour's poor electoral record in London in the past 10 years
also makes them fear a revival in the animal spirits of the Labour municipal
left.
It is not easy to explain why London has found it so difficult to secure a
settled form of government. Some think it goes back a millenium - to
embattled monarchs in the Tower of London to the east, the rising political
class in Westminster to the west, and the merchants in between, all pursuing
their interests jealously. Others repeat the cliche that London is a
collection of villages. It is true that no consensus exists on either the
internal or external boundaries of the city.
To some extent, London's problems are essentially those of Britain,
magnified. The crisis in education and training, and a centralising
government's assault on the fiscal autonomy of local government, are by no
means exclusive to the capital. But London is special, if only in size and
international connection.
'Major change requires huge sums of money, which will always be controlled
by government. It is naive to believe otherwise,' says Sir Peter Bowness,
Tory leader of Croydon Council.
Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, and a prime
mover in the better London debate, thinks none of the political parties has
thought the matter through. He and a small, private group of other London
notables are busy drawing up their own blueprint for the capital's
government. He sees a flexible supervisory body with 'a directly-elected
element' and is 'radical without being abolitionist' about the Corporation
of London. He declines to answer the critical question about funding, but
must know that any body depending for cash upon either the boroughs or
central government will be as fatally weak as the GLC.
History, alas, suggests that none of these bright new ideas will last. As a
study by the London School of Economics study for the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation concluded glumly last year: 'No system of London government has
yet been capable of providing a robust and long-lasting solution. It is
possible that such a thing does not exist.'
Tony Travers, one of the authors of the LSE-Rowntree report, thinks
Londoners might do best to think practical thoughts rather than pursuing
unreachable ideals of government structure. 'If the tube worked as well as
in Paris, a large proportion of the problem would go away,' he claims. David
Bayliss, London Transport's chief planner, says that is exactly what
Londoners can expect by the end of the decade. With an investment programme
heading for Pounds 750m a year, London is in the middle of its biggest tube
investment boom since before the Second World War. Bayliss, an old GLC man,
says: 'it's relatively easy to lay down good policy; the lesson of the GLC
is the difficulty of implementation.' That, unfortunately, is not an
observation with much political sex appeal.
It does not do, however, to be too gloomy. Unless you are part of that
minority condemned to live in stained concrete tower blocks, London has a
great deal going for it. The biggest, most diverse arts scene anywhere. An
absence of no-go areas, even in its most ill-treated parts. The view from
Primrose Hill at dusk. Even London's behaviour towards the homeless at least
stops short of water cannon, which cannot be said of some other European
cities.
In the end, cities get the politics - and, indeed, the buildings - they
deserve. VS Pritchett, in his 1962 essay London Perceived, wrote: 'London is
before anything else the world's market . . . This no doubt explains why
London is the least splendid, the least ostentatious, of capitals.'
A couple of weeks ago, I was talking about this article over lunch. We were
vigorously debating the potential democratic dimensions of the new London
when the waitress came to take our order. 'The great thing about
government,' she said, 'is that we never get as much as we pay for. Mark
Twain said that.'
She told us she came from Pennsylvania. A true Londoner.

FT  28 MAR 92 / The Long View: Canary that could not fly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME-HONOURED justification for investing in land is that 'they ain't
making it any more.' But when it comes to developed property the supply is
not always so restricted. Right now 'they' have made far too much of it.
This week the world's biggest speculative real estate developer, Olympia &amp;
York, has been forced to begin restructuring its debt of some Dollars 20bn,
which is nearly Dollars 1,000 for every citizen of Canada, the company's
base. As the saying goes, if you cannot repay Dollars 1,000 it is your
problem, but if you cannot repay Dollars 20bn then it is the bankers'
problem. The next step is that it becomes the politicians' problem.
In Britain, especially, there has been a colossal mistake over property.
London is, of course, the site of Olympia &amp; York's most spectacular white
elephant at Canary Wharf, the flashing tower of which is tantalisingly
visible from the City, but frustratingly hard to reach. Quite apart from
that East End folly the City has an office vacancy rate of some 20 per cent.
Empty blocks loom everywhere, including one near the Financial Times. There
is said to be 30m square feet of vacant office space in central London.
Never mind, you might say, even if money is lost on such ventures, at least
the over-investment in commercial property could be put to good use. With
vast quantities of cheap, high quality space available the City ought to be
able to prosper mightily, given that in the past its high accommodation
costs have proved a serious competitive handicap.
But having made one appalling mistake the property industry is intent on
making another. Most City businesses are locked into long leases of up to 25
years on which rents can never go down. True, new tenants can shop around
for bargains but, even so, many developers are unwilling to drop their
asking rents to the market clearing level. The rent, multiplied according to
a formula, sets the value of the building. In many cases to accept the going
rate would be to admit bankruptcy, so it can seem better to both the
developer and his bankers to leave the property empty and pretend that a
market recovery is just around the corner. The way things are going, a vast
amount of space could remain empty for years.
Property crashes are nothing new, and there was an example almost as bad in
London in the mid-1970s. But that took place in an inflationary environment.
Interest rates peaked at about 15 per cent but inflation at one stage
reached 27 per cent. Those property companies that survived the immediate
crisis found that interest rates had fallen into single figures and they
could wait for rents and values to recover.
Today's situation is quite different. Interest rates are in double figures
even though inflation is only 4 per cent; in fact, rental inflation is
strongly negative, at about minus 10 per cent over the past year for office
space, nationally, and perhaps minus 25 per cent in the City of London.
Capital values have fallen even faster. If your liabilities are rolling up
at 10 to 15 per cent a year and your assets are declining at similar (or
worse) rates you cannot stay solvent very long, at any rate if you are as
dependent on bank finance as the typical property developer is.
Banks in Britain have a relatively small liability to Olympia &amp; York, but
total UK banking lending to the property sector has reached Pounds 40bn,
having quadrupled inside 5 years. The total appears to have stabilised, but
the quality of this lending must be deteriorating all the time. How can the
banks ever get their money back? Property is highly illiquid, as millions of
home owners know to their cost; forced sales could send values crashing
further.
The property disaster happened because banks financed a large number of
different projects without having proper regard for the overcapacity that
was being generated; the banks also failed to understand the risks they were
taking in financing aggressive entrepreneurs.
Furthermore the banks were too complacent about the eventual demand for
completed and let property from long-term investors. Pension funds, for
instance, used to be big investors in real estate: in 1979 the average fund
had 22 per cent of its assets in UK property. But only a few of the biggest
pension funds now own a lot of property. The typical fund has just 3 or 4
per cent of its portfolio in commercial real estate. Nor is this likely to
change, unless property values reach giveaway levels.
According to a survey by Godwins, the pension consultants, 89 per cent of
investment managers see growth in share prices over the next year, and 82
per cent expect gilts to go up, but only 35 per cent feel the same way about
property.
Still, there was a certain amount of bargain hunting last year by UK
institutions, which invested probably about Pounds 2.5bn - a modest sum
indeed by the standards of the overhang of bank finance.
With the market opened up, property has become much riskier. As far as the
investment institutions are concerned commercial property has become vastly
downgraded as an investment over the past 25 years or so.
Once, a prime quality office block was regarded as an inflation-proof asset
in a market where an artificial scarcity was maintained by planners: rental
yields of 4 or 5 per cent were accepted.
It is different now, with sterling in a low-inflation currency bloc, and the
market glutted. There is nervous talk of 'crossover' with gilt-edged yields
on the grounds that for the foreseeable future a property investment will
carry a fixed income, and some risk on top. An average yield of just over 9
per cent has not quite reached gilt levels, however.
The property collapse is a postscript to Thatcherism: private sector
entrepreneurs celebrated new freedoms without realising that higher risks
required more prudent financing arrangements. A post-Thatcherite government
may have to pick up the pieces, if only as cheap office space for civil
servants.

FT  28 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between British Gas and its regulator have been strained for a
while now, so the market has grown used to their robust exchanges of views.
Hence in part its calm response to what appeared an intemperate outburst
from Ofgas in response to Thursday's news that Gas intends merely to freeze,
rather than cut, prices for domestic consumers.
Equally, this close to the election shares in utilities are bound to react
more to the polls than to evidence that the regulator may be back on the
warpath. Gas has already suffered more from regulatory intervention than any
of its peers, so it is in relatively little danger from political change.
On a more general level, the price freeze raises the question of how Gas
might fare in a period of sustained low inflation. It seems logical that its
present price formula of 5 percentage points below inflation will become
increasingly punitive as the retail price index falls. Unless it succeeds in
its campaign to re-cast the formula, Gas will presumably have to accelerate
job cuts in order to meet the target. Its shares will continue to yield well
above the market average because Gas will show slower than average dividend
growth. Their present prospective yield of nearly 8 per cent suggests they
are already discounting that conventional thinking.
But Gas has defied such expectations before, and could do so in future
depending on the success of its nascent exploration activity. Even if its
scope for dividend growth is only marginally greater than the market view
assumes, its shares should interest investors brave enough to be looking for
value ahead of the election.

FT  28 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Paribas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least Paribas does not appear greatly exposed to Olympia &amp; York. That is
small comfort, though, following yesterday's pessimistic warning from
chairman Andre Levy-Lang that the French investment bank's provisions will
be hefty again in 1992. The damage this time, in large part due to worries
about the French and UK property markets, will not be on the scale of last
year's FFr9.5bn hit. That included FFr2.8bn of special provisions for the
Swiss unit, mainly to cover Maxwell and risky Swiss real estate loans. The 4
per cent slide in Paribas shares yesterday reflected disappointed hopes of a
meaningful fall in the underlying figure this year.
Since the apparent abandonment of the time-honoured French tradition of
income smoothing as part of the new management's clean-up campaign, the
Paribas numbers have become notoriously hard to predict. All indications
suggest that French loan demand is weak and competition for deposits will
intensify,though leasing and syndicated loan margins have started to look
healthier.
The key to the shares, on the other hand, will probably be the industrial
portfolio, notably Ciments Francais/Poliet which is strongly geared to a US
upturn. In retrospect, the cement restructuring move was rather unhappily
timed, though as with Suez the Paribas assets now have a more cyclical feel.
The question for long-term investors is whether they want to be in either
sprawling conglomerate, or whether they should leave the shares to traders
and build up their own portfolio.

FT  28 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Heron
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when banks thought they might have seen the last of the large problem
borrowers, two more have popped out of the woodwork. Even though its worries
revolve around London's Canary Wharf, Olympia &amp; York is more a problem for
Canadian and US lenders. Heron International's difficulties strike closer to
home, which explains why shares in Barclays shed nearly 4 per cent
yesterday. Signs are Heron will also be a particularly difficult case for
its bankers.
The company is at pains to stress that it has ample liquidity. But the
proceeds of recent disposals, including both service stations and Spanish
property, should more than cover interest on the group's Pounds 1.3bn debt.
So its restructuring request implies a distinctly gloomy view of the ability
of its recession-bound UK property, home-building and car sales divisions to
generate enough cash to stem the outflow from its loss-making US interests.
Finding a solution will be all the harder because it requires the
co-operation of investors in Heron's Pounds 350m-worth of Swiss franc bonds.
Bank lenders to Brent Walker know how difficult it is to enlist the
collaboration of bond investors in a rescheduling. Swiss bond investors
require anonymity and rarely display much social conscience in debt
work-outs. Their market is thus a particularly tough nut to crack, as
borrowers like Costa Rica and the Bond Corporation have already found. On
top of that comes the need to unravel a plethora of interest rate and
currency swaps. The rescheduling is likely to take the sort of time which
Heron and its bankers can ill afford.

FT  28 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Poll paralysis hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Were it not for the election, equities might be discounting a modest
recovery. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey suggests a
slight improvement in manufacturers' order books. Companies like Booker and
United Newspapers have muttered vaguely positive things about current
trading when reporting their results. The trade figures revealed buoyant
imports of capital goods. But it makes no sense for equities to take this on
board before the election.
The conventional wisdom is that ERM membership means the UK's long-term
economic prospects will be little different whoever wins. However, the
short-run ride could be rough if a Tory defeat forced an interest rate rise.
The impact on consumer confidence of higher mortgage rates would defer the
recovery, probably until 1993. Meanwhile government borrowing would soar.
One temptation for Mr John Smith might be devaluation, but, to keep
inflation down, that would need an accompanying squeeze on government
spending. Amid the uncertainty the equity market is inevitably inclined to
head lower. One consolation is that the more a Tory defeat is discounted in
advance, the less of a shock there will be if it happens. Another is that
stocks with large US exposure like RTZ and Siebe still seem able to ride out
the storm.

FT  28 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Reflective phase follows resilience to
rate rise - Talk of the beginning of a bull market in Germany is tempered by
gloomy caveats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the last quarter of 1991 investors lived in fear of an aggressive
interest rate move from the Bundesbank. When the move did come it was more
aggressive than expected - a half-point rise in both Lombard and discount
rates - and yet the German stock and bond markets responded positively.
As in the German Bund market, investors, predominantly overseas
institutions, took the central bank's move as evidence of its determination
to beat down inflation. They calculated this was as far as interest rates
would have to go, and bought shares and government securities in
anticipation of rate cuts in the spring or early summer.
Further positive impetus for German equities came from the rise of Wall
Street share prices in the first two months of the year. The DAX index
climbed to a peak of 1,772 in early March, outperforming other European
share markets in the process. It has slipped back to around 1,710 since then
 -still an increase of just under 9 per cent since the beginning of the
year.
In the past few weeks, the high volumes which induced the rally have fallen
back and the market has entered one of its periodic reflective phases.
Investors are once again scrutinising the contradictory indicators, and
asking themselves whether they are in for a prolonged bout of stagnation or
if they stand at the very beginning of a glorious bull market.
'We are sure we are in a bull market,' said Mr Gunter Kirchhain of Deutsche
Bank's Dusseldorf-based institutional equities team, at an investment
symposium in Berlin on Thursday. In its latest report on Germany, Goldman
Sachs is also optimistic, saying that the DAX index ought to rise to 2,000
over the next 12 months. But both Goldman and Deutsche Bank temper their
enthusiasm by saying that the surge in share prices will not happen
overnight.
Indeed, as Mr Kirchhain outlined to his audience of international investors,
there is much to be glum about. The negative factors include:
The west German economy is slowing down. Deutsche Bank is predicting growth
of just over 1 per cent this year. Without unequivocal - and sustainable -
recovery in the US, there is no chance the German economy will be bailed out
by a demand for exports.
Domestically, the impetus to west German growth caused by reunification is
running out of steam.
Economic difficulties are reflected in poor company profits. Hardly a day
goes by without some large German company issuing dreadful figures for last
year and bemoaning the outlook for the current year.
Veba, the energy group which announced a dividend rise on Wednesday is a
rarity in the industrial sector. Collectively, German companies' earnings
are likely to rise between 0 and 3 per cent this year.
The banking sector is enjoying a boom, but Deutsche Bank alone among the
bigger banks has had the courage to put up its dividend.
The outlook for interest rates is not as encouraging as it may have seemed
shortly before Christmas. Money supply growth is higher than the Bundesbank
would like, and the 6.35 per cent pay settlement for steel workers is not an
encouraging signal for the rest of the wage round.
Inflation is likely to reach a peak of 4.7 per cent for March and April,
before dropping back 'decisively' to below 4 per cent in the second half of
the year, according to Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.
He said the Bundesbank would not move to cut money market rates until June
at the earliest. Thereafter the need for finance to rebuild the eastern
Lander would keep pressure on interest rates over the longer term.
The market's rise this year is explained by the fact that investors are
already looking beyond these short-term problems and anticipating 'another
decade of double-digit earnings growth', as Mr Kirchhain put it this week.
They are expecting interest rates to come down later this year; they are
anticipating a US-led world economic recovery; they are expecting German
companies to come out of this year's recession leaner and fitter; they
believe that over the next decade German industry will be the beneficiary of
demand for capital goods, not just in the five new Lander, but in the whole
of eastern Europe; and they are anticipating the benefits of the EC's single
market programme.
Thus Deutsche Bank is forecasting economic growth of a full 3 per cent in
the western part of Germany next year, and earnings growth of 12 to 15 per
cent. With the DAX at the 1,710 level, this puts shares on a prospective
multiple for 1993 of somewhere in the low teens - arguably reasonable when
compared to 18 or 19 for the current year.
Both Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs think that the market may have got
ahead of itself in anticipating recovery - Mr Kirchhain even went so far as
to say that equity valuations look dangerously high in relation to long Bund
yields. But both institutions believe that now is not a bad time to buy
German equities, even if there is a risk that the market will stagnate for
some months.

FT  28 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls to
five-year closing low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
THE NIKKEI average fell to a new five-year closing low, as small-lot selling
by companies and investment trusts depressed share prices amid thin volume,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 248.50 at 19,636.99, the lowest since
February 1987 and down 2.7 per cent on the week. The index briefly hit the
day's high of 19,942.79 but fell on light selling to the day's low of
19,587.11 just before the close.
Volume remained at 180m shares. Foreign investors, who had been steady
buyers during the past few weeks, were absent. A foreign broker said that
the weakness in the Nikkei could prompt foreign investors to reassess their
asset allocations.
Declines outnumbered advances by 678 to 278 with 154 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 18.63 to 1,428.13 and in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.44 to 1,119.58.
Market participants were discouraged by comments by government officials
'talking down' hopes pinned to an economic stimulus package due to be
announced next week. An official of the Economic Planning Agency said that
the business sector was more bearish towards the economy than actual
economic conditions warranted, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister,
said long-term interest rates were declining steadily.
Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said next week's announcement held
critical importance in judging the government's attitude towards reviving
the economy.
Rumours of financial trouble at a leading non-bank financial institution due
to extensive investments in speculative issues also depressed share prices.
Speculative favourites plunged on the rumours. Minebea, the most active
issue of the day, fell Y44 to Y465 and Clarion plunged Y130 to Y910.
High-technology issues were lower on small-lot liquidations by institutional
investors. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y780 and Matsushita Electric Industrial
declined Y10 to Y1,270.
Mitsubishi Motors fell Y38 to Y612 on news that Chrysler, the US car maker
had sold 43.6m shares, or half of its stake, in Mitsubishi for Y27.5bn.
Light index selling depressed Nikkei index component stocks with low
liquidity. Shimura Kako fell Y100 to Y780 and Godo Shusei retreated Y130 to
Y1,140.
Drug related stocks lost ground on the sharp fall of Mochida Pharmaceutical,
which fell Y490 to Y3,160 on selling by short-term players. Meiji Milk
Products lost Y37 to Y841 and Okamoto Industries fell Y40 to Y1,140.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 257.47 to 21,269.03 in volume of 107.9m
shares.
Roundup
ACTIVITY on the Pacific Rim was generally dull yesterday.
HONG KONG eased on some disappointing results from major companies. The Hang
Seng Index closed 30.13 lower at 5,007.58 for a 0.2 per cent fall on the
week. Turnover was HKDollars 2.39bn after HKDollars 2.57bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was unmoved by a clutch of results, preferring to wait for next
Tuesday's annual central bank economic report. The composite index fell 1.56
to 602.71, little changed on the week.
SEOUL rose for a second day, as buying concentrated on shares with low
price/earnings ratios. The composite index added 5.68 to 617.38, up 0.3 per
cent on the week, in heavy turnover of Won643.1bn.
AUSTRALIA closed firmer, helped by better-than-expected results from BHP
which rose 10 cents to ADollars 13.32. The All Ordinaries Index gained 5.2
to 1,576.4 in turnover of ADollars 471.6m, a 0.4 per cent rise on the week.
NEW ZEALAND recovered Thursday's decline and the NZSE-40 index closed up
22.4 to 1,412.83, for a 1.8 per cent fall on the week. Turnover remained low
at NZDollars 16.9m. Telecom gained 5 cents to NZDollars 2.23 and Fletcher
Challenge 7 cents to NZDollars 3.32.

FT  28 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses round off
week on easier note
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses eased in quiet trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed the week quietly, as the DAX index declined 7.57 to
1,711.45, for a fall of 1.4 per cent on the week, while the FAZ index,
calculated at midsession, eased 2.02 to 696.19, down 1.2 per cent on the
week. Turnover fell to DM4.1bn from DM5.2bn.
Bayer slipped DM4 to DM296.70 following the completion of a big buy order,
while Schering remained under pressure, falling DM9.80 to DM817. The holding
company Altana bucked the easier trend, adding DM10 to DM690 in a narrow
market.
PARIS was delayed by a technical problem just before the close. The CAC-40
index finally closed down 11.21 at 1,923.54, up 0.2 per cent on the week, in
modest turnover of FFr1.9bn.
Spie-Batignolles jumped FFr25.9 or 7.5 per cent to FFr372.9 on buying by
Meeschaert, a broker owned by the insurer, Axa, and by a domestic company
active in arbitrage. There has been speculation that Schneider might like to
sell off its stake in the ailing construction company.
Lafarge Coppee added FFr3.50 to FFr357.50 in relatively heavy volume of
303,110 shares which included two block trades totalling 65,000 shares.
Paribas dropped FFr15.60 or 3.9 per cent to FFr385.20 after news that the
bank would have to make more provisions in 1992.
Euro Disney, badly hit earlier in the week by a sell note from Goldman
Sachs, fell another FFr2.20 to FFr147.50.
ZURICH weakened, as higher interest rates dragged banks lower. CS Holding
bearers lost SFr25 to SFr1,920 and UBS bearers shed SFr30 to SFr3,690. The
market ignored a report by a research group which forecast that the economy
would recover in the second half. The SMI index lost 8.3 to 1,827.3, for a
0.5 per cent decline on the week .
Roche continued to outperform the chemicals sector and its bearers gained
SFr30 to SFr4,310 as investors anticipated a strong rise in profits when it
reports next month.
MILAN lost early gains due to weakness in Generali. The Comit index rose
just 0.77 to 497.74, for a fall of 2.7 per cent on the week, in turnover
estimated at L77bn after L84.4bn.
The session opened firmer, with Fiat rising L64 to L4,774 and Pirelli up L50
at L1,265, on optimism over the company's restructuring plans. But Generali
then depressed the market with a fall of L10 to L28,490.
Telecoms moved against the weaker trend with Sip gaining L6 to L1,374.
Benetton, which announced a 24 per cent rise in net profit, just ahead of
market expectations, gained L110 to L13,215.
Jolly Hotels fell L650 or 6.8 per cent to L8,900 after reporting a sharp
fall in 1991 consolidated net profit to L384m from L17.1bn. Rinascente, the
retailer controlled by the Fiat group, fell L173 to L6,470 after news of a
4.6 per cent rise in consolidated net profit.
AMSTERDAM saw intense activity in Daf and Nutricia. The food group plunged
Fl 12.50 or more than 7 per cent to Fl 159.50 following disappointing
results after the close on Thursday. The company forecast a slowdown in
growth this year and said that earnings will be cut by competition in its
dietary food sector.
Daf closed down Fl 1.80 at Fl 22.40 as investors took profits. James Capel
issued a sell note, saying that the company's expectations of a recovery in
the UK truck market might be optimistic.
The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.9 to 124.7, a decline of 0.8 per cent on the
week. Turnover was Fl 543.9m after Fl 485m.
BRUSSELS finished weaker with the Bel-20 Index falling 3.54 to 1,187.09 for
a 1.1 per cent fall on the week. There was interest in the retailing sector
as both Gib and Delhaize announced results after the close. GIB fell BFr2 at
BFr1,348 while Delhaize, which said it was planning a five-for-one share
split, ended BFr30 lower at BFr9,150.
STOCKHOLM's property sector was firmer on strong results from Lundbergs,
which saw its restricted shares advance SKr4 to SKr74, although Skanska B
shares slipped SKr1 to SKr112. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 2.8 to
1,006.9 but was down 0.2 per cent on the week. Turnover was SKr452m. Volvo B
shed SKr4 to SKr426.
MADRID moved ahead, with the general index up 1.14 at 256.71 but down 0.6
per cent on the week. Union Fenix gained Pta190 or 4.4 per cent to Pta4,450
on rumours of restructuring.
ISTANBUL fell 2.2 per cent following a four-day rise. The stock market index
ended at 4,129.05, down 92.98, but 3.5 per cent stronger on the week.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee market goes into reverse
 -Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE market's recent advance went into reverse this week, in spite of
a couple of distinctly bullish developments. The May futures position on the
London market had travelled hopefully from Dollars 795 to Dollars 886 a
tonne in response to signs the Brazil, the biggest producer, was at last
adopting a positive attitude to the revival of the moribund International
Coffee Agreement. But traders seem to have found the arrival of Brazil's new
policy something of an anti-climax. And they had already shrugged off
Brazil's forecast of a 28 per cent cut in its crop next season.
The upturn in prices began three weeks ago, after Brazilian coffee growers
voted in favour of the reintroduction of the agreement's export quota
scheme, which was suspended in July 1989. That was not very surprising;
growers are naturally more interested in encouraging higher prices rather
than in ensuring unfettered trade. Much more significance was attached,
however, to the following week's news that Brazilian exporters, concerned
about the impact of low prices on the prospects for the country's coffee
production, had abandoned their traditional opposition to export controls.
With both sides of the Brazilian coffee industry speaking with one voice for
a change the way was open for the government to formulate a clear policy for
price stabilisation. That policy was revealed on Thursday night and seems to
have been well enough received. Mr Jorge Cardenas, president of the
Colombian coffee growers' federation, described it as 'a very important step
in the process of negotiations towards a new International Coffee Agreement'
and London trade house GNI said it appeared to be 'a reasonable document,
agreeing on the need for a universal quota (covering all coffee exports) and
the establishment of a realistic price range'.
But the bullish trend had already run its course. On Thursday, as the market
awaited details of the Brazilian policy, the May futures price fell Dollars
14. And yesterday morning, as traders studied the proposals, it slipped
another Dollars 13. That fall was recovered in the afternoon, however, and
the price ended the day unchanged at Dollars 859 a tonne, Dollars 19 down on
the week.
The cocoa market fared still worse, with the May quotation ending Pounds 44
down on the week at Pounds 646 a tonne, an eight-month low. Some of the
fall, about Pounds 13, was explained by sterling's strength against the
dollar, but most of it simply reflected the deteriorating fundamental and
technical situations.
'Technically the picture looks terrible,' one London trader commented
yesterday. He said stop-loss selling orders had been triggered as prices
slipped following the May position's failure early in the week to break
through resistance near Pounds 700 a tonne.
Producer selling was also reported, and there was news of rain in West
African growing areas, which could benefit next season's crops.
This week's London meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation made
little progress towards a resumption of effective price stabilisation
efforts. But that was as expected and had no discernible market impact.
At the London Metal Exchange most interest was focussed on the zinc market,
which was boosted by hedge selling early in the week and surged to 15-month
highs yesterday on a reassessment of last year's demand situation by the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group.
The study group adjusted its figure for 1991 zinc consumption from 5.25m
tonnes, which would have been unchanged from the previous year, to 5.34m
tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking
group, described the news as 'dynamite'. He said it showed that the zinc
market was 'much more robust' than had generally been thought.
Traders seemed to be similarly impressed. The three months LME price, which
had dipped to Dollars 1,255.50 a tonne at the lunch-time ring, closed at
Dollars 1,263.50 a tonne and moved up to Dollars 1,275.50 a tonne in
after-hours trading, taking the overall rise on the week to Dollars 41 a
tonne.
At the London bullion market the gold price staged a tentative rally
following last week's heavy fall. An early rise reflecting consumer buying
ran into producer selling at Dollars 340 a troy ounce, but that barrier was
breached on Wednesday, with the aid of US computer fund buying, and the
price ended the week Dollars 2.75 up at Dollars 341.80 an ounce.

FT  28 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talk surrounds Racal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Very heavy turnover in security and telecommunications group Racal
Electronics, combined with a rise in the share price against the market,
prompted a number of market observers to cast around for a bidder.
The shares were the most heavily traded in the London market yesterday with
more than 13.5m dealt and they rose 3 1/4 to 58 1/4 p. This followed a rise
of 2p on turnover of 10m on Thursday.
Market commentators believe that industrial conglomerate Tomkins, which was
previously thought to have offered around Pounds 500m for Racal's Chubb
subsidiary, may launch a 65p a share bid for the whole company - possibly
next week.
In December Williams Holdings, which still holds 10 per cent of Racal made a
three-for-20 share offer which ultimately valued each Racal share at 54.8p.
Mr Brian Newman, an electronics specialist with agency broker Henderson
Crosthwaite said; 'Racal only just defeated the previous bid and if Tomkins
were to bid at 65p they would stand a good chance.'
Barclays slide
Concern over its debt exposure affected Barclays Bank which slumped 13 to
322p on particularly heavy turnover of more than 10m shares.
Property company Heron International said it was seeking the extension of
maturity dates for some of its debts of at least Pounds 1.3bn. The market
estimates that Barclays is owed around Pounds 250m.
There is also a feeling that Barclay's exposure to troubled Canadian
property company Olympia &amp; York could be greater than feared.
However, Mr John Aitken, a banking analyst at County NatWest said that,
after conversations with the bank, he had good reason to believe the Heron
figure was more in the region of Pounds 125m.
He added that most of the clearing banks would have an exposure.
The news comes at a time when it was hoped that most of the banks' bad debt
news was already out in the open and discounted. NatWest Bank, which some
observers said could have a Pounds 150m exposure to the Heron debt, fell 7
to 280p.
Waters gain
Water stocks, perhaps the most sensitive sector to the political climate,
shrugged off yesterday's disappointing opinion poll news for the
Conservative government. The shares resisted a weak market, showing small
gains, as BZW said that although political risk has added uncertainty in the
short term little change in policy is likely in the immediate few months
after the general election, regardless of who leads the government.
Smith New Court recently pointed out that water companies will have to spend
about Pounds 40bn in nominal terms in the next ten years and that a Labour
government could not realistically take on this investment programme.
Southern gained 6 to 326p, with Thames up 2 at 446p, while Seven Trent and
North West both put on a penny to 323p and 342p respectively. Wessex, the
weakest performing water stock earlier this month, continued to recover on
the back of its waste disposal joint venture, rising 4 to 398p.
Lonrho weak again
Conglomerate Lonrho fell for the second day running following Thursday's
sale to Libya of a stake in its Metropole hotel chain, and a profit forecast
cut from its broker.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reduced its 1992 profit estimate by Pounds 25m to Pounds
125m for the year to end September after Lonrho warned of a tough first half
at its annual meeting on Thursday. The house also reduced its dividend
forecast by 2p to 8p. Lonrho's shares fell 8 to 87p on heavy turnover of
more than 10m shares.
Midland Bank bucked a weak market to rise 2 1/2 p to 350p after news that
the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation, which hopes to merge with
Midland, had reached an agreement in principle for a dual primary listing in
Hong Kong and London.
More analysts cut their forecasts on TSB. County NatWest reduced its 1992
forecast by Pounds 60m to Pounds 200m and the shares slipped 2 to 128p.
Royal Bank of Scotland fell 10 to 164p after two securities houses turned
negative on the stock.
SG Warburg reduced its forecast for the year ending September 1992 by Pounds
50m to Pounds 80m and maintained the stock as a hold but was not prepared to
comment on reasons behind the change. Also, Smith New Court recommended a
switch out of Royal Bank into Bank of Scotland arguing that the latter had
underperformed Royal Bank by 18 per cent over the past quarter. Bank of
Scotland was unchanged at 105p.
Conglomerate Trafalgar House rose 8 to 127p after traders were caught with
short positions following an abortive bear raid earlier in the week. Oner of
the US investment banks was said to be among those short of stock as a brisk
1.8m shares changed hands.
Aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce, denying any industrial trouble at its Derby
plant, edged a penny to 155p.
Late talk in the market hinted that Eurotunnel, which had advanced this week
on hopes that it would join the CAC-40 index in Paris, is close to agreeing
terms with its contractors over the payment of extra costs for building the
Channel tunnel.
Sketchy details emerging suggested that agreement had been reached on Pounds
400m of the Pounds 1.2bn claimed by the contracting consortium TML - and
that no equity stake was involved. It is believed that TML is likely to
settle for around 70 per cent of the remaining Pounds 800m. The shares
slipped a penny to 438p.
Food companies and supermarket groups showed defensive attractions at a time
of political uncertainty. A positive note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew continued
to support J. Sainsbury, up 3 at 390p, with Wm Morrison climbing another 6
to 334p, following Thursday's good figures, Kwik Save gaining 4 to 543p and
Tesco 1 1/2 to 257 1/2 p. A buy recommendation from County NatWest helped
lift Booker 7 to 437p.
A bad week for Euro Disney ended with the shares a further 22 off at 1523p.
The stock has been weak following adverse press comment and a downgrade by
Goldman Sachs.
Profit-taking in Rank Organisation, which had benefited on Thursday from a
Smith New Court buy recommendation, saw the leisure group tumble 14 to 646p.
Troubled gambling machine group Kunick was busy after Mason Hill Asset
Management of New York bought a 5.6 per cent stake in the 8.25p Preference
Shares. The ordinaries lost a halfpenny to 7p in volume of 1.2m.
There was renewed, but largely disregarded, bid talk surrounding the holiday
group stocks, with the focus on Airtours, a penny easier at 264p, Eurocamp,
2 firmer at 308p, and Owners Abroad off 2 at 107 1/2 p.
Continuing caution over its Virgin deal saw Thorn EMI 10 adrift at 730p.
Monument Oil &amp; Gas was one of the market's heaviest traded stocks, with a
block of 5m shares said to have been sold into the market.
The shares settled  1/2 off at 29 1/4 p.

FT  28 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL worries returned to the futures market yesterday, sidelining
investors and undermining prices, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE contract opened at 2,458 and, in an early rally, hit the
day's high of day of 2,462. It then proceeded to drift for the rest of the
day, led by the cash market and undermined by reports of a favourable
opinion poll for the Labour party in London marginal constituencies.
A weak Wall Street also dragged at sentiment, and by early afternoon March
was trading at 2,450. Any attempt to trade at a premium to the cash market
was quickly quashed as March was sold down, typically trading at a 4 to
5-point discount.
March closed at 2,444, a fall of 22 on the previous session and a discount
to the cash market of around 4 points. Volume was a quiet 5,797 contracts,
although there was a surge in after-hours trading, with March continuing to
be sold down.
On the traded options market, trading was quiet with 23,090 lots dealt
against 28,000 on the previous day. Business was enlivened by brisk trade in
Lonrho and BTR.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dropped sharply yesterday in European trading and was also
suffering in New York at DM 1.6445/52 and Y133.14/19 mid-session in New
York, writes Andrew Jack.
In low-volume Asian trading, the dollar had weakened slightly against the
yen and firmed against the d-mark, with most trading being pre-weekend
position adjustments, according to dealers. It closed at Y133.85 and DM
1.6637.
During the day in London it had drifted below DM 1.66 after an early
speculative attempt to break DM 1.6620 failed. In the late afternoon in
London a single speculator, rumoured to be a south east Asian central bank,
sold dollars in a thin market. It closed at DM 1.6440 and Y133.15.
In New York, the release of mixed US economic data appeared to have little
effect on the dollar. February personal income rose 1.1 per cent, while
spending increased 0.9 per cent, against analysts' prediction of 0.7 per
cent and 0.8 per cent. Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, showed that the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed
mortgage was 8.98 per cent for the week ended March 27, down from 9.03 per
cent last week.
'The dollar is range-trading, trying to see what the lowest levels might
be,' said Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo bank in London. 'It
started falling before the numbers came out and was more driven by the
d-mark/yen. There is just routine dollar trading. It is very, very quiet
before the year end.'
Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical bank in London, said: 'The
main activity was selling of the dollar out of New York. 'It was purely
speculative trading in a narrow range and nothing to do with the economy.
There was some attempt to up it up yesterday which failed so now they were
selling again.' 'The big thing today was the d-mark/yen. There is still no
sign of the long expected Bank of Japan interest rate cut. The Bundesbank is
just keeps laying down the law. Its European monetary union conditions are
getting stricter and stricter, reflecting the public waking up to the
economic realities.'
The mark rose to an 11-week high of Y1.235 and 109.69/82 Swiss francs in
Frankfurt in afternoon trade. This was partly fuelled by a hawkish speech
from Herr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank board member, who told an
investment conference in Berlin that it would be intolerable if monetary
growth exceeded Bundesbank targets. This caused further speculative selling
of the dollar.
Sterling gained on the dollar fall, gaining more than one cent to close at
Dollars 1.7380 against Dollars 1.7260 at the start of trade. It dropped 0.19
pfennigs to close at DM 2.8581. The trade index closed up 0.1 and 90.2.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Longer rates firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER RATES firmed yesterday as the market digested the latest opinion poll
in the morning suggesting a strong swing to Labour in London's marginal
seats, writes Andrew Jack.
Early activity in most dates from one month to one year trickled away in
morning trading, while the Bank of England kept rates on shorter money down,
calming the volatility generated by continuing political uncertainty.
Overnight rates fell below 10 per cent during the day before settling back
to close at 10 1/4 -10 1/8 per cent.
Three month money eased on the opinion polls, closing at 10 13/16 -10 25/32
per cent down  1/8 per cent on the previous day.
One year money rose to 11 1/16 -10 15/16 per cent by the end of trading,
compared with 11-10 7/8 per cent on Thursday.
The June sterling contract continued its fall, closing at 88.98 against
Thursday's close of 89.08. It opened up at 89.11, and rose as high as 89.11.
At one point it dropped to 88.96, which dealers said was partly explained by
the opinion poll released during the day. The volume was the highest for
several days at 29,833.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 850m in the
morning, driven by Pounds 600m from a rise in note circulation, Pounds 573m
in treasury bills and maturing assistance, Pounds 205m in bankers balances
below target and Pounds 180m in bills for repurchase by the market, offset
by Pounds 685m of exchequer transactions.
The Bank of England purchased bills totalling Pounds 745m in early
operations, including Pounds 395m outright. It bought Pounds 15m in band-1
treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 267m bills in band-2 at Pounds
113m at 10 3/8 per cent as well as Pounds 350m for re-sale to the market on
April 7 at 10 7/16 per cent.
At midday it revised its forecast to a shortage of around Pounds 1bn before
taking account of early operations. It purchased a further Pounds 248m in
the market. These comprised Pounds 98m band-1 treasury bills at 10 3/8 per
cent and Pounds 150m bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank of England revised its forecast up further to
Pounds 1.1bn. It bought Pounds 126m band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. There
was no late assistance.
'The Bank of England has been providing assistance and will continue to do
so all the way to the election,' said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank.

FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Bank to gain dual
listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hongkong and Shanghai Bank has reached an agreement with both the Hong
Kong and London stock exchanges for it to have a primary listing on the two
exchanges in the event that its offer for Midland Bank is successful.
The Hongkong Bank said yesterday that if its offer - due within the next few
weeks - was accepted by Midland's shareholders, it would comply with those
regulations which impose the higher standard of disclosure, or the more
onerous requirements.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
colony's corporate watchdog, said the move would offer investors in Hong
Kong greater protection. They both supported the bank's application.
Mr Herbert Hui, of the Hong Kong exchange's listing division, said the
bank's decision would remove doubts about the regulatory authority for HSBC
Holdings - the Hongkong Bank's holding company which will own Midland.
The bank said the dual primary listing - which it believes to be unique -
would ensure that its shares are traded on both exchanges.
The move was seen, however, as a necessary one if, as expected, the Hongkong
Bank's offer for Midland is a straight share swap. The bank would want to
offer Midland shareholders equity which was regulated in the same way as
that which they were giving up, analysts said.
The Hongkong Bank last week proposed a merger to Midland, bringing to an end
more than four years of discussion about a link-up. It is expected to
disclose the terms its offer for Midland within the next few weeks.
Hong Kong's listing rules are based on London's and the implications for
Hongkong Bank of submitting to UK rules are not great. Differences between
the two exchanges' rules are largely those of detail, not thrust or intent.
Some of the main differences relate to the definition of a discloseable
transaction, and the interest of directors in a company's shares.

FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: SocGen to leave central Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, the French commercial bank, is to move out of its
prestigious central Paris office and into a new FFr5bn (Dollars 883.3m)
headquarters, in the city's largest property transaction.
The spectacular deal gives a lift to the flagging property market in La
Defense, the modern business district on Paris' western boundary.
Societe Generale is the latest of several large companies with plans to move
out of central Paris to seek cheaper and roomier offices in and around La
Defense, but activity has slowed sharply over the past 18 months.
Societe Generale's new headquarters, to house 5,400 staff from early 1995,
will be two 38-storey tower blocks behind the Grande Arche, the square white
marble arch which forms the focal point of La Defense. The move is to take
place in three years.
However, the deal casts a shadow over the central Paris property market,
through the prospect of the 200,000 square metres to come vacant as Societe
Generale's central services move out of their 50 offices spread across the
city.
The bank will keep a branch in its present headquarters in the Boulevard
Haussman, Paris' traditional banking district, but has not yet decided what
to do with the rest.
'This will certainly dynamise the market in La Defense, but it will increase
stocks in central Paris, even if over a long period,' said Mr Philippe
Bastien, analyst at James Capel.
Societe Generale's central Paris property portfolio was worth between
FFr10bn and FFr12bn, he estimated. That is roughly 30 per cent down on its
worth 18 months ago when the commercial property market started to go into
decline under the twin pressures of high values and oversupply.
Recent transactions are at around FFr60,000 per square metre, against around
FFr90,000 in mid-1990, sometimes rising to FFr120,00 for the best locations.
Societe Generale could be expected to await an upturn and sell its
properties in small amounts so as to avoid weakening the market, said
analysts.
Its portfolio is small in relation to the overall stock of potentially
vacant property, but it is concentrated in a small central area around the
so-called 'golden triangle'.
The new headquarters is being developed by Sari - a subsidiary of water and
services group Compagnie Generale des Eaux - headed by Mr Christian
Pellerin. He was recently charged with aiding and abetting financial
irregularities in another property transaction at La Defense.
The deal indicates a warming in relations between Societe Generale and Mr
Pellerin, who supported an abortive attempt to seize control of the bank
four years ago.

BENETTON, the leading Italian casual clothing concern, raised net group
profits by 23.6 per cent to L164.8bn (Dollars 131.8m) last year, thanks to
higher sales and improved financial management.
Group turnover rose by almost 12 per cent to L2,303bn despite increasingly
difficult market conditions. Benetton sold 83m items last year through a
chain of over 6,500 shops in 100 countries.
The rise in earnings has prompted a L50 increase in the dividend to L300 a
share, a decision which will be welcomed in financial markets.
In 1991, Benetton surprised analysts by slashing its dividend by half to
L250 in a drive to reinforce self-financing at a time of strong growth.
The effect of tougher financial controls and a lower payout to shareholders
was evident in the group's balance sheet, with net debt falling to L171bn at
the end of 1991 from L233bn in 1990. The burden of net interest costs fell
to 1.8 per cent of sales, from 2.2 per cent in 1990.
Benetton drew attention to its controversial advertising campaign, dedicated
'to universal themes of a social character', which it said had helped to
reinforce a homogeneous international image for the group. Spending on
advertising and sponsorship amounted to L108.2bn last year.
Sales of its Sisley brand rose particularly strongly, with a 34 per cent
increase.

<TEXT>
APPLE Computer will join forces with Sharp of Japan to produce the first of
a new class of pocket-sized electronic devices. The trans-Pacific
partnership gives substance to the much-heralded convergence of the computer
and consumer electronics industries, both of which are looking for new
sources of growth.
'Strategic partnerships like this one will be the key to business success as
the gap between personal computers and consumer electronics products
continues to close,' said Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief
executive.
The two companies have set up product development teams and are aiming to
put their first personal electronic devices on the market early next year,
with different versions to be sold under both Sharp and Apple brand labels.
Details of the planned product, dubbed as 'personal information management',
remain a closely guarded secret. However, the device is expected to
incorporate an electronic calendar and phone book and be capable of sending
and receiving messages.
It will be a hand-held device and will probably incorporate a pen, rather
than a keyboard, for entering data. It is expected to sell in the US for
less than Dollars 1,000.
The joint development effort will combine the strengths of both parties.
Sharp is a leader in personal electronics products such as its Wizard
electronic organiser. The Japanese company also has expertise in key
technologies such as flat panel displays.
Apple is known for its innovative software that makes computer technology
easy to use.
Under the agreement signed in Tokyo on Friday by the two companies, Apple
will grant Sharp a licence to use new software specifically designed for use
in its new family of personal electronics products.
Terms of the agreement were not revealed, but Sharp is expected to pay
royalties to Apple for use of its software.
Apple also plans to license this as-yet unreleased software to other
parties. Sony of Japan is said to be another potential Apple licensee.
Apple announced in January that it intended to enter the consumer
electronics field with a new class of products that bridge the gap between
personal computers and consumer electronics.
These products would essentially be single-function, hand-held computers and
could include , for example, electronics books, electronic organisers,
multimedia players, electronic note takers, display telephones or personal
communicators.
Apple has formed a new business group to pursue the consumer electronics
market, separate from its established Macintosh personal computer business.
In addition to the joint development and software licensing pact, Sharp has
agreed to distribute Macintosh personal computers in Japan from next month.
Apple sales in Japan have been growing rapidly, especially after
introduction of its Powerbook notebook computers last year.

FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Paribas expects loan-loss
provisions to remain high
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARIBAS, a leading French investment banking group, yesterday announced that
it expected provisions to remain high this year because of the poor economic
outlook in France and the UK.
Paribas was forced last year to make a special provision of FFr2.8bn, mainly
due to its exposure on loans made by its Paribas Suisse subsidiary. Most
were property loans although it was also exposed to the collapse of Mr
Robert Maxwell's media empire.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, yesterday warned that Paribas faces another
year of high provisions in 1992.
The group also confirmed an earlier forecast that it had slipped from net
profits of FFr2.54bn (Dollars 448.7m) in 1990 into a net consolidated loss
of FFr184m in 1991.
Meanwhile, the banks within the Paribas group were forced to raise their
provisions by 28 per cent to FFr6.3bn because of the adverse environment in
France, the UK and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Europe.
'The trend in France during the opening months of 1992 has not been good
because of weak demand,' said Mr Levy-Lang, emphasising Paribas' concern
about the effect of the economic slowdown on small companies.
He added that the situation in the UK, where the Compagnie Bancaire unit is
active in the consumer loans and mortgage market, was clouded by recession
and uncertainty over the general election.
When Paribas forewarned of the increase in provisions in January, it was
placed under surveillance by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit
rating agencies, with a view to downgrading.
Mr Levy-Lang admitted it was possible the group could be downgraded, but
said he would not expect it to have a 'marked negative effect'.
He warned that the banking sector faced fierce competition and pressure on
margins, and Paribas planned to counter this by continued cost-cutting and
possibly by selling some of its investments in 1992 and 1993.

<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S two largest retail groups - Delhaize 'Le Lion' and GIB Group  -
both pushed up profits in 1991, justifying the strong support for their
shares on the Brussels market this year.
Delhaize, largest of Belgium's three quoted retailers, announced that net
consolidated profits had risen nearly 16 per cent in 1991 to BFr4.37bn
(Dollars 127.7m), from BFr3.77bn in the previous year.
The company is proposing a 21 per cent increase in the dividend from BFr72
to BFr87 a share, and the directors are also planning a one-off dividend of
BFr33 a share to celebrate the company's 125th anniversary.
Turnover at Delhaize, which operates the expanding Food Lion chain of
supermarkets in the US, rose more than 16 per cent to BFr310bn, from
BFr266bn.
Food Lion itself pushed up sales by 15 per cent and opened a further 103
stores during the year, bringing the total number of US supermarkets to 881
across 12 states.
Meanwhile, GIB indicated it would show an increase in consolidated profit
from BFr2.99bn to BFr3.35bn for the 12 months to January 31, 1992.
Turnover rose to BFr217bn, from BFr205bn the previous year, although in the
dominant supermarket sector, sales crept up by only 1.5 per cent. Detailed
1991 accounts for the group - which is also active in the do-it-yourself and
fast food sectors - will be drawn up by the directors during May.
The group said it would devote BFr6.4bn to modernising its operations in all
sectors during 1992 - a 30 per cent increase on the 1991 investment plan.

BELGIAN legislators yesterday propelled Sabena, the ailing state airline,
further towards its long-awaited partnership with Air France, the French
national carrier, when they approved a law transforming the airline into an
ordinary company, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Officially, the airline is open to any partnership, but Air France is
thought to be the only serious suitor.
The link-up will probably involve Air France injecting some BFr6bn (Dollars
175.4m) into Sabena and taking a 37.5 per cent stake, but a formal decision
has been delayed since last October.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER'S sale of just under half its 10.99 per cent stake in Mitsubishi
Motors was privately welcomed yesterday by the Japanese car maker, whose
executives have been angered by Chrysler's demands for limits on the sale of
Japanese-badged vehicles in the US.
The US maker sold 43.6m shares for Y27.5bn (Dollars 205m), leaving it with
5.88 per cent of Mitsubishi Motors, whose share price has been under
pressure in expectation that the financially stretched Chrysler would
off-load part of its stake.
Officially, Mitsubishi said the two companies would maintain a 'strong and
co-operative relationship', but unofficially, the Japanese company was
delighted to see Chrysler slip to third in its shareholder rankings, behind
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Mitsubishi Corporation, the core
company of the group.
Chrysler invested in Mitsubishi Motors in 1971, and the company was run for
15 years as a joint venture between the US maker and MHI. In 1985, when
Mitsubishi Motors was listed, Chrysler had a 24 per cent stake, which was
reduced to 10.99 per cent in September 1989.
Last October, Chrysler sold to Mitsubishi its 50 per cent stake in Diamond
Star Motors, the companies' production joint venture in the US, raising
Dollars 100m. That venture was formed in 1985, but Chrysler's investment
could not keep pace with Mitsubishi's ambitious expansion plans.
Of the 43.6m shares, about 33.6m were sold in Tokyo, and apparently most
were taken by Mitsubishi group members and life insurance companies. The
remaining shares were sold in Europe to a range of investors.
Relations between US and Japanese car makers have become particularly
prickly in recent months, with President George Bush accompanied on a Tokyo
visit by US car company executives, who mocked a planned reduction in
Japan's self-imposed ceiling on car exports to the US.
Mitsubishi executives have been openly critical of Mr Lee Iacocca, the
Chrysler chairman, who has demanded limits on Japanese vehicle sales in the
US.
Publicly, Mitsubishi executives have said that Mr Iacocca's comments are
'disappointing' and, privately, they have used far stronger terms.
Mitsubishi yesterday said it 'understands' that the share sale is 'aimed to
strengthen Chrysler's financial position', and that the move 'will not
affect' their business relationship. However, the sale is another sign of
the weakening links between the two.

float

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH DATA Management, a business services group, yesterday announced that
it was seeking a Stock Exchange listing through the placing of 52 per cent
of the company at 125p.
The placing values the company at Pounds 29.1m and puts the shares on a
multiple of 11 times prospective earnings of 11.4p, based on a pre-tax
profits forecast for the year to June of Pounds 3.5m.
About Pounds 10m of the proceeds will repay debt and reduce gearing to give
the new public company nil gearing.
The balance is being taken out of BDM by three directors, led by the
chairman Mr Stephen Crown, who bought the present operating divisions from
Britannia Security Group in 1989 for Pounds 10m.
Most of the shares were placed yesterday with a variety of institutions, but
1m were placed with private investors.
BDM's main subsidiary, Britannia Data Management, is the UK's largest
contract storer of oil exploration data for major oil companies. It is also
involved in off-site storage of documents and back-up computer data and the
long-term storage of archives.
BDM also owns Eurocrate, the UK's second largest supplier of removal crates,
and Britannia Storage Systems, which is involved in design and installation
of data storage systems.
Mr Crown said that division had been hit by recession but was the only
profitable area in 1989 and provided essential cash flow for the group.
Mr Crown will retain 32 per cent of the company. He said none of the
directors would be selling in the near future and that he would allow his
stake to fall as the group grew through acquisitions.
In the year to June 1991, BDM made operating profits of Pounds 2.3m on sales
of Pounds 12.68m, and paid Pounds 1.17m in interest on debt taken on to
finance the acquisition from Britannia Security Group before it was taken
over by ADT. In 1990 operating profits were Pounds 989,000 against losses of
Pounds 253,000 in 1989.
Mr Crown said BDM would be the only quoted company dedicated to data
management.
NM Rothschild sponsored the placing and Smith New Court was broker.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Chemists, the fast-expanding chemist chain, yesterday won control of
Macarthy, its smaller rival, when its agreed Pounds 92.5m bid was accepted
by holders of 79.2 per cent of the ordinary shares.
The takeover will give Lloyds a total of 1,280 stores.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said last night he was
delighted by the response to the offer which had been recommended to
Macarthy shareholders by their board. Lloyds had tied up 26.2 per cent of
the shares before it made its bid.
The news came after the stock market closed with each company's shares at
328p, Lloyds down 2p and Macarthy down 1p. The offer was of one Lloyds share
for every Macarthy share.
A cash alternative at 305p has now closed, but holders of only 40,896 shares
had opted for cash. Holders of over 90 per cent of each class of Macarthy's
preference shares had also accepted.
Lloyds' bid was launched in February two days after clearance from the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission which had been examining two bids made for
Macarthy last year.
Originally Grampian Holdings, a Scottish mini-conglomerate, bid for Macarthy
in May last year but later pulled out. That was followed by bids from
UniChem, the retail and wholesale group, and Lloyds.
Both bids were referred to the MMC and cleared. However, UniChem decided
that the Macarthy price had risen too far by the time its bid was cleared.
Lloyds' success appears to have been based on three things: the
recommendation from Macarthy, the inclusion of a cash alternative, and the
acceptance of the bid terms by Govett Strategic Investment Trust for its
16.5 per cent stake before the offer was launched.
Lloyds had held 9.7 per cent of Macarthy's shares since its earlier bid.

The outcome of the election is beginning to worry corporate Britain - at
least the small part of it represented by Town Centre Securities, a
Leeds-based property group.
It is bringing forward its interim dividend of 1p per share from June to
April 3. Mr Norman Bell, company secretary, said this reflected concern over
the election and the board's wish that shareholders should receive their
money in the current tax year.
Further questions were referred to Mr Arnold Ziff, the company's chairman.
Unfortunately Mr Ziff was not available for comment, but he has been more
forthcoming in his other capacity as chairman and main shareholder of Stylo,
the Bradford-based shoe retailer.
In Stylo's annual report for 1991, Mr Ziff said 'this government is doing
more harm to British industry than any government this century'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, said there had been no let-up in recessionary trading conditions
when it reported a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.15m to
Pounds 2.71m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 28.3m to Pounds 25m in the six months to January
31. The company said 50 jobs had been shed out of 1,000 in the last year and
working capital restricted, but no measures could offset the fall in
turnover completely.
Although earnings per share fell to 6.23p (9.41p), the interim dividend is
raised by 20 per cent to 1.94p (1.62p). The company cited the strength of
its balance sheet to justify this payment, cash balances having increased by
Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 14.9m.
UDO said it had introduced new products and claimed its position had also
been improved by a reorganisation of management, recent acquisitions and the
effects of recession on competitors.
Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said: 'The measures taken to mitigate the effect
of the recession will undoubtedly benefit the group when business improves.
There is however no current indication of any such improvement, with many
companies unable or unwilling to invest for the future.
'The vast majority of overhead saving have already been made and the major
problem still facing the group remains the level of turnover.'

Tudor, the USM-quoted tiling group, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 325,000 to just Pounds 23,000 in the year to December 31.
At the same time it announced the acquisition of the ceramic tile and
adhesive business of MGB Tiles, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manders, the
inks, paints and property group.
The acquisition will be incorporated into Tudor's United Tile subsidiary.
The total consideration is Pounds 1.87m via the issue to Manders of 5.24m
new ordinary Tudor shares at 20p apiece. This will represent a little less
than 48 per cent of the enlarged share capital, following the purchase.
Tudor's turnover edged ahead to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 12.3m) in 1991 and
trading profits dropped to Pounds 303,000 (Pounds 474,000). Earnings came to
0.72p (3.66p) and the final dividend is passed leaving a total for the year
of 0.5p (2.7p).

FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Last bank signs terms of Brent Walker
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER's financial restructuring was all but completed yesterday when
the last bank to agree to the terms signed the documents. 'It would take an
act of God to stop it now,' an official close to the negotiations said.
A meeting has been scheduled for Monday at Standard Chartered, the bank
leading the negotiations, to put final signatures to the deal.
A way has been found round the condition to the refinancing that an
agreement should be reached with Grand Metropolitan, the leisure group,
concerning the Pounds 50m Brent Walker owes it.
The restructuring plan, the UK's largest, involves the conversion of Pounds
250m of debt into shares, giving the banks more than half the company's
equity.
It has involved, bankers say, some unprecedented moves, such as the
inclusion of a bank which is in administration, British &amp; Commonwealth
Merchant Bank is one of the lenders in the syndicate which lent for the
purchase of the William Hill betting shop chain.
The conclusion of the refinancing will end more than 18 months of
negotiations between Brent Walker, which runs a large public house estate as
well as owning William Hill, and its 60 main banks. During the period, when
Brent Walker frequently seemed to be on the point of receivership, the
amount of debt involved has risen as interest has been rolled up into the
capital amount and now totals Pounds 1.65bn.
The 47 banks which lent directly to Brent Walker are understood to have
signed by Thursday, while the 30 banks in the William Hill syndicate, of
which 17 are also in the group of 47, completed signing yesterday. One bank
had apparently raised last minute objections but signed yesterday afternoon.
It is expected that supplementary listing particulars for the new shares
will be posted today. The new shares should be issued on Monday, when the
company will also be entitled to draw down the bank facilities.
Trading in the new shares is planned to start on Tuesday. Brent Walker
shares, which have been traded throughout the negotiations, were down 1p to
10 1/2 p yesterday.
The refinancing had to be completed by Tuesday, the day when shareholder
approval for the restructuring plan, gained at a special meeting last
December, ran out.
The group started negotiations with its banks in autumn 1990 when it
launched a convertible bond issue and the extent of its difficulties were
realised. A standstill agreement with its banks was signed in November 1990
with the aim of refinancing the debt by February last year. However, the
talks dragged on far longer than expected as a series of problems arose.

FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: HTV tumbles but expects sharp recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west of England, suffered a drop in
profits from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 441,000 pre-tax for the 1991 year.
Some recovery in advertising revenue in the second six months enabled the
company to wipe out a first half loss of Pounds 4.8m.
Extraordinary items of Pounds 8.02m included the cost of applying for a new
licence, closure expenses and a Pounds 4.2m provision which arose from the
disposal of the fine arts division.
HTV noow plans to concentrate on its core television activities.
Mr Louis Sherwood, the chairman, said yesterday that he expected 'a
significant recovery in 1992, due partly to some improvement in net
advertising revenue which has been evident during the early months of this
year.'
HTV had made conservative estimates of growth in advertising in its
application for a new licence - an average real growth of 2.9 per cent a
year over 10 years.
The ITV companies' prospects would also be boosted by savings in overheads
already achieved and the reduction in the Exchequer levy on ITV profits.
HTV won a new 10 year licence beginning in January by narrowly outbidding
three rivals with an annual bid of Pounds 20.5m.
Mr Sherwood insisted yesterday that because of such factors as no longer
having to contribute towards the cost of the Welsh fourth channel and
savings on transmission charges 'the overall effect is scarcely more
expensive.'
Since 1988 the number of people involved in the franchise operation has
fallen from 998 to just over 500.
Mr Charles Romaine, HTV's chief executive, said yesterday that as a result
of the redundancies 'the level of staff matched the level of business and we
are now in the process of building up morale.'
Despite the pressure HTV is proposing to maintain its final dividend at
2.25p making an unchanged 3.75p total.
Turnover at Pounds 171.7m was slightly down on last year's Pounds 178.8m.
Because of the substantial extraordinary charges and provisions, net assets
per share were reduced to 53.05p compared with 73.5p in 1990.
The company was hoping that improved cash generation this year would ensure
a substantial reduction in borrowings currently at around Pounds 20m.
Mr Huw Davies, director of television, was optimistic that the break-up of
'the old producer's cartel' and its replacement with a central network
scheduling system would mean more national programme opportunities for HTV.
The shares closed 2p higher yesterday at 65p.

FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: PW to interview MCC board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRECTORS of Maxwell Communication Corporation have all been been
invited for formal interviews by Price Waterhouse, the administrators of the
publicly quoted Maxwell interests.
The interviews - likely to be held in May - represent a further stage in
Price Waterhouse's process of evaluating every aspect of MCC's activities in
the two years before the company went into administration. It is believed
that the interviews will be conducted by Price Waterhouse investigators with
lawyers present.
It is considered unlikely that either Mr Kevin or Mr Ian Maxwell will be
willing to give voluntary interviews. Both will be interviewed in a private
court hearing under insolvency legislation.
Meanwhile investigative work continues on 2,000 crates of MCC documents. Two
significant strands of work are being simultaneously pursued.
Teams are still trying to reconcile the mass of transactions made by MCC,
many of them between MCC and the Maxwell private interests. About Pounds
6bn-worth of transactions into MCC and Pounds 6bn out have been identified
but it is believed large gaps and transactions are still unaccounted for.
In a presentation to banks in December, Price Waterhouse also made clear
that it was interested in looking in detail at the accounts of MCC to see if
there was any artificial inflation of profits and, if so, who was involved.
That process is now under way.
The Serious Fraud Office, which has seized more than three tons of documents
since November, will soon start looking in detail at the affairs of MCC.
All the signs are however that early prosecutions are unlikely and that the
process of sifting the vast bulk of material by administrators and fraud
investigators alike could continue throughout 1992. Another small bit of the
Maxwell empire has changed hands, having been sold to Mr Brian Gilbert, a
former main board director of MCC.
Mr Gilbert completed the purchase of MBC Data Service, a company
specialising in the publication of annuals and yearbooks particularly for
the legal profession.
Mr Gilbert paid Pounds 3.65m for the small deal which follows hard on the
heels of his purchase of the main industrial magazines of Maxwell Business
Communications for Pounds 5.5m.
Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme has appointed Fleming Investment
Management as its sole investment manager, adds Norma Cohen.
Mr Patrick Johns, marketing director, declined to disclose the value of
assets under management, citing instructions of the pension fund trustees.
However, MGN is believed to have accounted for roughly half of the estimated
Pounds 700m of Maxwell company pension funds, of which Pounds 400m is
believed to have been siphoned off by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.

FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Europa board faces new attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Europa Minerals, a UK mining finance house, is facing its
second assault by dissident shareholders in 12 months.
Austmin Gold, an Australian mining company which owns 14.4 per cent of the
UK group, has asked for representation on the board 'with a view to solving
Europa's problems and returning value to shareholders.'
Mr Arthur Smith, Europa's chairman, said yesterday the board would contest
Austmin's proposals. He said the directors were nearly ready to put forward
their own restructuring and refinancing proposals, worked out with adviser
Lazards.
Early indications suggested the board, which last April successfully fought
off a shareholder group led by Mr Alastair Holberton, another Australian,
had a battle on its hands.
Two institutional investors, Abbey Life, with just under 10 per cent of
Europa, and M&amp;G, with just over 10 per cent, at present tend to favour
Austmin's proposals.
Waverley Asset Management, with about 6 per cent, is sitting on the fence
until it sees both proposals in detail. Nobody was available yesterday to
speak for Standard Life, a 9 per cent shareholder.
Austmin has nominated Mr Guido Staltari and Mr Bob Duffin as its proposed
representatives on the Europa board. It pointed out in a statement that
Europa shares were floated in February 1989 at 100p and now stood at 8p. It
said that in the 18 months to July 31 Europa had lost Pounds 13.7m or two
thirds of shareholders' funds.
Austmin said it recently made proposals to Europa and asked for board
representation. 'In the absence of any satisfaction on these issues, Austmin
has been left with no alternative but to requisition an extraordinary
meeting to obtain representation on the board.'

FT  28 MAR 92 / Trials and tribulations: Large-scale clinical drugs testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1987, the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial entitled 'Human
Sacrifice', which suggested that no American doctor should take part in
clinical comparisons between a new 'clot-buster' drug and a 30-year-old
treatment for heart attack patients.
The article echoed the opinion of many US cardiologists that it would be
wrong to give patients streptokinase, which had been introduced in the
1950s, because tPA, heralded as the first blockbuster drug to emerge from
biotechnology, was more efficient at dissolving the blood clots that cause
heart attacks.
But Oxford University went ahead anyway with a clinical trial, known as
Isis-3, which compared the effect of streptokinase, tPA and Apsac (another
new clot-buster drug) on 46,000 patients in 20 countries.
The results of Isis-3, said to be the largest clinical trial in medical
history, were published this week. They confounded the sceptics who had said
the comparison was unnecessary, or even unethical, because the new drugs
would be bound to work better.
Streptokinase turned out to save just as many lives as tPA and Apsac and it
was safer than them because it caused fewer strokes as a side-effect. Yet
tPA and Apsac cost five to 10 times as much as streptokinase, which lost its
patent protection decades ago.
The results are a blow for Genentech and SmithKline Beecham, the
manufacturers of tPA and Apsac respectively. But they vindicate researchers
who believe that the pharmaceutical industry and public health authorities
should support more clinical 'mega-trials'.
The clinical trials which manufacturers are required to carry out before
launching a new drug - typically involving 2,000 or 3,000 patients - are too
small to distinguish important differences between competing treatments for
common diseases. Statisticians say these need to be followed up by trials
involving tens of thousands of patients who are divided at random into
groups receiving different treatments.
Even before Isis-3, mega-trials had transformed the treatment of heart
attacks. Gissi-1 and Isis-2, co-ordinated from Milan and Oxford
respectively, proved in the 1980s - to the surprise of many doctors - that a
combination of two old drugs, aspirin and streptokinase, halved the death
rate of patients brought into hospital after a heart attack. Dr Rory
Collins, Isis co-ordinator, estimates that this treatment is now saving
4,000 lives a year in Britain.
The Gissi team in Italy was first to move on to compare tPA with
streptokinase. Its Gissi-2 trial with 20,000 patients came to a very similar
conclusion in 1990 as the larger Isis-3 this week: in clinical practice tPA
does not live up to its theoretical advantages as a more efficient
clot-buster.
The main market for tPA is the US, where Genentech sold Dollars 195m worth
last year - representing 38 per cent of the California biotechnology
company's total revenues. (In Europe, heart attack patients are normally
given streptokinase; tPA is reserved for people who suffer a second heart
attack within a year and may be allergic to streptokinase.) Half of all US
patients treated with clot-dissolving drugs receive tPA.
'If US physicians began to use streptokinase routinely instead of tPA, this
might avoid hundreds of strokes each year - and it would save more than
Dollars 100m each year in US drug costs,' says Dr Collins.
Prof Desmond Julian, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, the
leading heart charity, praises Isis-3. 'We feel that the size of the trial
is of immense importance and so is its independence from specific drug
companies,' he says. 'Isis-3 is likely to have a very substantial effect on
the choice of drug' for heart attack patients.
But Genentech is fighting to prevent that happening. Mr Kirk Raab, chief
executive, insists that 'the Isis-3 findings are irrelevant to our product
and to standard prescribing patterns for thrombolytic therapy in the US'.
Genentech and SmithKline Beecham both maintain that certain technical flaws
in Isis-3 prevented their products showing their superiority to
streptokinase. For example, they say the trial did not administer heparin,
another blood-thinning drug, in the best way.
In addition, Genentech points out that Isis-3 did not use its tPA (trade
name Activase) but a version made by Wellcome of the UK and abandoned in
1990 after a court ruled that it infringed Genentech's patent. The Isis
researchers argue that the two are equivalent in their clinical effects but
the US company disagrees.
As the streptokinase suppliers, Kabi Pharmacia and Astra of Sweden and
Hoechst of Germany, gear up new sales campaigns based on Isis-3, Genentech
is advising cardiologists to wait for the results of yet another mega-trial
now under way: Gusto.
Gusto will compare the effectiveness of Activase and streptokinase
treatments on 40,000 patients under US conditions. Its costs - estimated at
Dollars 55m - are being met mainly by Genentech, though Gusto, like Isis and
Gissi, is in the hands of a co-ordinating group independent of the drug
industry. Gusto's results are due next year.
Meanwhile, medical researchers are planning more mega-trials. At Oxford, Mr
Richard Peto, the Isis statistician, has designed a Pounds 10m study to
answer one of the most vexed questions in medicine today: 'does really
effective lowering of blood cholesterol in middle age save lives?'
Some experts, including Mr Peto, believe passionately that the answer is
yes: 'Cholesterol is a cause of nearly all heart attack deaths and there are
no proven hazards of lowering it.' Others point to the fact that
smaller-scale trials of cholesterol reduction have shown no net benefits.
The only way to resolve the argument would be a trial with 20,000 people at
high risk of a heart attack, divided at random into two groups. For five
years, one half would take a strong cholesterol-lowering drug and the other
would take inactive pills - mega-trials do require participants to make a
certain sacrifice for the sake of medical knowledge.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Forecasting growth in engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Leadbeater's analysis ('Productivity static in engineering
sector', March 26) of the Engineering Employers' Federation's latest
forecasts concludes that 'this downturn is less likely to bring the industry
long-term gains' in productivity. He points out that engineering
productivity increased by 11 per cent between 1979 and 1982, despite a steep
reduction in output.
However, the productivity gain in 1979-82 was achieved through a reduction
of employment in the industry of more than 700,000. Employment reduction on
that scale could not be repeated. It is two and a half times as many as the
reduction in 1989-92.
The best conditions for improving productivity are of course not during
recession but when output is rising. The EEF's forecasts to mid-1993
indicate an increase of some 5 per cent in output and 8 per cent in
productivity in the next 15 months.
Continuing growth of engineering output and productivity beyond mid-1993
will be crucial not only for the industry itself but for the whole UK
economy.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Many UK employers strongly support a minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir SIGMUND STERNBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the controversy over the minimum wage continues, it would be
unfortunate if the impression took hold that all - or even most - employers
are hostile to it.
Many employers strongly support the principle of a floor to wages. Good
employers have nothing to fear from a minimum wage, particularly one set at
the modest level of Pounds 3.40, and much to gain.
Nor does Britain have anything to fear from a minimum wage that merely
brings us into line with our European partners, nearly all of which have
lower rates of unemployment and higher skills levels than we do. They have
understood better than our own government that a minimum wage improves
standards in industry by preventing the bad employer from undercutting the
good, and that its absence is likely to impede rather than promote
investment.
Two aspects remain significant about this debate. One is that all polling
confirms that a majority even of Conservative voters support the
introduction of a minimum wage at Pounds 3.40, despite the best efforts of
the government. The second is that the debate remains precisely similar to
the debates which took place before the introduction of equal pay
legislation and of legislation on child labour. The critics of reform were
wrong then when they forecast that equal pay laws would force women out of
the labour force - and they are wrong now.
I only wish that ministers took as much trouble trying to improve Britain's
desperately poor record on training as they do trying to maintain pay at
levels that have no place in a modern society.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Oxfam aims on poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BELINDA COOTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As author of Oxfam's book, 'The Trade Trap: Poverty and the Global
Commodity Markets' (March 24), I feel your reviewer, David Dodwell, has
misrepresented its content.
Nowhere in the book do I suggest that alternative trade or 'development
friendly consumerism' are in themselves a solution to the problems facing
commodity-dependent developing countries. This is why the book focuses on
structural inequalities in the international trading system which undermine
the welfare of producers in the South. The policy recommendations include
calls for the withdrawal of trade barriers in the North, reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy and the creation of a genuinely multilateral
world trade system. Without such reforms it is difficult to see how
international trade can act as an engine of growth and recovery for the
South.
Mr Dodwell would have preferred to see a greater focus on problems created
by governments in the South. Oxfam is well aware of policy failures of Third
World governments, which are explored in the book. But our main purpose was
to expose links between poverty and trade arising from distortions in the
international market place. This is why we focus on the need for
international good governance, and call on the North to extend the
principles of democracy and co-operation to the management of world trade.
Finally, Mr Dodwell's equation of alternative trade with CAP cannot pass
without comment. Whereas the benefits of the CAP are enjoyed
disproportionately by the biggest farmers, our alternative trade proposals
are intended to enable highly vulnerable producers to participate more
effectively in international markets.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Insurance for pensions a non-starter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A P BENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Carty (Letters, March 26) rather misses the mark when he suggests
that pension fund managers should have insurance cover (presumably against
the risks of professional negligence and fidelity) equal at least to the
total level of funds which they have under management.
He cites the case of fund managers controlling assets of Pounds 27bn and
having some unspecified form of cover for Pounds 50m. Premiums necessarily
charged by insurers do not solely relate to their perception of the
probability of their being called upon to pay claims. Part of any premium is
paid for the commitment of an insurer's financial capacity (ie his
solvency), and in the example used by Mr Carty this premium element alone
would produce a considerable cost.
Additionally, and bearing in mind the relatively low asset bases of most
insurers today, it would be imprudent of any insurance buyer to over-expose
himself to any single insurer. If in this field a buyer decided that it was
prudent to place no more than Pounds 25m of cover with any one insurance
carrier it would be necessary to put together a panel of more than 1,000
insurers to provide coverage to the level which Mr Carty proposes. The
frictional or overhead costs of creating such an arrangement would be
massive indeed.
In short, insurance to such levels of indemnity is a non-starter. The more
sensible and less costly procedure would be to control the fundamental risk
by the imposition of statutory requirements relating to the roles both of
trustees and of fund managers, coupled with a requirement for relatively
modest compulsory insurance to provide basic protection against some,
although certainly not all, of the inevitable risks inherent in the
investment management process.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Which class of reader?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Roy Greenslade's argument ('Book Review: A better class of reader',
March 26) that British newspaper reading habits in 'a nation with two
distinct presses appealing to two different audiences' are class-based is, I
believe, mistaken. First, it assumes too easily that the upper and middle
class constitute 'an articulate, literate elite' without indicating what
literacy ought to mean in such a context. Second, it ignores the subtle but
significant differences between broadsheet newspapers and what might be
regarded as serious intellectual and emotional divides - as for example
between Guardian readers and Times readers.
The notion that the upper and middle classes in Britain nowadays constitute
any sort of literate elite in an age when genuine discussion is notable for
its absence, when Lord Young regards Radio 3 as an 'indulgence', and when
few people other than academics seem to read anything other than newspapers
is remarkable (and creditable) for its optimism.

<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Lorenz's article, 'Sum total adds up to more than the
figures' (March 6), was an interesting one, with a sting in its tail.
As a Fellow of the Institute of Personnel Management I might have taken
umbrage at the thought that Personnel use 'arcane language', but
unfortunately I agree.
One of our weaknesses can be a tendency to communicate in a jargon almost
comparable with that of the computer industry]
But the key issue was hidden in the article in the lines: 'The only totally
common ground between disciplines in business is not finance, but people.'
How true this is. Though management may not need to learn the personnel
language, perhaps we should encourage them to ask Personnel to explain,
simply, how the common sense of dealing with people can be used to harness
employee power and generate a contribution to the organisation's 'bottom
line'.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Man in the News: Many faces of Mr Moonbeam - Jerry Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has always been easy to laugh at Jerry Brown and this week has proved no
exception for the nation's comedians. David Letterman, NBC TV's
neck-of-the-night talk show host was as good as any with his top 10 reasons
why the former governor of California won the Connecticut Democratic primary
on Tuesday.
These included: he was the 100th caller; many citizens thought they were
voting for James Brown, the soul singer; heavy Klingon turn-out (one for the
Star Trekkies); growing sentiment the western world should be run by a guy
in a turtleneck.
Funny stuff, a lot of which probably has already been said in the course of
the 25-year public career of a man who will be 54 on April 7, the date of
his next date with destiny, the New York primary. What is serious, this time
for Bill Clinton and for the Democratic party as a whole, is Brown's habit
of making double mockery of it. Reinvent himself every year or two he may,
as Clinton says, but the reinventions sometimes, somehow, catch on.
This election year it is as the voice of the alienated, but it has not
always been such. He was, after all, governor of California, the largest
state in the union for eight years, and running it was a qualification
deemed good enough to get Brown's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, eight years in
the White House. In 1976 he was mainstream enough to throw a big scare into
Jimmy Carter's outside march on Washington.
Brown does not succeed all the time, failing in subsequent cracks at the
presidency, for the California Senate seat in 1982, and getting nowhere last
year in exploring another such bid. But he has a good political nose -
inherited from his father, Edmund G Brown Sr, governor of California before
Reagan - and an eye for issues.
He can fairly claim this year that he is the only candidate with
environmental credentials consistently adhered to throughout the
environmentally unfriendly Reagan-Bush years. This is in the modern
tradition of the west and explains why Colorado, almost reflexively, voted
for him a month ago.
But consistency does not normally bother him. Over the past two years, he
has completely changed his mind on campaign financing, once opposing
limitations, now favouring them. As governor he first opposed, then came
round to, Proposition Thirteen, the property tax-cutting initiative that
swept the state in 1978. Perhaps impressed by its simplicity or perhaps to
demonstrate his eclecticism, he now advocates new flat rates of income and
value-added tax, which, together with the retention of a few core deductions
like mortgage and rent relief, would replace in toto the current US tax
code. The fact that he borrowed these ideas from the right-wing Hoover
Institute does not faze this nominally left-wing candidate at all.
Less easy to defend is his opportunistic switch from internationalism to
near xenophobia. As governor of California Brown was not insensitive to
Pacific Rim trade or the economy of neighbouring Mexico. This year, he would
have his audiences believe that Mexico is the primary source of job loss in
the US. Occasionally he makes the legitimate point that the proposed North
American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada is fundamentally flawed
because it lacks the labour market regulation that makes the European
Community work, but he knows that the sort of audiences he is appealing to
stop listening when he gets too technical. It is easier, as he has done, to
say that if the US can shelter the Kurds it ought to be able to look after
its own homeless.
This, of course, is precisely where he has had success so far this year  -
in mining a seam of discontent in the country that knows things are wrong
but has no answers. He has few either, but that is not the point, which is
to direct the finger of blame at those who are more responsible - the
political establishment, in all its manifestations. Even the Democrats, he
would have all believe, are now run by a politburo (yes, he uses the old
communist word), which has decided that Clinton should be the presidential
nominee.
But essentially his is a plague on all the houses, for only by tearing them
all down can he render all conventional political wisdom that he can never
be president, let alone nominee, null and void. It is pure populism,
leavened only occasionally by traditional political guile, such as in trying
to extract an endorsement out of Governor Mario Cuomo of New York this week.
And this must be prosecuted regardless of party or indeed the facts. For a
trained lawyer and a Jesuit seminarian, subsequently schooled in zen
Buddhism, Brown shows an astonishing lack of interest in the truth. He is,
however, quick and unscrupulous in argument.
What nobody knows is whether Brown actually believes in what he is saying or
whether he is just riding the whirlwind he has created for the hell of it.
For his is more than an Anybody But Clinton movement; it is the voice of
disaffection and protest and it has existed on the other side of the
political fence already this year in the person of Pat Buchanan, who also
ran mostly on words and not much money. The phone calls flooding in urging H
Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, to run as an independent are another
manifestation. But Buchanan at least had a specific political cause, the
revival of conservatism, and perhaps a political end-game, in the shape of a
candidacy in 1996. With Brown, it is impossible to be sure of either.
Or anything: for as the campaign moves on it probably is the case that the
Brown phenomenon will get closer scrutiny for what it stands for, rather
than against. It might stand that test, especially if Clinton continues to
be carved up by New York's tabloids.
But if not, then what? The second best political quote of the week (after
President George Bush's 'it has been a screwy year') was to be found in the
Wall Street Journal from Joe Scott, a veteran Brown-watcher. 'Jerry can't
win the nomination and he knows it. But these next few weeks are going to
look like the Russian retreat from the Ukraine. Nothing will be left
standing.' Except possibly Bush, which, for the Democrats, would not be
funny at all.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Leading Article: The morning after
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Winston Churchill once described democracy as the worst possible system,
except for all the others. It takes an election campaign to make one realise
how awful all the others must be. Buy Labour for more public spending. Buy
Conservative for tax cuts. What should the Advertising Standards Authority
say about those claims? It should rule both out of order.
A week dominated by charges and counter-charges over the sad case of a
little girl is illuminating only for the way in which electorates are
consistently deceived. If the Labour party is implying that it will
eliminate delays in the National Health Service, it is lying. If
Conservatives wish to deny there will always be a two-tier quality of health
care, they too are lying.
The UK confronts serious choices. But the most important of those choices,
over Europe and economic policy, divide the two parties internally. No
wonder these topics are taboo. The British people have to choose, instead,
between competing fantasies.
The point can be drawn from an analysis of the alternative economic
prospectuses by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, published this week.
Neither Labour spending increases, beyond those promised in Mr Smith's
shadow Budget, nor Conservative tax cuts, beyond the Pounds 1bn promised for
each of 1995-96 and 1996-97, can be afforded without a greater than expected
'growth dividend'. The likely growth dividend has already been spent. In
fact, it has been overspent.
Even on the government's optimistic forecast that growth between 1991-92 and
1996-97 will average 3 per cent, the public sector borrowing requirement
falls below 3 per cent of gross domestic product only by 1995-96. Moreover,
this assumes that after growing by 11 per cent in real terms between 1991-92
and 1994-95, general government spending will grow at a mere half a per cent
a year between 1994-95 and 1996-97.
Not at all likely
How likely is such a recovery? Not at all likely, for three reasons: first,
because it is what the Treasury forecasts; second, because it is all that
happened after the last recession, when conditions were far more favourable;
and third, because the UK is in the grips of a consistently underestimated
debt deflation.
To detail the Treasury's forecasting errors would be unkind, especially
since it has been in good company. But to consider the economic
circumstances is necessary. The end of the last recession coincided with a
sharp depreciation of the real exchange rate and real interest rates (base
rate less the rate of retail price inflation without mortgage interest) at
around 2-3 per cent. Now the real exchange rate is at best static, while
real interest rates are some 5 per cent and, as inflation falls, rising.
Furthermore, the personal sector, though richer, is far more indebted than
10 years ago; the nominal prices of housing are still falling; and the
London property market is suffering from a collapse of American proportions.
Pummelling groups
Why should anyone hope for a vigorous consumer-led recovery in these
circumstances? It is impossible, moreover, to understand why the Labour
Party should believe that pummelling the groups in society that must make
any recovery happen, plus a 'strategic framework for finance and industry',
plus a Pounds 1.1bn 'recovery programme' would make the desired recovery
either swifter or stronger. Or, more precisely, it is impossible to
understand why anyone should believe it.
Suppose that growth were to average only 1 1/2 per cent a year from 1991-92
to 1996-97. Real GDP would then be 7 per cent lower in 1996-97 than under
the Treasury's forecast. Furthermore, unemployment would continue to rise,
thereby increasing public spending. Under those assumptions a general
government deficit that would never fall below the 6 per cent of GDP
(without privatisation receipts) forecast for 1992-93 and 1993-94 can be
readily foreseen. It could be higher still.
Yet none of this grim background emerges into the light of public
discussion. The Conservatives do not want to discuss the problems because
they cast grave doubt on their reputation for economic competence. The
Labour party does not want to discuss the problems because they mean that
the long and imaginative wish list it calls a manifesto is no more than
waste paper. Yet the truth is that German monetary policy and its
determinants - the pain of unification, German industrial unrest and fiscal
deficits - bear far more on the prospects for the British people than
anything said in these miserable weeks.
So ignore what is being said in the election, if possible. Far more
revealing will be what happens the morning after. The Conservatives seem a
known quantity, although they too can spring surprises. But what of the now
increasingly likely Labour government? It would be tested severely, first of
all by the foreign exchange markets, then by its own supporters. It would
have to forget almost all the things it thought it was elected to do. On its
ability to do that might depend its chances for longer-term survival in
government.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock pledges action on health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Kinnock, the Labour leader, last night tried to turn the election
into a referendum on the National Health Service, claiming that the NHS
would be completely broken up if the Conservatives were returned to office.
Speaking to supporters in Glasgow at the end of a week in which the health
service has dominated the campaign, Mr Kinnock said the Tories had not dared
subject any element of their health proposals to the democratic judgment of
the voters.
He claimed that the election of a Labour administration would stop the NHS
from being run 'like a stockbrokers or a chain store'. Under the Tories, he
said, the NHS would become a 'patchwork quilt of of profit centres'.
Earlier in the day Mr Kinnock rejected suggestions that Labour had been
damaged by the row over its party election broadcast based on the case of
five-year-old Jennifer Bennett, and said the controversy, which had prompted
enormous public support, was injecting fresh energy into the party's
campaign.
Mr Kinnock told the Glasgow rally that the Conservatives were 'utterly
determined to go on bulldozing, extending the commercialisation of the
health service, pushing the market into every nook and cranny of care,
multiplying the army of business managers, spreading the opt-outs, turning
every hospital into a trading unit, every general practice into a small
business'.
Broadening his attack on the Tories, the Labour leader said the voters had
only '13 days more to endure'. He said the Tories knew that they were losing
the campaign and that their 'sour, drab appeal to selfishness' was making no
impact.
He added that in their desperation ministers had abandoned any pretence of
positive campaigning and had been forced to resort to calling for help from
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister. Mr Kinnock said: 'They
brought in John Major because he wasn't Margaret Thatcher. Now they've
brought in Margaret Thatcher because she's not John Major.'
Mr Kinnock attempted to lay the blame for the recession firmly on the
shoulders of Mr Major, claiming that the prime minister was trying to
persuade everyone that he had inherited the nation's economic problems from
someone else.
He attacked the government for its inaction in addressing the problems of
the recession, and claimed it had not made any serious effort to solve the
country's economic difficulties.
He criticised Mr Major for claiming that the Conservatives intended to build
on the successes of the 1980s and the legacy of Mrs Thatcher. He told the
rally that all they could build on was a legacy of increased poverty,
homelessness, rising unemployment and industrial decline.
Mr Kinnock added that on election day the choice before the electorate would
be a Tory party the people no longer trusted and a Labour party which would
work for the whole nation's interest.

Although there has been a 250 per cent growth in the number of women
candidates since 1979, only 10 per cent of MPs at most in the next
parliament are likely to be women, the society says.
Electoral reform - with either a single transferable vote and multi-member
constituencies, or the German 'additional member' system - would be needed
in order to change the imbalance in the sexes in parliament, the society
concludes.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown to stand firm on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night stressed his
party's commitment to a single European currency and criticised Britain's
delay in joining the exchange rate mechanism.
Because Britain was late to join the ERM, 'we were late in the battle
against inflation and under Mr Major and Mr Kinnock, we will be late to join
a single European currency. But join we must,' he told a rally in Leeds.
He is expected to make clear at the weekend that the Liberal Democrats would
insist on a more pro-European stance if they were to form a government with
either Labour or the Tories.
The Liberal Democrat leader will use a trip to Bologne tomorrow, where he
will meet other European Liberal party leaders, to set out his party's
policy on Europe and indicate how he would use any negotiating muscle he has
after April 9 to push for Britain to back a single European currency.
Mr Ashdown also heightened yesterday the priority he would attach to
Scottish devolution in a hung parliament. 'It is inconceivable that we would
agree to a programme for the next parliament which did not include a
commitment to legislate for a Scottish parliament,' he said.
In the course of the campaign Mr Ashdown has made proportional
representation the main condition of any pact, but has also gone some way to
outline other elements of the deal he would seek. These would also include a
significant increase in spending on education. He said more conditions may
be set before April 9.
The education, PR and home rule policies are all areas Labour would have
less difficulty than the Tories in accommodating.
His comments at a press conference in Edinburgh came as opinion polls showed
a further slip in Liberal Democrat support in Scotland. Mr Ashdown described
Scottish home rule as 'the first step' in the reform of the UK political
system.
However, he again insisted that law for PR at Westminster remained the
overriding condition for a post-election pact.
Mr Ashdown denied that his stance was alienating Scottish voters. There was
a growing perception that a Scottish parliament could not become entrenched
until electoral reform ensured a government was able to pass the legislation
in the first place and then prevent it from being repealed.
A System Three poll for the Glasgow Herald newspaper showed Liberal Democrat
support tumbling to 7 per cent, compared with 19 per cent at the 1987
general election. The party is defending 10 seats in Scotland, almost half
its parliamentary strength. Mr Ashdown knows he would not hold his party
together if he did not insist on home rule should he have influence over the
government after the election.
In many of their Scottish seats, the Liberal Democrats originally won
support because they had the best chance of beating the Tories. Now the
Conservative vote has shrunk, and some former supporters may switch to
Labour or the Scottish nationalists.
Mr Ashdown will not say what he compromise on in the event of a hung
parliament.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Adelaide News forced to close after 69 years
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Adelaide News, the afternoon newspaper which formed the base for Mr
Rupert Murdoch's international media empire, closed yesterday after losing a
long battle against falling circulation and revenue.
The closure of the News follows its sale to a group of local businessmen in
1987 as part of a deal in which News Corporation, Mr Murdoch's media group,
acquired the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT) group of newspapers.
Ironically, the closure gives a monopoly of south Australian daily newspaper
circulation to the Adelaide Advertiser, a morning newspaper acquired by News
Corporation as part of the HWT deal. News Corp also owns the city's only
Sunday newspaper and its largest chain of suburban weeklies.
Mr Tony Baker, editor of the News, said the closure was forced by 'a simple
inability to get the readership and the advertising that we needed for
survival'. Mr Baker said the newspaper would honour a redundancy agreement
with 54 journalists, photographers and artists.
Mr Murdoch inherited control of the News, which was established in 1923,
from his father, Sir Keith Murdoch, a prominent war correspondent in World
War One, who developed the newspaper into a major metropolitan daily.
He joined the newspaper as a cadet reporter in 1953, and became managing
director in 1959. The News then became the launching pad for Mr Murdoch's
assault on the Australian media, subsequently extended to the UK and US.
News Corp is now the biggest newspaper publisher in Australia. Other assets
include five UK national newspapers, a half share in the BSkyB satellite TV
business, and a US TV network and film studio.
The group is still registered in Adelaide, and holds its annual meetings
there. However, it has long been managed from the US, where Mr Murdoch has
lived since becoming a US citizen.
The News was the last afternoon metropolitan newspaper published in
Australia, following closures in other capital cities over the last five
years.
News Corp merged its tabloid morning and afternoon newspapers in Melbourne
and Sydney last year.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL, the world's leading coffee producer, hopes to achieve an
international accord using export quotas to spread the responsibility for
maintaining prices, according to private sector sources.
The government announced a 10-point set of principles to guide its position
in talks on the International Coffee Agreement in London early next month.
Brazil favours a quota system covering all coffee exports, thus avoiding
two-tier markets. One of the main reasons for the collapse of the last
agreement in July 1989 was the sale of coffee outside the agreement at lower
prices.
It wants 'realistic' prices without stimulating 'excessive growth in
production', and argues that each country's quota should reflect its 'real
capacity' to supply the market, considering stocks as well as production and
export capacity.
The Brazilian government also argues against 'distorted commercial policies'
 -which observers understand as criticism of official subsidies in countries
such as Colombia.

FT  28 MAR 92 / US and France in last-ditch effort to solve air row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French and US governments are to make a last-ditch attempt next week to
resolve a deadlock over dividing capacity on transatlantic air routes. If it
fails, there could be restrictions on flights in the next few weeks.
The row is over US demands for a more than 40 per cent average rise in the
number of seats alloted to US airlines this summer on routes between France
and the US.
France's Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) says this is far too
much to ask, on the grounds that air travel between the two countries is
expected to rise by only 10 per cent this year and that US airlines already
have the lion's share of Franco-American transatlantic travel.
The DGAC and the US Department of Transport will meet in Washington early in
the week to try to settle the row, which has been building up since their
annual talks on the share-out of transatlantic air route capacity began in
December. France will apply from tonight the 15 per cent average increase it
is prepared to accept in transatlantic flights from the eight main US
airlines, said a senior DGAC official.
However, France will not apply the 15 per cent rise evenly to all US
carriers. It is planning to freeze flights by TWA and Continental Airlines
at last year's levels, on the grounds that they are trading under Chapter 11
protection from creditors, considered an unfair advantage.
Other carriers would accordingly get more generous treatment, within the
overall limits. Failing agreement, any flights from the US above these
levels could be refused landing rights in France, said the official.
'We are at the foot of the wall. Enough is enough. We don't see how
companies unable to pay their bills should develop their businesses,' he
said. US airlines already occupied 70 per cent of the routes between France
and the US, a steep rise over the past eight years, because of their greater
capacity. Air France and its subsidiaries take the rest.
This is roughly in line with the share-out between Germany and the US,
though Britain has achieved a more favourable share of routes with the US.
The share-out of transatlantic capacity is still negotiated between
individual European governments and Washington, an issue not yet covered by
European Community air travel deregulation.
A bigger swing in the US favour would make it harder for Air France to
allocate capacity to independent French airlines, a condition of EC
deregulation, said the DGAC. Industry officials accuse US airlines of
dumping, using high internal fares to subsidise transatlantic routes and
undercut European competitors. Air France was unable to comment.

FT  28 MAR 92 / NF votes spark row for Mitterrand ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW erupted between French political party leaders yesterday after two
ministers in the Socialist government were elected presidents of their
regional councils with the apparent support of the extreme right-wing
National Front.
This is an electoral accident which will embarrass the government further at
a time when the Socialists' fortunes are at a record low. Last weekend they
polled an ignominious 18.3 per cent in the regional elections.
At the same time, voting throughout the country by the new regional
councillors to choose their presidents revealed a deep split between the
Socialists and the Communists. This is being taken as an advance warning
that the Communists are in future likely to be considerably more
antagonistic to the government in parliament.
The main surprises yesterday were the election of Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson,
minister for public administration in the Socialist government, as president
of the Bourgogne regional council, and of Mr Jean-Marie Rausch, minister of
posts, in Lorraine.
Both ministers are moderate conservatives who joined the Socialist-led
government as part of President Francois Mitterrand's policy of an opening
towards the centre.
Neither had expected to be elected following the Socialists' heavy defeat
last weekend. However, the National Front yesterday threw its weight behind
the two candidates because they said: 'We wanted to elect two ministers
without party alliances.'
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, denounced the election
of Mr Soisson in Bourgogne as 'this additional turpitude of the Socialists,
which has taken another step forward in their relations with the National
Front'.
Mr Francois Bayrou, secretary general of the centre-right UDF umbrella
grouping, called on Mr Soisson to resign from the government immediately, or
explain this new alliance strategy on the part of the government. 'This is
the end of the government,' he said.
Mr Soisson, surprised by his victory, described it as 'a spectacular
reversal'. He claimed it was due to the transfer of votes from the
centre-right.
There were however other explanations for Mr Soisson's victory. Mr Charles
Pasqua, elder statesman of the Gaullist party, blamed the result on a broken
agreement between the two traditional conservative groups, the centre-right
UDF umbrella grouping and the RPR Gaullist party.
Mr Pasqua clearly indicated that he thought it was possible Mr Soisson might
have been elected through the defection of some angry UDF members.
The hardening of the Communist attitude promises a much harder road for the
government in future. In several key regions, the Communists insisted on
maintaining their own candidate for the presidency throughout the three
successive rounds of voting, even though they could not be elected, rather
than line up behind the Socialist candidate.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Brazilian accord cuts car prices by 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN car prices were reduced 22 per cent yesterday as a result of
successful negotiations between the government, vehicle and parts
manufacturers and union representatives.
This is the government's first major step towards reaching a social pact
believed necessary for the success of its economic stabilisation plan and is
an astonishing breakthrough in the effort to reduce monthly inflation,
currently running at 21 per cent. The government hopes to repeat this
victory in other sectors, and will begin talks with the textile industry
next month.
Under the accord, reached late on Thursday night, the government has agreed
to lower state and federal taxes by 12 percentage points in return for a 7.5
per cent cut in profit margins by manufacturers and a 2.5 per cent cut by
dealers. Workers have agreed to delay a pay rise due next month until July
in return for guaranteed job stability.
The move is of particular significance because of the prominence of the
Brazilian motor industry, which is dominated by Autolatina (a joint venture
between Ford and Volkswagen), General Motors and Fiat. It accounts for more
than 10 percent of GDP and generates around 4m jobs. Protected from foreign
competition since the 1950s, manufacturers have been able to raise prices
way above inflation.
Although President Fernando Collor ended the ban on car imports when he took
office in March 1990, import duties remain a stiff 50 per cent and despite
the country's recession Brazilian car prices have risen an average 42 per
cent in dollar terms in the last 15 months according to the Federation of
Vehicle Distributors.
As a consequence sales have fallen drastically and Mr Collor's recent
announcement of a cut in import tariffs - to 40 per cent from October -
finally forced the manufacturers to the negotiating table to discuss how the
notoriously inefficient industry could survive in the face of foreign
competition.
In a series of sectoral meetings headed by Ms Dorothea Werneck, the national
economy secretary, the manufacturers complained that they had been
handicapped by the country's import ban on information technology and by
taxes of 43 per cent - a level they claim to be the world's highest.
The aim of the accord, which will run for a 90-day trial period, is to step
up sales and efficiency. The government also agreed to put forward a
programme of fiscal incentives and subsidised credit to stimulate exports,
while car producers pledged to invest Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) over four
years.

FT  28 MAR 92 / IMF works on to agree terms for new members: White House may
back capital increase to Fund
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVE directors of the International Monetary Fund were yesterday making
plans to work through the weekend to complete preparations for Russia's
membership of the Washington-based financial institution.
The IMF board began discussions on Thursday on the size of the Russian quota
in the fund, as well as those of the other former Soviet republics, and is
expected to reach agreement early next week. The quotas will help determine
the amount of financial assistance each republic can eventually call on from
the IMF.
A quota of slightly over 3 per cent is expected to be agreed for Russia  -
which would give it access to roughly Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of IMF
financing in a full year.
Concern over Russia's ability to carry through its economic reform plans
could affect the IMF's readiness to agree to financing facilities once the
republic has joined the fund, but is not thought likely to hold up the
processing of its membership application.
The US, meanwhile, is expected to announce in the next two weeks a new
package of measures to help Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
The package is expected to include a US contribution of up to Dollars 1bn to
a rouble stabilisation fund, some Dollars 600m of additional food and
technical aid, and the relaxation of curbs on trade with the former Soviet
republics.
The package is a response to sharp criticism from former President Richard
Nixon and senators in both parties who have accused the Bush administration
of a 'pathetically inadequate' response to the changes in the Soviet Union.
The White House is also considering campaigning openly in favour of the US's
Dollars 12bn share of a Dollars 60bn capital increase for the IMF. Without
US agreement, the whole Dollars 60bn capital increase would be blocked,
leaving the IMF perilously short of cash and possibly forcing it to start
delaying financial commitments later this year or early in 1993.
The Democrats who control Congress have been reluctant to vote this funding
for fear of coming under attack from the Republicans for pouring money
overseas, as they did last time they voted an IMF quota increase in 1983.
They have demanded that President George Bush himself publicly back the IMF
funding, instead of leaving the job to his treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas
Brady.

FT  28 MAR 92 / US to buy new Russian reactor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government yesterday said it would buy a Russian experimental nuclear
reactor designed to power space travel, as part of a Dollars 14m (Pounds 8m)
Russian space technology purchase.
The White House said the purchase of the Topaz reactor from Moscow's
Kurchatov Institute would give the US access to its technology, which many
scientists believe is not matched by any current US reactors, at a
significantly lower cost.
The Topaz was originally sought by the Strategic Defence Initiative
Organisation which runs the US 'Star Wars' anti-missile defence programme,
but for the past 15 months its purchase has been held up the Defence
Department.
The disagreement encapsulates a contentious debate within the US government
over what attitude to adopt towards the space, nuclear and military
industries of the former Soviet Union.
Members of Congress such as Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, as well as
some members of the administration, have argued that the US should buy
equipment and services from Russia, both to obtain new technologies cheaply
and to provide gainful employment for crucial scientists and engineers who
might otherwise be tempted to sell their services to countries in the Middle
East or the Third World and so contribute to the proliferation of advanced
military technologies.
The Defence Department, however, has appeared reluctant to agree to such
purchases.
The Topaz reactor will be acquired without nuclear fuel, and will be worked
on at the University of New Mexico, in Mr Domenici's home state, to see how
its technology can be adapted for use in the US space programme.

President Boris Yeltsin is understood to have ditched the official draft
Russian constitution following attempts by parliament's constitutional
committee to reduce his emergency powers, Leyla Boulton reports.
Although a new constitution has been one of Mr Yeltsin's chief political
goals, he has effectively killed the prospect of endowing Russia with a new
one to replace that inherited from the old communist empire at a sitting of
the Russian parliament on April 6.
A constitution not only determines the power structure in Moscow but the
relationship between the centre and the autonomous republics and regions
within the largest republic of the former Soviet Union.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PERSONAL income rose 1.1 per cent in February, the largest monthly gain
for three years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The surge in incomes, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations, helped
explain the surprisingly robust recovery in US retail spending since
Christmas. The higher spending has sparked speculation in recent weeks that
the long-awaited recovery from recession is under way.
In real, inflation-adjusted terms, yesterday's figures showed a 0.6 per cent
rise in personal consumption spending last month. Figures for January were
revised to show a gain of 0.9 per cent.
Many economists expect higher consumption spending to underpin a modest
growth of gross domestic product in the first quarter. Revised figures
released on Thursday showed GDP growing at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in
the final quarter of last year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 per
cent growth.
Officials said the rise in incomes last month was boosted by special factors
including subsidy payments to farmers.
But an underlying increase estimated at 0.9 per cent reflected a sharp rise
in non-farm employment and a lengthening of the average working week.
With personal savings rates low, the recovery of consumption spending is
likely to be sustained only if employment continues to grow. Analysts are
thus keenly awaiting employment figures for March, due out next week, which
will provide a clearer picture of the economy's underlying momentum.

FT  28 MAR 92 / German armour used against Kurds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY said yesterday that Turkey had acknowledged using German-supplied
armoured cars in clashes with its minority Kurds, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, told a news conference the
Turkish government had confirmed that vehicles from the former East German
National People's Army had been used in military operations in the Anatolia
region.
'Armoured vehicles supplied by Germany. . . from the former National
People's Army - armoured personnel carriers armed with machine guns - were
deployed for monitoring, surveillance and observation,' he said.
Bonn on Thursday accused Turkey of using German weapons against civilians
and imposed a ban on arms sales to Ankara.
In Lisbon, the Portuguese presidency of the EC said it was seeking further
clarification from the Turkish authorities and EC diplomats in Ankara about
Turkey's attacks on Kurdish villages, before deciding on a common response
by the Twelve.
'There are indications that the situation is much more serious than has been
reported,' the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
The EC diplomats refused to comment on what an EC declaration might contain,
but an EC-wide suspension of military equipment to a Nato member is thought
unlikely.
The presidency said it had raised the issue with its EC partners, even
before the German government on Thursday suspended military supplies to
Turkey and called for EC condemnation of the attacks on the Kurds.
Turkey's Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel sought to defend his security
forces yesterday, arguing that Turkey's tactics against Kurdish rebels were
no different from those Germany had used on its urban guerrillas.

FT  28 MAR 92 / High tax payers start to scramble for an offshore haven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF CHANNEL shipping is heavy this weekend, it could just be caused by men in
rowing boats filled with Pounds 5 notes, fleeing the prospect of a Labour
government.
With 12 days to go before polling, accountants are beginning to report a
large increase in inquiries from taxpayers anxious about the prospects for a
Labour victory in the general election.
Many said yesterday that the demands from clients for tax-planning advice
far exceeded those in previous years at this time, and the interest was also
higher than in 1987 before the last election - when the prospects of a
Conservative victory seemed far more certain. Labour's tax proposals mean a
married man on a Pounds 100,000 salary is contemplating a loss of Pounds
13,000 a year, a fall in after-tax income of 20 per cent.
So far, much of the action is taking place within the UK. Many people are
taking 'tax-efficient' measures so that they receive income in the current
financial year. Some financial institutions, such as James Capel, have
brought forward the payment of bonuses to their employees.
On the other hand, some taxpayers are delaying expenditure to allow them to
take advantage of hoped-for high reliefs until the coming tax year.
But the real question is whether investors will be sufficiently panicked to
take their money offshore. A British citizen is liable to be taxed on all
his or her worldwide income.
Most accountants coughed indignantly at the suggestion they would be asked
to advise clients about placing money offshore where it might not be
disclosed to the Inland Revenue.
'It's certainly not the sort of thing they would consult us about,' said Mr
Tony Martin, a tax partner with Price Waterhouse. 'They would do it without
professional advice.'
Lack of exchange controls means that someone could conceivably take out wads
of cash in a suitcase, but they risk being noticed by the taxman when they
bring back the money. In offshore centres such as Gibraltar and the Isle of
Man, there were reports yesterday reflecting nervousness which stopped short
of capital flight.
One leading Gibraltar lawyer said yesterday: 'What we have been getting in
recent days is quite a number of accountants coming to us who are
anticipating capital flight and who want us to be ready for it. But the
capital from the UK hasn't arrived yet.'
Offshore jurisdictions close to the UK have received some inquiries about
moving assets offshore in the event of a Labour government, but have
certainly not been inundated. For the moment, investors may be waiting until
the opinion polls indicate a clear victor.
However, traditional havens such as the Channel Islands may not see the bulk
of the flight capital. Mr Geoffrey Bailey of Lloyds Private Bank, said: 'It
is not altogether clear what the standing of the Channel Islands will be.'
Mr Peregrine Banbury, head of the Coutts investment department, said that
other offshore centres such as the Bahamas, Caymans, Luxembourg and the Cook
Islands might benefit from any move of capital.
Offshore funds which allow investors to accumulate income and legitimately
postpone the payment of tax were reporting a growth in interest.
Fidelity, which recently launched a range of such funds, reports that
Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.32m) is flowing in every week and two prominent
managers in the field, Guinness Flight and NM Rothschild, noted increases in
inquiries and investment.
What about the prospect of UK-based businesses moving overseas during a
Labour government? Large London-based foreign banks say they would not
relocate if Labour came to powerbut one said the idea of a Labour victory
was 'too awful a prospect to contemplate'. Dresdner Bank said moving out of
London would be 'unthinkable' while Citibank said it was 'unlikely'.
Nor is there any hard evidence that foreign investors are delaying or
cancelling their investment plans. Development agency officials, who handle
foreign investment inquiries, say it is 'business as usual' and that there
has been no change in the level of inquiries.
For individuals, the safest way of avoiding British tax involves removing
oneself as well as one's money. Mr Keith Kerruish, chartered surveyor and
partner in Chrystals Royal Life Estates in the Isle of Man, estimates
between 20 and 30 people may have moved to the island in anticipation of a
Labour government.
In recent weeks, leading figures in the entertainment business such as
composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and rock star Phil Collins have declared that
higher tax rates as pledged by Labour could cause them to emigrate. Their
view is in the musical tradition of the Beatles, who satirically sang, at a
time of a 95 per cent top rate: 'If 5 per cent appears too small, be
thankful I don't take it all. Coz I'm the taxman and you're working for
no-one but me.'

DUNSTER by John Mortimer Viking Pounds 14.99, 296 pages
JERICHO by Dirk Bogarde Viking Pounds 14.99, 278 pages
BAY OF ALL SAINTS AND EVERY CONCEIVABLE SIN by Ana Miranda Harvill Pounds
14.99, 305 pages
COMPOST, nourisher and perhaps poisoner of us all, the past must always
fascinate novelists. Two of the week's novels have narrators digging
painfully into the younger days of someone close to them. John Mortimer's
Dunster is masterly. No swanning around with the Brits in Chiantishire, as
in recent novels - though the British in Tuscany are crucial to this one's
past action. It goes much deeper, and more darkly, though the surface has a
similar exactness and exuberance and a similar deadpan wit. Destructive yet
with an integrity of sorts, Dunster is the kind of barefaced busybody who
churns up trouble wherever he goes, tangling fact and fiction inextricably
together. All through their lives and into middle age he has pursued his
schoolmate Progmire with a mixture of chumminess and guile, charm and
cheating, undermining his confidence, luring away his wife and, in a
roundabout way, his daughter, and in general stamping on his soul. Every
cause he backs he believes in with every fibre of his fairly, though not
totally, awful being, and when he decides that Progmire's admirable, beloved
boss, Sir Crispin, is a war criminal who in Italy in 1943 blew up a church
containing the entire population of a village, the fight is on. Sir Crispin
fights back, wins his libel action and, honourable to the last, refuses his
half-million damages. So, who comes out of it how? Dunster is defeated, not
just in law but in his soul and personality. Was he, ever righteous,
possibly wrong? And does winning a libel action guarantee truth?
Part thriller, part observer of current mores, realistic yet full of
ambiguities, Dunster raises every kind of question, moral and psychological,
while spinning along at a cracking pace. The trial takes up a third of the
book, involving us in courtroom doings as Mortimer so well knows them, not
as outsiders imagine them: muddle, noise, confusion, personal enmities,
liaisons, spites, cunning and the odd whiff of brilliance. At a more serious
level than recent Mortimer novels, it makes the best possible read.
Dirk Bogarde's Jericho also has a downbeat narrator and nasty secrets from
the recent past to uncover in a Mediterranean country. With his marriage
collapsing in Parsons Green, William is sent a key to the French home of his
brother James, out of touch for years and jealously resented for being born
a decade after him to steal the family's attention. Out he goes to Var to
discover the vanished James, and finds a way of life to cherish, beauty,
sunshine, a son he hardly knows and a surprising small nephew. Also a widow,
of sorts. And, when he pokes deeper into the underside of James's life, some
sordid truths.
What's to follow? The end is credible and, one is led to expect, happy. With
Parsons Green shuffled off, and with it Helen, the wife William no longer
even likes, a new landscape and its natural world appear. Son and nephew are
beautifully realised, vivid and present; so are the artefacts and the social
life of provincial France and, to a lesser degree, the widow-of-sorts and
her formidable bourgeois mother. Only the detection, the lewd discoveries,
the shock-horror aspects of bisexual, kinky James seem contrived and are,
frankly, tedious.
As readers of his memoirs will know, Bogarde's writing is stylish, showing
splendid descriptive power and judgments tender or waspish; as admirers of
his acting will remember, he has an uncanny way of entering the
personalities of others; and for good measure this Admirable Crichton has
painted, pretty well, his own book's jacket.
Another enticing jacket gives Bay of All Saints and Every Conceivable Sin an
initial advantage. What will Ana Miranda in her first novel make of the
rich, lurid life of 17th century Bahia, then capital of Brazil? Well, we
learn a good deal: about the country's history, its relations with Portugal,
its oppressive hierarchy of law and government; about slavery and
corruption, torture, violence, imprisonment, plantations, sugar, politics,
church. But research, which has clearly been extensive, has overwhelmed the
book: detail becomes oppressive, holding up the action. As a work of
imagination, it is leaden. No one comes alive, or seems to matter. It lacks
wit and pace, and so dully presented are the characters that it is sometimes
hard to tell or remember who's who. The translation is by Giovanni Pontier.

<TEXT>
CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES by Penelope Farmer The Bodley Head Pounds 8.99, 200
pages
THE SCHOOL story is a mould into which many writers for children have poured
their unequal talents - Talbot Baines Reed, whose Fifth Form at St Dominic's
established many of the most familiar features of the genre in the late 19th
century, to the noisy, up-to-the-minute battlefields of Grange Hill. This
month the Bodley Head has re-published what can fairly be described as a
contemporary classic of the genre, Charlotte Sometimes by Penelope Farmer, a
writer whose first book, The Summer Birds, was short-listed for the Carnegie
Medal.
Charlotte Sometimes was first published in 1969, but the feel of the story
and its narrative density suggest an even earlier epoch. It is Charlotte
Mary Makepeace's first day at her new boarding school, a day full of
loneliness and misgivings. First into the dormitory, she is given the pick
of the beds and chooses an old-fashioned and yet oddly appealing thing with
cast-iron wagon-wheels.
When she wakes up the following morning, the view from Charlotte's window is
shockingly different from what she remembered. The school's new brick
extension has been replaced by the spreading arms of a dark and ancient
cedar tree and the hump in the bed beside hers (which proves to be a funny,
abrupt creature by the name of Emily) insists on calling Charlotte by a
different name, while all the time emphasising that Charlotte, is in fact
Emily's sister, Clare.
The shocking truth is that Charlotte has travelled back in time to a school
which is now caught up in the dreary regimen of the Great War. Instead of
neatly-mown lawns, there are market gardens teeming with cabbages, and,
flying from the school gates, a pair of faded Union Jacks. Everything about
the place is strict, drab, austere, scarce and nasty - from the ferocious,
starch-aproned Nurse Gregory to the meagre, disgusting rations.
The next morning, however, Charlotte wakes to discover that she has been
catapulted back into the late 1950s again, and for that dispensation she
feels mightily relieved - both for her own sake and that of her younger
sister, Emma. Unfortunately, the next day she finds herself again in that
same world of cold-tar soap, fizzing gas burner and photographs of dead
young men. And so it goes on, day after troubling day, this shuttling back
and forth in time, with the one girl taking the place of the other.
Then a terrible thing happens. Clare's status is changed to that of a
day-girl. She and Emily will be moved out of the school - and the magical
bed left behind. Unfortunately, the move takes place on the wrong day and
Charlotte finds herself stuck in the past, boarding with a family that has
lost its son to the battlefields of France.
Her loneliness and desperation increase when, some days after her arrival,
the family call upon a medium in an attempt to get in touch with their dead
soldier-son - but it is the voice of Clare, Emily's sister, that escapes
from the medium's mouth, screaming out to her. Clare - like Charlotte
herself - is locked, sorrowing, into an alien age, desperate to claw her way
back to her sister in the past.
Some of the details of the novel bring to mind Tom's Midnight Garden, that
children's classic of the late 1950s, in which time-travel plays a crucial
part. But Penelope Farmer's ability to write as if from deep within the mind
of an 11-year-old girl, to delve into her emotional anxieties, to capture
with such sureness the emotional vicissitudes of the relationship between a
real girl and her ghostly counterpart in the past, and even to give great
symbolic importance to small, individual details - the glass of water that
Emily fills with marbles, the huge handbell, rung on Armistice Day, that
proves so disappointingly to have a 'dull, small, thudding sound' - set this
profound, disturbing and intellectually-challenging novel in a category of
its own.
It is a piece of taut narrative writing that moves and troubles in almost
exactly equal proportions.

FT  28 MAR 92 / Books: Hopkins' lonely road to classic status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPKINS: A LITERARY BIOGRAPHY by Norman White Oxford Pounds 35, 531 pages
'WHAT FUN if you were a classic,' the undergraduate Gerard Hopkins once
remarked. 'What a waste,' the painter, Jack Yeats said when he met him 20
years later, 'that Gerard Hopkins, with all his gifts for art and
literature, should have become a priest.' Hopkins' retort - 'you wouldn't
give only the dull ones to Almighty God' - highlights his arrogance and his
own sense of loss as well as his commitment.
Why did the most original poet of the 19th century choose a vocation which
prevented him from publishing a single stanza, and was his art enhanced or
diminished by the sacrifice?
The first triumph of Norman White's splendid biography is to show how deeply
Hopkins' difficult, intense poetry comes out of his difficult, extreme life:
the Jesuit priest at once despairing and devout; the Victorian prig who
subsumed homosexual lust into holiness; the scholar who enjoyed blowing
cayenne pepper through a keyhole to disrupt his colleagues' seminar.
The second is to set the poet-priest's maverick, conflicted temperament in
the context of fevered, Victorian religiosity and idealism, and thus to
broaden out a life story into an intellectual and social portrait of an age
which should fascinate anyone interested in English history.
Hopkins was born in 1844, the eldest son of an upwardly mobile insurance
broker whose sons' education reflected his rising status: Gerard attended
local school in Hampstead, but three younger brothers went respectively to
Lancing, Winchester and Charterhouse. For Gerard, life opened out at Oxford,
which began in adolescent rapture ('Altogether Paradisaical. A canoe in the
Cherwell must be the summit of human happiness') and ended in the queue of
conversion-hungry undergraduates which, by the 1860s, lined the route from
Balliol to Newman's door in Birmingham.
'I believe the Balliol set is truly wise,' said the young poet Clough at
this time. White is comically inspired on 1860s teenage posturing, which
ranged from midnight tutorials with Jowett to secular pursuits like shooting
water-rats from a bridge on the Cherwell.
Romance, mostly between men, was of course everywhere, and Hopkins fell for
Digby Dolben, an aesthete expelled from Eton for Papist inclinations (he
wore a monk's habit and dated his letters by Roman feast days). He flirted
with Hopkins and, says White, his 'flamboyant leanings incarnated Hopkins'
suppressed spiritual inclinations'.
Incipient homosexuality is as obvious in Hopkins' poetry - witness the boy
in The Bugler's First Communion 'breathing bloom of a chastity in mansex
fire', or the hedonists plunging around naked in the pools in Epithalamion -
as it is in Kipling's; both poets are famously popular with adolescent boys.
White links the homo-erotic impulses, which Hopkins experienced as an
overwhelming sense of sin - he records admiring the bare arms of working
navvies and looking up 'dreadful words' in the dictionary - and youthful
rebellion against his family as factors which drove him to Rome. He was, WB
Yeats later observed, the typical 'sensitive querulous scholar' of 19th
century 'English Aesthetic Catholicism'.
When Hopkins converted, mid-Victorian England was rife with Papist-phobia;
on a train journey once, Pugin 'crossed himself while engaged in private
prayers. . . to the horror of a lady, alone with him in the compartment, who
cried out: 'You are a Catholic, sir - Guard, Guard, let me out''. But
Hopkins got only enlightened tolerance from Balliol and his parents, and so
his masochism pushed him further into the strict arms of the Jesuits. He
used to meditate on being shut-up in a cloister and on pain's 'great and
real sense of freedom'.
'I did say yes/O at lightning and lashed rod,' he records on joining the
Jesuits. He made a bonfire of all his poems but first sent corrected copies
to his friend, Robert Bridges.
Before he became a priest, Hopkins used to compile lists of similar sounds,
of 'consonant-chiming' words, of words to which he was specially attached,
and try them out in prose; a long wrestling which lay behind the muscled
strength of celebratory poems like The Windhover. As a Jesuit, this was put
aside and not until the shipwreck of some nuns was he pushed to break a
lengthy silence. The Wreck of the Deutschland is in part a classic Victorian
sea-disaster poem; it is also the first Victorian work to break away from
poetic convention into a dramatically truthful art.
It was frighteningly original for the Jesuits, who refused to publish it in
their magazine. Since publication elsewhere was forbidden, there followed a
lifetime of artistic isolation.
'I should do you no kindness in sending you a man so eccentric', wrote one
priest to another about Father Gerard. As a Jesuit, Hopkins fitted in
nowhere, and was moved year after year - 'to seem the stranger lies my lot'
 -from London to Wales to Glasgow to Dublin, as a worker in slum-dwellings
and as a teacher.
Too aloof to get on with his working-class parishioners, he was also too
naive to teach - he was once mocked for weeks after solemnly telling his
class that 'he regretted that he had never seen a naked woman'. Meanwhile,
his own artistic instincts and his interest in music and sounds - in Wales
he learnt Welsh, in Dublin he collected Irish accents - were discouraged.
The result was acute, piercing loneliness, an absolute lack of understanding
which made him ill and exhausted and inspired the sequence of despairing
sonnets - Carrion Comfort; No worst there is none - which are among the most
passionate and intimate in all English poetry.
His last poems were scribbled on the back of exam books while he was
invigilating at University College, Dublin. Then, worn out, he died aged 44
from typhoid fever, possibly carried by two rats discovered in the Jesuits'
stewpot.
The unsung hero of this story is Robert Bridges, who collected the poems as
Hopkins sent him them, corresponded with and encouraged him, and finally, in
1918, judged the time right to publish them. Regarded as odd and cold and
impossibly obscure by most who had seen them in Hopkins' lifetime, they
suddenly found their place: an early wave in the great tide of modernism.
Leavis' approval in the 1930s sealed Hopkins' longed-for status as a
classic.
Norman White's scholarly, humane and witty account will surely send many
readers back to the poems and enhance that reputation still further.

THE SIGN AND THE SEAL: A QUEST FOR THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT by Graham
Hancock Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 600 pages
MANKIND'S weaknesses are easily turned into money. Among the most
convertible is credulity, a close third to the human relish for sex and
violence. Credulity explains the success of books about religion,
particularly the sort alleging discoveries about the Turin Shroud, the Holy
Grail or the Dead Sea Scrolls. Take the barrels of salt required when
reading any such book and multiply them tenfold: you will need no less for
Graham Hancock's account of the present whereabouts of the Ark of the
Covenant.
Neither Hancock nor his publisher mind admitting that the film Raiders of
the Lost Ark influenced the genesis of this book. Hancock duly attempts to
inject a little excitement into his account; but he is no Indiana Jones, and
not even meeting a Harrison Ford look-alike helps to make the book remotely
rousing.
The Ark of the Covenant is the gold-covered box in which the Israelites kept
Moses's stone tablets, brought down from Sinai with the Ten Commandments
upon them. Until Solomon's time it stood in the Holy of Holies in
Jerusalem's temple. It then disappeared. Hancock's claim is that it was
taken via Egypt to Ethiopia, where it has remained ever since, now lying in
a chapel in a little town called Axum.
But this is the least of it. Hancock further claims that The Ark and the
Holy Grail are the same thing. Indeed, the Grail is a cypher for the Ark,
whose whereabouts was discovered by the medieval Knights Templar, who wished
to keep the secret from their contemporaries while passing it to posterity.
They therefore hired the poet Wolfram von Eschenbach to write Parzival to
encode the secret of the Ark as a story about a Grail quest.
The Knights Templar, in the meantime, excavated the mount in Jerusalem where
Solomon's temple had stood, and discovered blueprints containing the basic
principles of Gothic architecture. Tipped off by the carvings in the porch
of Chartres cathedral, Hancock spotted the ruse and unravelled the secret of
Chartres, of the Templars, of Parzival, and therefore of the Ark itself.
There is much more in this vein, involving everyone from President Mengistu
and the Queen of Sheba to the deity himself in an engulfing mire of
improbabilities. The book is 600 pages long, but it would be a mere 60 if
one removed all sentences containing the words 'perhaps' and 'possibly' and
all such rhetorical phrases as 'could it not be the case that'. The logical
structure of the book's argument has the classically tendentious form,
'perhaps ..perhaps ..if so ..therefore'.
The book is complete rubbish. From beginning to end it is a cobbling-up of
invention, speculation and guess-work, draped like a tarpaulin over a
rickety frame of second-hand erudition and third-rate sophistry. I suppose
one should be indignant about this almost fraudulent attempt by author and
publisher to part as many people as possible from their money, but in truth
the book is so exceedingly awful that it is funny. It is a surreal parody of
a book, a fictional work of non-fiction in the tradition of Jorge Luis
Borges but without the quality. It rides the coat-tails of a film made for
teenagers, but the film at least was honest: it did not claim to be other
than fiction.
Clearly Heinemann scents lucre. Whether or not the result is commercially
worthwhile, I think they would do better by coming clean and giving the book
a decent burial in their Humour list.

CONCISE DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY Oxford Pounds 95 (Pounds 125 after
June 1), three volumes boxed
OXFORD University Press recently announced that the Dictionary of National
Biography is to be 'revised' in what will apparently be a root-and-branch
job; it will take ten years.
In the meantime, the Press has issued a rearranged three-volume summary of
the much-loved Dictionary, covering the whole period up to 1985. The
inevitable problem, as with the earlier Concise version, is that the need to
reduce each entry very savagely - the average entry is one-fourteenth of the
original - effectively deletes the elegance and charm which are among the
delights of the 31-volume full edition, in addition to truncating the detail
to a point where this Concise DNB becomes no more than a comprehensive
reference book.

CANNON Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate, ran up a loss of Pounds
34.9m pre-tax for 1991 of which Pounds 34.5m related to an exceptional
charge to cover asset write-downs and restructuring costs.
For 1990, the company returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.3m.
As forewarned in December the final dividend is omitted leaving shareholders
with 3.3p for the year - for 1990 they received 8.8p in total.
Mr Robin Binks, who replaced Mr William Hislop as chief executive, said
group borrowings had been reduced by Pounds 50m to Pounds 45m following
flotation of the company's Avonside building arm as well as the sale of most
of its stake in Betacom and the disposal of Stalbridge Kwick Klean Laundry.
Gearing is now down to 90 per cent.
The group will now focus on its distribution and building services
operations.
Most of the write-downs concerned the hotel properties. Mr Binks did not
expect further write-offs would be necessary once sales had been achieved.
He said profitability had been adversely affected by the recession and heavy
interest costs due to the high level of financial gearing.
Net interest rose from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 11.5m.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Attack on Kurds sours friendship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE malaise in Turkish/German relations, with Bonn suspending arms shipments
over the alleged use of German military aid to put down Kurdish
demonstrations, owes something to the realisation on both sides that the
special relationship is over.
Historically, Germany has been Turkey's main European ally. The two fought
together in the First World War.
More recently the relationship has been cemented by economic links. In the
growth years of the last three decades Turkish Gastarbeiter (guest workers)
have played a vital role in both economies, particularly for Turkey. Turkish
workers last year sent home Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 860m).
However, the relationship is souring. Turkish feathers were ruffled during
the Gulf War, when Germany initially failed to respond to Turkey's request
for military aid, in the end sending eight Alpha jets.
Behind the malaise is the realisation that, following German unification and
developments in eastern Europe, Turkey is less important to Germany as an
economic partner. Germany's dependence on Turkish labour has lessened.
Indeed German aid is used as subsidised credits to entice Turkish workers
home. Although DM13m (Pounds 4.5m) has been spent on rehabilitation and
business schemes, as many as 1.5m Turks seem determined to stay permanently
in Germany.
Many guestworkers, perhaps 400,000, are of Kurdish origin. They provide much
of the financial support for the separatist Kurdish Workers party whose
political wing operates openly in Germany. Ankara has repeatedly called on
Bonn to ban their activities.
Yesterday's crisis follows television reports from south-east Turkey showing
Turkish security forces using old east German armoured vehicles to attack
Kurdish demonstrators. Most worrying for Ankara is the linking of the
Kurdish issue to EC membership for Turkey.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Freedom for airlines to set own fares agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC TRANSPORT ministers yesterday agreed in principle to grant airlines the
freedom to set fares from next year.
In a prelude to a new crackdown on state subsidies to airlines, the European
Commission gave ministers a detailed report on state aids to the industry,
which it said were inhibiting development of a genuine 'open skies'
environment. The freedom to set air tariffs will be limited by safeguards
against over-pricing and 'predatory pricing' by large carriers cutting fares
to force smaller competitors out of business.
The full effectiveness of this measure will not be realised unless the 12
agree to liberalise market access, and to common airline licencing rules
intended to facilitate new entrants to the industry. Ministers yesterday
made less progress on these aspects of the EC's so-called 'Third Aviation
Package', the vehicle of its drive for open skies.
Ministers and Commission officials said agreement was likely in June on most
of the package. 'Seventh freedom' rights - the right of, say, British
Airways to fly from Paris to Berlin - look likely to be agreed. On the
introduction of cabotage - the right, for example, of BA to offer services
between Paris and Marseilles - France, supported by the southern member
states, is holding out for a six-year transition.
Mr Paul Quiles, French transport minister, said the EC must 'avoid market
destabilisation through too rapid a liberalisation'. The UK argued that
partial liberalisation measures from 1987 and 1990, the first two open skies
packages, had already provided the transition. The Netherlands, the other EC
air transport liberal, called for a maximum one-year transition.
A likely compromise is about two years, with the introduction from next year
of 'consecutive cabotage'  - BA offering services between Paris and
Marseilles or Berlin and Frankfurt, provided the flight originates in the
UK.
It was largely agreed that exemptions could be made, to take account of the
environment, regional development, congestion, and promotion of railway
transport. But Mr Karel Van Miert, transport commissioner, warned that
Brussels would not accept any attempts to use such safeguards to circumvent
liberalisation. The Commission also warned it 'will not give any privileges

FT  27 MAR 92 / People: Strains of the Classics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor David Spearman, mathematician and vice provost of Trinity College
Dublin, is envious of his brother John's new assignment - getting paid to
listen to classical music all day.
In fact, the new chief executive of Classic FM, Britain's first classical
music radio station that is both commercial and national, is unlikely to
have much time to wallow in Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov during office hours.
Starting up 'sometime in the second half of this year' in a highly inclement
advertising environment, Classic FM starts off paying the government Pounds
1m a year plus 4 per cent of qualifying advertising revenue for the
privilege of its franchise. Despite the muscle of its backers which include
TimeWarner and Associated Newspapers, the going could be hard.
But 50-year-old John Spearman, former chief executive and chairman of
advertising agency Collett Dickenson Pearce (CDP), who was approached by
TimeWarner, relishes the chance of running a new national medium.
With the increased popular appeal of the classics in Britain in recent
years, Spearman, who has no intention of trying to emulate Radio 3, believes
the time is right.
'Central Television these days has to brief its telephone operators before
each episode of Inspector Morse' as to what pieces the musical inspector is
tuning in to, because of the flood of weekly enquiries.
'We will offer advertisers and agencies a valuable audience of ABC1
listeners - at substantially lower rates than a page in the FT.'
Spearman left CDP at the beginning of 1990 after nine years as chief
executive because of a disagreement concerning diversification strategy,
notably Playback, the management training company he started with Mel Smith
and Griff Rhys-Jones, and in which CDP had a 51 per cent stake.
He bought out that stake when he left and has subsequently been chairman of
Playback.
'I thought I would enjoy doing things in a less intense, more eighteenth
century way, but I was wrong' he says, relishing the return to '
constructing and developing companies'.

FT  27 MAR 92 / People: Nabarro for Hambros Northern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
William Nabarro, a 36-year-old corporate financier, must have set some sort
of turnover record. He has joined HAMBROS BANK for the third time and for
the second time has left MAI, the financial conglomerate headed by Labour
peer Lord Hollick.
Nabarro has been appointed managing director of Hambros Northern. Based in
Leeds, it will provide corporate finance advisory services and represents
the merchant bank's first move outside the Home Counties.
Hambros has strong links with Yorkshire, helped by the presence of Lord
Halifax on the board of its merchant bank; but Nabarro stresses that it was
his idea to set up shop in Leeds. West Yorkshire has a 'very strong economy'
and a heavy concentration of local company headquarters, so 'more strategic
decisions are taken around Leeds than one might think,' says Nabarro. The
Leeds Permanent Building Society is an old client of Hambros and the bank
also advises several other local names such as William Cook, Persimmon, and
Evans of Leeds.
Although Nabarro is reluctant to elaborate on his reasons for leaving MAI,
it seems as if he is probably better at advising companies than running
them. MAI is a long standing Hambros client and Nabarro has been involved
with the firm for more than a decade and advised on several of the company's
major acquisitions.
After a two-year spell as MAI's group development manager in the mid-1980s,
he rejoined the group in late 1989 and was given the task of building up a
specialist market research and business information operation. MAI spent
well over Pounds 50m acquiring NOP and MIL, two of Britain's best-known
market research firms, and a 25 per cent stake in Addison Consultancy. The
intention was to float these supposedly fast-growing companies on the stock
market at a fancy multiple which would improve MAI's own lowly rating.
However, the recession intervened, the profits of the new information
division slumped and MAI is left with what looks like some rather expensive
acquisitions on its hands. Nabarro is not retaining his seat on the MAI
board and has been replaced as chief executive of MAI's information division
by 31-year-old Graham Hill, previously managing director of Milpro, MAI's
international healthcare research company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As part of a reshuffle designed to broaden top management at NEWSPAPER
PUBLISHING, owners of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday, Suzanna
Taverne, who joined 18 months ago as a strategic planning executive, becomes
the new finance director.
A 32-year old Oxford history graduate, she came to the Independent from SG
Warburg's corporate finance department, where she had been part of a team
advising the publishers. While a stock market floatation had earlier been on
the cards, by the time she arrived in August 1990 the effects of the
advertising recession, on top of strains imposed by the launch of the Sunday
newspaper, ensured that she was occupied instead with two rounds of
refinancing, helping bring in El Pais and La Repubblica which now hold 18
per cent each.
Taverne, the daughter of former Labour MP and early SDP promoter Dick
Taverne, takes over from Graham Luff, who became managing director in
November, shortly after the most recent refinancing. Luff's promotion was
seen as a step towards spreading the load of founder and editor Andreas
Whittam Smith, who however still retains the title of chief executive as
well as editor.

<TEXT>
SALVESEN, the distribution, manufacturing and specialist hire company, is
turning back to its home base of Edinburgh to find its next non-executive
chairman. It is choosing Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, to
replace John West who retires in July.
West, formerly chief executive of food group Reckitt &amp; Colman, is now 64 and
has been chairman since 1989. He was brought on board to lend some outside
experience to the group on the retirement of Sir Gerald Elliott, a member of
the Salvesen family which still holds a total of 44 per cent n the company.
A few months later a new chief executive, Chris Masters, came in, and the
company's performance has markedly improved since then.
While West operated from London with occasional visits to Scotland, Rankin,
57, who has been non-executive director of Salvesen since 1986, is based in
Edinburgh. One of the most cosmopolitan members of the Scottish business
establishment, he gave up the post of chief executive of Scottish &amp;
Newcastle early last year, and is evidently now looking to fresh pastures.
He recently became chairman of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the
organisation which lobbies for the Scottish financial sector.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLATILE trading left the futures market slightly firmer in an otherwise
featureless session, with political pressures for once pushed to the
background, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE future opened at 2,469 and was quickly squeezed up to 2,474,
but aggressive selling by, among others, Goldman Sachs and UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew then pushed it down to 2,460, and the rest of the morning trading was
at a discount to the cash market. However, an expectation that Wall Street
would be corrected up after a reported mistake by Salomon Brothers had
knocked the Dow Jones Industrial index overnight, helped March to rally by
early afternoon to 2,472.
There was steady business in a tight 2,468-72 trading range for most of the
afternoon, before a move to sell, largely by independent traders, sent March
lower. It closed at 2,466, one point up on the previous session but at a
discount to the cash market of around 5. Volume came to 6,339 lots.
In the LTOM, volume of 27,925, up on Wednesday's 24,916 that had been
incorrectly reported, included 10,699 FT-SE 100 contracts. Lasmo was the
busiest stock option on 2,860 contracts, followed by Prudential on 1,546.

FT  27 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Good results boost share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NOTICEABLE increase in equity turnover masked what was viewed by a number
of senior dealers as a largely uninspiring session in the market.
Nevertheless, shares posted widespread gains, shrugging aside the latest
opinion polls and focusing on another series of largely encouraging company
news reports. The FT-SE 100-share index closed 7.3 higher at 2,472.2.
Sentiment in London was also helped by expectations, subsequently proved
correct, of a firm opening on Wall Street.
The latest opinion polls, which continued to give Labour a small lead over
the Conservatives, were seen as slightly disappointing for a market which
had built up a head of steam late on Wednesday in anticipation of a poll
favouring the Tories.
In the event, the market proved extremely resilient to such news, opening
marginally firmer and gradually gathering strength before dipping off
towards the close.
Up 1.5 at 8am, the Footsie was 14.1 ahead at the day's peak as Wall Street
opened. The index was said to have been pushed higher by programme trade
activity, before succumbing to profit-taking and closing 7.3 points up,
The initial driving force came from evidence of a sizeable trading
programme, said to have been weighted towards the buy side, executed late on
Wednesday, and printed on the Seaq ticker first thing yesterday. At least
two more programme trades, one in mid-morning and the other in the early
afternoon, were responsible for boosting turnover.
Seaq revealed that turnover reached 527.7m shares at the close, the highest
daily total this week. But statistics revealed that daily turnover by value
has failed to top the Pounds 1bn mark, widely regarded as the benchmark of
profitability for market firms, this week.
Of the big company news stories, Burmah Castrol, the lubricants/specialist
chemicals group delighted the market with excellent figures and a positive
statement on prospects, and the shares bounded ahead in good volume.
Rank Organisation, the UK's premier leisure group, was another exceptional
performer, responding to a positive note published by Smith New Court's
leisure team pinpointing recovery prospects.
Lonrho, the controversial international conglomerate, delivered the worst
performance of the Footsie constituents, the shares sliding 7.8 per cent as
the market recoiled from the political aspect of its deal with Libya.
Commenting on the state of play in the election campaign the strategy team
at County NatWest said: 'If Mr Kinnock becomes the next prime minister the
market would probably have another 5 per cent to fall. However, the election
outcome is still wide open.'
Kleinwort Benson pointed out that the market should not miss what it says
may currently be judged as minor issues, namely that the season continues to
impress plus evidence that the economy is at last moving off the bottom.
The securities house also points to the continued firmness of Wall Street
where it says evidence of US economic recovery is accumulating.

FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers ground lost by
broker's error
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended a listless session in positive territory yesterday,
but the lack of good news on the economy kept gains to a minimum, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.28 at 3,267.67. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.34 firmer at 407.86. In
contrast, the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slipped 4.08 to
615.40. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 176.7m shares, and declines
narrowly outpaced rises by 840 to 767.
Early gains had been expected when the market opened, primarily because the
previous session's loss was due entirely to a clerical error at Salomon
Brothers, the securities house, which initiated a heavy computer sell
program in the final minutes of trading, wiping 12 points off the Dow.
Salomon's subsequent attempts to rectify the mistake - which would involve
the firm buying back millions of dollars worth of shares - and the
realisation that stock prices were actually on an upward course on Wednesday
in spite of the loss on the Dow, meant that trading got off to a positive
start.
Yet the market struggled to sustain its upward momentum, and sentiment was
not helped by news of a slightly bigger than expected 15,000 rise in weekly
jobless claims.
American Express firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 in volume of 5.2m shares
after Smith Barney Harris Upham, the broking house, upgraded its rating on
the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'.
The Smith Barney analyst likes the stock because of the strong contribution
to earnings from the group's Shearson Lehman stockbroking subsidiary, and
more competitive pricing and cost-cutting at American Express's
travel-related services unit.
Commodore International featured after trading in the stock was halted due
to an imbalance of buy orders. When business resumed, the stock jumped
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 amid speculation - started on a morning
television broadcast - that the computer manufacturer could be a takeover
target. One of the names mentioned as a possible suitor was Nintendo, of
Japan.
Glenfed plunged Dollars 1 7/8 , or more than a third, to Dollars 3 1/2 on
news that the savings and loan group's non-performing assets and
restructured loans increased by 11 per cent in January and February.
On the over-the-counter market, Borland International dropped a further
Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 in heavy trading after Shearson Lehman cut
its fourth-quarter earnings forecast from an originally estimated 20 cents a
share to just 5 cents. Borland shares have fallen 17 per cent this week,
partly on the news that Microsoft International was entering the market for
database management software.
Canada
GAINS IN bank issues and real estate and construction shares offset losses
in other sectors, keeping the Toronto market flat. Nervousness over Olympia
&amp; York's debt levels and cash flow situation continued to abate.
The composite index closed only 3.8 off at 3,448.5 after fluctuating within
a 12-point range during the session. Falls slightly outnumbered rises by 281
to 271 after volume of 30.1m shares valued at CDollars 297m.
Gulf Resources Canada rose CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 6 in heavy trade on
speculation that a foreign oil company may buy O &amp; Y's 74 per cent stake in
the company. The government lifted restrictions limiting foreign ownership
of oil and gas firms on Wednesday.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises in light activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR regained some of its recent loss against the D-Mark in London
yesterday in the quietest trading reported in several weeks, and in spite of
the release of poor economic data, writes Andrew Jack.
The US Labor Department released figures showing the number of people
registering for unemployment insurance rose by 15,000 to 447,000, against
market expectations of nearer 440,000. Revised gross domestic product
statistics for the fourth quarter of last year were also disappointing, with
growth reported at 0.4 per cent compared with the 0.8 per cent previously
published.
But the effect was short-lived, with the US currency soon rising again to
end in London at DM1.6615/25 and Y133.85/95, against DM1.6520 and Y133.35 at
the previous close. Later in New York it finished at DM1.6615 and Y134.05.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Bank in London, said: 'The
dollar is a bit perkier. It managed to shrug off the data.' He added that
the markets had already absorbed the impact of these figures and were
waiting for a fresh crop on the US economy due next week.
It may also have been helped by bullish speeches from Mr Edward Kelley,
Federal Reserve governor, and Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, who
argued that US economic recovery was well on its way.
The Swiss franc dropped sharply against the dollar in New York, when the
D-Mark/Swiss franc cross-rate broke through resistance at 91 centimes. Most
traders were reported as buying into D-Marks, and then switched to buying
dollars against the Swiss franc.
In Asian trading, the dollar had slipped against the yen late in the day on
speculative sales and stop-loss orders, closing down at Y133.20 but up on
the D-Mark at DM1.6528.
Sterling closed 90 basis points down at Dollars 1.7225 in London,
relinquishing Wednesday's rise. Against the D-Mark it improved from DM2.8600
to DM2.8625. The pound's exchange rate index was unchanged at 90.1.
Dealers said a group of US funds helped to lift the dollar in modest late
trade as programme trading was carried out based on technical analysis of
market trends. 'Apart from this late burst, it has been one of the quietest
days I can remember,' one dealer told Reuter.
They maintained that the effects of the political uncertainty would have
little effect on the pound, as it was being discounted through the money
markets instead.
Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi commented: 'Sterling is an icon of stability
in contrast to equities and gilts. It has been able to absorb fairly
changeable opinion polls. It is pinned firmly to the floor. Cutting base
rates would be a necessary condition to lift it.'

FT  27 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading stays low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES closed little changed yesterday in modest trading as uncertainty over
the UK general election result continued to haunt the market, writes Andrew
Jack.
'It is unfortunately a bit tedious at the moment,' said Mr David Cocker,
treasury adviser to Chemical Bank in London. 'The market isn't thinking of a
Conservative victory. It favours a hung parliament.'
His views seemed to be reflected in a Reuters poll among 46 economists
circulating on the news wires, which showed more than 70 per cent expected a
hung parliament.
Dealers said most trading was complete by mid-morning, with the vast
majority of the volume in very short dates no further out than one month.
The overnight rate went as high as 11-10 1/2 per cent, before closing at 10
1/4 -10 1/8 per cent, down  1/8 on the previous day. Three-month money
closed at 10 7/8 -10 3/4 per cent, holding stable with yesterday's close,
while at the long end one year money also closed unchanged at 11-10 7/8 per
cent.
The June sterling contract continued its descent, dropping by six basis
points from Wednesday's close to finish at 89.08. It opened at 89.01 and
then bounced between 89.07 and 89.18 during the day, with trading volume
standing at 28,028 by the close.
The Bank of England expected a shortage of around Pounds 400m in the
morning. This included Pounds 290m from treasury bills and maturing
assistance, Pounds 180m in bills for repurchase by the market and Pounds
100m from the rise in note circulation, offset by Pounds 205m in exchequer
transactions.
It revised its shortage to Pounds 300m at midday and did not operate.
However, in the afternoon, it came into action, buying Pounds 137m band-1
bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 13m band-2 at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank
provided late assistance of around Pounds 30m.
The US Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the banking system
through four-day system repurchase agreements. Funds traded at 4- 1/16 per
cent at the time of the Fed's operation, just above the four per cent target
level. The operation addressed a small need for reserves, economists said.
German call money eased but remained close to the 9.75 per cent emergency
Lombard rate, quoted at 9.60/65 per cent after 9.65/70 on Wednesday.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts driven down to pre-Maastricht levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-LED trading drove the UK government bond market down again
yesterday, wiping out the gains made earlier this week and putting the
market back to around its lowest levels since before the Maastricht summit
last autumn.
As in recent days, gilts opened unsettled by the latest opinion poll
results, which showed a small lead for the opposition Labour party. The
difference yesterday was a series of nervous rumours that some foreign
investors were selling gilts, and that the Bank of England had offered stock
to market makers.
Together with a poor day for other European bond markets, this pushed prices
on longer-dated bonds down by around  3/4 of a point, though some of the
losses were recovered later in the day.
The long gilt future on Liffe, which had opened at 94 5/8 , advanced to 94
15/16 early in the day, before the bad news wiped nearly a point off the
price. The Bank of England does not have any current tap stock to supply to
the market, but was rumoured to be looking to sell stock unofficially.
The fear of a greater supply of stock was stoked up by hints that some
foreign investors - recently content to wait on the sidelines for the
outcome of the general election on April 9 - had been unloading some of
their holdings.
With apparent resistance at around 94, the futures contract bounced back by
nearly a quarter of a point from its lows of the day.
In the cash market, the mark-down was reflected in longer-dated bonds, with
the 11 3/4 per cent bond due 2003/07 closing around  1/2 point lower than
its Wednesday close. Shorter-dated gilts lost little ground, with the 10 1/2
per cent bonds due 1997 losing less than  1/4 point on the day.
US TREASURY prices weakened at the long end of the maturity range yesterday
as investors swapped long bonds for shorter-dated securities.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  17/32 at
100 1/8 , yielding 7.982 per cent. The two-year note, in contrast, was up
1/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 5.700 per cent.
Although there was no clear cause for the rush to the short end yesterday,
investors are believed to have favoured notes over bonds because of the
belief that the economic recovery will remain anaemic for some time, and
that the Federal Reserve will, therefore, keep monetary policy relaxed for
most of the year.
Long bonds were also hit by the expected announcement of a Dollars 1bn issue
of 50-year bonds by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
The day's only fresh economic news - a 15,000 rise in weekly jobless
insurance claims - was in line with expectations and had no real impact on
prices.
INFLATION figures from two German states came in much as expected, leaving
the bund market still beset by doubts about where to look for any
improvement in the short term. The state of Hesse reported year-on-year
price rises of 4.9 per cent, against 4.5 per cent in North Rhine-Westphalia.
At these levels, analysts said, the overall rise was likely to be around the
expected level of 4.7 per cent.
Bunds remained in a narrow trading range, losing ground recovered the day
before. The yield on 10-year bonds rose from 8 per cent to 8.024 per cent on
the day, while the bund futures contract on Liffe, which opened at 87.30,
lost ground to close at around 87.37.
FRENCH government bonds tracked the German market closely as investors
awaited a cabinet reshuffle promised by Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime
minister. It seems that only the removal of Mrs Cresson herself will bring
much cheer back to the market.
Ten-year French government bonds lost ground yesterday, while maintaining a
yield spread of 66 basis points over comparable bunds.
JAPANESE government bonds moved ahead slightly, with the yield on the
benchmark no 129 falling from 5.33 per cent to 5.31 per cent on the day.
However, government bonds are expected to keep to a narrow trading range
ahead of an expected cut in the official discount rate next week.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Salomon blunder fuels trading
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers, the embattled Wall Street securities house, was yesterday
clearing up the mess left by an embarrassing clerical error which swamped
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) late on Wednesday with hundreds of
millions of dollars in computerised sell orders.
The mistake, which could prove costly, created chaos on the exchange floor
and knocked 12 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the final two
minutes of trading.
The NYSE said it was 'reviewing' the trades with the full co-operation of
Salomon. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the industry watchdog, said
it would also look into the matter.
Although it was not clear whether any disciplinary action would be taken
against the firm, the fuss surrounding Salomon's blunder is likely to
intensify the debate over the influence of computer trading on US stock
markets.
The error, which traders said was unprecedented in recent memory, was
committed when two Salomon clerks mistook a customer's order to sell Dollars
11m of stock as an order to sell 11m shares of stock. Even in these days of
big computerised trades, the latter represented a huge sale.
At 3.58pm on Wednesday, two minutes before the close, the incorrect order
was sent by Salomon to the stock market via computer, which began selling
11m shares of some of the market's biggest stocks.
The sudden wave of sell orders pushed prices lower as traders on the floor
rushed to find matching buyers. The Dow, which at 3.58pm had been up nearly
13 points, finished down 1.57 points. Experts say the entire loss was
attributable to the Salomon trades.
The value of the bungled order was estimated to have been somewhere between
Dollars 300m and Dollars 500m, although Salomon says it spotted the mistake
and 'halted the order mid-trade'.
The error could not have come at a worse time for Salomon, which is still
struggling to overcome last year's scandal over its illegal activities in
the Treasury bond markets.
The managerial, staffing and procedural changes in the wake of the scandal
have created morale problems within the company, most notably in Salomon's
equity department, which has seen its role cut back and several senior
executives depart for other firms.
One Wall Street insider who knows Salomon well said the computer blunder
revealed a worrying lack of supervision at the firm. He was surprised that
clerks apparently did not check with a senior supervisor before executing
the huge block sale of 11m shares.
If the embarrassment over the bungle were not enough, Salomon faced the task
yesterday of sorting out the mess without losing money.
Observers said that whether the trading error ultimately proved costly
depended on which direction the stock market moved. Late last night a
spokesman for Salomon said: 'The position we were left with on Wednesday
night was neutralised before the market opened this morning via a complex
set of hedging procedures.'
Salomon's blunder is also likely to provide ammunition to critics of
computerised block trading, a practice regularly used by big securities
firms to execute large stock orders in a hurry.
In the past, computer trading has been blamed for exacerbating price
volatility, most notably during the October 1987 crash. Critics have also
argued that it undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
They say the ability of dealers to trade large amounts of shares at great
speed by computer gives them an unfair advantage over individual investors,
who have to trade via specialist market-makers on the exchange floor.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Senior commissioner at SEC
resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edward Fleischman resigned last night as senior commissioner at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after years of feuding with Mr
Richard Breeden, the US watchdog's ambitious chairman.
The departure of the combative Mr Fleischman came as no surprise to
Washington insiders.
In recent years he had publicly disagreed with Mr Breeden over a number of
policy issues, arguing that the chairman wanted to stifle dissent within the
SEC and play down the power and influence of its four commissioners.
Mr Fleischman was particularly critical of the way decisions have been taken
at the SEC under Mr Breeden. In a controversial speech to the American Bar
Association in Atlanta last August, the commissioner charged that too many
key policy decisions were being made behind closed doors and that the SEC
was no longer publicly accountable for its actions.
The dissenting commissioner also argued that 'regulatory ambition' had crept
into the SEC during Mr Breeden's tenure, a veiled reference to the
widely-held view that Mr Breeden was using his chairmanship of the
commission as a springboard to political advancement in the Bush
administration.
Mr Fleischman's term as commissioner was scheduled to expire in June.
He could have sought renomination, but has decided instead to leave the SEC
next week to join New York law firm Rosenman &amp; Colin, where he will become a
partner.
He said last night: 'I've been here too long,' and went on to say that
during his time at the SEC he had seen the 'diminishment of my role and that
of other commissioners'.

FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: DAF seeks capital as losses
mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker in which British Aerospace holds a
16 per cent stake, plunged deeper into loss last year with a net deficit of
Fl 394.5m (Dollars 212m), compared with a loss of Fl 228m a year earlier.
The company disclosed yesterday that it had begun talks with its banks and
the Dutch government with the aim of seeking a capital injection of up to Fl
300m in the next six months to strengthen its battered finances.
DAF's financial performance is the weakest of the leading European
truck-makers, largely due to its dependence on the UK truck market, which
has suffered the steepest slide into recession since the Second World War.
The heavy losses of the past two years have seriously weakened its balance
sheet. Group capital and reserves have declined to only 26.3 per cent of
total assets from 34 per cent in 1988-89, in spite of the proceeds of a Fl
250m convertible preference share issue last autumn.
Mr Cor Baan, the group's vice-chairman, said the company was 'investigating
all the options' to strengthen the balance sheet. DAF was not planning to
issue new shares, he said. However, it is understood that one option under
discussion is a subordinated bank loan possibly backed by a state guarantee.
DAF said it had reached agreement with its banking consortium led by
ABN-Amro Bank for its financing needs.
The deterioration in its financial performance last year meant that DAF had
breached covenants in its loan agreements. As a result, a number of its
banks had taken collateral security on DAF properties in the Netherlands,
Belgium and the UK.
DAF will not pay a dividend on its ordinary shares for the second year
running, and it warned that it would suffer a further loss in the first half
of 1992. However, it forecast it would be close to break-even for the whole
year.
'The result for the second half of the year is expected to largely offset
the loss for the first half of the year,' the group said. This assumed a
modest recovery in the UK truck market.
DAF blamed its heavy losses on the low level of capacity utilisation at
plants in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium in the face of a 12 per cent
fall in truck production to only 26,373.
Truck output has fallen by 24 per cent in the past two years, while van
production declined last year by 9.4 per cent to 22,274.
The number of vehicles delivered fell by 4.8 per cent last year to 51,208.
Combined truck and van deliveries have fallen by 12.7 per cent in the last
two years.
DAF said that it was committed to 'lessening its dependence on the UK
market', but Britain still accounted for 29.5 per cent of group turnover
last year, compared with 31.1 per cent in 1990.

Maughan
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who took over as interim
chairman of Salomon after the Wall Street securities house became engulfed
in scandal last year, wants Mr Deryck Maughan to be named chief executive of
the group's broking operation, Salomon Brothers, when the government's
investigation of the scandal is completed this year.
Mr Maughan, currently Salomon Brothers' chief operating officer, was tipped
to take over the helm of the big broking firm after being appointed by Mr
Buffett last August to clear up the mess created by the bond trading
scandal.
Mr Maughan has instigated a number of fundamental reforms. Although the
changes have created some unrest within the company, and led to departures,
Mr Maughan remains generally well-liked by staff and has the full confidence
of Mr Buffett and the board.
There is so far no indication who will succeed Mr Buffett as head of the
entire Salomon group, which includes Salomon Brothers and the Phibro oil
trading and refining operation. Mr Buffett, who says he will step down as
chairman when the federal inquiry is over, is believed to favour a new chief
executive independent of both Salomon Brothers and Phibro.
In a separate development, Salomon has rejected demands from former chairman
Mr John Gutfreund and former vice-chairman Mr Thomas Strauss - who both
resigned their positions last year because of the bond trading scandal - for
more than Dollars 16m in bonuses and severance pay.
Mr Gutfreund and Mr Strauss have claimed they are owed about Dollars 7m and
Dollars 9m respectively in the form of severance pay, a special bonus pool
and annual bonuses earned for work completed before their departure. They
are also claiming Dollars 6.8m and Dollars 6m respectively in stock and
stock options.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Silent Tiny faces erosion of small holder
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST TWO hours into Lonrho's annual meeting, a small shareholder demanded
that Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland break his silence.
'Could Mr Rowland please stand up and tell us who are the six other
directors on the board who could also do the deals, in order to dispel the
tycoon factor,' he asked.
As Mr Rowland sat impassively, Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, replied: 'Mr
Rowland does not talk, he acts.'
While the answer received polite applause, it did little to calm the mood of
agitated shareholders demanding to know why the price of their shares had
collapsed.
Mr Rowland still had his supporters however.
One shareholder described him as 'the jewel in Lonrho's crown' and urged her
fellow shareholders to 'trust Tiny'.
Yet support from many of Lonrho's small shareholders was never really in
doubt.
What yesterday's annual meeting suggested was that about half of Mr
Rowland's once loyal band of small shareholders are no longer willing to
simply 'trust' their chief executive.
At the beginning of the meeting, a half-hour film was shown about Lonrho's
great successes in Africa. The film concluded that on Lonrho's estates it
had been a year worth celebrating.
While many shareholders agreed with those sentiments a significant number
yesterday made it clear that there was not much to celebrate in London.
As one shareholder put it: 'What a difference a year makes.' He pointed out
that Mr Rowland, in the 1990 Lonrho annual report, said the international
trading group had a sound financial base.
A year later many of the British companies were making a loss.
'Are the Lonrho directors spending too much time on litigation instead of
keeping their eye on their own ball?' asked the shareholder.
Another demanded to know why Lonrho's share price had been decimated. 'After
all,' he added, 'the City is not an ass, there must be an answer.'
Mr Leclezio explained that all UK companies were having a difficult time;
profits from Africa were not too high and the remittance of Lonrho's African
profits was proving easier than in the past.
Another shareholder wanted to know whether the board would consider the
appointment of independent non-executive shareholders.
Mr Leclezio said the group was not against the appointment of non-executive
directors, but they would have to be the 'right ones' who would 'fit into
the company'.
In response to the mood of the AGM, Lonrho's shares, after originally rising
on news of the sale of 33 per cent of Metropole Hotels to the Libyan Arab
Foreign Investment company for Pounds 177m, down 8p to close at 95p.
At the end of the meeting, nearly all the shareholders present voted in
favour of accepting the report and accounts.
But Mr Rowland was served notice by many of his shareholders, that if he
wants to remain silent at next year's meeting, Lonrho will need an
outstanding second half to give them better news when the year-end results
are published in January 1993.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Weir to Pounds 34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEIR Group, the Glasgow-based engineer, yesterday displayed cautious
optimism while reporting a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1991 and
a 14 per cent rise in the final dividend.
'Our order book is good, demand is holding up, and we have a strong
financial position,' said Lord Weir, chairman.
He added that, despite a difficult economic background, he was 'fairly
optimistic that we can continue the momentum of the last few years.'
Profits for the 52 weeks to December 27 rose from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds
34.2m on turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 424.1m (Pounds 318.9m).
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 32.1p (28.8p) and the final dividend
of 7.4p (6.5p) makes a 10.5p (9.3p) total.
Mr Ron Garrick, managing director, said half the rise in turnover came from
acquisitions - including the full-year benefit of purchases made in 1990.
The other half came from growth in the company's basic business.
New orders in 1991 rose 38 per cent to Pounds 474m, divided evenly between
the company's five main markets - the oil industry, marine, water supply and
sewage, general industrial and power generation.
The biggest single order was a contract for a desalination plant in Dubai,
worth Pounds 23m.
The main division, engineering products, increased turnover by 42 per cent
to Pounds 342.4m and pre-tax profits by 40.2 per cent to Pounds 14.2m. At
the smaller engineering services division, pre-tax profits were flat at
Pounds 12.5m.
Net cash at year-end stood at Pounds 46m compared with Pounds 33m at
end-1990.
COMMENT
The company's decision, born of desperation in the last recession, to move
towards more specialised, 'difficult' technologies has paid off in two ways.
Despite a slight dip in margins, Weir has remained immune, so far, from the
worst of the industry's price pressures. And the niches it chose - including
gas turbine power generation, the oil industry and water treatment - have
all continued to grow briskly. The company is confident that it can keep a
cost advantage over German rivals at DM2.95 to the pound, and the steady
flow of small acquisitions is likely to continue. Worries include the
possibility that continental competitors will slash prices to keep order
books full if the German slowdown worsens. The share price has outperformed
the sector by 195 per cent in the last five years and 9 per cent in the past
month. With Pounds 40m profits likely in 1992, the stock is fairly priced on
a prospective p/e of 14, above the sector average but not out of line with
the market as a whole.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea chief buys Cabra stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN BATES, chairman of Chelsea Football Club, has bought a 27 per cent
stake in Cabra Estates, the club's heavily indebted landlord.
The purchase, for about Pounds 3m, from Mr Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian
financier, is Mr Bates's latest line of attack as Chelsea struggles to avoid
eviction from Stamford Bridge, its London ground.
Mr Bates is now the largest shareholder in Cabra Estates, with which he has
been in dispute for most of the three years since Cabra took over Marler
Estates.
He is understood to have paid between 11p and 12p a share for the stake,
valuing Cabra at about Pounds 11m, less than half the Pounds 22.85m price
recently put on Stamford Bridge by an independent valuer.
Cabra also owns Fulham FC's Craven Cottage ground and a construction company
in the Republic of Ireland, but its debts have grown to more than Pounds 50m
 -something of a deterrent to a bid. The shares jumped 2p to 9p yesterday.
The property company reiterated yesterday that it was still determined to
force Chelsea to pay the Pounds 22.85m for the ground, or evict it. It
recently won a High Court order saying that Chelsea should fulfil a contract
to pay the sum. This has gone to appeal.
Mr Bates is using his new position as a major shareholder to call for an
extraordinary meeting. The agenda will probably include the suggestion that
Mr John Duggan be ousted as Cabra's chairman, as well as a question about
the future of Stamford Bridge. Mr Duggan said the board would probably meet
Mr Bates, who had requested a seat on it.
Mr Marwan said yesterday he had tried to encourage the two sides to find an
amicable solution. 'But this was difficult, so I decided to sell Mr Bates
the shares.'
The recorded message on Chelsea's Clubcall telephone line described the
purchase of the stake as 'the biggest transfer of all'. It also got the
decimal point in the wrong place over the amount spent, saying it was Pounds
29m.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Tibbett &amp; Britten drives ahead 15% to
Pounds 13.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIBBETT &amp; BRITTEN Group, the clothing and grocery distribution company,
reported a 15 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in 1991, from Pounds 11.7m to
Pounds 13.5m, as acquisitions and interest received on cash balances helped
compensate for tough conditions in clothing.
The rise was achieved on a 16 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 181.2m
(Pounds 155.6m). The group said that 80 per cent of the new revenue came
from organic growth, helped by new contracts with Marks and Spencer and J
Sainsbury.
Nevertheless, operating margins fell to 6.9 per cent (7.2 per cent) mainly
because of pressure in clothing and textiles, which make up just under half
of group revenue. Although overseas and distribution for individual clients
performed well, shared-network distribution, about a fifth of the clothing
division, became unprofitable as volumes and prices fell.
The retail consolidation division, which handles electrical and non-food
goods, saw revenues up by 30 per cent following previous investment in
warehousing for the B&amp;Q Retail DIY chain, and a new contract from Digital
Equipment Company.
Lowfield Distribution, which handles foodstuffs, saw turnover rise 12 per
cent, helped by the acquisition of a further contract from J Sainsbury.
Capital expenditure at Pounds 14m was some Pounds 6m lower than in previous
years, but the company also spent Pounds 6m on acquisitions, mainly a
regional distribution centre for Marks and Spencer.
However interest receivable still increased to Pounds 984,000 (Pounds
354,000).
Mr John Harvey, chairman, warned that '1992 will not be an easy year' but
added that 'tough conditions create change, and change helps us.'
Helped by a slight fall in the tax charge, earnings rose by 14 per cent to
25.7p (22.5p). A final dividend of 7.4p marked a 17 per cent rise in the
total dividend to 10.8p (9.2p).

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Kynoch launches rights to fund two
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
G&amp;G KYNOCH, the medical and scientific products group, yesterday reported
preliminary results for the 16 months to end-December, two acquisitions and
a Pounds 2.6m call on shareholders to fund the purchases.
Profits before tax amounted to Pounds 851,000, compared with profits of
Pounds 703,000 for the year to December 31 1991 and losses of Pounds 983,000
for the 12 months to August 31 1990.
The acquisitions are Astec Environmental Systems, a manufacturer of
filtration fume cupboards, and Peteric, a maker of biological safety
cabinets and related containment equipment.
The purchases, both in cash, will expand the range of products of Kynoch's
medical division and services and provide access to new markets in Europe
and the UK.
Maximum consideration for Astec is Pounds 1.05m and that of Peteric Pounds
414,000.
The rights issue, underwritten by Beeson Gregory, is of 7.9m new ordinary
shares at 36p each on a 2-for-3 basis.

FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: United Newspapers drops to Pounds 85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NEWSPAPERS, the publisher of the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily
Star and Yorkshire Post, yesterday announced an 11 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 85.2m in 1991, against Pounds 95.7m last time.
Lord Stevens, chairman, said the results illustrated the depth and the
extent of the recession and were 'not unreasonable in the circumstances'.
He added that, although 1992 had started somewhat better than expected in
the UK and the US, the outlook in the UK was heavily dependent on the result
of next month's general election and its effect on economic recovery.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 812.6m (Pounds 829.1m) and earnings per share
fell to 27.1p (31.7p). Despite the effect of recession on the group, it is
holding its final dividend at 13.5p for an unchanged total of 21p. The
shares rose 13p to close at 373p.
Lord Stevens said he was particularly encouraged by the way costs had been
controlled and by the improved perfortions, from advertising-supported
magazines in the US, and from Extel Financial and Express Newspapers in the
UK.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, the stockbroker, said that
the results were a lot better than many people had expected and that many
parts of the company were poised for growth once the recession ended.
'I think the quality of the portfolio is improving,' he said, adding that
the Sunday Express had improved its share of the Sunday market and the Daily
Express was holding its own. The Daily Star, after poor sales averaging
about 786,000 in February, had shot up to more than 825,000 in March.
Part of the cost-cutting had come from closing uneconomic titles. The
process continued this week when the group announced that Punch would close
on April 8 unless a buyer was found.
Mr Graham Wilson, United managing director, said that although there had
been numerous expressions of interests no concrete bids for the 150-year-old
humour magazine had yet been submitted.
Overall, Mr Wilson said he planned to continue to publish aggressively, to
increase market share and to go for growth.
Profits of United's national newspapers actually rose slightly from Pounds
23.8m to Pounds 24.3m and there was only a 6 per cent drop in regional
newspaper profits to Pounds 27.1m despite a 31 per cent fall in situations
vacant advertising.
Advertising periodicals had profits of Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 32.1m) but
magazines and exhibitions fell more sharply from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds
21.4m.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Plugging into each other's strengths: The trend to
international strategic alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and Grundig, the German
consumer electronics company in which it owns a 32 per cent stake, said they
would join their video and cordless telephone operations.
On the same day, Olivetti, the Italian computers and office equipment group,
announced an alliance with Canon, the Japanese camera and electronics group,
to produce bubble ink-jet printers.
These moves are part of a growing trend among Europe's ailing electronics
manufacturers to seek alliances in the hope of regaining their
competitiveness in the marketplace.
They include another recent announcement by Philips that it was joining
forces with Motorola, the US group, to design and develop semiconductor
chips for Compact Disk Interactive, a new CD-based medium combining
graphics, data, CD audio and video.
The Dutch group is now also looking for a partner to invest in a plant to
manufacture liquid crystal displays, a product of increasing strategic
importance.
A spate of similar links has also taken place in Europe's semiconductor and
computer industries over the past year as difficult market conditions forced
companies to adopt measures to stem failing fortunes.
Earlier this year Groupe Bull of France, the computer group, announced a
link with IBM of the US to develop advanced semiconductor chips. And
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor group is to collaborate with
GEC Plessey Semiconductors of the UK in chip development, and with Philips
in a semiconductor plant in Grenoble.
Nokia, the Finnish group, has been restructuring its consumer electronics
division, and has also been talking to a number of unnamed parties about
possible links.
Such partnerships have been spurred by the growing recognition among
Europe's indigenous manufacturers that their US and Japanese competitors
could be the main beneficiaries of the single European market. European
electronics companies have accepted they need help to survive in
increasingly competitive markets otherwise they will not be able to fund the
R&amp;D needed to keep pace with technology.
This is particularly true in the semiconductor industry, where most European
companies are suffering losses. 'That is the area in which European
companies are crying out for help,' says Mr Andrew Haskins, industry analyst
at James Capel.
Even cash-rich Siemens has realised it cannot afford the investment needed
to stay in the race and recently announced ventures in chip development with
both IBM and Toshiba of Japan.
The move towards alliances follows the failure to build a European
electronics champion through the merger of the semiconductor activities of
Siemens, SGS-Thomson and Philips. The three groups were unable to reconcile
their differences and, after months of talks, Siemens decided to link with
IBM, effectively dashing hopes for a major European electronics group.
It is not only that the Europeans find it difficult to agree on broad
co-operation; there has also been a spreading conviction that simply joining
the weak operations of three big groups will not lead to a strong business.
Having abandoned the idea of a European champion, manufacturers have
embraced less grand alliances, both among themselves and with outside
groups, as the logical solution to their problems. Olivetti has set up a
division specifically to look for possible technological co-operation.
Such alliances offer manufacturers the chance to pool resources and
rationalise operations, at a time of spiralling costs and stagnant growth of
key markets.
The situation is particularly dire for financially stretched European
groups. Last year, although Philips returned to profitability, its income
from consumer electronics declined 33 per cent. Thomson, Nokia and Olivetti
also suffered losses last year and the situation is equally bleak among
European semiconductor and computer manufacturers.
If they are to remain in the invest in R&amp;D, Europe's manufacturers need to
join forces or seek help from outside.
Ms Angela Dean, industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects Philips to
announce further alliances as it moves to rationalise its operations. 'What
we hear from Philips in the future will be more general and not just
restricted to video equipment,' she said.
Alliances with strategic partners also offer manufacturers the chance to tap
demand outside their own national markets. This is important for European
manufacturers, which have often blamed their woes on the lack of a large
indigenous demand base to support economies of scale.
Pan-European alliances will help to rationalise operations and share costs.
But they will have limited impact on raising the competitiveness of European
manufacturers. For that, European companies will have to look to US and
Japanese companies for the key technologies necessary to remain competitive
and profitable.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Redland wins battle for Steetley: Takeover will create
Europe's leading building materials group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND yesterday won its four-month battle to take over Steetley, its
building materials rival, with 60 per cent of Steetley's shareholders
accepting its offer.
The takeover, which values Steetley at Pounds 613m at yesterday's closing
prices, will create Europe's leading building materials group with a
turnover of slightly in excess of Pounds 2bn. It will be the UK's second
largest company in bricks, Europe's second largest in aggregates, and the
world's largest in roofing tiles.
Redland also announced acceptances from 78 per cent of Steetley preference
shareholders. The offer of 87 Redland shares for 100 Steetley shares had a
cash alternative of 365p.
A spokesman for Steetley said yesterday: 'The board is clearly disappointed,
but a construction company in the trough of a recession is a fairly easy
target.'
He added that the UK's competition policy, which forced it to abandon a
proposed joint venture in bricks and tiles with Tarmac, the UK building
materials group, had been 'no aid either'. The proposed venture, announced
last year, was referred first to Brussels under EC competition rules, and
then back to the UK. It collapsed after referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Redland, which planned to bid for Steetley in 1992, then accelerated its
plans after giving the MMC assurances that it would sell certain businesses.
Mr Robert Napier, chief executive, said yesterday: 'We have now put together
two fine companies and we have a lot of work ahead to get the benefits.'
Redland expects the merger to bring Pounds 30m pre-tax cost savings in 1993.
Steetley will also bring the group around Pounds 30m of unused advance
corporation tax provisions.
Redland has undertaken to sell within 18 months two UK brick works and one
clay tile business with combined turnover of almost Pounds 30m, around 5 per
cent of Steetley's turnover, leaving UK turnover at just under a third of
the merged group.
The Steetley board yesterday advised shareholders to take no further action
until a statement after a board meeting tomorrow.
A spokesman for the company said it hoped there would be 'an orderly and
professional handover . . . the directors aren't going to just put on their
coats and walk out'. Mr Napier declined to comment on whether there would be
a continuing role for Steetley directors.
The past two months has seen a debate between the two boards about the value
of European aggregates, in which Redland accused Steetley of overvaluing its
French and Spanish assets.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Freeze on domestic gas prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is to freeze prices to domestic consumers from next month and
will review them in June with a view to a cut if inflation stays low.
'There is not much doubt that if inflation continues to decline, the next
move we make on prices will be downwards,' Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing
director of British Gas, said.
The move has been forced on the company by a tough pricing formula which
restricts domestic gas price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate
of inflation.
British Gas is preparing to ask its regulator, the Office of Gas Supply, to
re-evaluate this and allow it to increase prices because of a cut being made
in its share of industrial business. This is part of an agreement with the
Office of Fair Trading to encourage competition.
British Gas is worried that this cut could reduce its ability to supply its
domestic customers cost-effectively.
Mr Brown said there had been a 17 per cent reduction in the price of gas in
real terms since privatisation in 1986.
But Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council said: 'There is
definitely an element of disappointment in the price news: we were all keyed
up to expect a price cut and it's a case of jam tomorrow.'
British Gas also announced its new commitment to consumers, which promises
its 18m household customers higher standards of service and offers them
fixed rates of compensation if the company fails to live up to its targets.
'We're determined British Gas will be second to none in terms of standards
and quality,' Mr Brown said.
Customers will, for example, be able to claim Pounds 10 compensation if
British Gas cancels an appointment without giving a day's notice. They will
be eligible for a Pounds 20 payment if gas supply is interrupted and not
resumed within one working day.
'The customer will get a very clear promise from British Gas as to what it
will deliver in a whole range of activities,' Mr Brown stressed. The company
will launch a Pounds 2m publicity campaign next week.
Mr Powe said the commitments were 'rather mealy-mouthed'.
He added: 'It's taken them a very long time to get to the stage the regional
electricity companies were at in 1988. It's disappointing that British Gas
is not paying compensation automatically since many customers will not know
what they're entitled to.'

FT  27 MAR 92 / Ukraine may retain N-arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL for Ukraine to retain nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip so
that reductions in the arsenals of other ex-Soviet republics could be
achieved, is among confidential proposals drawn up by the Ukrainian
parliament's defence committee.
The proposals, which are expected to provoke a fierce debate in parliament
next week, suggest Ukraine should rethink its pledge to remove all strategic
weapons by the end of 1994.
Following Ukraine's decision to halt shipments of tactical nuclear weapons
to Russia for dismantling, the suggestion is likely to cause misgivings in
the west and to exacerbate strains between Kiev and Moscow.
All tactical nuclear weapons were to have been shipped to Russia by July 1.
Ukraine has between 2,000 and 4,000 tactical weapons and 176 long-range
strategic missiles. Of these, 130 are scheduled for destruction during seven
years under last year's US-Soviet Start treaty.
Belarus and Kazakhstan are the other non-Russian republics with nuclear
weapons on their territory.
One deputy closely involved in the debate said that the committee was
proposing that Ukraine 'retain the right to reconsider the time-frame for
the shipment of nuclear weapons out of Ukraine depending on developments in
the Commonwealth of Independent States'.
Mr Mykola Porovsky, a member of the defence committee, outlined the three
main elements of the proposed nuclear policy.
First, rather than making unilateral cuts in the force on its territory, Mr
Porovsky said Ukraine should negotiate with other republics on disarmament.
Second, he said that Ukraine would insist on having the technical means to
prevent the use of nuclear weapons on its territory, rather than simply
being consulted by Russia.
Third, Ukraine would reinforce this control by assuming jurisdiction over
the personnel assigned to the strategic forces stationed in Ukraine.
The question of an oath of allegiance to the republic is likely to develop
throughout Ukraine, notably regarding the Black Sea fleet.
Some western observers accepted that western policy was partly to blame for
Ukraine's misgivings about removing the weapons. 'The west must reward
Ukraine, at least politically, for its non-nuclear stance,' a senior
diplomat said.

FT  27 MAR 92 / 'Clot-busters' found less safe than 30-year-old heart drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO heavily promoted new 'clot-busters' are a less safe treatment for heart
attacks than a drug introduced 30 years ago and cost five to 10 times as
much, according to a clinical trial said by the organisers at Oxford
University to be the largest in medical history.
Results of the Isis-3 trial, involving 46,000 heart attack patients in 20
countries, are published today in the Lancet, the British-based medical
journal. They are likely to make a big impact on the highly competitive
market for clot-dissolving drugs.
They show that streptokinase, whose patent protection has long expired,
saves lives as effectively as its two high-tech competitors, Apsac and tPA,
made by the Anglo-American SmithKline Beecham, and Genentech of the US
respectively. When combined with aspirin, all three drugs cut heart attack
mortality by half.
'But streptokinase is safer, with both tPA and Apsac causing significantly
more strokes from bleeding into the brain,' Isis-3 concluded.
Genentech has most to lose from the survey. Last year's sales of tPA (trade
name Activase) were worth Dollars 195m (Pounds 112.7m) - 38 per cent of the
company's total revenues. Its share of the US market for clot-dissolving
drugs fell from two-thirds to half, after preliminary results from Isis-3
were released a year ago.
The full report today emphasises more strongly the increased risks from tPA
and Apsac. According to Dr Rory Collins, Isis-3 co-ordinator, US hospitals
could save more than Dollars 100m and prevent as many as 400 strokes a year
by prescribing streptokinase instead of tPA.
But Mr Kirk Raab, chief executive of Genentech, said yesterday: 'We continue
to believe that the Isis-3 findings are irrelevant to our product and to
standard prescribing patterns for thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) therapy in
the US.'
Genentech and SKB say Isis-3 did not test their products under appropriate
clinical conditions.
According to SKB, Eminase - its trade name for Apsac  - saves lives because
it can be given to patients more quickly and easily than streptokinase.
Genentech points out that the tPA used in Isis-3 was not Activase but a
version made by Wellcome of the UK. Although Wellcome abandoned its tPA in
1990 after a court ruled that it infringed Genentech's patent, the US
company says the two are not clinically identical.
Genentech is paying Dollars 55m to support another clinical comparison
called Gusto, with 40,000 patients, which will compare Activase and
streptokinase.

It is a bit off that Peter Drew should be bundled out of the Taylor Woodrow
chairman's seat with such unseemly haste.
One minute he is looking forward to eventual retirement as chairman of what
is still one of Britain's most respected construction companies, even ifdown
on its luck. The next he is retired with immediate effect and the board's
'best wishes'. After 26 years'
service, the top man might surely have been given more than 24 hours to
clear his desk, however bad a job he has done.
Heaven forbid, but could the swiftness of his exit have
anything to do with the end of the tax year on April 5 and the possibility
of a Labour

generous with his settlement than it was with his period of notice.

It's always worth keeping an eye on what happens to the former acquisition
chiefs in Lord Hanson's entourage.
Greg Hutchings (class of 83) is the obvious star. He has taken Tomkins into
the FT-SE 100 and his company now sports a much racier share rating than
Hanson. John Newman (class of 77) is doing a reasonable job at TT Group, and
the smart money at Han-
son is on Philip Turner (class of 87) currently running Wassall with Chris
Miller, one of his lordship's old personal assistants. Now another Han- son
alumnus, Andrew Arends, has popped up as business development director of
Bunzl.
It is not a main board appointment, but then Arends - Oxford, Financial
Times and Harvard Law School - is far younger than the rest having just
turned 30.
Recruited by Lord White, he served on Hanson's Consolidated Gold Fields and
Beazer acquisition campaigns. However, he was moved side-
ways on the arrival of Chris Collins - he of the ICI idea.
Students of form might think that if Arends is as good as he sounds, then he
could have done better than embattled Bunzl. However, he still has time to
prove his mettle.

opening up a new line of career. With today's launch of a Santiago office by
Yorkton Securities - the first Canadian brokerage house to set up in Chile -
she is to act as its investment adviser there.
The well connected mining entrepreneur first broke into the industry by
joining Anglo American's subsidiary in Chile on the administration side in
the 1980s. She then branched off on her own and has been involved in
numerous mining projects, including the San Cristobal gold mine, eventually
sold to Battle Mountain Gold's subsidiary, Niugini Mining.
While going on running her Windsor Resources exploration company, which is
looking for more gold and copper projects, at Yorkton's office she will work
with another woman with mining even deeper in her veins: operations manager
Catherine McLeod.
Daughter of Canadian mines man Don McLeod, she has worked mainly as a banker
and broker to the mining community. She says that, by having people on the
spot, Yorkton should be well set to win business from the expected second
wave of mines investment in Chile - now the mining houses' favourite

Peter Jacobs, the old British Sugar hand now stirring things up as Bupa's
chief executive, is delivering on his pledge to make the private health
group more commercial while keep- ing its compassionate image.
On Monday he reported that Bupa had turned a Pounds 38.2m deficit into a
Pounds 1.3m surplus last year. Yesterday, he introduced the compassionate
image in the form of Sir Bryan Nicholson, the Post Office chairman and chief
executive, who is to succeed Lord Wigoder as Bupa's chairman.
Nicholson came to public prominence as chairman of the then Manpower
Services Commission in 1984 - he was knighted for his services there when he
left in 1987 - and his work on unemployment and training schemes revealed
him as a businessman with a strong social conscience. He still chairs the
National Council for Vocational Qualifications and the CBI's education and
training committee.
No doubt Jacobs will be keen to take advantage of Nicholson's business
exper-
ience as well as his reputation for compassion. The private health care
market is even more cut-throat than the new, commercial NHS, and Bupa's
market-leadership is under increasingly heavy attack.

Readers finding Britain's election campaign humdrum may like to know it has
at least provided one surprise, albeit outside the UK. It happened to a
British ski-ing party returning from Austria.
When they went to board their flight home at Salzburg airport, they were
stunned to find the Stansted-bound aircraft gaily emblazoned with the Labour
party campaign motif, complete with red rose.
One of the skiers, Tina Pulsford, marketing services manager with Hayters of
Bishops Stortford, says the 80 passengers were disgusted. 'We didn't expect
to be flying home in an advertising vehicle. We don't want political
opinions forced on us - especially as we're the sort of people that Labour
intends to clobber.'
Some passengers threatened not to board the plane. But all finally did so,
even though not entirely pacified by British Air Ferries' explanation that
the plane was going on to fulfil a Labour party charter.
'Mind you, we did have the last laugh once we boarded,' says Pulsford. 'The
interior of the Red Rose special is bright blue.'

FT  27 MAR 92 / Only clean and green borrowers need apply: Fears of
environmental liability are making banks hesitate before lending to some
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Anne Evans knows about dirty industries. The US businesswoman and her
company, Elm Energy, are about to build a Pounds 50m electricity generating
plant in the British Midlands which will burn used rubber tyres - the first
of its kind in Europe.
Not that the plant will besmirch the Midlands environment: it uses the
latest clean technology, and has the blessing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate
of Pollution. The UK government also gave it enthusiastic support because of
its pioneering nature.
Mrs Evans's problem was with the banks, from which she was trying to raise
Pounds 35m in loans. Although they were satisfied about the quality of the
technology, they were anxious about the green aspects of the plant. Did Mrs
Evans have all the right permits, would she be able to dispose of the waste
products, and - their greatest worry  - was there any danger of land
contamination?
After more than a year of negotiation, Mrs Evans finally secured the money
she needed, but she reckons that environmental issues added greatly to her
upfront costs, in lawyers' fees alone. 'If banks are worried about
contaminated land, they should not be lending in the Midlands,' she says
with some impatience. 'They should be lending in the middle of the desert.'
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the UK chemicals and feedstock company, also knows
about financiers' worries. Since last August, it has been negotiating a
Dollars 120m private placement with a group of US institutions. But
Harrisons owns 110 chemical sites in the US and the institutions insisted on
inspecting each one before they would commit themselves. Eventually,
Harrisons persuaded them that they need only visit a fraction of that
number, and gave them documentation for the rest. But the delays and
lawyers' fees have added noticeably to the cost.
'This is clearly indicative of a trend,' says Mr Bill Turcan, Harrisons'
finance director.
The lenders' fears are twofold. One is that a customer could be caught up in
an expensive environmental lawsuit which might impair its ability to repay
its loan. The other is the extent of a bank's own liability for the
environmental damage caused by a borrower - a legal grey area which bankers
see lawmakers longing to fill to their cost.
'We are worried about the uncertainty and the legislation that could come
out of the UK and Brussels,' says Mr Humphrey Norrington, deputy chairman of
Barclays Bank, one of the two banks involved in the Elm project, the other
being Fuji Bank of Japan.
There has always been a danger that banks will find themselves liable for
penalties incurred by a company when they foreclose on it because it cannot
pay its debts. The act of foreclosure makes them own-ers of the company's
property, and responsible for any pollution it has caused. More recently,
though, there have been suggestions that banks might also be made liable
simply by virtue of their lending relationship, regardless of whether or not
they foreclose.
The fear was triggered by a notorious court case two years ago in the US
involving a company called Fleet Factors, which set a broad precedent for
bank liability for clean-up costs. The court ruled that banks must pay if
they participate 'in the financial management of a facility to a degree
indicating a capacity to influence the corporation's treatment of hazardous
wastes'. A bank did not have to exercise that capacity to be liable.
The case sent shock waves through the financial community and provoked
several attempts - so far unsuccessful  - to introduce new legislation into
Congress which would define liability much more tightly, or specifically
exempt secured lenders.
The position in the EC is less clear. Although several member states have
laws defining liability for environmental damage, none has so far created
any big problems for banks. However, last year the EC Commission produced a
draft directive on civil liability for damage caused by waste, which said
that 'the producer of waste' would be liable 'irrespective of fault on his
part'. Although it was not clear whether a lending bank would count as 'a
producer', the strictness of the proposed liability sent further tremors
through bankers' ranks.
Since then, the Commission appears to have retreated on the proposal.
Instead, it is preparing a green paper on liability for environmental damage
which will address the issue again. However, officials say this will be more
of an exercise to provoke discussion than an attempt to define precise
borders to liability.
Some UK bankers are not satisfied by this. Mrs Hilary Thompson, head of the
environmental management unit at National Westminster and a leading
lobbyist, says that remarks made by EC officials to her suggest that they
intend to take a tough line.
'What they forget is that we might stop lending to these people,' she says.
The irony is that the more a company needs green finance to clean up its
act, the less likely it is to get it. Mrs Thompson is proposing that secured
lenders be exempted from liability provided they exercise due diligence
before lending to a company which subsequently causes damage. This would
probably involve that company carrying out an environmental audit as a
condition for a loan.
British bankers' worries have been noted by the UK government. Mr Michael
Heseltine, environment secretary, told a recent audience of City financiers:
'There are real concerns in this area which I recognise.' But he assured
them: 'We shall be looking for workable solutions in which we are equally as
clear about the effects on business costs as we are about the beneficial
effects on the environment.'
What is already clear is that the level of anxiety about these issues is
much higher in the Anglo-Saxon world than on the Continent. This is partly
because of the Fleet Factors case, and the fact that the US and the UK share
similar legal traditions. In continental Europe, lawyers say, the Napoleonic
traditions treat liability more narrowly. Also, enforcement of any
environmental legislation emanating from Brussels would be a matter for
individual countries, so differences in legal traditions could have a
significance.
It is not clear at this point quite how dampening an effect such worries are
having on bank lending. It has certainly been in the banks' interest to
sound the alarm bells to reinforce their case. But, though Mrs Evans's
experience shows how closely banks are scrutinising sensitive projects, they
are still willing to lend to them provided they are well-managed and
financially sound. The Chemical Industries Association, representing the UK
chemical sector, says it is unaware of any significant financing problems
among its members.
But whatever form the EC's legislation ultimately takes, banks will play an
increasing role in policing the environment. To protect themselves, all the
big UK clearing banks have introduced procedures to check out customers'
environmental records before advancing a loan, and to keep watch until it is
repaid. And checks are bound to get tougher.
'Lenders become essentially an enforcement agency,' says Mr Steve Jones, a
lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue of Washington which specialises in
environmental issues. 'Almost all US property now goes through a site
assessment, and I would be surprised if a similar process did not evolve in
Europe.'

FT  27 MAR 92 / Bus competition fails the road test: Increased efficiency
and innovation have come at a price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a wet morning in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. In most respects, the
town is as quiet as one might expect: but the bus station is a scene of
frenetic activity.
A few weeks ago National Welsh, the town's main bus operator, went into
receivership. With the 1986 deregulation of Britain's bus industry leaving
no barriers to entry, it was the signal for half a dozen other bus companies
to speed into town and fight over the spoils.
The result is close to anarchy. In this town of just 39,500 inhabitants,
buses enter or leave the bus station at the rate of one every 30 seconds.
Double-deckers, single-deckers, coaches, minibuses: they come in a bizarre
array of colours, parking two or three abreast at the bus stands and
proclaiming their destinations, if at all, with hand-scrawled notices stuck
behind their windscreens.
One man is audibly cursing as he dodges his way between the vehicles. 'It's
chaos,' he explodes. 'We're wandering around like chickens with our heads
cut off. Twenty years I've lived in this town, and I can't even find my own
bus stop.'
Merthyr's experiences of bus deregulation are not unique. Towns and cities
throughout much of Britain have experienced bus competition and its
consequences. London, with its special traffic problems, is alone in having
been excluded from the experiment; but the Conservatives have promised to
privatise and deregulate the capital's bus services, too, if they win the
general election.
The aims of deregulation were praiseworthy enough. For years, Britain's bus
system had been in decline. Part of the reason, the government argued in a
1984 white paper, was the highly restrictive licensing system which had
operated for half a century. The 1985 Transport Act swept this system away,
allowing anyone to run a bus service anywhere, except London, and paving the
way for the privatisation of the state-owned and municipal bus operators.
In theory, greater competition should have led to improved efficiency, a
proliferation of bus services, lower fares, and a rise in passenger numbers.
And indeed, deregulation has scored successes.
Efficiency has increased. Department of Transport figures show that the
average operating costs per vehicle mile have fallen by 36 per cent in real
terms since deregulation (largely through reductions in wage costs). Local
authority subsidies for bus services have more than halved from Pounds 465m
a year to Pounds 219m at 1991 prices.
Innovation, too, has come to the industry - notably through the introduction
of high-frequency minibus services in place of less frequent double-deckers.
Total annual bus mileage has risen by 19 per cent since deregulation,
reversing a long period of decline.
Arguably, however, these advances are far outweighed by the negative effects
of deregulation:
Fares have gone up, not down. Department of Transport figures show that
fares outside London have risen by an average of 12 per cent in real terms
since deregulation, largely because of the axeing of subsidies.
The pace of change in routes and services is such that many towns and cities
are no longer able to offer up-to-date information on bus times and routes.
Passengers have deserted the buses. Outside London, the annual number of
journeys has fallen by 19 per cent since deregulation. In the metropolitan
areas, they have fallen by 26 per cent.
Competition is limited mainly to the busiest routes in urban areas. The
effect is to worsen traffic congestion by spreading a declining number of
passengers among more buses. Less profitable off-peak services have been cut
because operators no longer make enough money from their busier services to
cross-subsidise them.
Wafer-thin profits have left operators unable to replace old buses. The
proportion of vehicles more than 12 years old has grown from 19 per cent
before deregulation to 34 per cent now. Britain's bus manufacturing industry
has collapsed.
Six years after its introduction, then, deregulation has failed to reverse
the decline of Britain's bus industry. Yet few would advocate a return to
the old days. The Labour party wants to restore order by giving exclusive
franchises for an entire town or region's services to a single operator. The
bus companies want to be allowed to build up dominant market positions over
substantial geographical areas.
The argument underlying both positions is that some of the best bus services
outside London today are to be found in the small number of towns and cities
where companies enjoy near-monopolies. Bus services in Bristol and
Birmingham, for example, are comprehensive and orderly, timetable
information is readily available, fares are reasonable, and the lack of
cut-throat competition has allowed operators to invest in modern vehicles.
The bus companies argue that regional monopolies are fine as long as the
threat of competition exists, because if an operator gets lazy or
exploitative, rival operators will quickly emerge. But the Department of
Trade and Industry has consistently intervened to obstruct merger activity
in an attempt to preserve head-on competition.
Whatever the outcome of the election, that could change. The trade and
Industry department is currently fighting a High Court ruling, upheld by the
Appeal Court, that local bus monopolies affect too small an area to warrant
intervention. If the House of Lords rejects the DTI's appeal case, the door
will be opened to a wave of consolidation.
Such an outcome, however, is unlikely to deter the Conservatives from
seeking to deregulate London's bus industry - an idea to which local
authorities, consumer groups, the London Tourist Board and others are
strongly opposed.
These organisations have pointed out that efficiency has already been
brought to London, where routes are still regulated but London Buses has to
compete with the private sector for the exclusive right to operate them.
Meanwhile, in spite of severe traffic congestion, London is one part of the
country where bus use has actually risen since 1986.
The government argues that bus deregulation and the privatisation of London
Buses would benefit the capital by encouraging innovation. Opponents,
though, query whether this potential gain would outweigh the risks.
Confusion over fast-changing routes and services could lead to mass
desertion of the buses in favour of cars or the hard-pressed Underground;
preserving the Travelcard system, which allows transfers between different
transport operators, would become much more complicated; withdrawal of
subsidies would push fares up; and, worst of all, traffic chaos could result
from hundreds of one-person-operated minibuses on the capital's busiest
routes.
It does not look like a vote-grabber. Far better, critics say, to keep the
routes regulated and speed up buses with bus lanes and other priority
measures. That, however, would mean clobbering car drivers.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
1913 was not only the year of the premieres in Paris of Debussy's Jeux and
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring - the orchestral twin peaks of modernism - but
also saw the first performance of Elgar's Falstaff, at the Leeds Festival.
Such a conjunction was too good for 'Towards the Millennium' to pass over,
and so on Tuesday, in the latest instalment of the celebration, Simon Rattle
and the City of Birmingham Symphony sandwiched Elgar's symphonic study
between the two masterpieces. Both Jeux and The Rite are very much Rattle
party pieces. He conducts the Debussy in particular with astonishing and
ever growing fluency, weaving its strands together into a web of fluctuating
tempos and changing textures with a naturalness and sense of shape that made
light of the work's difficulties.
By most standards too the Stravinsky was exemplary, vivid and immaculate,
without a moment of slackness, and with every detail etched into place. Yet
in the first part especially, it seemed curiously lightweight, fast and
slick rather than darkly menacing. Part 2 moved on a much more certain
trajectory; a single startling accelerando in the final Danse sacrale aside,
it had a relentless momentum and machine-like accuracy.
Alongside those two supreme pieces Falstaff necessarily seemed high on
rhetoric and thin on invention. Rattle's view of Elgar is in any case not
unduly sympathetic, tending to push forward when a little more indulgent
nobilmente would be appropriate, and making textures almost spikily
expressionist when a Brahmsian blend seems to be called for. Yet the
forwardness and vigour of the playing sometimes compensated for the lack of
real warmth. Played for all their expressive worth,the closing pages in
particularcan be as moving as anything in English music; here, though, they
just an elegant, dry-eyed pastiche.
With this Falstaff too, it must be reported that surtitles have arrived in
the concert hall. In what the CBSO described as an 'experiment", captions
outlining the narrative of Elgar's scheme were projected onto a screen. If
it catches on, the possibilities are endless. Strauss's symphonic poems
would be ripe for such treatment: those for the Sinfonia domestica,
unexpurgated of course, will be awaited with lubricious interest.

FT  27 MAR 92 / The Property Market: New towns show their age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England's new town movement, one of the most ambitious programmes of city
building ever undertaken, is about to take its place in history.
The Milton Keynes Development Corporation is due to hand over its assets to
the Commission for the New Towns, a government-appointed group overseeing
the winding up of all new town corporations, on March 31. It will be the
last of 21 English new town development corporations, set up at a cost of
Pounds 4bn since 1946, to be wound up.
Most new towns have a low key, even dreary, image that belies the enthusiasm
with which they were founded. The movement traces its roots back to the
Victorian idealist Ebenezer Howard.
His 'garden city' concept was embodied in Letchworth in 1903 and in Welwyn,
which became a new town in 1948. It was not however until the years
following the Second World War that the new town movement came into its own.
The desolation and congestion of bomb-scarred London inspired reformers such
as Lewis Silkin, formerly of the London County Council, and Lord Reith to
set up new towns in the countryside. The New Towns Act 1946 gave wide powers
to the newly-established development corporations to acquire land, create
infrastructure and build factories, shops, homes, civic buildings and
leisure facilities.
The first generation of new towns, such as Stevenage, Harlow and Crawley
were designed chiefly to accommodate the overspill from London. An exception
was Corby, which needed housing for workers attracted to its
rapidly-expanding steel industry.
The second generation of new towns, such as Redditch, Washington and
Telford, were designed primarily to revitalise depressed areas of the
country. Of the later towns, Milton Keynes, established in 1967, was a
planning exercise in a car-based society. The first generation of new towns
did not take account of the rising levels of car ownership, leaving the town
centres cluttered with multi-storey car parks. Milton Keynes is an
exception: typically, it takes 10 minutes for a resident to travel to work
in the town.
The verdict on the new towns is mixed. They have certainly provided vastly
improved environments for a large number of people. 'They are popular places
in which to live,' says Mr Adrian Webb, deputy director of the Town and
Country Planning Association, a charity which has promoted new towns.
However, new towns are also accused of lacking soul and community spirit,
and of possessing some uninspiring architecture. Many new towns have also
failed to attract sufficient industry, thereby forcing residents to commute
to nearby conurbations for work. (That said, levels of inward investment are
sometimes impressive: there are 43 Japanese companies in Milton Keynes.)
New towns have also been criticised for siphoning off the young and mobile.
That is only partly true: a study by the Greater London Council in the early
1980s revealed that in London only about 7 per cent of the population that
had moved elsewhere went to the new or expanded towns.
Financially, the new towns present a mixed picture. The first generation of
new towns, (Aycliffe, Basildon, Bracknell, Corby, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead,
Peterlee and Welwyn Garden City) were largely successful. Development
surpluses repaid the investment in infrastructure.
However, the second and third generation (Runcorn, Skelmersdale, Milton
Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough, and Warrington) suffered from less
favourable locations, high interest rates, a flagging economy and the less
buoyant property market of the 1970s. In many cases, they have had to run to
stand still.
These towns were also affected by a shift in government policy in 1977,
which resulted in more funds for the inner cities at the expense of new
towns. The effect of this shift was to curb the towns' growth, by upwards of
a third, resulting in an over-provision of infrastructure.
The election of the Conservative party in 1979 prompted a further shift in
policy. Public involvement and spending on the new towns was curbed and a
programme of privatisation of new town assets launched.
Initially, the privatisation proceeded slowly. In response, in 1982, Mr
Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary at the time, responded by
shaking up the Commission for New Towns, which was seen as a sleepy,
bureaucratic quango.
Sir Neil Shields, a Conservative businessman, was installed as chairman,
with a strong remit. Under his leadership, the commission drastically cut
its staff and increased takings from property sales. 'When I came in, the
rate of achievement of development corporations was way behind target,' he
says. After exceeding targets in the late 1980s and raising Pounds 2bn from
asset sales, the corporations' sales have now slowed down.
The commission faces a large task in the case of Milton Keynes. The town
corporation still possesses enough development land to build the equivalent
of another small town; its population of 150,000 is eventually expected to
reach 210,000. Indeed, the corporation fought hard for a reprieve, at least
for another three years, to complete the town's development. Although Sir
Neil was not totally unsympathetic to its case, he is confident of the
commission's ability to attract enough investment to complete the town's
development. 'We are not slouches at this,' he says.
It seems likely that whichever party ends up in power after the UK election
on April 9, the commission will continue to privatise new town assets.
The prospect of more new towns provokes vehement opposition from people who
see them as an autocratic piece of social engineering. Yet deteriorating
housing stock in many areas makes the case for such towns compelling.
According to the Town and Country Planning Association, 2.8m new dwellings
will be needed in Britain between now and 2011; about the total number of
dwellings in Greater London.
The Town and Country Planning Association has called for a revised new towns
programme. 'There is a strategic necessity for some new settlements' says
the association's Mr Webb.
During the past decade, the private sector has tried to gain a direct role
for itself in the development of new towns. In 1983, Consortium
Developments, backed by the property developers Wimpey, Barratt, Beazer,
Tarmac, Bovis, Laing, and McCartney and Stone, announced that it was looking
at sites for between 12 and 15 news towns to meet the demand for homes.
However, after repeatedly becoming bogged down in the planning process, the
project was abandoned.
Eagle Star has also submitted proposals for a new country town at
Micheldever in Hampshire as part of that county's structure plan. This has
been fiercely opposed by the county council and environmental groups. The
Prince of Wales has also lodged his own proposal for a new town at
Poundbury, near Dorchester.
Mr Heseltine has also hinted at another proposal for new towns as part of
the development along the East Thames Corridor.
If new towns are to be set up in relatively unpopular areas, there will be a
need for government intervention. A renewed new town movement, driven by the
public sector, may not be entirely a thing of the past.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Council spending uncut during Thatcher years, says
researcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTEEN YEARS after the election of the Thatcher government, local
authorities have survived unscathed with their spending largely uncut and
their workforces only marginally reduced, according to a study published
today.
Mr Tony Travers, a research director at the London School of Economics, says
council expenditure has risen as a proportion of all UK public expenditure
since 1979 - from 23.5 per cent to 23.8 per cent.
That is in spite of repeated attempts by the government to restrain the
spending of councils by the use of capping and other devices.
'Local spending has remained remarkably constant in the years since 1979,'
he says in today's Local Government Chronicle.
Since 1979, current spending has risen from Pounds 36bn to Pounds 49bn at
1990 prices, while capital spending has hovered between Pounds 8bn and
Pounds 11bn.
Local-authority manpower has fallen only from 2.4m to 2.3m since 1979, Mr
Travers says. Numbers fell in the early 1980s, but rose steadily from 1983
until 1988.
Since 1988, the workforce has fallen by at least 100,000, almost all through
compulsory competitive tendering of council services.
The Conservative manifesto for the election proposes the continuation of
such efforts.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, by contrast, are promising to end capping,
to give a significant boost to local-authority capital spending, and to give
councils a general power of competence to take on new responsi-bilities.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Assurance on defence review
</HEADLINE>

THE LABOUR PARTY yesterday told defence manufacturers that a Labour
government would not apply a freeze on contracts while it reassessed
military requirements.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's chief defence spokesman, also promised that the
present level of defence expenditure would be available through the 1992-93
financial year.
Subsequently, he added, there ought to be scope for savings.
He told the Royal United Services Institute that a Labour government would
set up a 'small group' to oversee the review, would consult widely and would
aim to present its conclusions to parliament in the autumn.
Arms suppliers have shown growing concern about a possible moratorium on new
contracts during a defence review. Such a move has been specifically
proposed by the Liberal Democrats in their call for a comprehensive review.
Mr O'Neill said that several contracts were near signing. He added: 'I don't
think we would see a freeze till October.' However, some 'sensitive'
purchases might have to await the outcome of the review.

THE WEST YORKSHIRE Superannuation Fund and County NatWest Ventures yesterday
launched a venture capital fund, Yorkshire Investors, which will have Pounds
30m available for investments, Charles Batchelor writes.
West Yorkshire is one of the largest local-authority pension funds in the
UK. It will be the sole investor in Yorkshire Investors with Pounds 15m
committed, but County NatWest, which will select the investments, will
co-invest on equal terms in each deal, taking the total funds available to
Pounds 30m.
West Yorkshire has assets of Pounds 1.9bn, but it has very little money
invested in venture capital. This is the first time County NatWest has
managed funds for an outside organisation. Local-authority pension funds
have increased investments by 51 per cent to Pounds 271m over the past two
years.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Jersey rejects demand for top judge to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DELEGATION from Jersey will visit London next Thursday to try to reverse a
ruling demanding the resignation of one of the island's senior judges.
Representatives of the States, the island's parliament, hope a compromise
can be found, but they warned yesterday that they might be forced to
petition the Queen directly over the issue.
Mr Vernon Tomes, Jersey's deputy bailiff, was asked to resign after a
meeting at the Home Office in London last week.
That followed complaints from island advocates that over the past few years
he had taken too long to deliver reserved judgments,
The island is a Crown dependency and a privy councillor, usually the home
secretary, has special responsibility for it.
The island's lieutenant governor, its attorney-general and the judiciary are
Crown appointments while other appointments are made locally. Mr Pierre
Horsfall, president of the island administration's finance committee, said:
'I am very hopeful that when they hear what we have to say we will be able
to persuade them to change their minds. Should this fail, it is possible we
could petition the Queen.'
Other politicians have voiced irritation at what they see as an example of
outside interference in the independence of Jersey.
Mr Tomes claims that delays in issuing judgments have been caused by an
overload of work. Mr Horsfall said that once the demand for Mr Tomes'
resignation had been removed, 'the question of the workload could be
resolved internally by the island's elected government'.
The local judicial committee recommended three months as a suitable length
of time to produce a judgment.
Mr Tomes, who acts as deputy speaker of the Jersey parliament, has sometimes
taken much longer than that.
In one judgment, Mr Tomes took more than two years.
That was in the Rahman case, a complex case in which the validity of a
Jersey-based trust was challenged by the family of Mr Rahman, the trust's
settlor (a person who makes settlements, especially of property).
Mr Tomes found the trust not to be a true trust, and the island amended its
trust law.
Hopes that next Thursday's meeting in London will lead to an internal island
resolution of the issue are echoed by Mr Reg Jeune, president of the
administration's policies and resources committee.
'We have had many centuries of working well together and our relations with
London have always been good', he said.
Mr Jeune said there was no constitutional crisis because by seeking the
deputy bailiff's resignation the Crown has not challenged the island's
independence. The Crown makes the appointment and can withdraw it.
However, he and other members of the States hope they can offer the privy
councillors an acceptable resolution of the problem that does not involve Mr
Tomes' resignation.

FT  27 MAR 92 / ICL leads in computer services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has an 80
per cent stake, has emerged as the largest supplier of computing services in
Britain.
It now leads the market after a decade-long shakeout which has seen UK-owned
companies routed in an industrial sector they once dominated.
ICL's annual UK revenues from services, estimated at nearly Pounds 250m, are
bigger than those of US competitors, including Electronic Data Systems and
International Business Machines. BT Customer Services, a newcomer to the
computer manufacturing sector with annual sales of Pounds 200m, represents
the only serious UK challenge.
In the 1980s, seven of the top 10 suppliers to the market were UK-owned, led
by Thorn EMI Software and Hoskyns. Today, apart from BT Customer Systems,
only two British companies remain in the list: Logica and Data Sciences.
Those two companies are vulnerable to takeover, Mr Richard Holway, a leading
industry analyst, said yesterday. He said he expected the large computer
manufacturers and telecommunications suppliers, including AT&amp;T of the US and
BT, to step up plans to acquire leading computing services companies to
compensate for falling hardware prices.
Mr Holway was speaking at the annual conference of the Computing Services
Association, the trade organisation for companies specialising in computer
software, data communications and facilities management and other data
services.
He said that computing services companies were not, on the whole, affected
by the recession last year. Average revenues had risen by 4 per cent, about
the rate of inflation. Nevertheless, profits had declined for the second
year running.
'I would expect profits to stop falling in 1992 and to show quite high
growth from the second half of 1992 onwards as the effects of cost
restructuring flow through to the bottom line,' he said.
Mr Holway attributed much of the industry's difficulty to the spate of
'ill-advised and badly executed' acquisitions in 1988 and 1989. 'Our problem
is that we have precious few managers who had any experience of acquisitions
prior to 1988,' he said.

TWO stockbrokers, Mr Patrick Mahon, chairman of TC Coombs, and Mr Andrew
Kent, the firm's corporate development manager, were sent for trial at the
Old Bailey by City of London magistrates yesterday.
They face two charges of conspiring to defraud The Securities Association,
its authorisation tribunal and its appeal tribunal.
The first alleges that they made false representations about the
circumstances of a purchase by Rahn and Bodmer Banquiers of more than 3m
shares in Coastline Resources; the second, that they dishonestly concealed
the source of Pounds 1.7m capital lent to Coombs, and falsely represented
that the firm's capital had been increased by Pounds 2m as a result of a
loan from International Pacific Securities.
Both offences are alleged to have been committed to obtain and maintain the
authorisation of Coombs to carry on investment business. Bail was reduced
for both men, who were arrested in February last year, from Pounds 500,000
to Pounds 250,000 each.

NORWEGIAN businessman Mr Tore Arne Thorsen appeared in Teesside magistrates'
court, Middlesbrough, yesterday for a further hearing into corporation tax
fraud charges relating to Nissan UK, the former importer of Japanese cars to
the UK controlled by Mr Octav Botnar.
Mr Thorsen, manager of Scansiris, a Norwegian freight company, is accused of
fraudulently inflating invoices when shipping cars from Japan to Nissan UK.
The Inland Revenue says that resulted in the company's profits being
understated by Pounds 100m over 10 years.
Yesterday's hearing was adjourned until June 18. Mr Thorsen, who is on bail,
entered no plea, but his solicitor says Mr Thorsen will deny all the
charges.
Mr Botnar himself, for whom an arrest warrant was issued in January, has yet
to return to the UK. Mr Botnar, 79, has been in Switzerland since before
Christmas.
Mr Michael Hunt, Nissan UK's assistant managing director, and Mr Frank
Shannon, a former finance director of Nissan UK, have appeared at
preliminary hearings into alleged corporation tax fraud.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Law Lords uphold TV franchise decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION South West lost its broadcast licence in last October's
independent television franchise auction because its revenue projections and
proposed cost structure left little room to manoeuvre if trading proved
worse than expected, the Law Lords ruled yesterday.
They said that the Independent Television Commission was entitled to
conclude that TSW would be unable to maintain a quality service over 10
years. It had done so after considering TSW's application and in particular
its forecasts of revenue, costs and profitability, and the size of its bid.
Having concluded that TSW's revenue projections were 'extremely optimistic',
the commission was bound to reject TSW's application, the Law Lords said.
They were giving their reasons for rejecting TSW's application for judicial
review of the commission's decision to award the licence for south-west
England to Westcountry Television, which bid Pounds 7.8m against TSW's
Pounds 16.1m.
TSW argued that the decision was based on an assessment of its bid that
failed to present a fair or accurate picture of its application.
That argument was fatally flawed, Lord Goff said, because it confused the
function of the commission with that of staff employed to advise it.
TSW's attack on the assessment paper was an attack not on the commission's
procedure but simply an attack on the contents of one paper prepared by
staff for the commission to consider.
Lord Goff said TSW's complaint was therefore misconceived because it failed
to focus on the relevant decision, which was that of the commission.
There was no scope for the courts to interfere with the commission's
decision in view of evidence from the commission itself.

FT  27 MAR 92 / No pledge on Tube extension
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday declined an opportunity to promise that it would find the
money to ensure that the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line Underground extension to
London's Docklands opened on time if Olympia &amp; York, the project's main
private backer, could not provide its share of the finance.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said it was 'unwise off the
cuff to promise a very substantial sum of further public expenditure' in the
current 'very difficult economic straits'.
His remarks followed the Department of Transport's admission earlier this
week that ministers would have to reconsider the future of the extension if
the financially troubled property developer was unable to meet its Pounds
400m commitment.
The extension, once regarded as a pioneering transport project, would create
five Underground stations in south and east London and would service
Docklands.
Turning his attention to Europe's biggest new office complex - Canary Wharf
 -which was developed by O&amp;Y, Mr Gould said it was 'somehow fitting' that in
a general election campaign dominated by the recession, the economic
conditions should 'at last be threatening even that Tory flagship'.
If the 'Tory property developers' could not make a success of Docklands
throughout the long 1980s boom, 'we must conclude there was something wrong
with the model,' he said.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, said that when O&amp;Y
became involved in the project, they were 'widely regarded as financially
impregnable', yet even they had been 'shaken to their foundations' by the
recession. Labour took 'no pleasure at all from the knowledge there may be
financial difficulties threatening these projects', he said.
Some cross-Channel ferry services are likely to be seriously disrupted this
weekend because of a strike by French seamen.
The action, scheduled for today, tomorrow and Sunday, will affect Sealink's
Dover-Calais services, which are being cut to operate only at peak times.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Allied to close John Bull brewery at Romford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the third largest UK brewer, is to close its brewery at
Romford, Essex, by next February with the loss of 300 jobs.
The closure at Romford, the home of John Bull bitter, is the latest in a
series of brewery closures since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report in 1989 which prompted the government to try to encourage more
competition in the industry.
Bass has announced the closure of four breweries within the past year.
Others have been closed by Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley and Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
The brewers Boddington and Greenalls have left the industry.
Allied's decision to close the Romford brewery follows a review of the
group's production resources and its position in the beer market.
Mr Tony Trigg, managing director of Allied Breweries, said the move would
significantly reduce production costs and improve cost-effectiveness. He
said the market was increasingly competitive but depressed, and that beer
sales had fallen 4 per cent last year.
'Already there is too much capacity chasing reducing volumes,' Mr Trigg
said. 'We expect competition to increase further. It is important that
overall production and efficiencies are improved.'
The Romford brewery, which became part of the Allied group in 1961, employs
550 people and brews Skol, Castlemaine, and Lowenbrau lagers. It has been
operating well below its capacity of 1m barrels a year.
A phased closure of the plant will begin in September. Brewing of the brands
will be transferred to three of Allied's five remaining breweries at Burton
upon Trent, Leeds and Wrexham, Clwyd.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Lloyd's holds talks to improve image today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to hold the first of a series of 'market leaders'
forums' today in an effort to improve communication between Mr David
Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, and the underwriters, agents and brokers who
do business at the insurance market.
Mr Coleridge organised the forums - known widely in Lloyd's as 'help tanks'
 -after recent adverse publicity. He said this month in a letter to more
than 60 executives that a 'frank and open exchange of views' would be
helpful.
Lloyd's said yesterday that the forums, which will take place each month,
will not supplant the work of existing market committees. Initial
discussions are likely to focus on public relations.
'This has to be good,' said Mr Robert Hiscox, a leading agent. 'The twelfth
floor (the floor at the Lloyd's building in London on which Mr Coleridge and
Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, have their offices) tends to get detached
from the realities of the market.'
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association,
said the meetings were 'a step in the right direction'.
Lloyd's is expecting to post losses of more than Pounds 1.3bn when it
reports its 1989 results in June, with the losses falling disproportionately
on a minority of outside Names - the individuals whose assets back the
insurance market.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Man accused of insider dealing is sent for trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST person to be prosecuted in Scotland for insider dealing since 1981
has been sent for trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr Thorold Mackie, an investment analyst, was committed for trial from
Edinburgh sheriff court, charged with an offence under the 1985 Company
Securities (Insider Dealing) Act.
The charge alleges that while employed by Bell Lawrie White, an Edinburgh
stock-broker, he was in possession of unpublished price-sensitive
information about the imminent issue of a profits warning from Shanks &amp;
McEwan, the waste management group, and 'counselled or procured' two Bell
Lawrie White salesmen to deal in the shares.
The previous case of insider dealing in Scotland was also the first in the
UK. In 1981, Mr John Bryce, a former partner in an Edinburgh firm of
investment managers, pleaded guilty. He was given an absolute discharge
after depositing Pounds 1,400 compensation.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Maxwell wine sale realises Pounds 93,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUCTION of Robert Maxwell's private wine collection yesterday raised
more than Pounds 93,000 towards the debts accumulated by the media magnate.
Bidders paid on average 20 per cent above the market average for bottles
including an Imperiale 1982 Chateau Figeac which went for Pounds 650.
Curiosity value in the Maxwell cellar, which boasted 3,000 bottles and 772
magnums, pushed prices beyond trade values, and most successful bidders at
the Christie's sale said the wine was for display rather than drinking. Some
customers were even heard asking auction staff about display cabinets
immediately after the sale.
The sale attracted bids from Japan, Israel and the US. Even the 40 lots of
lacklustre burgundy from a single obscure supplier (Albert Ponelle) were not
spurned.
Most of the wines, however, were famous-name 1982 clarets that had been
acquired by Maxwell at a Sotheby's sale in 1985. It followed the disposal of
his previous, more mature but less glamorous collection, on the advice of Mr
David Molyneux-Berry, former head of Sotheby's wine department.
At a sale in 1985, Maxwell bid personally and vigorously, pushing the price
of a dozen bottles of Chateau Latour 1982, for example, to Pounds 800.
Yesterday that same wine sold for exactly Pounds 800.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Accident 'black box' for ships launched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN accident 'black box' for ships was launched yesterday, but its
manufacturers fear that it may be some time before it is adopted worldwide.
The voyage event recorder provides a record of the last 24 hours of a
vessel's journey and should help marine investigators looking at the cause
of shipping accidents.
The device has already been installed by P&amp;O in 10 of its ships and is said
to be more sophisticated than its equivalent in aircraft, the flight data
recorder.
The International Maritime Organisation, Department of Transport and Marine
Accidents Investigation Branch have been kept in touch with the development
of the device by Broadgate Ltd of Almondsbury, Avon. But Mr Chris Winkley,
managing director of Broadgate, said yesterday: 'I can't see the IMO making
the VER mandatory on all ships at the moment.'
Investigators of marine accidents at present have to depend on verbal
accounts of events leading to a shipping accident.
The new device has a tape which can play back the last 24 hours of a ship's
journey using voice recordings and radar screens, on which the vessel's
exact position can be plotted.
The device is housed in a 19-inch rack cabinet which incorporates all its
control electronics and system monitoring devices. It contains an
eight-track VHS recorder from Racal Recorders.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Companies are criticised over accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY companies are failing to comply with accounting standards, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales alleged yesterday.
It said more than a third of companies whose annual reports suggested that
they had incurred expenditure on research and development did not give the
relevant figures even though accounting standards say they should be
disclosed. Disclosure levels by many companies and the quality of
information given leave much to be desired, the institute said after
publishing its 23rd annual survey of financial information.
It added that accounting standards had proved less effective than
legislation in persuading companies to comply with professional requirements
on financial reporting. The survey covered the accounts of 300 companies
with reporting years ending in June last year.
Eight per cent of the companies did not provide data on pension costs as
required by an accounting standard, the institute reported.
Since the passage of the 1989 Companies Act, which echoes EC legislation and
includes provisions to increase the number of subsidiaries consolidated into
group accounts, only 5 per cent of all companies and 1 per cent of large
listed companies still exclude subsidiaries from consolidation.
The institute found that the number of large companies disclosing detailed
pension information had fallen.
Only 68 per cent of large companies published the actuarial assumptions on
the rate of return on investments, and 65 per cent the rate of increase of
future salaries, compared with 92 per cent and 89 per cent respectively in
the previous year.
The analysis raises questions about the policy of using accounting standards
drafted and implemented by the accountancy profession to govern financial
reporting.
Mr David Tonkin, one of the authors of the survey, said the current standard
of financial reporting deserved 'eight out of 10 - must try harder.'
The institute said reporting on environmental matters remained principally a
'public relations exercise'. It urged companies to show greater willingness
to submit their environmental practices to external scrutiny and to devise
better ways of assessing the effects of company activity on the environment.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Price-cut battle for Pru audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR leading accountancy firms offered big reductions from the existing fee
in attempts to win the contract to audit the Prudential, the UK's biggest
insurer, last year.
The information provides further evidence of the widespread incidence of
'low-balling', in which firms offer big reductions in their fees to win
business.
Mr Michael Lawrence, Prudential's finance director, disclosed that the
company's audit bill would be almost unchanged at nearly Pounds 2.5m for
last year, but is likely to show 'a significant reduction' this year.
The details follow months of speculation about the fees charged after a
leaked letter from Price Waterhouse, which won the audit contract, appeared
to show it offering a Pounds 900,000 discount on its originally quoted fee
of Pounds 2.3m.
That led to accusations that accountancy firms had either been making
abnormal profits in the past or were beginning to offer audit contracts as
loss-leaders during the recession.
Mr Lawrence said there had been 'a lot of hype' over the PW fees. He said
'you would need a microscope' to see the difference between the PW quote and
that of the Prudential's previous auditor, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, which
had just merged with Coopers &amp; Lybrand at the time of the tender. KPMG Peat
Marwick and Ernst &amp; Young also offered similar fees for the audit.
Mr Lawrence said PW had done 'an extremely good job' and suggested that the
reductions were made possible by 'a more surgical, strategic approach' to
the audit, which saved time and cost. The fee reduction shown in the PW
letter included non-audit work such as completion of forms for government
regulators.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Conservatives focus on plan to frighten
waverers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THREE-pronged attack on Labour's tax policy, economic competence and Mr
Neil Kinnock's leadership has been put at the heart of the Conservatives'
election strategy.
Senior ministers said yesterday that Tory hopes of reversing Labour's poll
lead rested almost entirely on a plan to 'frighten' waverers in the
campaign's final two weeks.
Mr Chris Patten, party chairman, has all but abandoned his efforts to
project Mr John Major's policy prospectus for the 1990s in favour of what
one senior minister yesterday called: 'a straightforward Thatcherite
campaign to demonstrate that they (Labour) are still socialists.'
The approach reflects an acknowledgement that the Conservative campaign has
been overshadowed by superior Labour tactics. Some ministers believe that if
this weekend's polls do not show a narrower gap there will be intense
pressure on Mr Patten to toughen the assault further.
The ferocious attack on Mr Kinnock during this week's health row was
designed to put in place the final element in his plan. By yesterday,
however, the focus on Mr Kinnock's fitness for office had been obscured by
the row over Labour's election broadcast.
The ministers said they were confident that the Conservatives could overturn
a two-point Labour poll lead by stepping up their onslaught on Mr Kinnock
and his party during the last phase of the campaign.
At the heart of that strategy - directed principally at winning back the
votes of the skilled working classes - would be an advertising blitz saying
Labour would put up the tax of every wage-earner by Pounds 1,250.
That will be combined with a relentless effort to convince voters that a
Labour government would wreck hopes of economic recovery.
The third strand - an attack on Mr Kinnock's leadership and his fitness to
hold high office - is designed to capitalise on what the Tories insist is
widespread mistrust of him among 'floating voters'.
Mr Patten appears confident that the 39 per cent base for his party's
support in recent opinion polls is solid. His strategy now will therefore be
focused almost entirely on three groups among the electorate.
Disgruntled Conservatives who have switched to the Liberal Democrats will be
told that a vote for Mr Paddy Ashdown's party would allow Mr Kinnock into
Downing Street. The same message will be conveyed to former party supporters
who have indicated that they may not vote on April 9.
Finally, the campaign will aim to attract a slice of the working-class
voters who have been convinced by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, that
their incomes would be unaffected by a Labour victory.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems aim to fend off the squeeze factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORST fear of Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has so far
failed to materialise - the fierce battle between two far larger parties has
not squeezed him into the margins. Since the start of the campaign, Liberal
Democrat support has held at about 16 per cent, according to the FT's poll
of polls.
Resources and tactics are better focused than in the 1987 Alliance parties'
campaign. Mr Ashdown's election itinerary consists almost exclusively of
winnable seats. A campaign to counter charges that a Liberal Democrat vote
is 'wasted' will begin next week.
Party strategists said yesterday that the swing against the Tories would see
Liberal Democrat win seats such as Bath and Cheltenham, which in 1983 and
1987 were tantalisingly close.
In 1987, Alliance candidates came second in 259 seats - mostly to the
Tories. 'You only need a slight slip from last time for them (the
Conservatives) to lose quite a number of seats, many of which are vulnerable
to us,' said Mr Alec McGivan, deputy campaign director.
He added: '16 per cent in national polls is not actually that relevant to
our chances.'
It is too early, however, to rule out a crumbling in the traditionally soft
Liberal Democrat vote, with the knock-on effects in target constituencies.
Realistically, the party knows only a handful of seats are more than
'possible wins'. Seats the party holds, such as Rochdale and Southwark and
Bermondsey may be lost to Labour.
At the same time Mr Ashdown is, by conventional analysis, trying to defy
political gravity with his radical campaigning themes.
A penny on income tax, higher petrol tax and the phasing-out of mortgage
interest tax relief is not an obvious recipe for wooing disgruntled Tories.
Mr Ashdown is trying to convey the impression that Liberal Democrats are
distinct from Labour - not a modest alternative, but a different species. He
has stuck doggedly to his agenda at the cost of lost publicity. Yesterday he
tried to talk about the environment when the headlines were dominated by
health.
If Labour extends its poll lead, wavering Tories may be frightened back to
the fold by the threat of a Labour government or the implications of a
Liberal Democrat influence in a hung parliament.
Such arguments are not current at the party's Cowley Street headquarters. Mr
Des Wilson, campaign director, believes the lesson of 1987 is that national
and local campaigns must gel. Local activists were angered then by a
disorganised national campaign which portrayed the Alliance as the middle
ground between Labour and the Tories. Ironically, the only constituency in
England that the party won was Southport, which was almost ignored at
national level.
This time the party's manifesto, with its jumble of ideas, allows Mr Ashdown
to alter emphasis by region - tougher environmental protection in some,
improvements in the health service or job creation in others. He sees his
measures as populist - particularly the penny on income tax for education.
The radical mix also goes down well in many of the seats the party is
defending.
In spite of the scepticism of opponents, it is a strategy that has so far
stopped past Liberal Democrat supporters from drifting away. The party still
hopes it will do rather more.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Centre party seeks gains at the periphery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political map of Great Britain presents a paradox as it stretches
through England's west country.
This is a bastion of Liberal Democrat strength, part of Britain's rural
Celtic periphery, where associations with Liberalism are rooted in long
traditions of independence and religious nonconformism.
Yet throughout the south-west, from Bristol to Land's End, the
constituencies are a sea of Conservative blue.
Of the 41 seats in south-west England, just two are held by Liberal
Democrats. Yeovil in Somerset is held by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader,
and Truro in Cornwall is held by Mr Matthew Taylor.
Only two other constituencies stand out from the Tory blue. Plymouth
Devonport is the seat of former SDP leader Dr David Owen, who is standing
down; and Ms Dawn Primarolo holds Labour's solitary south-western seat in
Bristol South.
It is the paradox between Liberal Democrat support and Conservative
representation that makes the south-west a crucial battleground for the
Liberal Democrats. Here, more than anywhere, they are seeking to assert
themselves at the Tories' expense.
One obstacle is that their underlying strength is greatest in rural areas -
in the towns and cities, the vote tends to polarise between Conservative and
Labour; so in Bristol, where three of the Conservatives' four seats are
vulnerable, Labour stands to gain.
Similarly, Plymouth is more likely to bring a loss to the centre ground than
any gains. Devonport will almost certainly revert to Labour after Dr Owen's
decision to stand down, and the centre vote in the other two Plymouth seats
 -Drake and Sutton, both Tory-held  - will probably fall without the Owen
factor.
In rural areas, however, the Liberal Democrats are the Conservatives' main
rivals. Insofar as Labour has a presence, it has in many areas been squeezed
to near-insignificance by tactical voting: so it is the Liberal Democrats
who stand to cash in on the anti-Tory vote.
Even so, the gap between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats is sometimes
so vast that there is little hope of bridging it in a single election.
Victory in Devizes, for example, would require a swing of more than 13 per
cent from Conservatives to Liberal Democrats; in Honiton, more than 14 per
cent.
It is in Devon and Cornwall, counties associated with Liberal figures of the
past such as Mr Jeremy Thorpe and the late Mr David Penhaligon, that
traditions of independence are strongest.
Cornwall North and Devon North were both Liberal until 1979 - the former
held by John Pardoe, the latter by Jeremy Thorpe - and in both, the Liberal
Democrats have gradually rebuilt their strength. They now need a 4.1 per
cent swing in Devon North, and 4.9 per cent in Cornwall North.
A third possible victory is the Cornish seat of Falmouth and Camborne, where
recession has hit the industrial areas of Redruth and Camborne. The popular
Conservative incumbent, Mr David Mudd, is stepping down, to be replaced as
Tory candidate by Olympic gold medallist Mr Sebastian Coe - an 'outsider'
whose selection has cut little ice with the locals. The Liberal Democrats
would capture the seat with a swing of just 4.7 per cent - but this is one
seat where Labour might split the vote.
Exeter in Devon is a Tory marginal, but here, too, Labour might divide the
opposition vote. St Ives, Cornwall South-east and Torbay are on the Liberal
Democrat hit list, but they are long shots; in Bath, they will struggle to
oust Conservative party chairman Mr Chris Patten.
A gain of three or four south-western seats would be no small victory for
the Liberal Democrats - not least since that is probably as many seats as
they can hope to gain from the whole of the rest of the country.
