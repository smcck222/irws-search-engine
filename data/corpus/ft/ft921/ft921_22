MR YITZHAK RABIN last night toppled Mr Shimon Peres in a contest for the
leadership of Israel's opposition Labour party. He was set to head Labour's
challenge to the ruling Likud party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the
June 23 general election.
Labour party officials said unofficial results showed Mr Rabin had won 40.6
per cent of the votes cast in a ballot of party membership, just beating the
40 per cent barrier needed for outright victory in the first round. Mr Peres
won 34.5 per cent.
Final confirmation of the result will not be announced until later today,
but there appeared little doubt Mr Rabin had won.
Mr Rabin is a former prime minister who lost the party leadership to Mr
Peres in 1977.
Mr Peres said last night he accepted the party's decision and congratulated
his longtime rival, who has consistently been shown by opinion polls to be
capable of turning around Labour's dismal record in recent elections.
In a tense evening at Labour headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr Mr Rabin several
times saw his support tip over the 40 per cent barrier that he had to pass
to avoid a run-off election against Mr Peres on February 26. Several times
it slipped back again, before firming up.
Two other candidates, Mr Israel Kessar, leader of the Histadrut trade union
federation, and Mrs Ora Namir, a veteran MP, trailed well behind, with 19
per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively.
Opinion polls have consistently shown that under Mr Rabin, Labour would have
a much greater chance of closing the gap of some five points by which it
trails the ruling Likud party of Prime Minister Shamir.
Mr Shamir himself faces a challenge to his leadership of the ruling Likud
party tonight from Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, and Mr Ariel Sharon,
the housing minister.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Bundeswehr set for radical reduction
</HEADLINE>

THE German government yesterday gave the go-ahead for a radical
restructuring of its armed forces, cutting overall numbers from 495,000 to
370,000, restricting the call-up, and creating a new rapid reaction force.
At the same time the government agreed that it was 'politically necessary'
to amend the constitution with a 'clarification' to enable the armed forces
to serve outside the Nato area in future.
The new deal for the Bundeswehr was presented yesterday to the cabinet by Mr
Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defence minister, as the transformation of the
existing armed forces into a 'training and mobilisation army'.
The plan centres on the creation of a rapid reaction force at the heart of
the Bundeswehr, involving seven brigades kept on a high state of readiness.
In the army itself, the number of divisions will be reduced 48 existing
brigades will be disbanded. The air force's Alpha Jet fighter bomber will be
taken out of service, while the navy will be reduced from 180 to 90
'seaborne units'. In the civilian ranks of the defence ministry, 46,000 jobs
will be done away with. Overall, the restructuring is intended to produce
savings of DM43.7bn (Pounds 15.1bn) between now and 2004, Mr Stoltenberg
told parliament.
What the restructuring plan does not decide is the future of the European
Fighter Aircraft (EFA) which is being developed jointly with Britain, Italy
and Spain.
The DM12bn earmarked for the aircraft remains in the medium-term defence
budget.
A decision will only be taken on the project later this year.
Middle-ranking officers from all the Western European Union member states
attended a working seminar in Bonn yesterday at which Germany and France
spelt out their plans to create a new 'European defence corps'.
As yet, however, the idea remains a purely Franco-German initiative aimed at
the future expansion of the present Franco-German brigade into the nucleus
of a future European force.

FT  20 FEB 92 / EC report criticises drug prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG MANUFACTURERS in the UK, Holland and Germany are restricting
crossborder trade to maintain profits in high drug price countries, a report
prepared for the European Commission says.
Drug companies keep sales to a minimum when supplying wholesalers in low
drug price countries such as Belgium, Spain and Greece.
Parallel imports from these countries into the UK, Netherlands and Germany
account for up to 10 per cent of prescriptions, but could be higher if trade
were free.
The report says that companies' grip on supplies is either 'significant' or
'very significant' in holding back parallel imports. This could concern the
European Commission as running counter to Treaty of Rome free trade
policies.
Companies are justified in doing this because price differences are set by
governments rather than the market, according to Remit Consultants of
London, UK.
It identifies other restrictions on parallel imports including changing the
name of a drug between different countries. This tactic is common in
Germany, where prices are the highest in Europe.

FT  20 FEB 92 / British MPs express gloomy view on east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE failure of democratic politics to deliver improved living standards in
eastern Europe could lead to the re-emergence of autocratic regimes, the
foreign affairs committee of the Britain's House of Commons said yesterday.
In a gloomy report on the outlook for the former communist bloc, the
committee described as 'too sanguine' the views expressed by Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary. He told the committee that recent experience of
totalitarian rule in these countries has 'for the time being inoculated them
against' the authoritarian temptation.
The report urged the UK and its EC partners to take every kind of supportive
measure to strengthen economic and political reforms but underlined that
'help is likely to be a difficult and extremely expensive task'.
Should democracy fail, however, 'the emergence of authoritarian nationalist,
demagogic regimes on the borders of the planned European Union would raise a
host of problems and threaten its planned common foreign and security
policy.' On security questions the report called for 'the gradual evolution
of a single, coherent system to ensure European security'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Brussels seeks to target road haulage industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karel van Miert, the European Community's transport commissioner,
yesterday came out strongly in favour of making road transport companies pay
the full cost of the damage they do to the environment
His appeal came as the European Commission published a green paper which
called for environmental factors to be taken into account when setting
transportation policy. The paper noted that over the next 20 years, the
growth in road haulage would be 42 per cent, rail cargo 33 per cent, air
passenger traffic 74 per cent, while the number of cars would increase by 45
per cent.
It was particularly essential, Mr Van Miert said, for road hauliers to bear
the full costs of the damage they did to the environment. He called for
action to bring vehicle taxes into line across the Community to prevent
distortions in competition.
Increased taxes would provide more incentive to use other forms of transport
such as the railways, inland waterways and the sea, he added.
In another move to make EC transport more environmentally friedly, the
Commission yesterday proposed that governments should cut excise duty on
biofuels, made from agricultural products, to one tenth of that on regular
petrol and diesel. Such a move would provide alternative uses for Community
farm surpluses and reduce pollution.
The Commission claimed that with such a tax incentive biofuels could become
a commercial proposition, accounting for perhaps 5 per cent of overall
petrol consumption in the long term.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner responsible for tax matters,
said recent technical advances had brought down the cost of making biofuels.
For instance, the wholesale price of 'diester', a fuel derived from
vegetable oil, was now about Ecu300 (Pounds 212.70) per 1,000 litres, not
very far above that of diesel, which was around Ecu200 per 1,000 litres.
The Commission yesterday put on hold controversial proposals that would
require environmental vetting to be built into planning procedures across
the EC far earlier than is now the case, Reuters reports from Brussels.
Commission sources said that Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment
commissioner, failed to win backing from a majority of his colleagues in the
17-member EC executive for issuing such a proposal in the near future.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a strike in the German banking sector loomed closer yesterday
after negotiations between employers and the two leading bank trade unions
collapsed.
The unions walked out of the talks saying there was no point in further
negotiations because the employers refused to improve their offer above 5
per cent. Both the HBV (commerce, banking and insurance) union and the DAG
white-collar workers' union are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per cent and
shorter hours.
The employers' organisation immediately responded by declaring their 5 per
cent offer in effect from February 1, regardless of any new wage settlement.
They accused the unions of insisting on a settlement of at least 6 per cent
'against all the demands of economic reason'.
Warning strikes have already been held in banks in several areas and both
unions are now committed to holding a strike ballot.
It is the second time in a month that German industrial relations have been
brought to the brink of open conflict, after a steel strike was narrowly
averted two weeks ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION in Hungary - and throughout eastern Europe - cut the country's
industrial output by more than a fifth last year as big, inefficient
enterprises suffered in the difficult switch to market economics, according
to official data released yesterday, Reuter reports from Budapest. The
Central Statistical Office found that enterprises with more than 50 workers
produced 21.5 per cent less last year than in 1990, when output dropped 8.5
per cent.
The sharp decline reflects the collapse of the communist trading bloc,
Comecon, which once absorbed the bulk of Hungary's exports, and falling
domestic demand. Many small companies have sprung up in the past year but
their output has barely dented the overall slump that has pushed
unemployment above 8.5 per cent. But exports were worth more than Dollars
10bn last year and the government says they could grow another 8-10 per cent
this year as links with developed countries improve.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Judges thrust into battle to defend Maastricht line: How the
EEA treaty may test the Luxembourg court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was a case of 'once bitten, twice shy', when Brussels yesterday decided
to ask the EC's supreme court's opinion before daring to sign the European
Economic Area (EEA) treaty which it re-negotiated last week with the
European Free Trade Association (Efta).
This may further delay the far-reaching EEA treaty, creating a 19-nation
common economic zone. But the European Commission was clear that it did not
want to risk a repeat of last December, when the European Court of Justice
suddenly stymied 18 months of negotiation by objecting to the EEA treaty's
judicial provisions, in particular a court with EC and Efta judges. The
latest treaty version replaces the mixed court with a less ambitious
arrangement.
Referral of the draft treaty to the Court is a mark of its growing
importance. This is further enhanced by the Maastricht treaty which not only
allows it to fine recalcitrant governments for not complying with EC
directives and its own edicts, but also seems certain to draw it into the
highly political business of ruling on disputes over the treaty clause on
'subsidiarity' - the division of powers between EC institutions and the
Twelve.
But the 13 judges who make up the Court seem uncomfortable at being thrust
increasingly into the political limelight. In a rare interview, Sir Gordon
Slynn, who retires from the Court next month to join the House of Lords law
lords, recently insisted on the Court's 'judicial, rather than political
role' in ensuring the EC treaties are enforced properly.
The Court, Sir Gordon believes, will not, or should not, get involved in
essentially political disputes between member states and Brussels, in the
way that the US Supreme Court settles states' rights issues. He finesses the
problems of disputes over the subsidiarity clause by saying 'we probably
would not decide on whether something is better done by member states (as
opposed to the EC), but whether there was material to show that something
was capable of being better done'.
In other words, the Luxembourg benchers will, or should, avoid making the
highly political value judgements which are for governments to decide. But
the court proved itself bold last November, when in its ruling on the
Francovich case it said that EC citizens could sue their governments for
damages arising out of a government's failure to implement an EC directive.
This ruling, which could give enormous backing to Brussels' efforts to chase
up laggard governments, 'flows logically from earlier principles laid down
by the Court', says Sir Gordon. 'But the Francovich case will have to be
worked out in great detail over the years,' he cautions.
He noted that this potentially revolutionary ruling said little or nothing
about the amounts of damages, the link between an unimplemented EC directive
and actual damage suffered by an individual, or whether a member state might
argue justification in not putting an EC law into effect.
Part of the Court's function is to give timely guidance to national supreme
courts, like the Cour de Cassation in France or the UK's House of Lords, on
points of EC law. It is a job on which it has often fallen down.
A decade ago, the Court took six months to issue such 'preliminary rulings';
now it often takes 18 months. Sir Gordon welcomes the fact that the
Maastricht treaty allows more run-of-the-mill cases, such as state aid and
dumping disputes, to go to the lower Court of First Instance.
He is also thankful to be leaving Luxembourg before having to deal with the
legal tangles certain to be thrown up by the Maastricht protocol isolating
the UK on social policy. But it now seems he may not have so lucky an escape
on the EEA issue.

<TEXT>
IRELAND'S new prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, faces growing pressure to
hold a referendum on the 'right-to-life' amendment in the constitution
invoked this week by the High Court to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim
from having an abortion in the UK.
Acutely embarrassed by the controversy, he yesterday sought all-party
support to review Ireland's strict anti-abortion legislation, but appeared
to be finding it difficult to reach consensus even within his own Fianna
Fail.
He is being pressed by his coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats, to
hold a referendum on the 1983 constitutional amendment but many in Fianna
Fail are reluctant to face a re-run of that debate which one deputy
described as 'extremely bitter and divisive'.
Having just got the party off to a fresh start through the ousting of Mr
Charles Haughey from the leadership last month, he will not want to open new
wounds.
The opposition Labour Party is recommending that the Law Reform Commission
prepare 'an urgent report' on the issues raised by the High Court ruling,
but this was rejected yesterday by the main opposition Fine Gael, whose
spokesman said: 'That will take years. Action is needed immediately because
the status quo cannot continue as it is.'
Mr Dick Spring, the Labour Party leader said: 'I do not see how we can have
a public policy which says to children - to victims of sexual violence - you
have a right to life, but you don't have a right to sanity, to health, to
emotional stability, to begin to repair a life that has been shattered.'
The Irish constitution can only be amended by a referendum, but if the
political parties cannot agree to hold one, it may have to be left to the
courts to back the country out of this legal dead-end that puts Irish
legislation in contradiction with EC law.
An appeal could now be made to the Supreme Court, but given the closely
argued reasoning of the High Court judgment there is no guarantee its
injunction would be overturned. The case would then have to be taken to the
European Court of Human Rights.
According to one legal expert: 'There is a strong case to argue that Ireland
is in breach of Community law, by preventing the free movement of its
nationals within the EC.' The girl's family has given no indication that it
intends to appeal, however.
The politicians fear that a referendum would unleash the intimidating power
of the Roman Catholic church and its pro-life lobby group, the Society for
the Protection of the Unborn Child. The society was instrumental in 1983 in
getting the unborn child's right to life enshrined in the constitution.
Since then, it has successfully prevented the spread of abortion advice in
Ireland through court injunctions against pregnancy counselling services.
Last year the SPUC prevented Irish student unions from advertising or giving
information on UK abortion clinics to their members.
Ireland's anti-abortion law dates back to the 1860s, but it has been
accepted practice for Irish women to travel abroad to terminate unwanted
pregnancies. According to UK statistics, more than 4,000 Irish women obtain
abortions in Britain every year. Until now, no legal action has been
attempted to stop this practice. The 1983 constitutional amendment, however,
created a means for the state to intervene which it has now done.
In effect, any Irish woman who now seeks an abortion abroad, faces possible
prosecution regardless of the circumstances of her pregnancy.
According to Ms Rita Burtenshaw, the director of Dublin's Well-Woman Clinic,
Ireland's largest non-directive pregnancy counselling clinics, many women
come to her in a near-suicidal state, unable to obtain abortion advice -
since 1986, her clinic has been banned from giving it.
She said that many Irish family doctors refuse to prescribe contraception on
religious grounds 'particularly to unmarried women'. That, together with the
lack of sex education in schools, 'means that many Irish women are
appallingly ignorant about their bodies, sex and sexuality. The UK abortion
clinics are picking up the pieces.'
Her clinic, which counsels 40,000 women a year, is presently challenging the
government's ban on abortion counselling through the Court of Human Rights.
A further complication is the protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which
Ireland negotiated last December, and which excludes Ireland from any EC
legislation which would contradict its constitutional 'right-to-life'
amendment. Before signing, the treaty will have to be approved in Ireland by
a referendum. Many women may now oppose it on the basis of that protocol,
which would potentially deny them the right to legal recourse through
European courts, if further injunctions are sought against women travelling
to the UK for abortions.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SONY, the Japanese electronics group, surprised the markets yesterday when
it warned it would lose Y20bn (Pounds 89.3m) in the final quarter of its
financial year which ends next month.
Sony Corporation, the parent company, also expects to report a full-year
operating loss of Y20bn, its first loss since listing on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in 1958.
News of the forecast loss prompted widespread gloom on the Tokyo exchange,
where prices retreated to the lowest level since October 1990 amid fears of
a collapse in consumer spending in Japan. The Nikkei index fell by 253.73 to
20,618.30, while Sony shares closed Y160 lower at Y4,000.
Many economists have been counting on continued strong consumer spending to
keep the Japanese economy from falling into recession. However, Sony said
sales of audio visual equipment in Japan had fallen by 20 per cent in
January compared with a year ago.
Sony's poor results are also a broader reflection of troubles facing the
consumer electronics industry, which is suffering from a lack of new
blockbuster products. Traditional audio visual markets where Sony has been
strong have been saturated with electronic equipment, such as video
recorders and stereo equipment.
The decline of Japanese consumer electronics sales along with the continued
strength of the yen on foreign exchange markets forced Sony to pare its
estimates for consolidated operating profits for the year to Y165bn, 45 per
cent below the result for 1990-91. In response, Sony planned next year to
cut capital spending by Y160bn to Y280bn.
The forecasts were made as Sony announced its third quarter results, in
which consolidated pre-tax profits fell by 36 per cent to Y67.1bn. An
extraordinary gain of Y62bn from the sale of shares in Sony Music
Entertainment boosted after-tax profits in the quarter, up 94 per cent to
Y97.2bn.
Sony tried to put on a brave face, pointing out that worldwide sales
remained strong, up 10 per cent in the quarter to Y1,125.4bn. But it was
apparent that Sony was operating its production lines at full capacity and
having to sell products at extremely low margins.
The brightest news in the results was the turnaround of Sony Pictures
Entertainment, formerly Columbia Pictures, which Sony purchased in 1989 for
Y3.4bn. The release of several highly successful films pushed film revenues
up by 65.4 per cent to Y112.6bn in the quarter.
Operating profits in the entertainment business were Y32.69bn, compared with
Y47.03bn in Sony's traditional electronic equipment business.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Bush vows to fight off Buchanan challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush took his re-election campaign to the south yesterday
in an attempt to restore his flagging electoral fortunes, and promised a
no-holds-barred battle against Mr Patrick Buchanan, his rightwing Republican
challenger.
Mr Buchanan's unexpectedly strong performance in Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary is a triumph for the television commentator whose campaign tapped
widespread discontent over Mr Bush's handling of the economy.
The size of the protest vote against the president embarrassed Mr Bush's
supporters and elated Democrats, who believe they have a strong chance of
defeating him in November's presidential election.
Mr Bush said he had still scored a 'good victory' with 58 per cent of the
Republican vote, against Mr Buchanan's 40 per cent. 'I'm not saying I
wouldn't have liked to do better, but I'm satisfied with the results, and
now we're down here and we're going to take this guy on in every state,' he
said on a campaign visit to Tennessee.
Although Mr Buchanan is not expected to endanger Mr Bush's chances of
winning his party's nomination - especially as several states have refused
to allow him on to the primary ballot - he came closer to the incumbent than
any challenger since Mr Ronald Reagan startled President Gerald Ford in
1976.
Republicans fear that Mr Buchanan could split the party, damaging its
chances in November's election.
Now that the conservative coalition, which has given the Republicans a near
stranglehold on the presidency since 1968, is showing signs of crumbling, Mr
Buchanan's long-term target appears to be the soul and perhaps even the body
of the Republican party in the years ahead.
Mr Bush campaigned for only four days in New Hampshire, but he will step up
the pace with several trips to southern states, which will see a series of
critical primaries over the next three weeks.
This culminates in the Super Tuesday contest on March 10, when 11 states
will cast their votes.
Mr Bush attempted to minimise the significance of Mr Buchanan's strong
showing in New Hampshire, calling it a protest vote from a state that has
been severely hurt by recession.
The president's advisers said New Hampshire would prove a high water mark
for the Buchanan campaign.
But Mr Buchanan said his relative success had given him the momentum to take
the Republican nomination from Mr Bush. 'If an incumbent president with his
resources and his machinery and the White House and the entire establishment
cannot do any better than that, I think they should really stand down,' he
said.
Mr Bush acknowledged the weakness of his performance and promised a tougher
campaign. 'All I did was lay back and get hammered by these Democrats and,
to some degree, by Pat,' he said. 'I've been in tough fights before and I'm
looking forward to this one.'
In New Hampshire, he avoided attacking Mr Buchanan or even mentioning his
name. Yesterday, he threatened some of the ferocious advertising that he
used to destroy Mr Michael Dukakis, his Democratic opponent in 1988. Mr Bush
warned: 'I've been very kind and gentle. I'll still be kind, and I'm now
debating how gentle to be.'
Mr Bush also took aim at his Democrat opponents, noting that Mr Paul
Tsongas, who won his party's primary in New Hampshire with 35 per cent,
disapproved of the economic programme put forward by Democrat leaders in
Congress.
Mr Tsongas and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who came a strong second
in New Hampshire with 26 per cent of the vote, have emerged as the
Democratic frontrunners.
Early recovery in the US economy and inflation at its lowest for a
generation was predicted yesterday by Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve
chairman. Page 22

FT  20 FEB 92 / Heseltine spars with Labour over recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLY CHARGED fore-taste of the general election campaign set pulses
racing in the Commons last night as the two main parties clashed furiously
over the roots of the recession.
As Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, poured scorn on Tory claims that
the stalled recovery was a consequence of a worldwide downturn, Mr John
Major indicated in a newspaper interview that he was ready to authorise more
public spending in the Budget to kick start the economy.
Repeating his claim that the UK was now 'poised' for an upturn, the prime
minister said recovery had been delayed by a general lack of the 'confidence
factor'.
Mr Major's admission that he would raise the public sector borrowing
requirement came in an interview with The Daily Telegraph today ahead of a
cabinet meeting on Budget strategy.
Earlier Mr Smith had made clear he would unveil the details of Labour's tax
and spending plans after the March 10 Budget was announced and before an
election.
The economy dominated the day at Westminster as Labour's ferocious assault
on the government's record met an equally spirited counter-attack from Mr
Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary.
Amid fierce barracking from the government benches, Mr Smith charged the
Tories with blaming foreigners for their failures and being 'unwilling and
incapable of moving the country out of recession'.
But his attack was brushed aside by Mr Heseltine who counter-claimed that
the Labour leadership was riven with divisions about how to respond to the
downturn.
Against the mounting election fever at Westminster, the recession debate had
been widely - and rightly - anticipated as a 'clash of giants'. Mr Heseltine
had been drafted in to answer Mr Smith because Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, was giving evidence to the Treasury committee.
Mr Smith used his opening speech to review the government's pledges of an
early economic upturn. He went on to pour scorn on claims that recovery had
been halted by an international recession.
Earlier explanations from ministers that the causes of the recession were
rooted in such factors as deregulation of the financial sector were proof it
was 'home-grown, domestically caused and without a hint of a foreign
bacillus', he said.
Ignoring the charges, a clearly relaxed Mr Heseltine countered that the key
issue was not the cause of the downturn, but how to respond to it. To the
delight of his backbenches, he went on to cite newspaper reports of
divisions within the Labour leadership.
'This debate started off as a vote of confidence in the government's
economic policies,' Mr Heseltine said. 'It has rapidly become a vote of
confidence in the shadow cabinet.'
His light-hearted teasing of the Labour frontbench provoked outrage from the
opposition, but clearly raised morale among Tory MPs who described his
speech as a 'vintage performance'.
The government had a majority of 100 when it came to the vote, with the
Labour attack defeated by 311 to 211.
Earlier, Labour had stepped up its assault on the Tories' economic record
when Mr Smith, claimed the government had cost every household Pounds 2,200
last year alone.
The figure - centrepiece of a new document entitled The Cost of the
Conservatives - came as a clear response to the Tories' recent poster
campaign alleging Labour would raise taxes by an average of Pounds 1,000 per
taxpayer.
It is based on a calculation that the government's 'economic incompetence'
had delivered the worst growth record since the second world war, resulting
in the UK economy foregoing some Pounds 50bn in gross domestic product last
year.
Sitting beneath a poster of Mr Lamont in a stocking mask alongside the
slogan 'You've Been Robbed', Mr Smith told a Westminster news conference
that 'everyone now knows' Britain was suffering the deepest recession since
the 1930s.
He said the Pounds 50bn GDP shortfall represented the gap between a 2.5 per
cent average growth trend, established from 1955 until 1979, and the
'miserable' 1.7 per cent annual growth actually achieved.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Air raising plan for Mexican pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO CITY'S government is considering installing 100 giant hot-air
ventilators across the nation's capital, in a bizarre effort to blow
pollution away from the city.
Mr Manuel Camacho, the city's mayor, has embraced the proposal, saying it
'could not be faulted theoretically.' The ventilators would be an additional
tool in the fight against pollution, he said.
The devices would supposedly create an effect similar to a hurricane,
lifting the pollution - and conceivably anything else not firmly bolted to
the ground - from the capital.
The idea is to place 100 ventilators roughly every 1,000 square metres in
specially designated parks or gardens, at a cost of around Dollars 100m
(Pounds 57m). The ventilators would consist of a series of fans, and an
incinerator that would heat the air between the fans, to blast polluted air
from the mountain-ringed capital.
The scheme has generated enormous publicity, mostly sceptical. 'The project
has no technical foundation whatsoever,' said Mr Luis Manuel Guerra,
director of the Autonomous Institute of Ecological Research, Mexico's
leading ecological research institution.
'To think that you can solve the problem of ozone with this device shows a
complete lack of knowledge of the atmospheric chemistry of ozone.' The
incinerators will burn natural gas, and thus worsen the city's ozone
problem, according to Mr Guerra.
The scheme was originally proposed by one of Mexico's most distinguished
leftwing opposition politicians, Mr Herberto Castillo, who is also a civil
engineer.
The ventilator scheme was announced on the day ozone reached 'very
dangerous' levels, prompting the government to enforce strict anti-smog
measures. Certain industries were required to cut production by between 30
and 40 per cent and people were urged to use public transport.
No decision will be made on the ventilator scheme until further studies are
completed.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (22): Smarter Cinderellas
 -The new image of vans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK SEMPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIGHT commercial vehicles have traditionally been the Cinderellas of the
motor industry. However, they are quietly and slowly, shaking off the worst
of that image, as manufacturers, dealers and fleets start to take them more
seriously. The supplier side of the industry appears to be putting its house
in order, according to Derek Carpenter, of the Harris Research Centre.
Harris has been doing annual surveys of van operators' satisfaction since
the mid-1980s, and found in its latest survey that 'overall, operators said
the standard of servicing was high, and better than in 1990. However, there
are still examples of customers having to wait a very long time for spare
parts.' Other problem areas highlighted by a generally happy public were
quality of workmanship, and having to return to the workshop more than once
with a recurring fault.
Several manufacturers are doing detailed market studies and using the
results much more actively to identify poor dealer performance. Some are
using financial rewards and penalties to encourage improvements.
'Either manufacturers are coercing dealers, or the dealers are simply
improving their own performance. Although vans are low volume compared with
cars, they can be very profitable.' Many van customers are reliant on their
vehicles, much more so than car users, he notes.
According to Stuart Wright, light commercial vehicle manager at Citroen UK,
dealers are coming under increasing pressure from sections of the van market
to move away from car-based after-sales support and move more towards what
is available in the heavy truck sector, in terms of the style of maintenance
and contracts.
Lorry operators have long been used to a responsive, 'open-all-hours'
service from their dealers, which has enabled them to get their vehicles
serviced at times when they are not needed to carry freight, and repaired at
the roadside urgently. Many truck dealers' workshops are open 24 hours a
day, six days a week or more, contributing significantly to their customers'
efficiency.
The influence of the heavy truck market is coming through on a number of
fronts, according to Malcolm Jefferies, marketing director for Leyland Daf
vans and trucks. 'More fleets are buying on a professional basis, they are
looking at their costs in more detail. A lot of people are looking at vans
on a whole life cost basis, who two or three years ago wouldn't have given
it a thought.
'Out-of-hours servicing is one thing which grows out of that. If the
vehicles are working on eight-hour day delivery cycles, one way to reduce
the costs of non-productive time off the road is to have the vehicles
maintained outside normal hours.' Fleet managers running vans and trucks and
demanding out-of-hours servicing for the heavier vehicles often have exactly
the same operating requirements for their vans.
The difference in culture between car and lorry dealers shows up in the
Leyland DAF network. While 140 dealers are part of car (mostly Rover)
operations, a further 50 joined after the disposal of Rover's van and truck
companies to DAF in the late 1980s.
Bill Beadnell, chairman of North East Leyland Daf, has two workshops which
were more used to catering for hauliers working for chemicals and heavy
engineering companies, than for van operators. After getting the van
franchise, companies like his have been able to offer lcv users with 'a
level of service most had hardly dreamed about'.
Mr Jefferies agrees. 'Heavy truck dealers have been able to provide a
different type of service.' But there are, by necessity, relatively few
heavy truck outlets, and many van operators would prefer to deal with a car
dealership, than have to walk into a huge truck workshop. The ideal would be
a network which combined the best of both worlds, but that is impossible, he
says.
At a time when there is pressure to reduce workshop hours, the dilemma
facing car dealers is how to justify the increase in overheads involved in
putting on a second shift in the workshop to cater for van customers needing
out-of-hours servicing. The demand will rarely be great - more than half the
lcv market seems happy to buy after-sales service in the same way as car
owners.
There is no evidence that customers would pay more for the service in this
recession. On the contrary they have been seeking lower labour rates. It
seems certain that some fleets seeking out-of-hours servicing, will move
away from franchised garages to independent workshops.
Some manufacturers, who are seeking to expand their lcv activities, are
finding that dealers, hit by falling sales and profits, are reluctant to
invest in the parts, vehicle lifts and trained personnel needed for a
first-class van outlet.
Ford, the clear market leader, is putting pressure - it prefers the term
'friendly persuasion' - on its car dealers to set up separate sales, parts
and service operations for their van business. 'Car specialists can't deal
in a normal way with commercial vehicle requirements. It involves a
different product knowledge, everything. It is obviously difficult at
present, but we are putting a lot of weight behind commercials.'
Another manufacturer commented: 'By and large, customer requirements will be
met. However, dealers would undoubtedly invest more, if it weren't for the
recession.'
Manufacturers' warranties are improving, however. Toyota and Mazda offer
three-year, 60,000-miles cover, typically of interest to small traders,
while Leyland DAF now gives two years or 100,000 miles as standard, with a
third year option. Ford gives one year, unlimited, while Mercedes gives an
optional second year warranty on the driveline.
Meanwhile, Iveco Ford Truck, market leader in goods vehicles up to the
non-heavy goods vehicle limit of 7.5 tonnes, has introduced the concept of
menu pricing along with its new Cargo range of middleweight trucks. The
computer-based system is part of a package of measures designed to overcome
a long-standing criticism of truck dealers - that operators can never be
sure of what they will be charged for maintenance work, until they get the
bill.
The system seeks to impose the discipline of standard workshop hours, which
are common in the car side of the industry but much less so with trucks,
across a wide range of servicing and repairs.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (23): Geared for change -
Lorries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK SEMPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LORRY industry is going through a radical change, due in part to the
impact of the recession, but also as a result of a new, strategic offensive
by truck manufacturers. They aim to broaden substantially their involvement
in the market, so that they play a dominant role in the way in which fleets
finance, and, subsequently, maintain their vehicles.
The truck companies are setting up their own finance companies to provide
operators with everything from basic hire purchase to full contract hire
packages.
On much of the Continent, the move will allow them to take the lead in the
development of contract hire services; in the UK, where contract hire is
more developed, it means they will challenge the established giants, such as
BRS and Ryder, head-on.
In the UK, the move is also a short-term necessity, to plug the gap left by
traditional lenders - the high street banks and finance houses  - which have
fled the market. Barrie Cload of Volvo Truck Finance (VTF) says these
lenders have 'lost their shirts' in trucks over the past 18 months.
Volvo was first to develop its own contract-hire and finance arm. In 1988,
just 5 per cent of Volvo trucks went on the road with a guaranteed buy-back
from VTF; in 1991 the figure was one in four. VTF's receivables total around
Pounds 70m, and the company says it has not yet reached top gear.
Companies such as ERF, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland, and
Scania have followed Volvo's lead.
Mercedes-Benz is thought to be planning the most ambitious attack on the
contract hire market yet with the formal launch expected in May this year.
Underlying this strategic shift is the desire of manufacturers and their
dealers - in many cases wholly-owned - to retain control of the profit
opportunities available in selling and servicing lorries throughout the life
of the vehicle.
The truck industry is following the example of General Motors in the US car
market during the mid to late 1980s. The company was making minimal profits
from US car manufacturing, but the financing of those vehicles proved highly
profitable.
Truck manufacturers will tailor contracts to the realities of transport much
more closely than traditional lenders, according to Mr Cload. For example, a
haulier may wish to finance a vehicle over five years, with the possibility
of getting out after one year, if he loses the transport contract, and
reducing the cost of a repair and maintenance agreement using the part
exchange value of traded-in trucks. 'These deals are a million light years
away from what finance companies were offering. We are to a finance house
what a merchant bank is to the bank in the high street.'
While only a proportion of operators will favour full contract hire,
manufacturers will be attacking in-house workshops more strongly than they
ever have in the past. Pence per mile repair and maintenance contracts have
become cheaper, partly as a result of commercial pressure to cut rates but
also due to increased reliability of the trucks and a long-term drive to
bring business back into dealers' workshops. Contract charges will continue
to fall, in cash terms, over the next two years, Mr Cload predicts.
They are also available over much longer periods, giving operators fixed
maintenance costs for five or more years. In the past three months, Renault
has broadened the concept by actively marketing repair and maintenance
contracts on used lorries.
Several factors will favour the case for using dealers. Skilled fitters will
become increasingly scarce, and therefore hard to attract. Electronics on
vehicles are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and there will be pressure
to invest in expensive diagnostic equipment. Some tasks, for example setting
up the air suspension on some Leyland DAF lorries, can be done only by using
specialist equipment. As vehicles become more reliable, the convenience
benefits of in-house workshops are reduced.
However, British hauliers are proving much more reluctant to part with their
workshops than their continental counterparts. UK operations are renowned as
the most demanding in Europe, and the rigorous legal requirements for
mechanical inspections, typically every six weeks, are unmatched in Europe.
As a result, trucks have to be in the workshop more often.
Taylors of Martley, a haulier running 100 trucks based near Worcester, is
committed to having a workshop at its main depot, but recognises the
increasing pressures to stay ahead of dealerships. Unusually, the
family-owned firm has persisted with a three-year apprentice scheme
throughout the 1980s to ensure it has skilled fitters.
'The trend in truck electronics will encourage us to specialise on one make,
though,' director Stephen Martley says. 'Having your own workshops usually
only starts to pay dividends in the second half of a vehicle's life, when
maintenance costs start rising and niggling faults start to appear. I doubt
if firms with 10-15 trucks will have their own workshops, in future.'
Old lorries, unlike, old soldiers, rarely fade away gracefully - either they
die suddenly or they cost a fortune in workshop charges.
The arrival of manufacturers alongside contract hire specialist companies
coincides with a classic credit squeeze on many operators, and intense
scrutiny of costs at all companies. There has been such a jolt to business
confidence and profits, that many firms will feel reluctant, or unable to
buy vehicles and suppliers predict a new surge in demand for contract hire.
Many operators will insist that in-house operations are still the cheapest,
and the safest in the long term. However, guaranteed fixed-costs for truck
fleets has rarely been as attractive an option or as widely available.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (21): Attractive option -
Diesel-engined vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of diesel-engined cars in the UK rose by 9 per cent during 1991 at a
time when the rest of the new car market was falling by more than 20 per
cent. And they increased their share of that market from 6.4 per cent in
1990 to 8.8 per cent last year.
New diesel car sales in 1991 totalled 139,810, more than 11,600 up on the
1990 figure of 128,167, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT). That growth compared with a 21.74 per cent fall in 1991
total car sales to 1.59m.
Now, say automotive industry sources, the growth in diesel vehicle sales
could further accelerate over the next few years if the UK government bows
to growing environmental and industry pressures for a reduction in diesel
fuel tax to widen the price differential with petrol. 'In Britain, diesel
fuel is barely cheaper than petrol but the price differentials in other
major European markets are considerably wider,' claims the SMMT.
Taking 1991 prices, the SMMT says that in France, for instance, a gallon of
diesel fuel after tax was about 70p cheaper than a gallon of petrol. In
Holland and Italy it was 83p cheaper and in Germany, 30p cheaper.
As a result of those price differentials, claims the SMMT, diesel car sales
in Continental Europe are proportionately much higher than in Britain.
Figures for 1990 showed the diesel share of new car sales in France was 31
per cent, in Germany 11 per cent and in Italy nearly 7.5 per cent.
Diesel car sales for fleets of more than 25 vehicles accounted for 38,419 in
the first 11 months of 1991, an increase of nearly 13 per cent on 1990 at a
time when vehicle fleet numbers as a whole fell by 12.5 per cent.
Further evidence of the increasing popularity of diesel-engined cars comes
from vehicle manufacturer Peugeot Talbot which claims to have three models -
the 405, 205 and 309 - in the half dozen top selling diesel cars in Britain.
'Our sales of diesel-engined cars for the first 11 months of 1991 rose by
just over 37 per cent on the same months of 1990 to 42,286. That represented
38 per cent of our total 111,585 British car sales in that period,' says
Heather Yaxley, Peugeot Talbot UK public relations officer.
Peugeot Talbot also saw diesels account for 4,262 (77 per cent) of its total
5,549 UK light commercial vehicle sales in the 1991 period. In the overall
UK British light commercial vehicle market, diesels accounted for 99,772 (67
per cent) of the total 149,155 sales in the first 11 months of 1991.
There are now reckoned to be around 1.25m diesel-engined cars and light vans
in the UK and by the mid-1990s that figure is expected to top 2m.
The main selling point for diesel cars in the UK has been their lower fuel
costs. They have also held their value as used cars. Those advantages still
hold good, says Geoff Cobley, managing director of Fleet Management
Services. But he remains cautious about the wider attractions of
diesel-engined cars for fleet operators. 'At the moment, we are only
recommending diesel-engined cars for very high mileage users - those doing
25,000-30,000 miles a year,' he says.
Mr Cobley admits, though, that any change of policy by the UK government to
make diesel much cheaper than petrol could result in diesel-engined cars
becoming a more attractive proposition for a wider range of fleet operators.
Mr Ron Elder, managing director of Avis Lease and Fleet Management, believes
the government should also look at 'redressing the slightly unfair tax
banding situation' in respect of diesel car engine capacities. 'You
generally need a larger capacity diesel engine to deliver the same power as
a petrol-driven unit. There should be some adjustment of the tax bands for
diesels to reflect that,' he says.
Further support for that argument comes from the British Vehicle Rental and
Leasing Association which claims in its recently-published 1992 Budget
submission that in the context of vehicle taxation 'the arbitrary use of
engine capacity produces serious anomalies and discriminates unfairly
against the diesel-engined car'.
The main argument in favour of lowering diesel taxes is an environmental
one. The SMMT claims the reduced levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and
oxides of nitrogen resulting from the use of three-way catalytic converters
on petrol engines is achieved more naturally by diesel. And, it adds, diesel
does not contain lead.
Many car drivers, though, apparently remain unconvinced about the
environmental merits of diesels. A survey commissioned by BRS Car Lease
showed that only 33 per cent of more than 600 company car drivers questioned
believed that diesel cars were more environmentally-friendly than
leaded-petrol-engined cars, with that figure falling to 28 per cent in
respect of cars using unleaded petrol.
Only 36 per cent of drivers said they would consider choosing a diesel car.
Forty-eight per cent said they thought diesels were 'too polluting or
smelly,' with a further 31 per cent citing noise as a reason for not
choosing one. Surprisingly, adds BRS Car Lease, only one in five drivers
were concerned about performance.
'With only one in five drivers stating performance as a reason for not
choosing a diesel, it is clear that manufacturers' advertising campaigns
have worked well. However, these campaigns have been targeted at showing the
improvements in performance of diesels and not promoting their environmental
advantages,' says Paul Bates, general manager of BRS Car Lease.
Particularly significant in terms of the performance improvements cited by
Mr Bates has been the introduction of turbo-charging for passenger car
applications. Such features add power increases of 25 per cent or more,
helping to overcome the 'sluggish' image of earlier car diesel engines.
Turbo-charging has also been accompanied by improvements to fuel injectors
and the combustion system to produce greater engine efficiency and lower
emissions.
At the same time, diesel car manufacturers have upgraded vehicle trims and
other features to make them more attractive to comfort and image-conscious
users.
Further enhancements to diesel cars are likely to include the fitting of
catalytic converters.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (19): Emphasis switches
to smaller engines - Merits of the latest business vehicles on the market
assessed by Stuart Marshall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THE emphasis among business car buyers and users is now on vehicles
costing no more than Pounds 19,250 and having engines of less than 2-litres
cylinder capacity.
This is nothing new for fleet cars but the business car user has become
uncomfortably aware that going over Pounds 19,250 and two litres brings an
unwelcome rise in personal taxation.
As a result, the best sellers among executive cars are now the
smaller-engined ones. They include the newly facelifted and much improved
Rover 820s and such 4-cylinder familiars as the Granada and Carlton, Audi
100, BMW 518, Mercedes 190, Saab 9000 and Volvo 940.
Some even slip into the under Pounds 19,250 category when fitted with
automatic transmission. This is something fewer and fewer business users,
faced with city centre crawls and the aggravation of motorway tailbacks, are
prepared to do without.
There is no doubt that a modern 4-cylinder engine, often multi-valved and
fitted with contra-rotating balance shafts, performs so smoothly it is hard
to distinguish from an in-line or V6. This is certainly the case up to
moderately high revolutions.
It would, of course, be idle to suggest there is absolutely no difference at
all between driving, say, a 2.7-litre Rover Sterling and an 820i, or a
2-litre Peugeot 605SLi and 3-litre 605 SEV. Of course, there is in terms of
sheer acceleration and unusable top speed. But most user-choosers have
decided it is not enough to make the tax penalty worthwhile, even if their
employers should be in a position to provide the larger-engined car.
Many front-wheel-driven executive class cars of similar size and price are
so similar that the choice may depend more on subjective matters such as
appearance and image than on actual performance.
The manufacturers may be reluctant to acknowledge it, but there is not a
great deal of difference in performance or general ambience between a Rover
820i and a Lancia Thema, a Saab 9000i and an Alfa-Romeo 164.
Standard power steering makes them easy to drive and park; they have
comfortable seats, electric windows, big boots, effective
heating-ventilation systems and decent stereo radio/tape players and, most
important, are quiet enough for easy listening on motorway journeys.
The same can be said of 2-litre front-wheel-driven cars whose cheaper,
smaller-engined versions are either the staple of company fleets - the
Vauxhall Cavaliers and Peugeot 405s - or family cars. Now that the bitter
conflict between Nissan's erstwhile UK distributor and Nissan Motor has been
resolved, the admirable, British-made Nissan Primera deserves to pick up a
lot of sales in the business market this year.
From the entry model 1.6L to potent 2.0e ZX, the Primera - every one
16-valve-engined and power-steered - sets a class standard for refinement,
build quality, handling and equipment.
There are, of course, still some executive-type under 2-litre cars of
individual character.
Among the front-wheel drives, the Citroen XM and the veteran Saab 900 spring
to mind. For users who prefer rear-wheel drive (or who never think about
such things), the BMW 518i and 520i look and feel athletic, the Mercedes 190
oozes status and quality; and the roomy Volvo 940 carries real but
undefinable overtones of safety and environmental acceptability.
If size is not first priority, the user-chooser is well catered for by
highly specified cars such as the new Audi 80, BMW 3-Series, Fiat Tempra,
Lancia Dedra and the Rover 200/400 Series.
They offer everything that most business drivers expect of larger cars
except their bulk. If not more than two people are regularly to travel long
distances in them, they are often to be preferred. They feel nimbler on
winding roads and are easier to park.
One of the best newcomers in this segment is the SEAT Toledo, in effect a
Spanish-built Volkswagen between Golf and Passat in size and most
competitively priced. Other new entrants that would appeal to younger
business motorists include the Citroen ZX, Honda Civic 1.6 VTi and, insurers
willing, such hot hatchbacks as the 16-valve-engined Renault Clio, Fiat
Tipo, Ford's admirable Escort RS2000 and the new Vauxhall Astra 2.0 GSi.
At the moment, Japanese makes are handicapped in the business market simply
because they are Japanese and most companies feel they should support
British or at least European manufacturers.
In so doing they deprive their employees of an opportunity to drive cars
that are often ahead of class rivals for creative design as well as for
reliability, refinement and equipment.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (20): Mind-boggling
technology - John Griffiths looks ahead to possible future developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE AREA of costs associated with vehicle fleet operation lies largely
beyond the control of the fleet manager: the delays, wasted fuel, lost
man-hours and other inefficiencies caused by road congestion and often
inadequate infrastructure.
Near the end of last year, as part of the pan-European Prometheus (an
acronym for Programme for European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and
Safety) research programme to improve traffic safety and efficiency,
Europe's motor industry issued its own estimate of the problem's cost:
Ecu75bn (Dollars 96bn) or 15 per cent of the EC's entire transport-related
spending.
Reducing those costs is a key goal within Prometheus's twin overall aims of
improving traffic flow efficiency by at least 20 per cent, and safety by at
least 30 per cent, between now and 2010.
Five years after the launch of the programme - which involves 18 European
vehicle makers, 80 component companies and 124 research institutes, with
help from EC governments - the first fruits of its non-competitive research
efforts were put on display in Turin a few months ago.
It was a mind-boggling array of technology. Some - such as vision
enhancement systems allowing drivers to 'see' through fog - is intended to
be commercially available by the mid-1990s.
Other technology, of closer interest to commercial vehicle fleets expecting
to operate throughout the single EC market, is unlikely to be available
until near the end of the decade. Included within this are satellite-based
fleet management systems and Copdrive, in which the vehicles are permanently
exchanging information with each other while driving and manoeuvring.
More controversially, there is the prospect of 'convoying' on inter-city
highways, with collision-avoidance systems controlling vehicles running in
tight formation, thus maximising use of road space.
The Turin extravaganza included a vehicle fleet management demonstration
system representing the pooled efforts of MAN and Daimler-Benz, the German
truck makers; Sweden's Volvo; Iveco, Fiat of Italy's commercial vehicles arm
and French state-owned Renault Vehicules. Using a combination of cellular
phone networks, a Satcom satellite ground station and satellites, the fleet
operator can track the precise movements of all its vehicles, integrate them
into route planning and exchange data.
The overall concept is even more complex than at first it might appear:
Its formally-defined goals are: improving transport planning and scheduling;
increased safety and reliability; better use of available cargo space and to
avoid empty runs; the creation of pan-European standards for the exchange of
information on fleet movements; and improvements in areas such as monitoring
the movement of valuable or dangerous cargoes and improved emergency
reporting procedures.
In spite of the long-term nature of the programme, substantial progress on
it is expected to have been made by the end of this year.
Before 1993, the partners in the project intend to have evaluated all the
likely alternative systems and formulated proposals for standardising the
message and data exchange technology.
They then expect to conduct large-scale field tests with integrated freight
and fleet management systems, in co-operation with some of the existing
large international transport chains.
However, the Prometheus partners acknowledge that such technology-based
approaches to greater efficiencies are unlikely to be wholly effective in
the absence of co-ordinated legislative activity at EC and individual
government level.
As part of the process, they argue, it is essential for pan- European
standards to be established for highway networks, traffic information
systems and other 'harmonised' infrastructure through which the new
technologies would need to work.
The Prometheus estimates of the current cost of transport inefficiency
appear certain to act as a significant incentive. Judging from the reaction
of officials and bureaucrats from the main EC countries and institutions
invited to Turin, the response is already strongly sympathetic.
However, Prometheus is also likely to be seeking significantly more cash
from governmental quarters.
So far, the Prometheus projects between them have been swallowing funds at
the rate of around Ecu90m a year, with government contributing some Ecu30m
annually between them.
But, as with the fleet management programme, many of the projects are moving
from basic research and small-scale prototype work towards field trials and
the need actually to manufacture hardware.
In the past few months, the partners have formally committed themselves to
extending their activities beyond 1994 and to strengthen Prometheus's
management.
But from then on, spending will have to rise to several - perhaps many  -
times present levels. Without substantial extra government funding, it could
fizzle out.
Few within the programme, however, expect this to happen, for Prometheus's
spending appears puny in comparison with the sums required under DRIVE, the
EC programme for improving transport infrastructure with which Prometheus is
complementary.
The programme, which has already developed an Integrated Road Safety,
Information and Navigation System (IRIS) plan, outlines the prospect of
having to invest up to Ecu15bn in information technology and transport
telecommunications alone, within 70 European cities and along Europe's main
highways, for an integrated approach to traffic infrastructure to be
successful. That excluded the Ecu50bn worth of equipment that would have to
be fitted inside vehicles themselves to make use of it.
The consolation, however, is that much of this is likely to be provided by
the private sector, investing in both the equipment and the supply of the
information services as new market sectors.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (17): Gold-plated
electronic future - There are more than 1m carphones in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOBILE phone has become as much a fixture in the typical executive's
company car as the dashboard clock or the spare wheel. Just 10 years' ago
few could have predicted its impact on business efficiency and working
practices. The next 10 years, however, could see a host of new
communications devices introduced to vehicles.
Before the introduction of cellular radio in the UK in 1985, there were
fewer than 50,000 carphones in use, many of which had to be manually
'patched into' the public telephone network by an operator. Today there are
more than 1.3m, an increasing proportion of which (now more than 50 per
cent) are of the take-anywhere hand-portable variety and all of which are
attached to fully automatic networks. Typical retail prices - even of the
hand portables - are a fraction of those of a decade ago.
The low cost and consequent high popularity of the mobile phone has been
largely the result of new technologies which combine computing and
communications to make highly efficient use of limited radio spectrum
resources.
The same technologies also st developments.
Today's Total Access Communications System and Extended Total Access
Communications System (TACS and ETACS) standards, which account for most
mobile phones in the UK, are set to be replaced during the 1990s by the
Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). GSM, is an all digital
version of today's analogue TACS/ETACS cellular radio system. It offers the
added advantages of in-built text messaging as well as the ability
eventually to use mobile phones in other European countries.
Services based on GSM are now being launched across Europe although,
ironically, the UK's high density of users of analogue mobile phones is
likely to delay its introduction in Britain.
Another big advantage promised by GSM is its relative ease in handling of
mobile data traffic from such terminals as facsimiles or computers in
vehicles. Today's analogue systems also offer limited support for mobile
data. But GSM should be able to offer five times the data rate and with
greater degrees of integrity and security.
A rival to GSM's data role, however, is likely to arise from dedicated
mobile data service providers. In the UK, four such companies have already
received licences - electronics company Dowty subsidiary Cognito, Hong
Kong-owned Hutchison Mobile Data, US-owned Ram Mobile Data and
semiconductor, computing and radio communications giant Motorola. Three of
these have now launched services and are reporting good take-up rates.
Makers of terminals also see mobile data as the way of the future. Last year
US computing giant IBM landed a bombshell in the personal computing market
with the unveiling of a series of laptop computers dedicated to use as
mobile data terminals. It listed three new models with in-built
communications facilities, two featuring wireless technologies.
IBM describes the 3kg PCs as 'note-book sized, ruggedised, battery-operated
computers' which allow users to access and input information from remote
locations. One model is designed to communicate over dedicated mobile data
radio networks. The second operates over cellular radio-based mobile
telephone networks, and features an optional extra handset allowing it to be
used as a mobile telephone as well as a mobile data terminal and portable
computer. The third uses ordinary fixed telephone lines.
However, IBM is not the only company investing in the future of mobile data.
Before the IBM announcement, a number of companies had dedicated wireless
data computer terminals on the market and Japan's NEC and the US's NCR even
had laptop computers on the market with built-in radio communications.
Satellites promise to play a significant role in mobile communications in
the 1990s. The International Maritime Satellite organisation (Inmarsat) and
the European telecommunications satellite organisation (Eutelsat) have
launched messaging services aimed at international freight haulage companies
so that truckers can keep in constant two-way contact with their bases.
The messages are restricted to data/text only and the receiving equipment is
relatively large and expensive, but future developments promise smaller and
cheaper equipment, also capable of transmitting and receiving voice signals.
Inmarsat, for instance, is collaborating with US company GE Astro to design
satellites 20 times more powerful than the Inmarsat spacecraft. 'Customers
will be able to travel all over the world and communicate with each other
via telephone, facsimile, personal computers or pagers using terminals that
are small enough to fit into business briefcases', says Olof Lundberg,
Inmarsat's director-general.
In recent years, a number of newcomers to satellite-based mobile
communications have claimed they can offer full voice communications with
even smaller and cheaper handsets.
The first of these newcomers was Chicago-based Motorola with its Dollars
2.3bn Iridium project. Here the plan is to use 77 low earth orbit satellites
to offer links for voice, facsimile and data to handheld terminals anywhere
in the world. These satellites are cheaper to build and launch and do not
have the great signalling distances to overcome from outer space which
affect today's communications satellites.
Inmarsat, France's Alcatel and Japan's KDD are also studying systems similar
to Motorola's. Mr Lundberg, of Inmarsat, believes his organisation should be
able to provide global voice services to hand-held terminals by the end of
the decade.
Compatibility with terrestrial cellular systems is a priority and should not
cost more than Dollars 1,000, with service delivery costs not rising above
Dollars 1 a minute, he adds. As with today's mobile telephone systems, Mr
Lundberg notes that any manufacturer should be able to provide equipment for
the system, providing it is type-approved.
By 2000, he predicts, the worldwide mobile satellite user population could
reach 1m to 2m, mainly international business travellers, justifying
investments in the region of Dollars 1bn.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (16): Davids subsidise
cash flow of Goliaths - Friction between makers and dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the less pleasant aspects of a recession for many smaller businesses
is the way in which it mysteriously starts taking longer for large companies
to which they are suppliers - and on which, obviously, they are dependent -
to settle their accounts. Effectively, it is a case of David subsidising
Goliath's cash flow.
The Davids will not be at all pleased to learn that they could well be
subsidising Goliath's fleet of company cars as well.
The report which highlights this possibility was commissioned by the Retail
Motor Industry Federation. In ordering the hefty, 200-page study* from
consultants Harbour Wade and Professor Jonathan Brown, research professor in
retail management at Brighton Business School, the RMI was more concerned
with the welfare of the 7,500 franchised car dealers who form the bedrock of
its membership than end users.
It was seeking mainly to identify the extent to which car makers, ever
anxious to 'move metal', have been by-passing their franchised dealers -
through which all sales should theoretically be made - to sell directly to
the big fleets.
It concluded that at least 200,000 such sales are being made annually and,
for some particularly large and favoured fleets, at discounts sometimes
reaching as high as 40 per cent. That is considerably more than double most
franchised car dealers' own official profit margins, which are typically
around 16 per cent.
Since, in the present depressed UK car market, most dealers in volume cars
would be happy to retain 6 or 7 per cent of their margin even to private
customers, it is hardly surprising that the main burden of the report was
that such sales stand to undermine dealer viability and perhaps result in
the disintegration of the franchised dealer system itself.
However, it is the effect that these deeply-discounted cars have when they
emerge two, three or four years later into the used car market - in other
words their residual values - which is of most relevance to smaller
businesses and to an even greater extent by private buyers.
Cars bought at considerably less discount, typically 8 to 12.5 per cent for
volume cars, still form most of the market and represent the level of
discount available to reasonably persistent private and small company
buyers.
If this were to be the maximum discount level, as is the case in many other
markets where the fleet influence is less pervasive, residual values for a
given car, age and mileage would be relatively equitable.
The 'drag-down' in residual value suffered by the private buyer, receiving
least discount, caused by the lower price a company might accept for its
used cars bought at a higher discount, would be relatively insignificant.
The way things work at present in the UK, however, is seen as altogether
more damaging.
At least 200,000 cars, bought at 25, 30 or even 40 per cent discount,
finding their way back into the used car market are likely to have a
noticeable impact, particularly in a market where last year only 1.59m new
cars were sold.
Naturally, the big fleet operators selling them could accept much lower
prices in the used car market yet, proportionately, suffer no worse from
depreciation than the private or small company buyer. The point is, however,
that they do not have to.
Because the bulk of the used car market is still made up of relatively less
discounted cars, the residual value contained within the trade guides which
motor traders themselves use as their 'bibles', Glass's Guide and the CAP
Black Book, will mainly reflect depreciation on these vehicles.
However,the extra availability of very deeply discounted cars in such
numbers undoubtedly reduces the value of the private or small company's cars
at auction or trade-in time.
The additional drop may not be much - perhaps 10 per cent. But it is still a
loss which would not arise in the absence of big direct fleet deals.
In contrast, the daily rental company which bought 20,000 cars direct from
the manufacturer, at a discount of 30 per cent, is laughing all the way to
the auction block.
Not only did it buy the cars cheaply, but courtesy of the private buyer and
small company sector, it is benefitting from much higher residual values
than if everybody had been able to buy at a similar discount.
Once again, David is subsiding Goliath.
As the RMI research found, there is a lot of money at stake. Its statistics
demonstrate that, on average, private buyers in 1990/early 1991 received a
discount of Pounds 575.
That rose to Pounds 750 in the case of small company fleets of two to 24
cars; Pounds 1,140 per car for fleets of 25-100; Pounds 1,365 for 100-plus
fleets; Pounds 1,870 for small daily rental fleets and a full Pounds 2,000
for the rental market 'majors'.
Accusations that manufacturers have consistently increased new car prices by
more than the rate of inflation, in part to create a higher base from which
to discount heavily to the fleets, already form part of the investigation by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into new car prices in the UK, and how
they are influenced by the system of exclusively franchised dealer.
If the RMI study is right, and the franchised dealer system really is under
threat from being by-passed, that too, it is argued, would have considerable
implications for all business car buyers.
'We consider that its replacement by a largely unstructured supply
organisation would not work in the interests of consumers, customers or
manufacturers. There would be a significant downscaling and reduction of
investment by dealer networks, which would affect national coverage, quality
and standards,' the report's authors conclude.
As the end of January neared, the big question appeared to be: would the MMC
itself agree?

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (18): High hopes for
Budget relief - The campaign to abolish Special Car Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car prices, which has just
been published, did not consider in fine detail justification for the
Special Car Tax (SCT), a tax which adds the nominal 10 per cent to new car
prices, plus VAT at 17.5 per cent.
The motor industry has long been campaigning for the abolition of the SCT,
arguing that a reduction in showroom prices by nearly 12 per cent would
cause a beneficial chain reaction - it would boost demand which, in turn,
would boost British industry, generate jobs and perhaps even result in a
stronger indigenous motor industry which could then bolster the country's
balance of payments by increasing exports. For years successive chancellors
have ignored the motor industry's pleas. Yet now there is a real possibility
that the SCT may go. The government, shocked by the detrimental effects of
recent budgets on the motor industry - sales of new cars in 1991 were down
20 per cent to the lowest level for nine years - is listening with a keener
ear than ever before to industry.
Treasury Minister Gillian Shephard, for example, has held two meetings with
senior motor industry executives in the past month and has pledged that
'very careful consideration' would be given to their views.
Sir Hal Miller, director of the SMMT who was present at those meetings, said
of Special Car Tax: 'We have been asking for its removal for the past three
or four years. The car is the only comparable product that is burdened with
this extra 10 per cent tax and its removal would certainly give the industry
a much-needed boost.'
The SMMT claims that elimination of the SCT and a shift of taxation from the
owner to the user of the car by increasing the duty on petrol, would result
in a rise of only 15 pence a gallon. And should the increase be phased in
over two successive budgets, the burden to the motorist would hardly be
noticed, given the volatility of fuel prices.
Simon Foster, managing director of Toyota (GB), also argues strongly for the
removal of SCT, pointing out that for importers from outside the EC the
total tax burden is even worse. Imports from Japan and the US attract 10 per
cent tax on their landed value, then SCT is imposed, and then VAT on top of
all that.
'It comes out at around 34 per cent, which is a staggering level of tax to
pay on any product,' he said. He also made the point that at a time when
governments were supposedly encouraging consumers to choose greener
products, and manufacturers to offer more environmentally-sound cars fitted
with high-cost catalytic converters, electronic management systems and the
like, it makes no sense for the UK government to push those products outside
many people's price range.
He estimates that removal of SCT would not only increase the new car market
by between 5 and 10 per cent 'which would be of enormous benefit to the
industry', but would also encourage more motorists to buy newer, more
fuel-efficient and cleaner cars.
However, a strong word of caution comes from Roger Macey, chairman of the
British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA). Though like others
in the motor industry he wants to see SCT removed, he insists that it must
be done on a phased basis.
He estimates that if new car prices come down by some 12 per cent then
overnight Pounds 1bn will be wiped off the residual values of Britain's used
cars - disastrous not only for the leading leasing and rental companies who
would see their inventory values slashed, but also for private companies
running their own fleets.
'These dramatic losses would undoubtedly drive many companies out of
business and the knock-on effect on the rest of the motor industry would be
enormous. Quite apart from anything else, with tens, perhaps even hundreds
of thousands of cars controlled by receivers, a period of great disruption
would follow,' he said.
'While the long-term benefit of the removal of Special Car Tax is in
everybody's interest, it has to be phased out gradually.'

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (12): Essential business
tool - The EC company car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE successive UK chancellors have sought to discourage the company car
through taxation increases well in excess of inflation, its popularity,
particularly as an executive perk, is growing apace in most European
countries.
At director level the widespread perception that the UK is somehow unique
for the profligacy with which 'perk' cars are dispensed is not standing up
to close scrutiny.
As an extensive study of the European company car scene by the Monks
Partnership makes clear, at director level there is a fairly small and
ever-narrowing difference in the extent of provision between the UK and some
leading Continental countries.
Only in Switzerland, among a total of 14 countries surveyed, does the level
of provision to directors fall significantly below 90 per cent. (Needless to
say, Swiss directors are in a better position than most to fund their own
cars out of salary.)
At managerial level the gaps, as might be expected, widen - but even here
provision is increasing, Monks partner Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt concludes.
The highest increase in popularity in recent years has occurred in France,
where 80 per cent more non-director senior managers were offered company
cars last year compared with 1989.
In Germany, which in unit terms has a larger company car market than the UK,
the level of provision to directors is now the same as in the UK, at 98 per
cent. Spanish middle managers, such as in sales or accountancy functions,
fare least well in comparison with their UK counterparts, with 49 per cent
being offered cars compared with 96 per cent in the UK, 86 per cent in the
Netherlands and 80 per cent in third-placed Germany. However, while the UK
proportion has actually dropped back marginally since 1989, only just over
one third of Spanish managers were receiving cars in the late 1980s.
Where UK business people do stand out - in company with their Spanish
colleagues - is in their penchant for running expensive cars. Even allowing
for exchange rate variations, in sterling terms the cars run by British
managers are the most expensive. Last year the average, at managing director
level, was Pounds 28,000 (Dollars 50,000) and at senior manager level,
Pounds 20,000.
In sterling terms, per-car spending on Spanish senior managers' vehicles was
even higher than in the UK, at Pounds 21,600. The managing director,
however, settled for one costing Pounds 26,500.
In comparison, German directors and managers appear positively modest at
average spending of Pounds 20,400 on the managing director's car and just
Pounds 14,600 on senior managers'.
This does not necessarily mean German managers are excessively self-denying
 -part of the difference is accounted for by varying purchase taxation
rates.
Whereas these, including VAT, total around 14 per cent on the German car,
British buyers, because of special car tax and higher (irrecoverable) VAT
pay around double the German rate.
In virtually all countries surveyed, the provision of free fuel for private
motoring - a blatant 'perk' if ever there was one - is the norm rather than,
as might be expected, the exception.
At director level, four out of five Germans with company cars receive it,
the Norwegians lead with 92 per cent, and even two-thirds of Swiss directors
also receive the benefit.
Middle managers in Norway fare much worse - provision is only about half the
level of directors, but in most countries the level of provision is still
well over two thirds.
In spite of the increasingly burdensome taxation regime in the UK, the Monks
survey, conducted after last year's Budget, concluded that there has been
little reduction in the level of allocation and that company cars are still
more prevalent throughout the corporate hierarchy than in any other
European, or indeed industrialised, nation.
This does not, however, prevent those operating within the UK vehicle
provision industry from complaining about the British tax burden. For
example, Mr Freddie Aldous, chairman and chief executive of TSB's Swan
National vehicle leasing and rentals group - and a leading light of ECATRA,
the European car and truck rental trade body - complains that UK company
cars are now 'greatly overtaxed' compared with many other EC states.
According to an analysis by Swan National, the assessed tax benefit to the
company car user of his private use of the vehicle is substantially higher
than in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands or Spain - the other
countries studied in the analysis.
The Swan figures examined only a slice of the sector, but the group argues
that it is by far the most important - cars of 1.6 to 1.8 litres; less than
four years old; in use by sales and marketing personnel and engineers, and
typically covering around 15,000 business miles and 5,000 private miles a
year.
Such a user, Swan's figures show, faces a Pounds 2,650 assessed taxable
benefit in the UK, compared with Pounds 2,400 in the Netherlands, Pounds
2,055 in Germany, only Pounds 1,250 in France and Italy and a lowly Pounds
950 in Spain.
'The government must recognise that the company car is an essential and
irreplaceable business tool,' says Mr Aldous.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (15): Discretion and
convenience - A French company's fleet management policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK FRATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCRETION and convenience are the watchwords of fleet management at Alcatel
Alsthom's headquarters in Paris. Cars and vans bought are most likely to be
French in France, German in Germany and British in the UK .
Decision-making is decentralised and conducted by each subsidiary rather
than strictly controlled from Paris. If there is an overall strategy, it is
to prioritise convenience and discretion - as well as to keep costs down.
Convenience in practice means that where Alsthom operates in the home
territory of a leading motor manufacturer its products are probably cheaper
and easier to service than those of a foreign producer with a small market
share. For the directors' cars local products also make for a lower profile.
As fleet manager for all Alcatel Alsthom's operations in Paris and the Ile
de France, Jean-Claude Rousson is responsible for handling the buying of
cars for directors at Alcatel's five main offices in the Paris region and
running a fleet of some 300 commercial vehicles, mostly light and
medium-sized vans. Autonomy for all subsidiaries means that he does not get
involved with the decisions for Alcatel Cable or any other division based in
the same area. He nevertheless is the person responsible for keeping the
board members on the road.
His operations break down into two distinct parts; the cars for the
directors and the commercial vehicles for the repair and maintenance teams.
The logic behind the division is a simple question of quantity of vehicles
and the tax treatment of them.
In France it is not possible to recover the VAT on directors' cars, but it
is deductible for the commercial fleet.
The commercial vehicles are bought through an annual tender process in lots
of typically between 50 and 100 units. Requests for tender submissions are
sent to all leading vehicle manufacturers, but the final choice has
consistently remained between Renault and Citroen. Peugeot misses out
because of its essentially passenger car range. Fine tuning of prices and
specifications are carried out after submissions have been received.
The directors, on the other hand, are allowed a healthy choice of cars and
tend to pick the top-of-the-range Citroen XMs and Peugeot 605s - a
reflection perhaps that the Renault 25, due for replacement this year, is
now looking a little tired. They are expected only to use company cars for
company business and have a car of their own for private use. Insurance,
maintenance and petrol are all paid by Alcatel.
Mr Rousson explains that in addition to the practical reasons of price and
servicing 'buying French is a group decision, but one without pressure. It
is simpler, but there is also a certain sentimentality (towards the French
marques).' His colleagues in foreign subsidiaries are not expected to import
French cars or to buy locally-sourced French-made vehicles.
Alcatel amortises the cost of its fleet over four years, but tends to keep
vehicles longer - up to six years. The vans clock up an average of 50,000km
a year. 'After that they are dead in terms of cost and usability,' says Mr
Rousson. 'We keep them all that long and the chairman sets a good example.'
The decision to buy rather than lease, Mr Rousson explains in terms of
price, even though leasing and long-term hire are gaining in popularity
among other fleet operators. 'We are able to amortise the cost,' he
explains. Diesel-engined vehicles for the van fleet 'cost more at the
beginning but that gives us more to amortise'. His relaxed position on
commiting so much capital to his vehicle fleet is perhaps one that companies
smaller than the giant Alcatel could not hold quite so easily.
Buyers are penalised by a number of special taxes. Cars attract France's 25
per cent luxury goods rate of VAT (18.6 per cent is the standard rate) and a
special Taxe sur les Voitures de Societe (TVS) that is calculated on the
mysterious puissance fiscale (fiscal value based roughly on engine size and
make), which adds an extra FFr5,700 (Dollars 1,053) to the cost of running
the smallest cars and FFr15,000 the largest. Users also have to pay a taxe
professionelle which varies from region to region.
While the majority of fleet operators are still buyers, the proportion has
been dropping since the mid-1980s and is now only 52 per cent, according to
the motoring weekly Auto Plus, as leasing and long rental become more
sophisticated. That challenge to the traditional modus operandi and the
possibility that European tax harmonisation might reduce the cost of company
motoring and, hence, increase fleet sizes has sparked a new interest in
fleet operation in France. At present only between 16 per cent and 23 per
cent of new cars, depending on the interpretation of the figures, are bought
for professional use - a rate considerably lower than that of the UK. But as
a sign that things are changing French fleet operators will next month be
able to attend Auto Flotte 1992, the first exhibition of its kind in France.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (14): Operators buck the
trend - Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOING against a trend which saw a slight downturn in overall Italian demand,
about 2.5 per cent more vehicles were delivered to the country's fleet
operators last year than in 1990. Though precise statistics are not
available, industry experts estimate that fleet operators took more than
400,000 new vehicles on to their books in 1991, equal to about 20 per cent
of Italy's total market.
The number of saloon cars bought by operators is estimated at 320,000. In
addition, Italian fleet operators purchased about 80,000 light vans, below
the half-ton threshold and mainly saloon derivatives.
Though fleet operators bought a large number of vans, figures from Turin
automobile-maker Fiat reveal significant bias towards the higher market
segments. Whereas segments E and D represent 16.9 and 22.4 per cent
respectively of total fleet purchases, these segments account for only 6 and
16 per cent of the total Italian market. At the other end of the scale,
segments A and B represent 9.8 and 44.5 per cent of the total automobile
market respectively, but only 6.3 and 24.8 per cent of fleet purchases.
The biggest fleet operator, with its flotilla of official cars, is the
public sector. In addition to the standard macchine blu (dark blue cars),
there are vehicles of sundry colours, some bearing rotating blue lights,
others carrying gun-toting law officers riding shotgun and others merely
displaying discreet official discs.
From ministries to state and quasi-state bodies, state-controlled
corporations and banks, and the local communal authorities, this part of
Italy's fleet market bought 120,000 vehicles last year. This was four times
greater than sales to car rental operators.
The largest single fleet operator in Italy, outside the military, is the SIP
state telephone corporation. Of its 40,000 vehicles, dispersed the length
and breadth of the Italian boot and on the islands, about 34,000 are Fiat
Pandas and derivatives. The remainder also carry 'made-in-Italy' badges, an
aspect that characterises virtually all the country's public sector fleets.
Indeed Fiat Group, comprising Fiat, Lancia, Autobianchi and Alfa Romeo, won
52 per cent of the total fleet segment last year. This was around five
points higher than the group's standing in the market overall.
But changes in purchasing preference appear to be under way. General Motors
has set the pace in this process. Two years ago it achieved the first sales
of imports to the public sector by selling Kadett and Astra station wagons
to the ENI state hydrocarbons holding corporation. Last year it sold Rascal
small vans to the electricity corporation ENEL and to two ministries. Rover,
with its Land Rover four-wheeled drive cross-country vehicle, also ranks
ENEL among its customers.
Importers also see opportunities at SIP. Indeed, while admitting that
nationally-built vehicles have precedence, fleet managers at the telephone
corporation say they have started to examine the ranges offered by
importers.
'The public sector is starting to open, with state bodies and corporations
being more willing to consider change than ministries. But importers have
only been able to erode Fiat's position with specialist vehicles for which
the Turin company cannot offer an alternative. It will be real progress when
importers sell their saloon models to the public sector,' says Elio Tiberi,
General Motors' fleet sales manager.
Since Fiat's acquisition of Alfa Romeo, there is concern about the monopoly
position that the Turin Group has won in domestic production. However, adds
Mr Tiberi, public sector purchasers are nevertheless subject to considerable
pressure to buy Italian.
Some industry experts believe that the group has been able to use its
position as sole national manufacturer when setting prices. Mr Tiberi notes
that importers generally offer between 10 and 12 per cent basic discount on
list prices, together with volume-related discounts of 6 per cent and more.
It is thought that, where it gives discounts to the public sector, Fiat
offers rather less.
But, as in other countries, Italy's fleet operators' choices are not
determined only by initial purchase price. Trade-in value is an important
factor. And this is giving a significant advantage to importers whose
increasing market share in Italy owes much to the attractiveness of model
ranges, as well as to competitive prices.
'Private sector businesses in Italy are lengthening their lists of staff
eligible for company cars and offering a choice of models. Usually staff opt
for the most attractive, which are often those with the highest re-sale
value. We emphasise the importance of re-sale when negotiating with
clients,' says Mr Tiberi.
That this aspect is increasingly an area of competition is confirmed by
Fiat. A spokesman notes that the group fixes buy-back prices on large fleet
contracts at the time of sale.
The maintenance factor is also attracting greater attention. 'In the past
imported cars had a reputation for poor and expensive spares supplies and
service networks. This is no longer true and all major imported makes offer
after-sales back-up that matches Italian makes,' says Mr Tiberi.
Maintenance is a top priority for fleet managers at SIP, whose vehicles,
which cover an annual total of about 370m kilometres, have a ceiling of
90,000km or nine years in service with the corporation. They are subject to
checks at intervals of six months or 2,500km and to full maintenance
servicing annually or after 10,000km.
In addition to employing several hundred of its own mechanics, SIP has
agreements with garages throughout Italy. 'Fiat's consolidated presence
through an enormous network provides the assurance of nationwide maintenance
service that SIP's widely-spread fleet requires,' says a senior executive at
the telephone corporation.
Though it contracts out a substantial part of its maintenance workload, SIP
owns the vehicles in its fleet. But more operators are deciding they do not
want responsibility for maintenance or for the many other aspects of fleet
management. Leasing and hiring are becoming more popular.
'Companies are able to axe whole departments and reduce their overheads. By
buying full service, they eliminate all the administrative details of
maintenance, repairs, insurance, vehicle licences, fines and many other
worries,' says a Fiat spokesman.
General Motors's Mr Tiberi agrees. 'Italy's high labour costs encourage
firms to look carefully for opportunities to cut payrolls. Hiring and
operational leasing offer practical solutions to the problem. The leasing
businesses established by the main car rental firms provide high efficiency
and cost containment.' Leasing and hiring are expected to expand
significantly as vehicle fleets in Italy continue their growth trend.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (13): Driving motivation
 -German policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANS love their cars, and executives and managers are no exception.
Big corporations and banks have fleets of vehicles to ferry their top
employees in a country where extensive driving is vital to doing business.
The same is true of government and public authorities, which also have
garages full of cars.
Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based metals, mining, engineering, and
chemicals group, has a fleet of 304 cars, which includes all the main German
car marques except Porsche, whose luxury sports cars hardly fit the role of
the sober executive.
The Metallgesellschaft cars are allotted to managers on a hierarchical basis
(accounting for a third of its fleet) and according to who drives the most.
Having weighed up the relative costs and benefits of leasing against
purchase, it favours purchase. Thus the company owns all its cars.
The cars in the Metallgesellschaft fleet do not include those of its
subsidiaries such as Lurgi, the big engineering company, and Kolbenschmidt,
which makes motor components. But the rules for executive and company cars
are roughly the same throughout the concern.
At Metallgesellschaft, the nine main board management directors all receive
a Mercedes-Benz 400 SEL, costing just over DM100,000. Although BMW has made
considerable inroads into the Mercedes domain with its sleek, attractive
7-series, it is still the Mercedes which is the German executive car par
excellence, especially with its new S-class, which came out last May and is
bigger and more expensive than its predecessor.
Below the management board, there are three hierarchical levels. The first
rank of managers is entitled to a Mercedes 300SE or BMW 730i. The next two
are allowed to have progressively less expensive cars from the ranges of
Mercedes, BMW, or Audi (the up-market Volkswagen subsidiary).
For employees who drive more than 25,000km (15,500 miles) a year, there are
four categories. Within these, the entitlement is to various models of BMW,
Ford, Opel (the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US) and Audi. All
Metallgesellschaft employees who receive a car can add their own money, if
they wish, to move up into the next level; they may not, however, edge into
the main directors' group. Since they would be contributing towards the
payment of a car that was not their own, and would thus get nothing back
when the car was sold, very few do trade up in this way.
The company will also pay a further 12 per cent over the list price of the
car an employee receives to cover any extra equipment desired such as
air-conditioning - highly desirable during the recent hot summers - or a
sun-roof.
Companies such as Metallgesellschaft do not just hand out company cars to
make their employees feel appreciated, although this is obviously a factor.
'It is a sort of motivation,' says Mr Horst Bogateck, the group's head of
administration. The main reason is to save time and ensure that top managers
can move quickly from place to place when necessary.
In Germany, there is no single dominating business centre. Because of its
highly decentralised economic structure, now extended with the addition of
eastern Germany through unification, a tremendous amount of time is spent on
the road. For some journeys, say between Frankfurt and Munich, it is quicker
to fly. Rail is also the better option for some routes, such as between
Frankfurt and Cologne or Frankfurt and Stuttgart.
Moreover, many companies are not in the main cities or towns at all.
Bertelsmann, one of the world's biggest media companies, is based in the
small northern town of Gutersloh, though it has important divisions in
Hamburg, Munich, and elsewhere. Germany's thousands of Mittelstand (small-
and medium-sized) companies, which are such a vital part of the economy, are
spread all over the country.
Metallgesellschaft changes its cars every four years or after 120,000km.
Last year, it bought 70 new cars at a cost of just over DM2m. Those cars
which are provided according to an employee's rank tend to do the full four
years, with the others reaching their kilometre level in less than three.
The cars driving the farthest distances are mostly accounted for by
Chemetall, a materials consultancy subsidiary of the group.
A company car does not mean a free ride for German employees, who are taxed
on 1 per cent of the car's list price (including extras) per month and also
on mileage covered for travelling to and from work. However, maintenance,
insurance, petrol, and other costs are taken care of, giving the user of
such a car considerable benefits. Each main board director has a driver,
with two others available when needed. The company also has 13 cars in a
general pool, consisting of vehicles whose users have retired, left, or
moved up the scale.
For Mercedes-Benz especially, the company fleet market is of vital
importance, although it is coy about saying just how much. The new S-class,
an increasingly common site as it purrs down German motorways, dwarfing most
other cars, has put the company back at the top of the executive class
market. In Germany, new S-class registrations went up by more than 40 per
cent in the first 11 months of last year, while those of the BMW 7-series
eased by just under 4 per cent. Some of these big limousines are bought by
independent businessmen or lawyers, dentists, and other wealthy people, but
company fleets account for a big chunk of their sales.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (10): Reward for safety -
Ways to cut claim rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME company car fleets have seen their accident claim rates drop by 39 per
cent compared with the previous year. They have seen their accident claim
costs fall by 29 per cent at a time when average claims costs have been
rising much faster than the rate of inflation.
Consequently, insurance premiums for those fleets have been reduced by about
Pounds 100 a vehicle.
The fleets experiencing these startling improvements are taking advantage of
the FIRMS (or Fleet Insurance and Risk Management Services) scheme,
introduced by the General Accident insurance group in 1988.
The FIRMS concept is very simple: if a company's management shows determined
commitment to a genuine safety culture and if drivers are educated to think
about safety, then the company's vehicle accident rate should improve. And
when it does, GA will reduce its insurance premiums.
Not only that, to show its faith in the idea, GA is paying towards the cost
of training - the insurance group's contribution (paid via a reduction in
the premium collected) was recently increased from Pounds 25 to Pounds 45 a
driver.
GA's initiative sprang from the appalling fact that more than one company
car in three will be involved in an accident this year and motor insurers
will deal with 4m claims.
In 1989 there was on average one death or injury per 41 company cars. The
claims frequency (expressed as the number of claims per 100 vehicles a year)
rose substantially during the 1980s and by 1988 stood at 43.5 per cent for
fleet vehicles compared with 33.5 per cent in 1985.
Yet fleet operators usually ignore this problem. When GA surveyed 1,000
fleets and asked whether they kept in-house records of car accidents, 92.2
per cent said they did. And 83.6 per cent said they analysed the records to
establish common factors. But, when asked whether they took any action as a
result, more than 75 per cent said 'no'.
The average cost of a damage-only accident in 1989 was Pounds 850 if social
costs such as police time are included. Mr David Crichton, GA's commercial
motor manager for the UK, says this is probably what an accident costs a
fleet operator if management time and inconvenience are taken into account.
'If a company's accountant found that more than Pounds 800 was being stolen
from the company on a regular basis, he would clamp down immediately. Why is
it the same approach is rarely taken on vehicle accidents?' Mr Crichton
asks.
He points out that there are now more than 3m company cars on British roads
travelling a total of 63bn miles a year. That is 40 per cent of the total
car mileage in Britain. 'Fleet managers could, therefore, collectively have
a tremendous influence on the national casualty figures,' he says.
'Most car fleet managers could do a great deal to reduce their fleets'
accidents. Perhaps the most important single measure would be to introduce
good quality driving training. It is not unusual for a fleet to find that
such driver training reduces its rate of accidents by more than 30 per cent,
provided it is backed up by a firm management commitment to an overall
coherent strategy to reduce accidents.'
Mr Crichton is backed by Mr Wayne Gardner, a director of BSM Health &amp;
Safety, one of about a dozen driver training organisations recommended by
GA. He points to a BP Oil division with 70 company cars and where the
accident rate has dropped to only 1.5 per cent since driver training was
started in 1988 and where management is taking road safety issues seriously.
(That 1.5 per cent compares with the previously-mentioned national accident
claims average of 43.5 per cent).
BSMHS offers a three-tiered scheme to fleets and clients can take their pick
from what is on offer. This includes 'workshops' for managers explaining how
they can take a pro-active approach to road safety; in-classroom training
for drivers covering behaviour and attitude; and a one-on-one accident
prevention course, using the client's vehicle, where the risks an individual
takes and how he or she deals with the risks caused by others are analysed.
A company taking the complete package would pay about Pounds 150 per driver.
Mr Gardner warns, however: 'You can't wave a magic wand. A bit of driver
training will not make all the problems go away.' But he insists attitudes
can be changed. BSMHS stresses that 'people have accidents because they take
risks with the company's asset.' Drivers are also reminded that the most
common cause of death of people between four years of age and 44 is road
accidents. 'For many people, being out in the company car is the most
dangerous part of any job, Mr Gardner points out.
Apart from giving grants towards driver training schemes, such as the BSMHS
one, the General Accident FIRMS package includes a free safety audit; free
'risk improvement' materials (handbooks on risk management, driver training,
and a video and booklet for lorry drivers); a free recovery help line as
well as a 'retro rebate scheme' for fleet operators sending more than half
their drivers on a GA-approved training course. They can have a proportion
of their premiums refunded retrospectively if their claims experience
improves.
Mr Crichton says: 'Most fleet operators in this country have an abysmal
record when it comes to taking measures to reduce accidents. We are often
asked to quote for fleets which have claim frequencies of 100 or 200 per
cent or more - just imagine, an average of two claims per car a year.'
He admits, however, that the biggest problem with car fleet risk management
is that people are usually recruited because they can do a particular job,
not because of their driving ability. 'This often means recruiting people
who are young, ambitious, confident and energetic - precisely the type of
person who tends to have a high threshold of risk (the amount of risk they
are prepared to accept in their lives.)'
The fact that more than half of Britain's company car drivers are now
'user-choosers' and can have the motor of their choice within certain budget
limitations, adds to the risk management difficulties. Younger drivers tend
to choose 'hot hatchbacks' which 'can be lethal in the hands of a youngster
who wants to show off'. Older, more senior, managers may want to go for
genuine high-performance cars without necessarily having the quick reactions
needed to control them safely.
Mr Crichton asks: 'Would it not be more sensible if the driver's abilities
were tested and then the driver was provided with a car which matched those
abilities?'
Then how do you discipline a good salesman with a poor accident record? Mr
Crichton suggests this situation is best tackled by offering a 'reward' for
safe driving so that the salesman 'wins' a better company car if he drives
for, say, two years without an avoidable accident. Drivers with particularly
bad accident records could be allocated pool cars which they would not be
allowed to take home.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (9): UK heads the EC
theft table - The latest vehicle security methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people have either experienced or know somebody who has experienced car
theft. That is a statistical probability, as demonstrated by the fact that
the UK leads the rest of the EC in the number of vehicle related thefts -
7.1 per 1,000 head of population, according to figures compiled by the
Insurance Service.
Compare that with the figures per head of population for France (4.2), Italy
(3.64) and Germany (1.14) and it is not hard to see why these crimes have
become such a hot topic for the motor industry, government and fleet
operators.
Among the UK Home Secretary's reactions to this growing problem was a
declaration of his intention to make 'joyriding' a criminal offence. The
resultant Aggravated Vehicle Taking Bill has now completed the committee
stage in the Lords, to be followed by a third reading in the Commons.
Furthermore, the Home Office this month launched its new Pounds 5m
initiative, Crime Prevention Year 1992. The intention is to involve the
public, as well as businesses, industries and organisations, in an attempt
to eradicate car crime.
Among those most seriously affected by these problems are companies such as
rental and leasing companies. which operate vehicles as their prime source
of revenue. For this reason, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing
Association (BVRLA) has over the past five years been operating an annual
award scheme for manufacturers it considers do the most to build into their
products deterrents to the thief. But progress appears to have been
disappointing.
Mr Freddie Aldous, BVRLA vice-chairman, says: 'As far as the majority of
companies are concerned, very little has been done, contributing to a
situation which is, at best, depressing. Manufacturers have a clear social
responsibility to ensure that cars, vans and trucks are made as difficult as
possible to be used illegally and action cannot be delayed any longer.'
Among the few exceptions, according to the BVRLA, has been Vauxhall, which
has won the award three times. When making its third presentation to
Vauxhall, the association congratulated the company for remaining a clear
leader in the field and for demonstrating that additional progress had been
made over the previous 12 months.
At present, Vauxhall fits deadlocks to five out its six car model ranges,
which the company claims account for more than 80 per cent of new Vauxhalls
now on sale. Immobilisers, too, are standard where alarms are fitted, such
as on higher level Astras, Cavaliers and Carltons, plus all Calibras and
Senators. Vauxhall claims this accounts for 25 per cent of all its cars.
Among Vauxhall's other security measures are the provision of car stereo
units with either removable displays or, on the new Astra, displays which
are located separately from the control unit and payment to its dealers for
etching on every window surface the registration number of all new cars and
vans.
Renault, too, is taking steps to make its vehicles more secure. The company
has initiated a programme whereby its complete range of high-performance
cars will be protected by the Renault Anti-theft Protection System. This is
a key-operated engine ignition inhibitor, hidden within the car, although a
dashboard light shows the system is in operation and there are windscreen
logos to warn the potential thief.
The new device was introduced with the recent launch of the Renault Clio
16-valve. It has since been phased in on the 16V and Cabriolet versions of
the Renault 19, 21 Turbo and 21 Turbo Quadra, plus Alpine GTA.
In addition, Renault's Bureau des Etudes in France is evaluating a new
vehicle security device known as Verrou Logiciel (literally: 'digital lock')
for lower-specification models. Due for introduction in the UK towards the
end of the year, this is an electronically-controlled keypad, located in the
passenger compartment, on which the driver has to key in a numbered code
before the car's engine management system can be 'unlocked'. According to a
Renault spokesman, one of the options under evaluation is that of linking
this device to the Renault 'Plip' remote control system for the central
locking, so that one beam from the driver's key ring allows both the doors
to be unlocked and the engine to be started.
Meanwhile, at BMW (GB) - which has received a commendation from the BVRLA
security award judging panel - a call was made in November for the removal
of car tax and VAT from engine immobilisers, to reduce retail prices and
encourage consumer demand.
'Should the Treasury support the Home Office by adopting tax incentives, BMW
would respond with 100 per cent fitment of immobilisers as soon as
practically possible,' promised Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB).
He adds that in September the Home Secretary asked manufacturers to fit
deadlocks, visible chassis numbers and immobilisers to new vehicles. While
BMW has been fitting deadlocks to all its models since 1988 and visible
chassis numbers since September last year, he believes that, without these
tax incentives, 100 per cent fitment of immobilisers would be mean too large
an increase in car retail prices in a recession.
The Whitehall view is that the complexities of implementing such tax
incentives - and the fact that they would have to be initiated not by the
Home Office, but by the Treasury which has other priorities - make this an
unlikely event during Car Crime Prevention Year.
However, BMW has responded to the Home Office's initiative by announcing a
Pounds 1m car security programme, to run from February 24 to March 20 this
year. While there is still no commitment on fitting immobilisers, the scheme
includes a free car security audit at a BMW Dealer, a BMW approved
anti-theft system fitted for half the normal retail price and enhancements
to the deadlocking system on eight older BMW 5 and 7 Series models.
Fleet operators, though, have already been given a financial incentive to be
security-conscious by the Association of British Insurers, which has
regrouped car insurance ratings, to make higher-performance cars, and others
more likely to fall prey to criminals, more expensive to insure.
Consequently, fleet operators are facing large rises in premiums on these
cars, and some may decide not to issue them to their staff. Since a
significant proportion of sales of these cars are to companies, this may
produce a noticeable reduction in the number on the roads. If so, it could
be a partial solution to the problem.

<TEXT>
PREMIUMS were increased during the past year in line with the predictions of
brokers and insurers. Although the recession means that claims are down
overall, claims costs per vehicle mile are still moving upwards.
Several factors contribute to this trend, including rising repair costs for
vehicle damage, rising court awards for personal injuries, higher value of
equipment inside vehicles and increased incidence of theft and fire. Coming
at a time of poor general underwriting results, these trends have forced
insurers to impose premium increases of 25 per cent or more on some
policyholders, though competition remains fierce for what John Pegnall, of
Norwich Union, calls the 'blue chip' fleets with the best loss records.
Most insurers report a substantial difference in claims experience between
the good and bad risks. Premium levels for the good ones have been pegged
more or less to the rate of inflation, but overall, according to Mr Pegnall,
the market is less concerned about market share and more determined to
charge realistic rates. Royal Insurance, the market leader, has taken a very
hard line this year. After some years of unprofitable business in this
sector, its stance has been that there is a correct premium for each risk,
based on underwriting for a profit. As a result, Royal has lost a
significant amount of business.
The hardening of the insurance market has led, according to Chris Palmer of
Zurich International (UK), to a switch in the debate from premium levels to
value added and guaranteed service standards. Independent market research
for Zurich suggests that fleet operators place service standards marginally
ahead of price in their criteria for selecting insurance cover. The finance
director of one haulage company described the claims handling service as
'absolutely vital'. When repairs take several days to be approved, the lost
revenues from vehicles off the road far outweigh some of the premium
discounts on offer from less efficient insurers.
Larger insurers see their nationwide, and even international, spread of
offices with authority to settle claims as a key element in what they have
to offer. 'Cheapest is not necessarily best,' says Ray Morley, of Commercial
Union. 'If I charge half as much as another company, but keep your vehicles
off the road twice as long, that would be a very poor deal for you.'
Nevertheless, insurers cannot afford to ignore the financial pressure that
their customers are under. They are therefore looking for ways to help keep
the costs down. Few are recommending a switch from comprehensive to
third-party-only insurance, except for the largest fleet owners, who can
afford to carry much larger risks on their balance sheets. For small fleets,
third party cover would be very poor advice, according to Mr Morley.
Instead, Commercial Union, like many of its competitors, is looking to risk
management and larger excesses or deductibles, to control policyholders'
costs. There has been a general trend to move from 100 to 250 excesses per
claim, with excesses of 500 and more among larger fleets. Some companies
require drivers to pay these excesses wherever a claim arises, to
concentrate their minds, although one broker fears that this could lead to
drivers not reporting all accidents.
One of the UK's largest fleets, NFC, which self-insures its fleet of 12,000
vehicles under a government bond, last year doubled the deductibles it
imposes on the individual companies in the group. These now stand at 5,000
third party and 10,000 damage, for heavy vehicles, and at 20,000 third party
and 100 per cent self-insurance for damage, for cars. Graham Lee, of NFC,
sees a clear message in this: 'The closer you can get the manager writing
the cheque to the accident, the better your cost control.'
On the risk management side, Mr Lee emphasises the need in a recession to
keep vehicles in A1 condition, to keep claims costs down. With the weight of
legislation, he feels that 'running a fleet of vehicles is getting like
running a fleet of aircraft. Maintenance has to be 100 per cent; 99.9 per
cent is not good enough.'
Derick Perkins, of Fleet Management Services, points to another aspect of
cost control, arguing that policyholders should watch out for insurers
offering deflated prices for vehicles that are written off, and that many
operators are still paying well over the odds for insured repairs.
General Accident has increased its training grants for advanced driver
training, extended the scheme indefinitely into the future and opened it to
people not initially insuring through GA. Other insurers have put more
emphasis on providing information to policyholders, seeing this as crucial
to loss control.
Dudley Brown, of brokers Alexander Stenhouse, argues that some of the fleets
which carry only catastrophe level insurance are not properly measuring
their losses. 'If you can't measure it, you can't manage it,' he says.
Better use of databases can help operators to identify the causes of
accidents and make informed judgments about the cost effectiveness of
prevention measures, like controlling who is allowed to drive the vehicles
in leisure periods, drivers' minimum ages and technologies such as
anti-theft devices.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (6): Switch to diesel
cuts cost of fuel bills - Profile of DHL International (UK)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR express company DHL International (UK) operates a vehicle fleet of some
230 company cars, nearly 290 vans and 25 trucks.
Together, they cover around 16m miles a year and generate a fuel bill of
between Pounds 800,000 and Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.8m). Any savings area can
therefore make a significant difference to the company's overall operational
costs. As a result, DHL has just decided to change around half of its all
petrol-engined car fleet to diesel-powered models. The company expects the
move to reduce fuel costs by more than Pounds 30,000 a year.
'We did look at the possibility of using diesel cars several years ago,'
says DHL fleet manager, Clive Gardner. 'In fact, I was using one at that
time. There were savings to be made but at that point it was felt a change
to diesels would be too demotivating for staff and the idea was ruled out.
'Since then, though, the quality and performance of diesel cars has improved
a lot. At the same time, recent general economic pressures have encouraged
the company to look very closely at all costs.'
That review has led to a company decision to replace the high-mileage cars
used by sales personnel, typically Ford Orions, Escorts and Sierras, plus
Rover 216 and 416 models, with diesel-engined versions.
Apart from savings on fuel costs, says Mr Gardner, the diesel-engined cars
also tend to produce better resale prices. Initial buying costs are higher,
he adds, but overall the pence per mile costs work out lower.
Mr Gardner believes that in addition to current considerations, there are
also longer-term reasons for switching over to diesel cars. 'There seems to
be a growing feeling in the motor industry that the government is moving
towards introducing further tax concessions for diesel cars. And with the
coming of the EC single market, I think moves will be made to reduce our
diesel fuel prices to bring them more in line with those on the Continent.'
DHL has an advantage over many company car users considering a switch to
diesel in that it already has considerable experience of that type of engine
through its van and truck operations. The company is running a fleet of 286
diesel-engined vans for its collection and delivery activities.
Around 70 per cent of that van fleet are Ford Escorts, mainly 1.8 diesels,
and 25 per cent are Ford Transits. More recently, the company has introduced
Volkswagen Transporters, both 2.4 and 1.9 diesels, to replace some of the
Escorts. 'The payload of the Volkswagens is about 25 per cent greater than
that of the Escorts and with our express traffic growing last year, we
needed the extra capacity,' explains Mr Gardner.
At one time, DHL used to buy all its own vehicles but within the past couple
of years it has changed over to using lease purchase arrangements for its
vans and the cars. The basic reason for that change, says Mr Gardner, was a
financial one. 'With outright purchase, we were tying up a lot of capital.
Using lease purchase arrangements we have been able to release that capital
for other purposes.'
But DHL does still buy its heavy goods vehicles. The 25-strong fleet
comprises mainly Ford Cargos, plus a few Mercedes. 'With these vehicles, we
found the financial advantage was in favour of purchase,' adds Mr Gardner.
DHL has 27 locations around the UK but most of its vehicles are based at the
company's main operational centre at Orbital Park, Hounslow, near Heathrow
Airport.
Unlike many vehicle users who have opted to hand over their maintenance and
general fleet management activities to third parties, DHL remains committed
to controlling those operations in-house.
The actual maintenance work is carried out by local garages and service
centres but their work is closely monitored by DHL. That monitoring process
has been further tightened up as part of the company's general move towards
achieving British Standards BS 5750 quality accreditation.
Explaining the policy of keeping fleet management control in-house, Mr
Gardner claims DHL has well-established computerised systems, based on the
use of a Car Fleet Control System fleet management package, for identifying
and monitoring running costs such as maintenance.
'If we did not have the tools to handle that side of things properly then it
might make sense to contract out the fleet management function. But if you
can identify the costs yourself and control them, then why pass on the job
to someone else?'
DHL has also developed a system for analysing and monitoring the causes of
accidents involving its vehicles. Drivers involved fill in various data
boxes at the bottom of an accident report form and that information is then
analysed to see what factors emerge.
The results can subsequently be used to help train drivers in ways of
avoiding such accidents in future, regardless of whether or not they were to
blame. According to Mr Gardner, that training has helped to reduce DHL's
fleet accident rate by nearly 50 per cent over the past four years.
As far as insurance is concerned, DHL has a global policy of only insuring
its vehicles on a third party basis. In addition to helping keep down
premiums, Mr Gardner believes that policy also helps to put over the message
to all personnel that they have a responsibility to keep down costs.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (8): Cashing in on a
greener image - Profile of Gateway Foodstores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK SEMPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GATEWAY Foodstores, with 1,100 cars in the fleet, is contributing to a
steady rise in the popularity of diesels. It started buying diesels in
earnest in August last year, and now has 200.
The retailer was already considering a move to diesels, especially in the
mid-range of its fleet, to reduce costs and improve reliability, when a
corporate commitment to environmental improvement swung the balance in
favour of switching to an all-diesel policy, across the fleet. The 'green'
benefit will come from reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
Brian Tomlin, commercial manager, sees diesels giving clear advantages over
petrol in other areas. Reliability emerged as a key issue. Niggling faults,
especially on electricals, start to creep in on petrol cars after about
60,000 miles, and garages do not seem to know enough about the vehicles to
cope with them efficiently and the risk of unit failure increases
significantly after 80,000 miles, he says. The company had extended petrol
car mileages from a maximum of 75,000 to 85,000.
Mr Tomlin says that while that is uncomfortably high for petrol cars, 'we
don't feel at all at risk, operationally, taking diesels up to 3.5 years or
85,000 miles'. Once the firm has more experience of the cars, these limits
could be extended to 100,000 or more.
Mr Tomlin feels much safer on residual values with diesels: 'You can get the
fright of your life from Glass's Guide, looking at what happens to trade
prices for petrol cars between 50,000 and 100,000 miles.' Diesels, on the
other hand, remain popular and retain strong residuals, right up to 100,000
miles.
The classic means of retaining high residuals is to replace cars at least as
frequently as every 40,000 miles. 'However, this leaves you exposed to heavy
capital demands, if you want to extend vehicle life temporarily, then go
back to frequent changes,' Mr Tomlin says.
Overall, he expects maintenance costs to be around 5 per cent lower using
diesels, in spite of slightly more frequent oil and filter changes. Costs
are about the same up to 40,000 miles, but start to creep up on petrol cars
after that.
The biggest cost savings are on fuel, and come at the heart of the fleet
market, the medium-sized saloons. Gateway was running 400 Sierra 1.6
petrol-engined cars - admittedly not the most frugal in its class -
returning an average fuel consumption of 30 miles per gallon (mpg). The
Sierra replacements, the Peugeot 405 and BX 19 diesels, both with the
increasingly popular PSA XUD turbo and naturally aspirated engines, are
giving around 45 mpg.
Not only are these cars using less fuel, but diesel can be substantially
cheaper than petrol - typically three pence a gallon in winter, and up to 16
pence a gallon the rest of the year. (Diesel prices are more subject to
seasonal fluctuations because of strong demand for fuel oil in winter.)
Overall, Mr Tomlin believes that company car fuel bills would fall by 40 per
cent across the fleet, given an instant change from all-petrol to
all-diesel.
This substantial saving derives partly from the concentration of
middle-sized cars. At the top and bottom end, percentage fuel savings are
more marginal.
Many diesel models continue to be priced higher than petrol equivalents, and
it can take 25-30,000 miles to recoup the extra with savings on fuel. The
differences in price exist for marketing, rather than engineering reasons,
and the gaps will close, Mr Tomlin predicts.
He sees other drawbacks with diesels. They are noisier, especially when cold
and at low revs, and this irritates some drivers. 'The gap between diesel
and petrol has narrowed, but I don't see that anyone will ever mistake the
two types of engine.'
In making the switch, Gateway has sweetened the pill by widening the choice
of marques available to its drivers. As the company gains experience of
diesels, the range will probably be narrowed to three or four makes for most
employees, to concentrate purchasing power.
There is still not nearly enough choice at the top end of the market, Mr
Tomlin says. The Mercedes-Benz 300D is offered to executives who previously
had larger Mercs, Jaguars and the BMW 7-series, but it is considered by some
to have too small a cabin. The BMW 525 diesel turbo, due by September, will
make a welcome addition to the available options.
Diesel poses problems, at present, to employees at the lowest tax bracket.
The Citroen AX with the 1360 engine is offered to drivers who previously had
Escort 1300s.
Mr Tomlin is concerned, too, at the lack of automatic options. for the time
being, the only option for many drivers is the Citroen BX.
Gateway buys its cars and services a third of them at its own workshop in
Bristol, which trades as Hartcliffe Motors. Already, the diesels are proving
simpler and cheaper to service, Mr Tomlin enthuses. Elsewhere, and
especially in London, the company is having a proportion of servicing done
by independent, rather than franchised, workshops.
Diesels have, until now, been sold short in Britain by market leaders Ford
and Vauxhall, which have treated them as second-division products, Mr Tomlin
believes. Peugeot and Citroen, with their XUD engines, found themselves
holding the key to a niche market, and the rest of the market is only now
responding. 'The diesel market is set to take off, for sound engineering,
cost and environmental reasons,' he says.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (7): New look to the car
park - Profile of National &amp; Provincial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK SEMPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'busy bee' building society, National &amp; Provincial, has scrapped its
conventional company car system, under which it owned 400 cars. Instead, it
has introduced a radical programme of cash allowances, and loans to every
'company car' driver to buy whatever he or she wishes.
The new scheme was launched last October and already the car park at the
headquarters in Bradford looks radically different. Gone is the
concentration of recently-registered stalwarts from the fleet market, in
N&amp;P's case Jaguar for senior executives, then Rover 800, Vauxhall, and, at
the bottom end, Ford.
There is now a liberal mix of vehicles: more drivers, free from punitive tax
bands, have gone for cars with engines of more than 2 litres; there is an
unusually high proportion of estates, for the family; and you can see a few
Land Rover Discoverys, a popular all-rounder in rural Yorkshire. 'Cars have
become a matter for individual choice - as they should be,' Paul Chapman,
director of business and organisation development, explains.
The switch to the new system has several main objectives, but cost reduction
is not one, Mr Chapman says. Most importantly, the company wanted 'to get
rid of the status thing which surrounds company cars'.
They have long been an unnecessary source of conflict between 'haves' and
'have-nots'. Also, even among those who have company cars, the perceived
benefit varies from one employee to another, especially as the workforce
becomes more mixed, and is no longer dominated by prototype male
breadwinners.
Basic administration was a burden on the company - not a great one, but the
buying, selling, insurance, processing of claims and so on distracts from
the main business.
The new system of cash allowances will allow N&amp;P to respond more effectively
to further changes in the tax structure of company cars.
N&amp;P's 400-strong fleet was split evenly between those which were primarily
perks, or 'benefit cars', and 'need' cars, supplied to staff such as
salesmen and valuers for whom a car is essential.
The benefit cars were on a three-year, 60,000 miles replacement cycle, while
the need cars were renewed after two years or 40,000 miles. These are now
the starting points for working out individual cash allowances. They are
calculated by taking the retail price of the car allocated to the employee's
grade within the company, the 'benchmark value', adding the estimated
straight line depreciation, maintenance and other costs, then deducting the
net tax saving for the individual.
The allowance is paid monthly, grossed up for tax. It is shown as a separate
item, although it could, logically, be consolidated with the salary. That
might be moving too far ahead of the market, however. 'We would want to see
what our competitors are offering, before we made that decision,' says Mr
Chapman.
The company offers employees four-year loans towards the cost of the car,
again related to the benchmark value, and tax-free up to the first Pounds
10,000 - the limit for tax-free loans under the society's rules.
Employees can benefit by buying second-hand and saving on depreciation,
something which would be much less acceptable as a company fleet policy.
Chapman's own car is a good example. Under the old scheme, he would have
been due a new Jaguar, reflecting his senior status in the company. In fact,
he has bought a sporty two-year-old Toyota Supra. List price, new, is Pounds
26,000 but he bought his from a local dealer for Pounds 13,000, with the
warranty extended for a further four years.
Not only does he have a car he prefers, he will gain financially. The car
had already suffered its heavy depreciation when he bought it, and by the
end of the third year, say, the car will be worth substantially more than
the value of the outstanding loan.
The cash allowance scheme is being closely monitored, Mr Chapman says, and
each driver's circumstances are reviewed every six months. Adjustments may
be made to the scheme, for example, to give employees a degree of protection
against the sharp depreciation in the first two years of a new car.
Any direct financial benefit to the society is marginal, and cost savings
were not the object of the change, Mr Chapman said. There should be cost
savings to the 'company car' economy as a whole, as employees are likely to
look after their vehicles more carefully. Many are expected to be passed on
to spouses, or other relatives.
Surprisingly, perhaps, employees are paying little more, in the present
economic climate, than N&amp;P was, either for new cars or for servicing. N&amp;P
has left its fuel payment system unchanged, to avoid making an already
complicated change more difficult. Those with cars on a 'need' basis claim
back fuel expenses, while those using cars as benefits use Dial fuel cards.
The principles behind the cash allowances scheme can be applied for a wider
range of company perks - car parking, low-cost mortgages and pension fund
contributions could eventually come up for review, for much the same reasons
as the car fleet system has been overhauled.
Mr Chapman believes the new scheme gives N&amp;P a slight edge in recruiting
good new staff. In spite of some initial misgivings, 'it has gone down quite
well, especially as people have come to recognise the individual
responsibility and choice involved', he says.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (5): Wide choice of cars
for employees - Profile of Johnson Matthey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY offers its employees a very wide range of company cars from
which to choose. Even the most junior employee entitled to a company car has
a choice from about 75 models from nine manufacturers. But, as might be
expected from the world's largest platinum group metals marketing
organisation, the company stipulates that every car must be fitted with an
anti-pollution catalyst.
Automotive catalysts are now the biggest consumers of platinum metals and
JM, which is one of the largest catalyst producers, has many of the world's
motor companies among its customers.
So virtually every car manufacturer offering cars with catalysts in the UK
is on JM's list of approved vehicles.
This list was extended two years ago and other changes made to ensure more
employees received cars of their choice. JM allocates cars on an
hierarchical basis but has blurred the lines between categories by
permitting employees to contribute some of their own cash towards company
cars. An employee can add up to an extra 10 per cent to the monthly cost to
get a better car. Employees pay the extra by way of a 'private use' charge.
Mr Terry Stock, JM's group personnel controller, says: 'Providing cars is an
expensive benefit - we spend about Pounds 2m a year - yet two years ago
people were complaining because they could not have the cars they wanted. It
made sense to change the system slightly so that, at no extra cost, they
could have the cars they wanted.' However, like many other companies, JM
frequently reviews its company car operations and Mr Stock says there is no
guarantee the system would not be changed if there were substantial savings
from having a less-flexible approach.
Already the impact of the recession has forced a change of policy and JM's
cars are now increasingly being retained for four years or 60,000 miles
instead of the three years or 60,000 which was the norm until recently.
'Modern cars can run for 80,000 miles with no trouble,' Mr Stock explains,
'but keeping a car for four years is stretching it a bit when it comes to
employee satisfaction.'
So, would JM switch back to a three-year policy when the economy picks up?
'I would not expect an immediate return,' he says. 'But the change will
probably be market-driven. When other companies move back to three years, we
may have to follow.' Mr Stock says the Chancellor's introduction of National
Insurance charges on the assumed financial benefit of company cars means JM
will hold as firmly as possible to the present 'benchmark' costs. So, when
car prices go up, employees might find the vehicle of their choice has moved
into a higher category.
The successively fierce increases in the personal tax charged on company car
benefits have caused some JM employees to ask for the benefit to be provided
by some other means. Typically these are employees whose spouses also have
company cars and who do not want to pay the tax on both. Mr Stock says that
requests for a change in the benefit are dealt with on an individual basis.
JM once bought all its company cars for cash. However, in 1984 it completed
a sale-and-leaseback arrangement with Avis and in August of that year signed
a contract hire deal with that company.
In the intervening years Avis has had several changes of management and even
an ownership change. There have also been times when its performance slipped
below what JM considered was the minimum level. So there have been occasions
when competing companies were asked to quote and individual operating units
within JM considered moving away from Avis.
But Avis Lease and Fleet Management still has the contract - a full-service
agreement covering all JM's 378 cars. Mr Stock says: 'I suppose it is a
question of 'better the devil you know'. But Avis understands us and has
worked with us and has responded well to criticism in the past.'
He says JM tries to have as little as possible internal involvement with
operating the car fleet. Nevertheless, he spends some of his time at group
headquarters setting policy - which must be agreed by JM's chief executive's
committee - while each operating unit has a fleet manager to provide liaison
between employees and Avis.
Employees are expected to look after their company cars and there have been
cases where people have been disciplined for failing to do so.
When employees have what Mr Stock calls 'driving problems', they are sent
for special driving tuition offered as part of the Avis package.
There is an unwritten rule at JM that employees cannot choose sports cars or
off-road vehicles unless they can make out a very good case for having them.
Mr Stock says nobody at JM has complete freedom of choice of car. The
remuneration committee of the board has to approve vehicles used by the
company's senior management. A few big executive cars are bought outright by
the company, 'although we're looking at leasing now'.
At the other end of the scale, the 'benchmark' car costs JM Pounds 327.66 a
month. It is a Vauxhall Cavalier, four-door 1.8 litre - with a catalyst, of
course.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (2): New business
difficult to find - The contract hire and leasing industry has been
shrinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's vehicle contract hire and leasing industry has been shrinking in
the recession. The most spectacular example of rationalisation has been
provided by the T Cowie group which in November snapped up the Royal Bank of
Scotland's loss-making Royscot subsidiary for Pounds 38m. Cowie also snapped
up the assets of Centre Contracts, previously part of the John Martin car
retailing group in Edinburgh, for about Pounds 300,000, and Ringways
Contract Hire in Leeds for Pounds 2m.
Several other small contract hire companies are up for sale because they
find it almost impossible to make a living in present market conditions. All
this might bring problems for their clients.
Dozens of small companies elbowed their way into the contract hire industry
in the late 1980s when business was booming. Many of them based their prices
on the car residual values being achieved at the peak and they are feeling
real pain today because most residual values have remained flat for nearly
two years.
One contract hire company which was approached recently by a number of
smaller rivals said an analysis of the residual values of the cars on their
books showed that 'if we took on those companies, we'd lose fortunes'.
Accountancy in contract hire being what it is, most companies can 'roll
forward' their mistakes in assessing residual values - as long as new
business keeps coming in. Unfortunately for them, since Britain's car-buying
boom ended dramatically in 1990, new business has been hard to find.
'The industry is very short of new business and it is very hard to make a
living as a small contract hire company,' says Mr Roger Macey, chairman of
the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association and a director of
Commercial Union Insurance's FMM Group.
Competition is incredibly intense, he says, 'and contract hire prices are
not going up as they realistically should'.
The lack of new business is not a total disaster, of course. It means in
most cases that customer companies are simply extending the life of
individual contracts and keeping the vehicles longer, typically for four
instead of three years.
This brings some headaches for the contract hire company. Maintenance costs
are bound to rise as cars get older and high-mileage cars are very difficult
to sell. Mr Macey points out: 'The irony is that manufacturers are making
cars that are more reliable and will last for at least 80,000 miles. But
people don't want to buy a car with 80,000 miles on the clock.'
Mr Macey says some of the newer contract hire companies grew up in the 1980s
and assumed that new car prices would continue to rise, pulling used-car
prices up with them. 'But for the past 18 months residual values have been
absolutely flat. The gap between new car and used car prices is becoming
wider and wider.'
A simple example of the impact on the industry is as follows: a company
bought a car three years ago for Pounds 10,000 and assumed a residual value
in 1992 pounds of Pounds 4,500. In present conditions the car is unlikely to
fetch more than Pounds 4,000, thus all profit on that particular contract is
eliminated.
Mr Macey points out that, because contracts usually run for three years and
as the industry's most recent glory days did not end until 1989, there are
still two years of painful financial results to come through.
At the same time, even if, as many predict, the UK new car market picks up
in the second half of this year, the improvement will not make itself felt
on contract hire companies' balance sheets until 1995.
He also warns that the industry must not assume car prices will rise
steadily through the 1990s. There are a number of important factors in the
offing which are likely to conspire to keep a lid on UK car prices. These
include the report on car pricing by the UK Monopolies and Mergers
Commission which has just been published and which the Trade and Industry
Secretary is at present mulling over.
Meanwhile, the European Commission is urging harmonisation of taxes and the
UK government might well pay heed. The UK-based car producers have certainly
been campaigning hard for a reduction in the total tax on new cars.
Then in 1995 the so-called 'block exemption' given to the car makers by the
European Commission comes to an end. This is the system which enables them
to have exclusive dealer networks - the Commission previously considered
that it was in the public interest, particularly when it came to the safety
that comes from having cars serviced properly, for these exclusive dealer
networks to continue. If the Commission changes its mind, car retailing in
Europe will undergo a massive shake-up.
As for customers, most hire contracts contain clauses which enable users to
'escape' should the worst happen and the contract hire concern go into
liquidation.
However, previous experience suggests that users suffer when contract hire
companies get into trouble. For example, if a contract hire concern does not
pay its maintenance and repair bills on time, the impact is felt by its
clients. Client companies lose the use of their cars if the vehicles are
kept off the road when the contracted garage refuses to do the necessary
repair or maintenance work because its bills have not been paid.
Mr Robert Blower, T Cowie's corporate communications manager, says that
already contract hire customers are putting much more emphasis on the
financial stability of potential car suppliers when choosing between them.
'Last year was very damaging for contract hire companies and 1992 will be
even worse for many in the industry, particularly those which rely on car
residual values for their profits,' he says.
Cowie is not dependent on residuals for profit, he points out. 'We compete
on quality of service, not price.' Overheads are kept to a minimum. For
example, at the time of the takeover, Royscot had 83 people looking after
6,000 cars while Cowie had 250 for 55,000. 'This enables us to make money
while others are losing it.'
Cowie's three acquisitions last year has taken the total of vehicles it has
on hire to corporate clients to more than 60,000, making it by far the
largest business of its kind in the UK.
Mr Blower says the takeovers came only after Cowie completed extensive
research and found that 'the contract hire industry has a good future'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (3): Something in it for
everybody - The pros and cons of fleet management companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the main pre-occupations of fleet operators is the pros and cons of
hiring a fleet management company to run their vehicles. But how many fleet
operators make use of such companies?
According to a survey* of company car schemes, an external fleet management
company is most commonly used by fleets of more than 100 vehicles (one third
of fleets of that size band responding to the survey said they do so).
However, a significant (although lower) percentage of companies running
fewer vehicles also declared they use the services of an outside fleet
management company.
The reason there is something in it for everybody is because fleet
management is by its very nature a bespoke service; ranging from a one-off
fleet 'health check' to full-time, hands-on vehicle management by outside
experts. There is no doubt that managing a fleet today has become a highly
sophisticated operation, with even greater cost penalties than ever before
to be paid for errors and oversights. But can a fleet operator's own staff,
however competent they are, be expected to perform this task unaided?
There are many specialist companies offering increasingly sophisticated
support systems to fleet managers. As well as the external fleet management
companies, handling as many areas of operation as the client requires, there
are software houses offering packages for the fleet operator's personnel to
run in-house, which are often tailored to meet individual needs.
According to Mike Newing, general manager of Kalamazoo Logistics, when fleet
operators are evaluating computerised vehicle management systems, they must
be aware that software comes in different forms, to run on a variety of
hardware and perform a whole panoply of tasks.
'Fleet operators need to examine their requirements and determine exactly
how much they want to spend on a computer system,' he advises. 'However,
they must recognise that running a fleet is a high cost activity.'
Just as an example, Kalamazoo's Profleet system costs from Pounds 3,000,
with the end user simply supplying some form of PC to run it on. From there
prices rise according to the sophistication of the system and the way it is
run, up to packages for mainframe users with networks linking operational
centres round the country, as in the case of some of Kalamazoo's larger
customers.
But, says Mr Newing, today's software is user friendly and adaptable to
individual customers' needs: 'Most of the software that's available these
days is designed for people who are not necessarily computer experts, nor
necessarily fleet managers.
'In addition, with customised software, you can break your company down by
your organisation so you can look at costs incurred by your fleet with your
in-house system based on the organisation of your company - and not just a
reflection of overall vehicle costs. It is almost impossible for a third
party company servicing a large number of other customers to provide
information based on all their organisations. You can imagine the logistical
nightmare that would involve for the supplier.'
Naturally enough, Derek Cant, Avis Fleet Management's director, believes
that a professional fleet management company can offer a number of vital
services, some of which cannot be achieved by an in-house operation.
'Clients can choose to have a vehicle acquisition programme, maintenance of
vehicles while they are in service - plus any number of ancillary services,
such as an accident management programme, advice on the best funding method,
fuel cost management, or access to daily rental vehicles - right through to
the point at which the customer's vehicle becomes an asset to be disposed
of,' explains Mr Cant.
'And we are consistently able to obtain a better net return on used vehicles
than the end users are themselves. Many fleet operators can perform
administrative disposal quite adequately, but that is a long way from
ensuring the vehicle is sold at the right time and in the right way, to
realise its optimum re-sale value.'
According to Mr Cant, end users benefit also from professional advice on
vehicle acquisition: 'It is remarkable how many fleets continue to include
vehicles in their car policies, based on a very simplistic and dangerous
comparison of capital costs. Arguably, it is more critical to look at what a
vehicle's re-sale prospects are, as well as fuel and maintenance costs.'
And costs of all sorts, as well as how to control them, are indeed the key
considerations when a fleet operator is deciding how the vehicles are to be
managed.
Even though a fleet operator's in-house staff are doubtless perfectly
capable of identifying any cost areas producing problems, does sophisticated
software alone equip them to deal with problems such as work poorly done, or
unnecessary maintenance work? And do they have the same clout with suppliers
of products and services as a fleet management company which buys these in
great volume all the time on behalf of its clients?
The chances are the answer is no - if only because these suppliers are
careful not to upset such a leading customer.
Furthermore, a fleet management company will have maintenance records for
countless examples of any make and model. It will know that model X needs a
new clutch normally after so many thousand miles, while at a certain mileage
the front discs are prone to go on model Y, and it will be on the look-out
for gross exceptions to any such norms when its customers' cars are
serviced.
But if so many tasks are to be assumed by an outside fleet management
company, suddenly there is less administration to be taken care of in-house.
This is a further benefit to the fleet operator because staffing costs can
also be reduced, or personnel can be re-assigned to more important tasks
connected with their employer's core business.
It is perhaps best summed up by one Bedfordshire fleet manager who makes
extensive use of a fleet management company: 'We aren't into cost and
maintenance control as our main line of business, so we think it's more
sensible to delegate those responsibilities to a company which is.'

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (4): Cash option poses
problems - Changes in company car perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERY many UK companies would like to offer cash to employees as an
alternative to the company car. Yet the number of corporations actually
offering the cash alternative has gone down in the past year.
This is in spite of the fact that the 1991 UK budget was expected to drive
many 'perk' company cars off the road because the Chancellor of the
Exchequer caused many corporations to re-think fundamentally their company
car policies.
He did so by:
Raising the personal tax paid by company car drivers yet again - it has
jumped by 280 per cent since the 1988 budget; and
By insisting employers pay National Insurance contributions on company cars
and fuel.
That certainly gave corporations food for thought. A survey by the William M
Mercer Fraser consultancy group shortly after last year's Budget showed that
two thirds of the companies contacted were reconsidering their car policies.
Half of those thinking of changing were considering the introduction of a
cash alterative.
So, what stopped them?
'While there is evidence that a large number of companies would like to
offer a cash alternative, they are being put off by administrative
complexities and the imprecise VAT and income tax position of cash
allowances,' says Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt of Monks Partnership, the
remuneration advisers.
Not only that, some companies which anticipated the Chancellor's tough
measures and launched a cash instead of cars policy in 1990, have been
forced to drop the offer.
Mr Vernon-Harcourt suggests that, while the income tax difficulties
eventually can be ironed out with the help of individual tax inspectors, the
potential VAT problem remains a serious one for companies.
He says Customs and Excise are taking the view that, if an employee could
have, say, Pounds 3,000 in cash or a company car, the supply of a company
car by the employer to the employee must be deemed supply by the employer of
a car for the VAT-inclusive consideration of the cash alternative.
Giving a simple illustration, Mr Vernon-Harcourt takes the example of a
company which offers employees a choice of Pounds 3,000 cash or a company
car. The company has 500 cars and 50 employees take the cash while 450
retain their cars. Customs and Excise will insist that the 450 car users
have had the supply of a car from the company on the following terms: supply
Pounds 2,553.19; plus VAT Pounds 446.81 (for a total of Pounds 3,000.)
So Customs and Excise might demand 450 times Pounds 446.81, or a total of
Pounds 201,065, from the company.
'For a company with 2,000 to 3,000 cars the VAT bill could be Pounds 1m,' Mr
Vernon-Harcourt points out.
As the VAT problem affects those cars retained by employees, it does not
arise if a company decides to do away with all its cars and give cash
instead to eligible employees. Monks has found a handful of companies
considering this course of action. They are mainly financial/City
organisations where all the cars on the fleet are 'perk' cars.
In any case, Mr Vernon-Harcourt says that, in spite of the Chancellor's
efforts, 'in most of the companies we've looked at, two out of three cars
remain tax efficient compared with the tax alternatives. So there is no
great impetus to change in this direction. It is not cost-effective to move
every company car driver to the cash alternative.'
Neither would a forced change from cars to cash be particularly popular.
The Mercer Fraser survey found that, while 12 per cent of companies were
offering a cash alternative, only one in 10 described the take-up of the
cash option as even 'moderate'.
The problem the UK government faces in trying to eradicate the 'perk'
company car is that the benefits to both employer and employee are far
broader than those which can be stated in simple monetary benefit terms.
The 'perk' cars era in Britain certainly started because companies in the
1960s and 1970s were looking for other ways to reward employees because high
personal taxes made pay increases relatively unattractive.
The government's counter-attack started in 1979 when it said it aimed to
reduce the UK's high personal tax rates but, to compensate, it also wanted
to eliminate the provision of 'perks' being handed out in lieu of extra pay.
Since car benefits were believed to account for about 80 per cent of the
total value of fringe benefits (apart from pension provisions) it seemed
appropriate for the Chancellor to concentrate on that sector.
However, over the years companies have found there are other benefits
arising from providing company cars. According to Vauxhall, the General
Motors subsidiary in Britain, there are four main reasons why employers
provide company cars for key personnel:
Business efficiency. 'Mobility in business is essential,' says Vauxhall.
'Key staff must have continuous access to reliable, cost-effective car
provision.'
Presenting the right image. 'First impressions are important, particularly
when company directors, sales managers or representatives arrive at customer
premises.'
Key personnel retention and company loyalty. 'The company car is seen as a
significant part of the overall package of remuneration and equipment
provision. Perceived status is often associated with the type of company car
and, in a competitive market place for skills, organisations believe it is
essential to retain the loyalty and full commitment of the employee.'
Safety. 'Regular and recorded service maintenance can be guaranteed if the
vehicle is in company ownership.'
According to Mr Len Clayton, managing director of Swan National Leasing  -
who, like Vauxhall, obviously has a vested interest in the future of the
'perk' car - there is more to the 'cash-for-cars' option than meets the eye.
Many of its problems emerge only when the option is examined more closely.
'The main problems may begin to arise only after a few months or a year
after the scheme has been implemented,' he suggests.
Mr Clayton says that, when users consider matters calmly, they will decide
to scrap the idea of a cash alternative. He adds for good measure: 'The
company car is an essential business tool. It is not a dying species. It is
alive and well and will remain so - because in the final analysis there is
no viable alternative.'
While these might be heartening sentiments as far as the car makers and
contract hire companies are concerned, there is no doubt that more companies
than ever have been reconsidering their company car schemes.
Pressures of recession have forced many of them to keep their company cars
longer so that four years, rather than three, is becoming the norm. And that
is not such good news for manufacturers or contract hire groups.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (1): Brakes on in the car
park - Many companies consider the cycle of purchase, operation and disposal
of car fleets to be an obvious area for cutbacks and savings. John Griffiths
investigates the severe effect on the motor industry, as operators review
their policies on replacement of vehicles and contemplate the alternative of
giving employees cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AS RECESSION has tightened its grip in the UK and other leading European
countries, so the business sector has looked with growing urgency for ways
of cutting costs.
Not without reason, attention has been drawn ever more closely to the
company car park.
For whereas the operation of vans, trucks and other commercial vehicles is
an unglamorous business in which cost control is paramount, the large 'perk'
proportion in company cars, the perceived status and other emotive issues
involved in their provision, and - not least - their use as a magnet to
attract key recruits, served to thrust cost from the top of the list of
concerns almost throughout the 1980s.
But with UK unemployment again creeping towards 3m, the property and other
large economic sectors showing scant signs of life, and thousands of
companies struggling simply for survival, the 1980s-style preoccupations
appear increasingly frivolous. And, as a result of successive UK Budgets,
they have also become considerably more expensive to indulge.
Last year the Chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, hit the motor industry and
business car users alike with what both regard as his now-infamous 'triple
whammy':
A further increase in tax scale charges payable by employees;
A hike to 17.5 per cent in VAT, which, unlike any other business good,
companies cannot reclaim on car purchases; and
The imposition for the first time of National Insurance Contributions,
payable by the company, on employees' private benefit of their cars.
One effect was to bring to almost tenfold the increase, during the past
decade, in the taxable benefit to the employee of his company car. The
typical operator of a 1.5 litre car under four years old in 1982-83 paid tax
on an assessed benefit of Pounds 360: in the current year the assessed
benefit is Pounds 3,250.
For most employees, that remains a very good deal - paying tax at 25 per
cent, his newish company car will have cost him or her around Pounds 800 in
the current tax year, far below the cost of buying and running the same car
privately.
The additional cost to employers, however, is much more substantial.
Thus, a steady stream of surveys - the latest by the UK's Monks Partnership
consultancy group in mid-February - has shown a majority of companies
identifying the cycle of buying, operating and disposing of their car fleets
to be one of the most obvious areas for cutbacks and savings.
To the dismay of car makers, importers and dealers, one of the easiest
decisions has been to postpone replacement of cars, which, for most
companies in easier times, had taken place in two- or three-year cycles.
Instead, as shown by the Monks Partnership survey of 202 UK companies
operating a combined fleet of 115,000 cars, nearly one quarter are requiring
cars to cover more than 70,000 miles before replacement - up from 8 per cent
in 1991 - and 31 per cent are keeping cars more than three years (up from 19
per cent).
Some 120 of the companies, surveyed between December of last year and the
end of January, were shown to be contemplating change to their company car
policies this year. Of these, a relative handful - 12 per cent - were
contemplating measures which could increase costs while 85 per cent were
looking for savings.
No less significantly, for the first time several surveys have identified
considerable interest by companies in opting out of the hassles of providing
and administering company car fleets altogether, usually by offering a cash
alternative.
The complexity of the calculations involved in determining the extent to
which such a course might save corporate cash has provided a field day for
accountants.
It has also resulted in a flood of often contradictory data from various
vested interest groups, such as the specialist contract hire, leasing and
fleet management companies which make their living from convincing vehicle
operators that they can do a better job than 'in-house'.
There is something approaching consensus, however, that probably between one
half and two-thirds of company cars are still tax advantageous for
companies, although the situation could change, should Mr Lamont decide
significant changes in the taxation and other treatment of vehicles and fuel
in his forthcoming Budget on March 10.
It is likely, however, that a good many more companies would have already
taken the plunge into offering cash alternatives, were it not for a number
of unresolved VAT and personal taxation pitfalls of which they are deeply
fearful.
Their fears are well founded. And the irony is not lost on them that it is
legislation from a government which committed itself to eradicating the
company car 'perk' which is helping to retain it.
Much the biggest problem relates to VAT. The courts are testing the decision
of Customs and Excise to demand VAT where 'cash for cars' schemes are
offered, even if most employees decide to keep their cars instead.
To illustrate: if a company offered its 500 employees Pounds 4,000 a year as
a cash alternative, and only 10 took up the offer, Customs and Excise would
demand from the company VAT on the supply of the retained 490 cars,
representing an additional bill for the company of more than Pounds 250,000.
Such uncertainties, when combined with those hanging over Mr Lamont's Budget
intentions, help explain the continuing sharp fall-off in UK new car sales
over the past year which has so severely affected vehicle makers and
importers. From a record 2.3m sales in 1989, the market plunged to just
1.59m last year. Commercial vehicle sales have suffered even more, and are
now running at little more than half the levels of two years ago.
In the past few weeks, the industry has been tossed at least one crumb of
comfort - publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into
car pricing in the UK, and the related question whether the system of sales
through exclusively-franchised dealers (in theory at least) has played a
role in keeping prices higher than necessary.
In spite of the MMC's conclusion that there was a complex monopoly in the
supply of new cars, it found also that this did not necessarily work to
consumers' disadvantage. To the chagrin of consumer groups, it accepted both
that UK prices were not, overall, disproportionately high in comparison with
Continental markets, and that franchised networks were needed properly to
care for such complex products with strong safety implications.
Its conclusions will be assessed closely by the industry and business
vehicle operators in Continental countries, for it is likely considerably to
influence the European Commission's own deliberations on pricing after the
advent of the single market next year and on whether the present exemption
from normal EC competition rules (which allows the franchised car trade to
exist) should continue after its scheduled expiry in 1995.
The MMC report does, however, propose greater freedom for dealers to compete
more intensively with each other. It also is critical of exceptionally large
fleet deals, involving very large discounts and concluded directly between
vehicle maker and operator. These, it argues, require subsidies from smaller
business and private buyers in the form of higher list prices.
It is possible that the bringing of such issues into the open, combined with
a growing hope that Mr Lamont's Budget next month may reduce the tax burden
on cars, may at last persuade fleet buyers back into the market.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Appointments: Linread succession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Harrisson has been appointed group managing director of Linread, the
Birmingham-based nuts and bolts manufacturer, following a boardroom upheaval
which has seen two senior departures in the past fortnight.
Mike Hughes, the chief executive and Orrie Mead, the former finance
director, left following serious problems in Linread's commercial products
division. One of the three plants has been closed and the workforce has been
cut by 45 per cent to 260; the company's 1991 results will show a loss.
Harrisson, 46, joins Linread after 11 years with Davy Corp-oration, where he
was chief executive of the mechanical handling division. Like Mike Hughes,
who was brought in to revitalise a then loss-making Linread in 1983,
Harrisson also spent part of his early career with BTR.
After six years which saw profits improve, Linread's recovery came to an
abrupt halt last year after faults were identified in the financial
reporting system; Linread's 1990 annual report notes that Hughes took direct
responsibility for the day-to-day operations. Orrie Mead stepped down from
the Linread board last June and was put in charge of the commercial products
division. He was replaced as finance director by Pieter Hazenberg. Peter
Anderson, a managing director of Newman Tonks engineering, takes over as
managing director of commercial products division next week, but is not
going on the Linread board.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Appointments: Glasgow smiles on part-time job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edwin Glasgow QC has been appointed chairman of the financial reporting
review panel, the new watchdog of accounting standards, in place of Simon
Tuckey QC who has just become a high court judge.
Glasgow, 46, was called to the bar in 1969 and took silk in 1987; he is
known for tough but courteous cross-examination. His broad-based practice,
covering common law and commercial litigation, has brought him into the
public eye. He acted on behalf of the football clubs in the public inquiries
after both the Bradford fire in 1986 and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989;
he also represented Ernest Saunders in the DTI inquiry into the Guinness
affair in 1987, and is currently acting on behalf of the Chief Constable of
Surrey in the Guildford Four inquiry.
The part-time job as chairman of the review panel involves co-ordinating the
work of its 22 members, who scrutinise accounts which are at variance with
accepted standards and have the power to order directors to change faulty
accounts at their own expense.
The panel has recently made its presence felt by making comments on the
accounting policies of four British companies - Ultramar, Williams Holdings,
Shield Group and Forte - and writing to 240 more which have made minor
reporting errors.
Glasgow says that he is expecting a 'very busy first year and will give up
as much time as necessary to ensure the job is done thoroughly. In
appropriate cases, a firm but fair line will be taken.'
He may have developed a passion for accounting during actions for and
against a number of large accountancy firms. But he must hope that earlier
earnings will tide him over; his time on the panel will only provide an
honorarium believed to be a few thousand pounds a year.

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul holds its breath ahead of
reforms - Turkish government proposals for the equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's stock exchange, like a nervous debutante waiting to be asked to
dance, is holding its breath as the government puts the finishing touches to
the reform package which helped take Istanbul's 75-share index to a 1992
peak of 5,128.91 a month ago.
There has been some profit-taking recently by investors who feel that the
market may have already discounted the impact of the reforms. It has come a
long way from a low of just over 2,500 last October. Yesterday the index
closed 7.74 down at 4,174.22, compared with over 5,400 in February 1991, and
its all-time high of 5,749 on August 2, 1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Trading in 135 stocks, Istanbul's equity market is still considered
undervalued on a price/earnings ratio of 12, compared with around 24 for the
US. It is hoped that the reforms will bridge some of the gap.
One proposal is to allow insurance companies and pension funds to invest in
the stock market - providing some badly needed liquidity. Other measures
seek to give increased investor protection by tightening up on insider
trading, and regulating the actions of fund managers.
At present, trades are frequently not booked in the client's name, which
enables the bank or the broker to use their clients' portfolios for their
own trading purposes; for example, selling the market short. Officials say
that this will now be regulated.
Settlement is a major headache, particularly for foreign investors. There is
a proposal to introduce a two-week account period. Currently, deals have to
be settled within 48 hours. Companies are also required under capital market
rules to distribute a fixed percentage of their profits as dividends. In the
past, say brokers, this resulted in a deluge of rights issues, with the
inevitable dilution. As a result, the stock market's earnings per share,
measured in real terms, have actually fallen over the past three years.
There is also an increasing expectation that Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economics
minister, will go further in pushing for wide-ranging legislation to
regulate the market and at the same time attract new investment.
The government has already announced a change in the withholding tax on
treasury bills which will encourage investors to move funds to the stock
market. And, from February, banks will have to separate their capital
markets departments from general banking activities, putting them on an even
footing with the brokers. Banks hitherto have used their foreign exchange
and interbank lending departments in support of their broking activities,
giving them a clear advantage over brokerage houses.
Market leaders in Turkey include Arcelik, the consumer electronics
subsidiary of Koc Holding, Turkey's largest trading conglomerate.
Construction companies with interests in the former Soviet Union are also
attracting attention as Turkish businessmen eye up opportunities in the new
republics. Of the key indust-rial sectors, cement remains attractive.
Brokers say that there is still plenty of money in the market, pointing out
that daily trading volume has increased by more than three times since the
general election last October. However, there remain serious liquidity
constraints. One analyst estimates that, of the total market capitalisation
of TL83,460bn (Dollars 14.5bn), perhaps as little as TL18,000bn is available
to investors.
A broker's analyst said: 'The market basically seizes up if the volume goes
above Dollars 100m.' Computerisation, due to be introduced in 1993, may help
to ease this problem, but fundamental, structural issues need to be
addressed.
Investors are more concerned at the lack of clarity in the regulatory stance
of the Capital Markets Board, the government authority which oversees the
market. They also want the government to tackle the problem of persistently
high inflation which, at 70 per cent, is eroding corporate earnings.

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines to
lowest level since October 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL disquiet and corporate earnings worries at home, and the setback
for President George Bush in the New Hampshire presidential primary, left
Japanese equity markets nervous yesterday, and the Nikkei average fell to
its lowest level since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Small-lot selling by arbitrageurs and companies, in thin trading, took the
Nikkei 253.73 lower to 20,618.30 after opening at the day's high of
20,793.77. The index reached the session's low of 20,485.72 in the morning,
subsequently recovering some ground on light bargain hunting.
A succession of poor earnings results put the market in a sombre mood, along
with the domestic parliamentary hearing on the Kyowa bribery scandal and
worries that New York could tumble on the New Hampshire primary news.
Volume again totalled 200m shares. Declines led advances by 732 to 219, with
151 issues unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks retreated
19.37 to 1,520.62, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.70 to
1,159.90.
Some investors fear that a recovery for Japanese companies may be delayed.
The yen's decline against the dollar also discouraged market participants.
The US currency extended its rally to close Y1.03 higher at Y128.20. The
yield on the benchmark bond also rose, as a weaker yen implied higher
inflationary pressures.
Share prices failed to respond to calls for strong economic stimulus
measures, including a cut in the official discount rate, by Mr Tamisuke
Watanuki, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Ross
Purdie at SG Warburg said that the Bank of Japan will not lower interest
rates as long as pressure from politicians persists.
Sony dropped Y160 to Y4,000 on a downward revision of its earnings. It said
that its parent company operating result would fall Y20bn into the red for
the current year to March.
The announcement dragged down other electronics companies, with NEC falling
Y40 to Y1,050 and Fujitsu Y12 to Y743. TDK lost Y210 to Y4,080 on reports of
a sharp decline in earnings for the current year.
Banks lost ground on selling by companies wishing to realise profits ahead
of the March year-end book closing. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y180 to
Y2,500 and Bank of Tokyo Y50 to Y1,210.
Non-life insurers declined on foreign investor selling. Traders said
foreigners had previously bought heavily into the sector, and wanted to
lighten their exposure. Yasuda Fire and Marine shed Y17 to Y713.
Sega Enterprises was one of the few gainers of the day, climbing Y300 to
Y14,000 on prospects of higher earnings for the current year to March,
thanks to brisk US sales of its video game.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 201.68 to 22,355.10 in turnover of 116.3m
shares. Volume surged on active cross-trading ahead of the year-end book
closing.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim was mixed to easier yesterday, though Kuala Lumpur recorded
an eight-month high.
KUALA LUMPUR rose to its best level since last June, the composite index
adding 11.05, or 1.8 per cent, at 618.72 in volume of 81m shares (65m).
Telekom rose 60 cents to MDollars 11.70, with 2.49m shares traded.
HONG KONG eased on profit taking, the Hang Seng index losing 21.40 to
4,725.70 in turnover of HKDollars 1.9bn (HKDollars 1.72bn).
Banks remained firm ahead of today's results from Hang Seng Bank, a
subsidiary of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, which are forecast to show a 30
per cent increase in profits. Hang Seng put on 25 cents to HKDollars 21.10,
while the parent group was unchanged.
SINGAPORE firmed in active trade dominated by Malaysian stocks. The Straits
Times Industrial index gained 9.42 to 1,511.22 in volume of 86m shares.
Analysts said reports of cuts in Malaysian interest rates created demand for
Malaysian stocks.
SEOUL staged a technical rebound after three days of decline. The composite
index ended 9.91 up at 648.13. Electronics issues remained depressed on
concern over financial problems affecting the sector.
TAIWAN rallied after falls earlier in the week. The weighted index improved
72.51, or 1.5 per cent, to 4,839.42 in turnover of TDollars 24bn.
BANGKOK suffered its largest one-day fall in almost three months as the SET
index shed 9.99 to 806.51 in turnover of Bt10.52bn. Bangkok Land, Tanayong
and Bangkok Bank lost Bt6, Bt12 and Bt24 to Bt200, Bt145 and Bt664
respectively after the Stock Exchange said that buying of these shares could
only be done by cash.
JAKARTA fell sharply, closing 6.55 down at 280.20 in volume of 5.8m shares.
Astra International weakened a further Rp550 to Rp13,050.
MANILA's composite index dropped 35.56 to 1,141.01, pulled down by a 4 per
cent fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which lost 35 pesos to 835
pesos. Turnover shrank to 41m pesos from 71m pesos.
AUSTRALIA succumbed to offshore selling. The All Ordinaries index dipped 4.8
to 1,622.3, but News Corp gained 6 cents at ADollars 18.30. Turnover was
moderate at ADollars 234.3m.
NEW ZEALAND ended steady after earlier declining about 16 points on the
NZSE-40 capital index, which finished a net 0.62 up at 1,473.65.

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Foreigners continue to buy
French cyclicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINENT put in a mixed performance yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS reinforced Tuesday's gains as foreign investors, including the
Japanese, continued to buy stocks with exposure to cyclical industries and
to the US economy. But some analysts feared that the optimism was premature.
The CAC-40 index rose 3.20 to 1,915.41 in heavy turnover of FFr2.6bn.
Rhone-Poulenc saw its investment certificates rise FFr22 or 3.9 per cent to
FFr587 with a respectable 153,375 units traded as the market gave an
unexpectedly good reception to its lukewarm 1991 results. Analysts were
cheered by the message given at a meeting with the company, that a further
recovery in earnings could be expected in 1992 and 1993, with the extra help
from a lower tax charge.
Cerus, the French holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo de
Benedetti, rose FFr4.70 or 4.1 per cent to FFr120 in a heavy 312,150 shares
on rumours that it would sell its 36 per cent stake in the car components
manufacturer Valeo or, alternatively, buy in the outstanding shares.
Analysts said the former had more credibility, given the fragile financial
position of Olivetti.
Accor, the hotels group, rose FFr15 to FFr761 with 117,400 shares traded on
news that SGB was likely to increase its holding.
FRANKFURT weakened as it pondered the New Hampshire primary in the US,
concluded that a strong dollar could be a two-edged sword, and moved towards
DTB closure day tomorrow. After a 1.62 decline to 689.48 in the FAZ index at
midsession, the DAX finished 7.20 lower at 1,687.79 after a half-hearted
attempt at the 1,700 level.
Siemens dropped DM5.10 to DM670.90 as it topped active stocks in turnover of
DM1.04bn, very high in the context of total turnover of DM5.3bn, down from
DM6.5bn.
Daimler led carmakers down with a DM6.90 fall to DM734.60 as some analysts
lowered their forecasts following reports that its models saw a 15 per cent
year-on-year drop in new registrations in western Europe in January, and
that the company expects to cut production this year.
Retailers, which had a good run on this week's tax package, ran into
profit-taking, Douglas falling DM15 to DM645, Asko by DM17 to DM738 and
Kaufhof by DM6 to DM487.50.
MILAN overcame an uncertain start and consolidated the previous day's late
gains as turnover improved to between L95bn-L100bn from L89bn. The Comit
index rose 4.38 to 531.27.
Among industrials, Fiat added L58 to L4,740 while in insurers, Generali was
officially fixed at L30,535, up L375. Rumours of a rights issue pushed Ras
down by L250 to L22,150.
Olivetti rose L87 or 3.2 per cent to L2,807 on expectations of a turnround
in 1992, but the buying was described as speculative. Montedison was another
gainer, as investors re-assessed the Beghin-Say/Eridania restructuring in a
more favourable light. The stock rose L22 to L1,356 in heavy trading.
The state-controlled cement group Cementir was suspended yesterday ahead of
IRI's announcement of the winning bidder for its 52 per cent stake in
Cementir. The stock is due to be re-quoted today.
AMSTERDAM, after moving strongly in the morning, fell back on nervousness
over a weaker Wall Street and closed barely changed on the day, up 0.1 at
123.7 in turnover of Fl 676.5m.
Royal Dutch, which reports its 1991 results today, lost Fl 2.30 to Fl
142.10. Most analysts are expecting to be disappointed, given a generally
poor fourth quarter for the European petrochemical industry. Among other
blue chips, Unilever recorded another record high, gaining Fl 2.30 to Fl
192.20, helped by a stronger dollar, Elsevier moved ahead Fl 0.20 to Fl
109.70, while Philips was off Fl 0.50 to Fl 32.40 on rumours of a rights
issue.
Begemann, the engineering group, which has been weak over the last few days,
came back Fl 5.00 to Fl 103.00, helped by favourable local press comment.
STOCKHOLM saw a 3.3 per cent drop in the banking and finance sector as the
Affarsvarlden General index closed 6.8 lower at 933.1.
Worries over loan losses were intensified by the suspension of payments by
Reinhold, the property company. Among Reinhold's main creditors, SE Banken
and Handelsbanken both fell, SE Banken C shares by SKr3 to SKr44 and
Handelsbanken B by SKr4 to SKr78.
OSLO closed at its lowest level this year, depressed by a weak oil price.
The all-share index fell 9.08 to 413.86 in turnover of NKr205m. Norsk Hydro,
which is expected to announce a net loss for 1991 today, fell NKr4 to
NKr139.
MADRID closed down 1.18 at 260.23 with Telefonica actively traded after
reports about its pension scheme plans sent the shares to a day's low of
Pta1,185. However, it recovered to close down Pta40 at Pta1,200.
ZURICH ended a quiet session slightly lower, the SPI index losing 5.0 at
1,122.5. Some cyclicals continued to attract interest, Alusuisse bearers
closing SFr17 higher at SFr970. VIENNA's 18-share ATX index fell 8.10 to
1,075.85.

THOUSANDS OF Czechs are eager to acquire private farms or start companies
processing agricultural produce, according to the farmers' daily Zemedelske
Noviny, reports Reuter from Prague.
'People are interested in buying parts of state farms to be privatised,' the
paper quoted Mr Karel Burda, head of the Czech regional agriculture
ministry's privatisation department, as saying. 'They do not want to start
an archaic smallholder farm, but rather modern agribusinesses with 150 to
500 hectares of land.'
He said that last year the ministry received only 700 projects to privatise
ineffective state farms. The number at present was more than 2,600.

high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASE in payments to miners has led to an expansion in Guyana's gold
production, which reached 59,300 troy ounces last year, 20,300 ounces more
than in 1990, 4,300 ounces more than the industry had forecast and the
highest for 76 years.
The Guyana Gold Board and the Miners Association in the English-speaking
republic on the north eastern shoulder of South America, are anticipating
production of 100,000 ounces this year, and significantly higher levels from
next year when a major new mine begins production.
The local industry said the expansion in production is the result of a
deregulation of Guyana's foreign exchange market and the consequent payment
to miners at rates which were not pegged to the official exchange rate of
the Guyana dollar.
An agreement with the government allowed the miners to keep a half of their
earnings from gold in hard currency - a move which officials say provided a
powerful incentive for increased production.
Guyana's gold is produced mainly by individual miners working alluvial
deposits. Before the new incentives were offered, say government officials,
much of Guyana's gold was smuggled across the country's borders to
Venezuela, Brazil and Suriname, because of higher prices.
The industry is expecting a further expansion in national output from a
USDollars 150m venture by two Canadian companies, Golden Star Resources and
Cambior. They are opening a mine in the Omai District of Guyana, where
production is expected to begin by late this year. Annual output from next
year is projected at an average 255,000 ounces annually during mine's
anticipated life span of about 10 years.
Guyana's diamond production last year, at 22,000 carats, was just over 7,000
carats more than 1990 output. The increase has been attributed by government
officials to changes in the manner in which miners are allowed to declare
production. The government recently removed the need for miners to produce
extensive documentation to back their declared production.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cape fruit welcomed back to the
fold - Life after sanctions for South African exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MRS Margaret Thatcher visited South Africa last May, she was
rapturously received by a business community deeply grateful for her
committed stand against sanctions over the years. The deciduous fruit
industry went so far as to name a new cultivar of nectarine Margaret's Pride
in her honour.
Ironically, when Unifruco, the overseas marketing arm for the industry,
tried last December to send Mrs Thatcher a sample of the first crop, it fell
foul of the customs authorities and was impounded for two days. Unifruco
have been more fortunate, however, in their own commercial activities.
Indeed, the lifting of most trade sanctions against South African goods has
been an enormous boost to the local fruit industry.
Earlier this month Mr Louis Kriel, Unifruco's chief executive, was in
Europe, partly to celebrate a century of fruit exports from the Cape and
partly in an effort to increase further the market penetration of South
African agricultural goods into European markets. He wears a slightly bigger
hat than a year ago when Unifruco was only concerned with the export of
deciduous fruit. Since then arrangements have been struck with the citrus
and wine industries whereby Unifruco will also have a hand in distributing
their products.
On the citrus side, a joint venture company Fresh Fruit Services was set up.
The logic of the tie-up is that it allows the two industries to rationalise
service functions, like promotion, quality control, logistics and finance
and systems, because their seasons are largely complimentary, although
overlapping for a short period. The result is a ten month season over which
to utilise resources.
The deal also boosts Unifruco's negotiating clout. Mr Kriel comments: 'We
can negotiate on behalf of 70m boxes of fruit instead of 40m (deciduous) and
30m (citrus) in Europe'. A further reason for the deal is that although the
Citrus industry for the most part is in the Northern Transvaal, with the
deciduous fruit industry in the Western Cape, many Cape farmers are planting
soft citrus fruits as a means of spreading risk and to take advantage of the
growth in the market.
Unifruco's venture into wine is through a company called Vinfruco, an export
company launched late last year as a joint venture between Unifruco and a
consortium of co-operative wineries and independent estates in the
Stellenbosch region. Mr Kriel says Vinfruco is a response to requests from
some of their farmers and European supermarkets who discerned a demand for
South African packaged wines to return to their shelves. 'South Africa has
the potential to be the latest fashionable new world wine discovery' says Mr
Kriel. Vinfruco, which has launched two red and two white wines under the
'Oak Village' label, will focus on the supermarket trade. Mr Kriel says
their aim is to sell 30,000 cases in the first year, with ambitions to
'multiply that extensively'.
In terms of their existing market, Mr Kriel says that post-sanctions
Unifruco is finding it can at last compete with its competitors as regards
promotional activities. 'We are being measured only on the intrinsic value
of our product. That gives us a lot of confidence because we can see how
we're gaining on our competitors.' He estimates that in the new southern
hemisphere season, Unifruco has supplied at least 30 per cent more fruit to
Europe than in past years, and demand has certainly not grown by that
amount. He says their aim is to get to more than 50 per cent of European
Community southern hemisphere imports.
In the 1990-91 season Unifruco exported 35m cartons of fruit, earning R1.4bn
(Pounds 280m) gross. Mr Kriel says at the rate things are going, they will
reach their target of 50m cartons before 1995. Another change, apart from
being able to compete on equal terms, he adds, is that 'we're being treated
by a number of organisations who were previously prevented by board
decisions from supporting us as long-lost sons'. These organisations believe
they suffered by not being able to stock the premium Cape label. Mr Kriel
cites the Albert Hein group in Holland as stocking Cape produce for the
first time in seven years, and in volumes to rival the large British
supermarkets.
Mr Kriel says they are under tremendous pressure from the trade to re-enter
the American market with a bang. He comments: 'We will be returning, but we
will be rebuilding the market. We must recreate the premium image and then
develop the volumes'.

THE ALUMINIUM market may be depressed, but this apparently is not daunting
Jamaica's miners and refiners of bauxite, the ore from which aluminium is
produced. In a display of confidence in the ability of the market to
rebound, the industry is pursuing projects to expand refining capacity.
Basing its faith on the cyclical nature of aluminium demand the industry is
spending heavily this year so that it will be able to take advantage of the
improvement it expects in the market.
Jamaica, the world's third largest bauxite producer after Australia and
Guinea, has nearly run out of spare bauxite refining capacity. Its installed
capacity of 3.1m tonnes a year will allow for only marginal growth in output
this year from last year's 3.01m tonnes.
'The problems affecting the aluminium market are short term,' says Mr
Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. 'There
is a bright future for aluminium in developments which will have a longer
term impact, such as increased efforts towards energy conservation'.
Mr Davis also sees good prospects for growth in aluminium consumption - and
consequently in demand for bauxite ore and alumina - in the motor and food
industries. The aluminium beverage can has yet to make its mark on the
European and Japanese markets, he says.
A similar conclusion about the ability of the market to recover and the need
to expand capacity now is drawn by Mr Billy Foster, director of process
modernisation for Kaiser Aluminum of the US. 'You always run the danger of
building a plant only to see the market drop,' he says. 'But if we were to
wait for a stable market before building plants then none would be built.'
Consequently, Kaiser and Norsk Hydro of Norway, which own Alumina Partners
of Jamaica, the island's largest refinery, are investing Dollars 180m to
expand output. Kaiser has a 65 per cent share in the refinery.
Alumina Partners has a rated capacity of 1.2m tonnes a year and will
initially be modernised to produce 1.55m tonnes a year. The project is being
financed through the floating of bonds in Puerto Rico through a financing
facility established by the island's administration.
The first issue of bonds, amounting to Dollars 60m, was completed in
December. 'The funding which is in place is intended to get the first phase
of the modernisation started,' says Mr Foster. 'A second bond issue of
another Dollars 60m will be sought when the first is consumed, maybe in
August or September, and this second issue will allow us to complete the
upgrading of the plant.'
The expansion will be completed in the next 12 months, with the remaining
funds coming from the resources of the two companies, which are already
contemplating another increase in capacity to lift output to 2m tonnes per
year. This second project will depend on demand for alumina, Mr Foster says.
Another refinery, Jamalco, jointly owned by the Jamaican government and the
Aluminum Company of America, is also being upgraded. Some Dollars 30m is
being spent on the plant this year in a programme aimed at increasing its
output from 800,000 to 1m tonnes a year.
Alcan of Canada is concluding a Dollars 60m investment in its mines and two
refineries in Jamaica, improving its ore transportation and port facilities
and lifting output from its plants to 1.1m tonnes a year, 200,000 tonnes
more than average production in recent years.
The government and Alcan are studying the feasibility of a new 1m
tonnes-a-year plant on the island's north coast. If the project is approved,
the plant is likely to cost about Dollars 1bn, with ownership by Alcan, the
government and at least one other company from either Japan, the UK or
another European country.
In another effort to expand the industry, negotiations are continuing
between the government and interests from the Ukraine and the US on the
start of a joint venture to operate a bauxite mine in Jamaica. The Nikolaev
Alumina Company of the Ukraine, Pioneer Windows of New York and Jamaica
Bauxite Mining, a state-owned company, plan to rehabilitate and work mines
in northern Jamaica that were closed eight years ago by Reynolds Metals of
the US.
It is to the Alumina Partners expansion, however, that the Jamaican industry
is looking for almost immediate relief from the shortage of capacity that
has caused a slowdown in the industry. Bauxite ore production rose by 5.5
per cent last year to 11.5m tonnes, compared with the 19.8 per cent
expansion of 1990. The growth in alumina production also slipped last year
to 5.5 per cent, from 30 per cent in 1990.
'It is now accepted in the industry that the four refineries in Jamaica are
the most competitive in the world, except perhaps for the plants located in
Western Australia,' says Mr Davis. 'They are, therefore, very good ventures
for anyone with an eye on the long term market.'

Gradually increasing strength in Australian and other wool values during the
previous two weeks continued to develop this week. The Australian Wool
Corporation's market indicator passed through the 600 cent mark, a record
since the free market was resumed just 12 months ago, and by February 19th
was at 619 cents, with every sign of moving higher. Clearances are good and
price rises now apply throughout the range, including finer merinos which
have for a long time shown relative and often actual softness. The wool
market's rise is accompanied by heavier stockpile sales in Australia, with
nearly 56,000 bales sold last week.

futures

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GRAIN futures prices fell yesterday as trader scepticism set in about
more US agricultural credits to Russia and the weather looked favourable for
winter wheat.
Prices for maize and soyabeans had risen on Tuesday because of the
announcement that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, had requested
another Dollars 600m in agricultural credits from Washington. It was
believed that the Russians would be primarily interested in these feed
grains.
But by mid-morning yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade, maize had fallen
by 1 cent in the March and May contracts, to Dollars 2.62 3/4 and Dollars
2.70 1/2 , and soyabeans have dropped by  3/4 cents and 1 3/4 cents in its
March and May contracts, to Dollars 5.71 3/4 and Dollars 5.80 3/4 .
Grain analysts in Chicago said they doubted that Washington would be quick
to agree to fresh credits for Moscow. They expect that the US government
will wait to see if the Russians keep up with their hard currency payments
in March on previous loans.
There was also uncertainty about Mr Yeltsin's political longevity. 'There is
caution about how to trade this information (about Russian credits),' said
Mr Steve Freed, a grain analyst with Dean Witter.
Wheat futures took a bigger fall, dipping 5 cents for the spot month of
March to Dollars 4.065 and by 4.5 cents to Dollars 4.04 for the May
contract. Traders had been expecting an Artic blast in the upper Midwest,
which would have potentially damaged winter wheat. But warm, moist weather,
which will help the crops, settled in the region.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar demand estimate reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENTS IN the Commonwealth of Independent States have forced
Czarnikow, the London trade house, to reduce its forecasts for this year's
world sugar production and consumption for the second time.
Production for 1991-92 is now estimated at 112.27m tonnes, compared with
estimates of 112.86m tonnes and 113m tonnes in made last August and November
respectively. The latest figure reflects increased output projections for
Thailand, China, Argentina and the EC, but these were more than offset by
sharp falls in the CIS (to 6.75m tonnes) and Cuba (to 6.5m tonnes), says
Czarnikow in its latest Sugar Review.
Consumption is put at 110.89m tonnes, compared with August and November
predictions of 112.15m tonnes and 113.14m tonnes. The latest figure has been
overshadowed by the CIS, where stocks held by consumers are high, and the
picture is further obscured by overseas food aid prospects. Czarnikow now
estimates Soviet consumption at 11.2m tonnes.
After allowing for unrecorded disappearance, estimated at 600,000 tonnes,
the latest figures imply a net addition of 770,000 tonnes to world stocks.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Headaches over Russian metal
sales 'to continue'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S METAL production and exports to the west would fall this year but
remain high enough to continue causing western producers severe headaches,
analysts suggested yesterday.
Metal output might drop as much as 15 per cent from last year's level,
according to Burdett, Buckeridge &amp; Young, the Australian stockbroker. Last
year production of the main traded metals fell from the 1990 level by
between 5.5 (nickel) and 11.5 per cent (tin).
Russian metal exports could fall by a third this year, mainly because of
problems caused by new taxes and licensing, Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at
Merrill Lynch, suggested.
He pointed out there was an eight-week backlog for licences in Russia and it
seemed exports had more or less ground to a halt. Mr Arnold said metal
exports would be low in the first quarter of 1992 because rail transport in
Russia had been diverted to moving food and fuel. It should return to normal
in the second quarter.
Other analysts were less convinced that exports would drop so much. 'While
the flow of metal might not quite reach 1991 levels, it will remain very
high by historic standards,' said Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin
Research. 'There will be a lot of metal for the relatively sluggish western
European economies to absorb.'
Mr Buxton pointed out, even if exports slowed, there was a great deal of
Russian metal already in Europe - for example 30,000 tonnes of nickel in
Rotterdam.
Analysts were puzzled by remarks made in London by Mr Anatoly Filatov,
chairman of Norilsk, Russia's main nickel producer. He insisted that delays
in nickel shipments had not been caused by bureaucratic delays and the new
export tariff but because prices were too low.
Mr Filatov told Reuter that Norilsk had already closed one smelter in
Siberia for six-months maintenance work because of low prices and said it
would not ship nickel to the west if the price fell below Dollars 3.50 a lb.
Last night nickel closed in London at Dollars 3.63.
Analysts suggested that Norilsk could not have escaped the difficulties
faced by other Russian metal producers. Burdett, Buckeridge pointed out in a
study of the Russian resources industry that these included problems of
labour productivity, old-fashioned equipment, shortages of raw materials and
capital and failures in power supply.

Nickel prices fell sharply on the LME, moving quickly through chart support
points in the afternoon. Dealers said volume was not particularly large and
the absence of the recent big buyer contributed to the retreat from Monday's
six-month highs. Liquidation, commission house and stop-loss selling weighed
on the market, with three-month prices hitting Dollars 7,950 a tonne at one
stage. Aluminium staged a partial recovery in afternoon trading after
earlier losses on liquidation and technical selling following the recent
jump to a seven-month high of Dollars 1,340 a tonne for three-month metal.
The market found good support below Dollars 1,300, dealers said.
Expectations of a resumption in Russian exports soon and the delay in the
scheduled closure of Italian smelter facilities has undermined fundamentals
this week. New York sugar prices were sliding at midday in a correction to
Tuesday's steep rise, which traders and analysts said was generally
technical - although some cited news that only four of Russia's 95 sugar
processing plants were operating because of a lack of raw sugar. Comex gold
futures were firmer at midday on a belief that prices might be headed
higher, analysts said. Comex silver prices had recouped earlier losses by
midday.

FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Latin America's new-found
allure - The recent rush of private capital to the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flows of private capital into Latin America tripled last year to more than
Dollars 40bn, eight times the 1989 level, according to research published
this week by Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank.
The research, which concentrates on five countries - Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Mexico and Venezuela - indicates that the types of inflows have
become more diversified among bonds, equities, country funds and direct
foreign investment. The 1991 inflows included a substantial repatriation of
flight capital, funds previously placed abroad by Latin American residents.
The 1991 inflow generated nearly three times the funds necessary to finance
the deficits on the countries' trade in goods and services, and helped to
boost foreign exchange reserves by Dollars 15bn.
Salomon's emerging markets group calculated that bond issues, private
placement, commercial paper and certificates of deposit together accounted
for Dollars 11.7bn of the total, and direct foreign investment accounted for
Dollars 13.9bn. American Depositary Receipts - bundles of shares packaged to
suit US investors - and country funds together accounted for Dollars 6.4bn.
Investment flows were encouraged by lower interest rates and the recession
in the US and Europe which contrasted with high growth rates and relatively
high domestic interest rates in Latin America.
'More importantly, Latin American economies are becoming more productive and
internationally competitive. The overall economic outlook and investment
opportunities in the region have improved with declining inflation levels,
positive GDP growth rates, reduced fiscal deficits, privatisation of state
owned enterprises and movement away from protected markets,' it said.
New trade policies, including negotiations between the US, Mexico and Canada
over a free trade agreement, were also significant.
It described as surprising the ability of countries such as Argentina and
Brazil to raise capital in the international bond markets while remaining in
substantial arrears on their debt to commercial banks. Capital flows to
Argentina were 10 times higher in 1991 at Dollars 5.1bn, than in 1990, while
inflows to Brazil were 20 times greater at Dollars 11.6bn.
Inflows to Mexico nearly doubled to Dollars 16.1bn. In the case of
Venezuela, they increased from Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 4.8bn. Inflows to
Chile fell to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 2.0bn, due mainly to the end of the
country's debt for equity conversion programme.
The research identifies a number of 'noteworthy' trends:
A large proportion of the capital flowing into Latin America was short-term
and attracted mainly by local interest rates significantly higher than in
the US.
All countries but Brazil registered solid growth rates in 1991, while growth
for all countries save Brazil is projected to exceed 5 per cent this year.
Average growth in gross domestic product (GDP) across the region translated
into per-capita growth of 0.9 per cent, reversing a eight-year trend of
declining GDP per capita. Inflation also dropped sharply. Privatisation
initiatives have gained momentum, attracting debt, foreign investment and a
reduction in domestic, and to a smaller extent, commercial bank debt.
Brazil has raised Dollars 1.6bn after its programme finally began last
October, and hopes to raise Dollars 18bn over three years. In Argentina, all
the main industries will be outside state control by the end of this year.
Mexico raised Dollars 7.2bn in 1991 from the privatisation of nine banks
alone; a further nine are due for privatisation in the first half of this
year. Venezuela raised Dollars 1.9bn from the sale of a 40 per cent stake in
its state telephone company late last year.
Non-bank institutional investors became significant investors in the region
in 1991, while the volume of repatriated flight capital rose considerably.
With an estimated Dollars 200bn of flight capital leaving Latin America over
the past two decades, some observers think that more than half of the
capital now entering Latin America is from Latin American investors. Mexico
estimated returning flight capital at close to Dollars 5.5bn in 1991.
Regional investment funds now total some Dollars 800m. Direct foreign
investment in Mexico amounted to more than Dollars 5bn, in Brazil to Dollars
1.3bn and in Chile to more than Dollars 1bn.
Four of the top performing markets in 1991 were in Argentina, Mexico, Chile
and Brazil. Market capitalisation of these countries has climbed
dramatically: Mexico's grew from Dollars 33bn at the end of 1990 to Dollars
83bn at end-October 1991.
Although most capital was short-term in nature, some countries, in
particular Mexico and Chile, began to attract longer-term capital.
The resurgence of economic growth and the prospects for numerous free trade
agreements with the US have led to a number of joint ventures between Latin
American and US and European companies. Some multinationals are directly
acquiring stakes in Latin American companies - such as the Dollars 320m
purchase by PepsiCo of 70 per cent of Empresas Gamesa.
'As in western Europe we expect the formation of strategic alliances to be
an increasingly important element of capital flows to the region during the
1990s,' the report concludes.

FT  20 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Underwriters set sights on Spain's
10-year issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ISSUE activity remained light in the international bond market
yesterday, with underwriting firms pre-occupied with the launch of Spain's
Y125bn 10-year issue, expected to be launched this morning.
Nomura International emerged as the winner of a bidding contest for the new
issue mandate and said that deal would be priced following consultation with
other firms this morning.
However, syndicate managers were yesterday divided on the correct yield
level for the issue. Some firms commented that the bonds should be priced to
yield the same as Belgium's Y50bn 10-year issue - 5.81 per cent in the
secondary market yesterday.
Others said that Spain's slightly lower credit quality, and the sheer size
of the deal, meant that a yield up to 8 basis points more than the Belgian
bonds was required for the deal to be a success.
Elsewhere, the Victorian Public Financing Agency, which carries the
guarantee of the Australian state of Victoria, launched a Dollars 300m
10-year deal lead managed by Morgan Stanley International.
The 8 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 76 basis points more the US
Treasury bonds, considered fair by participants in the deal although the
issue was said to have generated little enthusiasm among investors.
Syndicate officials said that only bonds issued by top-rated sovereign and
supranational borrowers would sell quickly under current market conditions.
The lead managers held the deal at the fixed re-offer price of 99.25
throughout the day.
Nacional Financiera, the Mexican state-backed finance agency, launched a
Ecu100m five-year deal. This is the longest maturity Ecu bond issue by a
Latin American borrower and underlines the extent to which developing
country borrowers are gaining access to new currency sectors.
In this case, however, the proceeds of the issue were swapped to provide
dollar funding at a rate comparable to that available by issuing directly in
the Eurodollar market.
Lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, the bonds pay a coupon of 10 1/4 per
cent and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.875, where the
yield is 10.284 per cent.
Osterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), the Austrian state-backed financial
institution, launched a L500bn zero-coupon issue. The bonds were re-offered
to investors at a fixed price of L34.90, where the yield is 11.10 per cent.
Participants reported buying from institutional investors keen to lock into
the high yields offered by lire bonds but with a minimal cash outlay.
The deal was the first zero coupon issue in the sector and underlined the
growing international interest in Euro-lire bonds. Earlier this week
Compagnie Bancaire raised L150bn and Crediop L500bn. Last week Deutsche Bank
raised L200bn.

FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan deals go ahead
after coup delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICING of two Venezuelan deals launched before the failed coup earlier
this month went ahead last week, after being postponed.
Dealers said the market had now stabilised, though recovery so far had been
slight and sentiment remained nervous. The pricing indicates that, despite a
20 per cent fall in the local stock market in the wake of the coup, the
market for new issues remains open.
A Dollars 110m global offering of shares for Sivensa (Siderurgica
Venezolana), a large manufacturing company, was due to be priced two days
after the coup attempt, on February 5. The shares were finally priced
earlier this week at Dollars 9.50 per unit. The deal has been fully placed,
according to adviser Samuel Montagu.
An offering of 5m global depositary receipts in Venepal, a paper and pulp
company, was being promoted at a US roadshow on the day of the coup. The
price was set on Tuesday, after a short delay, at Dollars 10 1/2 , and the
paper has been sold out, according to co-ordinator Lehman Brothers.
The Mexico Fund, a closed-end investment company listed on the New York and
London stock exchanges, announced a rights issue entitling shareholders to
acquire one new share for every three they currently hold.
This will allow the issue of up to 6.57m new shares at a slight discount to
the market price, which yesterday was Dollars 26 7/8 , suggesting the offer
will raise roughly Dollars 180m.

FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's says default rate on
commercial paper may be easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of commercial paper defaults, which rocketed in 1989, appears to be
tailing off, according to a special report by Moody's published yesterday,
writes Tracy Corrigan.
Since January 1989, 14 issuers have defaulted on a total of Dollars 1.4bn of
commercial paper in public markets.
The rate of European commercial paper defaults outstrips the default rate in
the US market. According to Moody's, some 46 per cent of commercial paper
losses over the past three years were in the Euro-CP market and other
developing sectors such as the sterling CP market.
The remainder was concentrated in the Dollars 500bn US CP market, which
overshadows the much-increased Dollars 80bn Euro-CP market.
According to the report, the default rate has been proportionately lower in
the US because the more mature US market has developed an 'orderly exit'
process, whereby the market rations the quantity of paper issued by
declining credits. 'Buyers simply refuse to hold risky paper at any price,'
Moody's reports.
Defaults have been more common in less-developed markets, but Moody's
expects that 'over the next few years, they will adopt their own version of
the orderly exit phenomenon'.
The report also highlights the divergence between commercial paper rated
prime by Moody's and paper without a prime rating. In the US between 1989
and 1991, the default rates of CP without a prime rating exceeded the
default rate of prime-rated CP by 89 times.
The report points to several reasons for the increase in default rates
globally since 1989, including the greater issuance of low-grade or junk CP,
associated with the bull market.
Then, as liquidity in the credit markets tightened in 1989, commercial banks
proved unwilling to back up liquidity as 'lenders of last resort'.
An accompanying report highlights the importance of alternative liquidity to
the successful functioning of the commercial paper market.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Treuhand privat-isation agency plans to double the successful
commercial paper programme it began last year.
The expansion by DM5bn to DM10bn of the short-maturity paper, which has a
low federal government risk, takes place against the background of DM30bn in
new debt issued this year by the Treuhand. The agency predicted a very
positive market response to the new issue.
Last year's initial Treuhand issue in the newly launched German commercial
paper market was well accepted by both German and foreign institutional
investors.
The agency said commercial paper was a particularly flexible and
cost-effective form of borrowing as interest rates were on average 0.20 per
cent (20 basis points) lower than money market loans. This added up to a
saving of DM8m on a DM4bn issue.
The number of banks offering the paper has been extended to 11 from seven.
Dresdener Bank is arranging the issue, with Deutsche Bank as co-arranger.
The Treuhand is unable to engage in medium-term borrowing until a new law is
passed regulating the listing of its securities for trading on the German
stock exchanges. The law is expected to be enacted in July.
The agency also announced that privatisation would be completed this year in
the east German food-processing industry, the first important sector of the
economy to achieve this goal.

FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sony struggles with the rewind
button - The deterioration in the electronics company's balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the Japanese electronics company, is having trouble winning friends in
the investment community these days. The company enjoys one of Japan's most
famous brand names. And it probably deserves its reputation as one of
Japan's most innovative companies.
Yet Sony is having trouble turning all of this into profits, and suspicions
are growing that Sony may have been simply too ambitious for its own good in
recent years.
Yesterday's dismal third-quarter results, with a 35.9 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits - excluding extraordinary items - along with official
projections that the parent company would lose Y20bn (Dollars 156.25m) at
the operating level in the year to end-March, have driven this message home
with startling clarity.
'The company really does look overstretched,' said Mr Barry Dargan,
electronics analyst at James Capel.
Mr Dargan calculated that Sony has Y1,000bn in net debt, and that if
goodwill was taken out of the balance sheet, its ratio of debt to
shareholders funds was 150 per cent. 'Clearly they need equity financing,'
he concluded.
The ultimate cause of the deterioration in Sony's balance sheet was the
purchase in recent years of CBS Records and Columbia Pictures Entertainment,
the film studio, for more than Dollars 5bn.
Sony is now having to manage the debt it accumulated to make those
acquisitions, while it copes with a recession in the US and a decline in the
Japanese market that have stunted sales, fired competition and whittled away
margins. Profits it has been able to generate overseas have been further
pared back by the strength of the yen.
On top of this, Sony, in common with all the electronics companies, is
having to cope with a lack of new, hit products of the sort that have kept
the electronics industry bubbling along almost non-stop since the 1950s,
when Sony started with pocket-size transistor radios.
'The consumer electronics industry is dead in the water,' said Mr John
Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer, during a visit to Tokyo yesterday.
Mr Sculley was commenting on why consumer electronics companies such as Sony
were seeking partners in the computer industry in an effort to generate new
types of products. Traditional products, he argued, had little growth left
in them.
In many ways, Sony's troubles are the result of its aggressive efforts to
keep the company growing in an environment that has become progressively
more difficult, and it may yet succeed with a surprise hit product.
Sony began a broad restructuring in 1986 when the rise of the yen following
the Plaza Accord provided a strong incentive to move operations overseas. As
a result, the balance of Sony's operating profits have gone increasingly
toward its subsidiaries, and away from the parent company.
While this makes good business sense, and makes the group stronger, Japanese
investors tend to focus mainly on the results of the parent company, which
must pay the dividend. The income-generating ability of the parent has to
some extent even been eroded by the expansion of the group, since the parent
shoulders a good chunk of research and development costs for the whole.
Thus the expected plunge into the red by the parent this year, following
Y72bn of profits last year, may overstate the difficulties of the group,
even though Sony's projection of a 45 per cent decline in consolidated
operating profits to Y165bn is hardly good news.
The other important move to restructure the company was the expensive
diversification into the recorded music and film industry. This was based on
a recognition that reliance on electronic hardware alone may be insufficient
to secure a good future for the company.
While analysts have criticised the acquisitions as being too expensive and
ill-advised, Sony can at least be credited with helping to foster a
turnround at Columbia Pictures, renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment. The
motion picture group finished 1991 with 20 per cent of US box office
receipts.
Sony film revenues in the three months to December were up by 65.4 per cent
to Y112.6bn compared with a year ago. Film profits - excluding interest
taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - rose by two and a half times from
the first to the third quarter of the fiscal year to Y47bn.
Sony's operating profits from its entertainment business, at Y32.7bn, were
only 30 per cent less than profits from electronic hardware. Sony is no
longer just an electronics company.
There are also bright spots in the results. Sales in the US rose by 16.4 per
cent, while sales in Europe rose by 13.7 per cent even when translated back
to yen. In Germany local currency sales were up by 34 per cent.
Similarly, worldwide sales of 8mm camcorders for the fiscal year are
projected to rise from 3.8m to 4.1m units, colour televisions from 6.1m to
7m units, compact disc players from 9.5m to 13m units, and even video tape
recorders from 3m to 3.5m units.
While this may appear positive, none the less, Sony is not managing to make
much of a profit on the sales.
And the most severe difficulty the company faces is at home, where sales
declined by half a per cent during the quarter and are expected to be off
much more severely in the current quarter. Sony is counting on new product
launches, including its Minidisc recordable CD player, to stimulate growth.
But at the same time Sony is pulling in its horns. The company will slash
capital spending by 36 per cent to Y280bn in the next fiscal year, and as
the burden of depreciation costs begins to recede, the financial results
should at least look healthier.
Whether Sony can re-ignite the sales growth of years past and keep profits
on the rise too is another question.

YAMAHA, the Japanese musical instrument maker, yesterday announced the
appointment of Mr Seisuke Ueshima as its new president.
Mr Ueshima succeeds Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, who was forced to resign during a
row over the company's internal restructuring programme.
Yamaha said Mr Ueshima had taken responsibility for the company's earnings
slump. Yamaha posted a record pre-tax profit of Y15.9bn (Dollars 124.2m) for
the year to end-March 1990. However, a slowdown in the sales of pianos, its
main product, hit revenues. Piano sales peaked in 1990 at 240,000 units and
have fallen sharply, hitting 170,000 units last year.
For the year ended last March, pre-tax profits slumped 10.7 per cent to
Y10.8bn from the previous year. The com - pany's attempt to diversify into
new business has also shown disappointing results.
Mr Ueshima, 57, joined Yamaha in 1958.

<TEXT>
Why can't building societies be more like banks? The Building Societies Act
1986 was intended by parliament to liberate societies from the constraints
of their past so as to allow them to compete on more equal terms with the
traditional rivals for the public's custom - the high street banks.
Unfortunately, the Act left many areas of injustice, and building societies
continue to be bedevilled by their past, and by the too easy assumption that
their aims should retain the simplicity of those of the Friendly Societies
from which they evolved.
But times change, and the larger societies are rightly anxious to offer a
full service to their customers in competition, if necessary, with the
financial strength of the big banks. At present, their hands are tied by the
legislative fetters of the 1986 Act, repeating as it does, the outmoded
constraints of the past.
For example, to be competitive, any financial institution must have ready
access to funds, to take advantage of commercial opportunities as they
arise.
A bank can obtain funds in large quantities and at short notice at
commercial rates. Not so a building society, which must not raise more than
40 per cent of funds in the wholesale market or hold more than 17.5 per cent
of commercial assets except for first mortgages over wholly-owned
residential property.
This is all because originally the only object a society might legitimately
have was to raise funds from the deposits and subscriptions of its members
and use them so that they could buy residential properties for their own use
on mortgage to the society.
How different and diverse are the objectives of building societies now - or
rather, how different are the financial services they would like to be able
to offer their members were it not for the restrictions imposed by the 1986
Act. This is already outdated and it was always too restrictive. Societies
in the 1990s face competition from banks in their traditional home loan
market, and are unable to respond effectively with new ventures of their
own.
The unfair disparity between what a bank can do and what a society can do
was highlighted soon after the Act came into force. The Abbey National, one
of the largest societies, thought its best course to achieve a level playing
field was to become a bank itself.
Banks are public limited companies governed by companies legislation and can
do what they please, since the objects clause of their Memoranda of
Association are extremely wide.
The 1986 Act, however, says only what building societies may do rather than
what they may not do. Any activity not specifically permitted is
automatically forbidden. This includes all new ventures and activities not
thought of in 1986.
At the time Abbey National converted to a plc it listed several areas in
which previously it could not compete with banks. These included the raising
of funds otherwise than by the deposits and subscriptions of members already
mentioned.
There were also such restrictions as the prohibition against lending more
than Pounds 10,000 to any one individual unless secured; the baffling
restriction against owning more than 15 per cent of a general insurance
company; the inability to operate outside the European Community and then
only through a subsidiary company; the inability to develop land except
primarily for residential use; the inability to use some instruments
available to banks for liquidity management.
The results have not all been bad. No building society was able to invest
imprudently in the American banking world because no building society could
invest in America at all. But the restrictions prevent any opportunity for
profit to be made outside the EC.
Even in the UK, a bizarre result of the Act is that it is uncertain whether
any society can take part in a syndicated loan designed to spread the risk
of lending. A thriving market in the purchase by housing associations of
entire stocks of local authority housing has developed comparatively
recently. Sums between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m are usually involved but
there is a prospect of two deals of Pounds 200m or more occurring within the
next year.
Not many banks standing alone would wish to commit themselves to figures
such as these; the situation cries out for syndication. But building
societies, the traditional lenders for house purchase, are inhibited from
taking part because this market was not in existence in 1986 and syndicated
loans were not mentioned in the Act. Some believe this fact prevents any
building society from participating.
There is an urgent need for change by way of amending legislation. The
essential nature of a building society could be preserved by a requirement
that its members could only be investors and mortgage borrowers and that one
of its principal purposes should be to make advances to them to buy houses.
Societies could be required to have perhaps 25 per cent of their liabilities
in respect of share deposits and loans represented by members shares.
Subject to this, any society should be entitled to do anything set out in
its memorandum, to be approved by the regulatory body.
Societies would still pursue their original purpose of lending to their
members but they should be able to raise funds with far less restraint than
today. They should be able to engage in a greater range of financial
activities.
There must have been members of the Abbey National who were dismayed to find
their rights in their own society transferred into a right to acquire shares
in a public limited company supervised, not by the Building Society
Commission, but by the Bank of England. How much simpler it would have been
to remove the restrictions which caused the Abbey National to make the big
change in the first place.
Freedom to operate should no longer be confined to banks and there should be
no need for societies to convert to limited company status to provide full
financial services. All of this seems clear. A greater difficulty would lie
in the choice of a regulatory body. The Building Society Commission, set up
in 1986, has few friends among societies, which believe it has been
restrictive and unhelpful. It has no experience of banking, but this could
be remedied by the recruitment of those in the clearing banks and at the
Bank of England who have.
The only alternative is that all societies which seize the new opportunities
created by an amending Act to provide banking services should be regulated
by the Bank of England.
But the Bank knows little of building societies. Its record as a regulator
is badly flawed. Its recent history is strewn with avoidable disasters in
spotting trouble that stretch from the failure of Johnson Matthey bank in
1985 to the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International last
year. To take on new responsibilities in an unknown field would be to invite
further disasters.
It seems better that the Building Society Commission under its new chairman,
Ms Rosalind Gilmore, should be given a chance to cast aside the restrictive
characteristics of its past and to meet the challenges of an expanded role.
The main purpose of a regulator is early detection and prevention of failure
and fraud. In contrast to the Bank of England, the Commission's record in
this respect is good. As Ms Gilmore said at the Building Society Association
conference in Glasgow last summer: 'Our duty is to promote the protection by
each building society of the investments of its shareholders and
depositors.'
Whenever a society has shown signs of difficulty, the Commission has acted
with commendable speed. Larger societies have been asked to assist and the
result has often been a merger of the weaker with the stronger building
society. The Commission has enforced its liquidity and capital adequacy
requirements well.
It would be a pity to remove from its regulatory control the larger and more
adventurous societies which would be likely to seize the new opportunities
made available to them.
But most societies feel there would be a need for a sea change in the
attitude of the Commission. If there is to be a change in the statutory
restrictions, the attitude of the Commission must also change so as to give
effect to the new liberality and flexibility of the industry it would
regulate.

<TEXT>
AZABU Building, a Japanese real estate company facing increasing financial
difficulties, announced a restructuring plan involving sales of its property
holdings and a freeze in interest payments to its creditors.
The company also appointed Mr Toshimi Shibata, a former official of Mitsui
Trust and Banking, its main creditor, as president. Mr Shibata succeeds Mr
Kitaro Watanabe, the stock speculator and land developer, who supplied funds
to Mr T. Boone Pickens, the Texan corporate raider, in his purchase of a
26.4 per cent stake in Koito Manufacturing, which has close links with
Toyota Motor.
Although Mr Watanabe will retain corporate representative position, Mr
Shibata, backed by Mitsui Trust, which has extended loans totalling Y200bn
(Dollars 1.56bn) to Azabu group, will take actual control.
Azabu's borrowings are estimated at Y700bn, including Y500bn at Azabu
Building.
Azabu's 33 per cent stake in Koito is also a heavy burden on the company.
After Mr Pickens returned Koito's shares to Azabu last year, Mr Watanabe
reached an agreement to sell 54m Koito shares, or 33 per cent stake in the
company, for Y120bn to Carlson Investment Management, an independent Swedish
finance company. However, Carlson has since refused Azabu's offer, due to
doubts over Koito's fulfilment of TSE requirements about the number of
shareholders.
Azabu said it will sell Y280bn worth of property by late next year and will
try to liquidate some of its real estate holdings in Tokyo and Hawaii. Azabu
is in talks with its creditors, including non-bank financial institutions,
over a deferral in loan repayments.
Koito said it was not considering buying back its shares from Azabu, and
hoped Azabu would sell its stake in the market. Koito said the adequate
price for its shares, which reached a high of Y5,470 in March 1989 due to
share cornering, was around Y1,000.

UNIGESTION Holding reported a 58 per cent jump in net income to SFr18.7m
(Dollars 12.50m) in 1991. The Swiss group was created by the Geneva-based
finance company of the same name following its sale last May of the
controlling stake in Banca della Svizzera Italiana, writes Ian Rodger in
Zurich.
The directors have proposed a 52 per cent increase in the dividend to SFr5
from an adjusted SFr3.3. Unigestion Holding last August gave shareholders of
the old company seven of its bearer shares for each one of the old company.
Consolidated total assets stood at SFr514m at the end of the year, of which
SFr208m were invested in securities, SFr130m in cash and approximately
SFr137m in loans.
No provisions were necessary last year, and shareholders' funds stood at
SFr300m, or SFr126 per share.
Consolidated sales of Bobst, the Swiss paperbox machinery maker, rose 9.1
per cent in 1991 to SFr1.1bn, due partly to the easing of the Swiss franc.
The group said in a statement it also expected improved profits.
The 1991 figures are based on EC accounting standards, and eliminate Bobst
Brazil from the consolidation. These changes, if applied to the 1990
figures, would cause a net reduction to consolidated sales of SFr41m.

OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, of Los Angeles, is selling up to half its 48 per cent
stake in its Canadian subsidiary as part of a restructuring to reduce its
debt burden.
Canoxy, which is based in Calgary, filed a preliminary prospectus yesterday
for its US parent to sell about 12m Canoxy common shares to a syndicate of
Canadian underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities.
The shares are being offered to the public on an instalment receipt basis at
a price of CDollars 25.75 a share. Canoxy's share price dropped by CDollars
2.50 to CDollars 25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange immediately after the
announcement. In addition, the underwriters had an option until late
yesterday afternoon to buy an additional 4m shares. Occidental's ownership
will drop to 24 per cent if all 16m shares are sold.
The US company said it had no plans to sell its remaining shares in Canoxy.
It will continue to have four representatives on the Canoxy board, and
business arrangements with the Canadian company will not be affected,
including co-operation in a project in Yemen.
Canoxy separately reported 1991 net income of CDollars 23.1m (Dollars
19.4m), or 35 cents a share, down from CDollars 31.6m, or 47 cents, in 1990.
Dominion Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, is
phasing out its fabrics weaving and finishing plants in eastern Ontario and
Quebec because of persistent losses and the recession's drastic impact on
the clothing industry, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
About 600 jobs will be lost by mid-year.
The company said the fabrics shutdown was part of a broad restructuring
under which activities in Canada were being reduced and emphasis was being
put on expansion in the US, Europe, North Africa and south-east Asia.

<TEXT>
SIR Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday brought together
the two investment companies with which he is associated to launch a
ADollars 127m hostile bid for Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL),
formerly Bell Resources.
The 23 cents per share bid was made through Rossington Investments, an
Australian company jointly owned by GPG, Sir Ron's British investment
vehicle, and Brierley Investments of New Zealand, in which he holds a 2 per
cent stake.
The bid is the first joint takeover attempt by the two companies since Sir
Ron acquired GPG in 1989. He resigned as Brierley Investments chairman in
1990, but remains a director.
Rossington said the bid was conditional on the cancellation of ACIL's
planned sale to Lion Nathan of New Zealand of its 50 per cent share in
National Brewing Holdings, formerly the brewing arm of Mr Alan Bond's Bond
Corporation Holdings.
ACIL would also be required to cancel a ADollars 220m flotation of Bass
Strait oil royalty holdings planned by Weeks Petroleum, in which ACIL holds
a controlling shareholding of 96 per cent.
ACIL said the offer price was 'totally inadequate' and 'highly unlikely to
succeed' because of the conditions. ACIL shares closed one cent lower at 24
cents on the Australian Stock Exchange last night.
Mr Douglas Myers, Lion Nathan chief executive, said Lion Nathan had 'an
absolute and binding contract' for the purchase of National Brewing, which
would give it 100 per cent of the Tooheys, Castlemaine XXXX and Swan brands.
The offer was also rejected by Mr George Haines, managing director of the
Adelaide Steamship group, which owns 19.9 per cent of ACIL. Mr Haines said
the bid was 'far too low,' and did not reflect the company's true value.
Sir Ron said ACIL was 'a company that needs to have a new direction. . . a
company looking for a catalyst, and we are filling a void.' He said the bid
was realistic, but admitted it could fail if the conditions were breached.
As Bell Resources, ACIL was once a vehicle for takeover activity by the late
Mr Robert Holmes a Court, who died last year. It was later part of the Bond
group, which crashed last year.
Mr Geoff Hill, the Sydney merchant banker who has guided ACIL through
extensive restructuring in the past two years, said he intended to go ahead
with plans announced earlier to resign as chairman, but would remain an
adviser to the group. He will be replaced by Mr Alan Batley.

NATIONAL Bank of Dubai (NBD), the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates

interest rates, AP-DJ reports from Manama.
Net profits slipped to Dh412.8m (Dollars 114.6m) from Dh466.3m in 1990. The
bank said lower dollar interest rates last year pushed down dirham rates
because the UAE dirham is pegged to the US currency.
Pre-tax profit fell 12 per cent to Dh411.4m from Dh468.9m. Customer deposits
rose 3.7 per cent to Dh19.84bn at the end of 1991 from Dh19.13bn. Total
assets rose almost 2 per cent to Dh24.63bn from Dh24.14bn.
The bank proposed cash dividends of 40 dirhams per share, unchanged from
1990.

THE Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) yesterday said a reduction in bad
debts helped it record bigger-than-expected net profits of ADollars 229m
(USDollars 176.1m) for the six months to December.
The bank, which was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in September
after the flotation of a 30 per cent shareholding by the federal government,
was expected to announce profits of between ADollars 180m and ADollars 210m.
Shareholders who subscribed to the ADollars 1.3bn flotation were rewarded
with a fully franked interim dividend of 20 cents per share, also
significantly higher than expected.
The result compared with earnings of ADollars 532m in the corresponding
period of the previous year. However, the earlier period included an
abnormal profit of ADollars 328m from the transfer of surplus staff
superannuation funds. CBA said the result should be compared with the second
half of the previous year, when the bank made net profits of ADollars 44m.
The second half also included the operations of the State Bank of Victoria,
which was acquired by CBA for ADollars 1.3bn.
The bank said bad and doubtful debt expense fell 36.8 per cent, compared
with the previous half, from ADollars 640.7m to ADollars 405.1m. The level
of non-accrual loans also fell to ADollars 2.1bn net of specific provisions
from ADollars 2.16bn.
Mr Don Sanders, managing director, said the bank's performance continued to
reflect the effects of recession. Demand for new finance was subdued, and
viable borrowers were tending to repay debt faster, while the debt servicing
capacity of many business borrowers remained severely impaired. He said this
had caused a cut in CBA's assets to ADollars 89.13bn from ADollars 89.29bn
and warned the balance sheet could contract further in the second half. 'Any
such decline would have a deleterious effect on profit, and may affect the
level of the final dividend paid in respect of the current year's profit.'

MANPOWER, the temporary employment business which was taken over by
Britain's Blue Arrow but has now redomiciled in the US, reported a
fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 20m, down from a loss of Dollars 60.2m in
the corresponding period of last year.
The figures included Dollars 19.5m of goodwill amortisation and Dollars 10m
of restructuring charges, compared with Dollars 20.1m and Dollars 51.5m
respectively in the same period of 1990.
After-tax earnings, excluding amortisation and restructuring, came to
Dollars 9.5m, down 16.2 per cent from the Dollars 11.3m of 1990. Corporate
revenues were Dollars 709m, down from Dollars 766m.
For the full year, earnings excluding amortisation and special charges
totalled Dollars 29.4m, down 50 per cent from 1990's Dollars 59.6m.
Mr Mitchell Fromstein, president, said the 1991 results reflected severe US
and UK recession in the first half and a modest US recovery in the second
half.
The company felt the worst was behind it, in that sales levels compared with
the previous year had improved modestly but continuously since mid-summer,
and it expected the trend to continue for the first quarter of 1992.

<TEXT>
PLATE Glass and Shatterprufe Industries, South Africa's largest glass
manufacturer which recently became part of the South African Breweries (SAB)
group, has announced it will be raising R354m (Dollars 125m) in a rights
issue.
The cash will enable PGSI to increase the equity base of its offshore
operations and refinance local borrowings. Some R210m will be used to
recapitalise PGSI's international operations, enabling them to take
advantage of growth opportunities. The balance will, in the short term, be
used to reduce local borrowings.
PGSI's ordinary shareholders will be offered renounceable rights to
subscribe for new ordinary shares at R43 a share, a 20 per cent discount to
the market price of R54 at the time of the announcement.
The move is part of a complex web of transactions announced over the past
two months between PGSI and SAB. The main transaction sees SAB acquiring
54.6 per cent of the equity of Placor, holding company for PGSI, with a
proposed scheme of arrangement in Placor whereby, if successful, it will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAB.
The second leg of the transaction is the purchase by PGSI of UK glass group
Pilkington's effective 48.4 per cent interest in Glass SA, the holding
company for the main part of South Africa's float and automotive glass
industry.
The other legs are PGSI's rights issue and the disposal by Afcol, an SAB
subsidiary, to PGSI of its interest in P. G. Bison, a company that
manufactures and distributes particleboard and decorative laminates.
The rationale for the latter deal is that P. G. Bison is a non-managed,
equity account-ed interest of Afcol. The sale will improve Afcol's financial
structure and provide the funds for Afcol to concentrate on its core
business. It also gives PGSI the opportunity to increase its holding in P.
G. Bison from 47.8 to 71.7 per cent.

HONEYWELL, the US controls group, reported fourth-quarter net income of
Dollars 102.6m, compared with Dollars 109.2m a year earlier, in spite of the
impact of the US and international economic recession.
The profits, which worked through at Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with
Dollars 1.49, were struck on sales which rose 2.3 per cent to Dollars
1.71bn, with each of the company's three main businesses showing revenue
gains.
The group's operating profit was Dollars 199.4m, down from Dollars 203.9m.
Honeywell said operating profits had improved in the home and building
control and industrial businesses, and remained steady in space and
aviation.
For the full year, the company reported net income of Dollars 331.1m, or
Dollars 4.70 a share, against Dollars 382m, or Dollars 5.03, in 1990.
However, the 1990 figures benefited from a lower tax rate - 28 per cent
against 35 per cent - as well as a gain of Dollars 14.3m from asset sales
and Dollars 10m of income from discontinued operations.
Mr James Renier, chairman, said the 'stable, solid results' were a dramatic
improvement over past recessions, and reflected the success of its strategy
in concentrating on the core control business.
The home control division earned fourth-quarter operating profits of Dollars
88.5m, up 3.5 per cent, while orders showed a double-digit increase. The
industrial business made Dollars 66.2m, up from Dollars 65.6m, with a modest
increase in orders.

SIVENSA, Venezuela's largest private steelmaker, is to invest Dollars 300m
in a new plant to produce direct-reduced iron ore briquettes for export.
Mr Henrique Machado Zuloga, chairman, said his company's exports of iron ore
briquettes were aimed at meeting rising international demand for
direct-reduced iron ore in steel furnaces, where it is mixed with scrap
steel.
The briquettes improve the quality of the mixture and help lower pollution
levels, he said.
Sivensa is already one of the world's largest producers of hot briquetted,
direct-reduced iron ore, with installed capacity of over 1m tonnes a year.
The company has turned to European and American capital markets to help
finance its recent expansion.
It was the first Venezuelan company to offer its shares overseas, in the
form of American depositary receipts (ADRs) sold in the US.
The company recently sold shares on the European market through global
depositary shares.

<TEXT>
Prudential Insurance Company of America, the largest US insurer, plans to
cut its workforce by up to 1,000 this year in an effort to trim costs, AP-DJ
reports.
Employees are being offered early retirement and voluntary redundancy, but
the insurer may have to resort to layoffs if there are insufficient
volunteers.
Mr Robert Winters, chairman, has said the company needed to cut its
operating costs.
Prudential Insurance had net income last year of more than Dollars 1.1bn in
1991, up from 1990's Dollars 113m.
Last month, Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, lowered its
assessment of Prudential Insurance's claims-paying ability amid concerns
over possible deterioration in the insurer's real estate and junk bond
investments.
Last year, Prudential Insurance cut 2,000 jobs by offering early retirement.

<TEXT>
NORSK DATA, the troubled Norwegian mini-computer group, made a loss, before
year-end allocations, of NKr810m (Dollars 125.6m) for 1991, against a
NKr134m deficit in 1990. It plans to cut a further 500 jobs.
The deterioration in financial performance was exacerbated by a NKr655m
non-recurring restructuring charge in connection with the group's
transformation into a computer service company.
Operating revenue fell 23 per cent to NKr1.81bn. Total orders last year
dropped by 18 per cent to NKr1.9bn, while orders for computer systems and
solutions fell by 23 per cent to NKr950m. The group's order reserve,
however, rose by 28 per cent to NKr243m.
Norsk Data said developments in 1991 were dominated by the far-reaching
reorganisation announced last September. 'This resulted in a completely new
structure built upon autonomous companies in Scandinavia,' it said.
It said these companies showed a profit in the fourth quarter of 1991, their
first reporting period as separate units.
The company stressed that its biggest problem in 1991 involved ND Comtec and
its German subsidiary. 'The collapse of the Robert Maxwell empire stopped
QED Technology, a Maxwell offshoot, from reaching agreement to buy ND
Comtec.'
As a result, ND Comtec has been wound down and staff has been reduced to 23
from 203.
In Germany, Norsk Data reduced staff by 230 to 165. 'The German operation is
now concentrated and focused on maintenance activities and sales to existing
customers,' the company said.
It said it had cut more than 780 jobs last year within the group, and that a
further 500 jobs would go this year. It would have 1,300 employees by the
middle of the year.
Last year operating costs were reduced to NKr1.8bn from NKr2.31bn in 1990.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIO-MULLER, the diversified Rotterdam-based trading, transport and
engineering group, fell into the red in 1991 but predicted that 1992 would
bring a return to profits.
It posted a net loss of Fl 120m (Dollars 65m) compared with a net profit of
Fl 2.6m in 1990. Turnover was unchanged at roughly Fl 3bn, with the effect
of divestments balanced by internal growth and acquisitions.
In 1991, Internatio divested or deconsolidated 32 companies with a combined
turnover of Fl 600m to focus on two core businesses: trading and technical
installation contracting.
The sharp profits decline in 1991 was due mainly to Fl 90m in reorganisation
provisions and book losses on the sale of subsidiaries. Internatio also
booked a separate provision of more than Fl 25m to cover losses incurred in
developing an automated navigation system for eight frigates ordered by the
Dutch navy.
Internatio said its divestments and reorganisation had set the stage for a
recovery.
It said it would not pay a cash dividend for 1991. It omitted its cash
dividend for 1990 but paid a 2 per cent stock dividend.

ATLAS COPCO, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, reported a 28 per
cent drop in profits after financial items for last year, to SKr910m
(Dollars 154m). Turnover fell 6 per cent to SKr15.03bn.
As a result, Atlas Copco suffered a 30 per cent drop in earnings per share
to SKr14.25, although it is maintaining its dividend at SKr8 per share.
The company said restructuring measures already taken should gradually begin
to improve earnings this year. However, it added that any upturn would be
'subject to business conditions not deteriorating further'.
The compressor technique division reported a 1 per cent decline in orders,
to SKr7.46bn, and a 2 per cent fall in sales to SKr7.36bn. There was a 14
per cent decrease in operating profit in the division, to SKr10.31bn.
The company incurred a SKr47m operating loss - mainly due to restructuring
costs - in construction and mining technique activities, with a 9 per cent
fall in orders to SKr4.52bn and a 7 per cent decline in invoiced sales to
SKr4.49bn.
The industrial technique division suffered a 33 per cent deterioration in
operating profits, to SKr299m, with a 6 per cent drop in orders to
SKr3.23bn. Invoiced sales fell 10 per cent to SKr3.17bn.

<TEXT>
TELE-COMMUNICATIONS Inc (TCI), the largest operator of cable television
systems in the US, has agreed to sell the United Artists cinema chain to a
management buy-out, backed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, for around
Dollars 680m.
The chain comprises 2,398 screens, spread over 502 locations in the US and
Puerto Rico, making it the nation's biggest cinema operator.
No financial details for the cinemas were disclosed, but the price is
thought to represent around seven times cash flow.
The sale follows the acquisition by TCI of all of United Artists
Entertainment's stock last year.
UAE, ranking number three in the cable TV industry, was formed by the merger
of United Cable and United Artists Communications in 1989. After long
negotiations, TCI - already a 54 per cent shareholder in UAE - agreed to buy
out the remaining equity for Dollars 1.1bn in stock and cash.
Since the TCI/UAE merger became a strong possibility, Mr Stewart Blair,
former chief executive of UAE, has been attempting to acquire the
Denver-based cinema chain which, TCI acknowledged, was peripheral to its
cable business.
News of his negotiations first became public last August.
Under yesterday's deal, Mr Stewart - with more than a dozen other members of
the movie theatre chain's management - will be backed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners, which manages two leveraged buy-out funds. It is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Wall Street investment bank.
The deal envisages Dollars 112m of equity funding, provided by management
and the LBO backers; Dollars 92.5m of preferred stock to be issued by the
buyer to TCI; and then a layer of debt financing. Closing of the deal is
subject to financing and certain other conditions.
Yesterday, parties involved in the deal said the plan was to run the cinema
chain on existing lines, and that only a few extraneous pieces of real
estate might be sold off.
The Merrill Lynch LBO funds hold more than 20 investments. The second of the
two funds will be about 50 per cent-invested after this deal.

THE bonds between Italy's biggest banks and insurance companies are to
tighten further with a wide-ranging accord between Istituto Bancario San
Paolo di Torino, the big Turin-based financial institution, and the
Fondiaria group, the country's second biggest private-sector insurer.
The link will come through a rights issue of up to L463bn (Dollars 374.2m)
by Milano Assicurazioni, one of Fondiaria's stock market quoted
subsidiaries, which is to issue 22.2m new ordinary shares and 15.2m savings
shares.
As part of the deal, San Paolo will raise from 6 per cent to around 20 per
cent its stake in Milano Assicurazioni. No details of how the increase would
take place were revealed.
However, it is likely that some, if not all, the shares will come from
Fondiaria, which currently owns 63 per cent of Milano Assicurazioni.
Fondiaria said it would 'participate' in the rights issue but did not make
clear whether it would take up all its rights, saying only that it 'would
retain control of' Milano Assicurazioni.
The new stock will be offered to shareholders on a one-for-two basis with an
additional one savings share being offered for every eight shares of either
category.
A premium for the new shares, which will have a nominal value of L1,000
each, has yet to be decided.
As part of the link-up, Milano Assicurazioni will sell a variety of life and
non-life insurance products through the San Paolo group, expanding an
existing alliance.
The deal involves both San Paolo and the group's two big regional banking
subsidiaries, covering around 775 branches in all.
Fondiaria, which is a one-third shareholder in an important joint venture
formed with Royal Insurance of the UK and Aachener and Munchener of Germany,
said the agreement with San Paolo would roughly double premium income at
Milano Assicurazioni to over L200bn a year.

NOUVELLES Frontieres, the French holiday company, bucked the recession in
the travel market by increasing profits by 62 per cent to FFr112.8m (Dollars
20.1m) in the year to September 1991 from FFr69.7m in the previous year.
Mr Jacques Maillot, president, said that Nouvelles Frontieres, like its
competitors, was affected last year by the instability caused by the Gulf
war and the civil war in Yugoslavia. The company was also hit by the effects
of the economic slowdown. However it increased sales by 14 per cent to
FFr4.46bn.
Nouvelles Frontieres, which has interests in package tours, hotels and
airlines, has emerged as the chief competitor to Club Mediterranee in the
French travel market.
Package tours produced consolidated profits of FFr79.6m in the last
financial year. The division benefited from an exceptional profit of
FFr15.9m from the sale of Nouvelles Frontieres' interest in the Opera-Cadet
hotel company.
Airline activities, which includes Corsair, the charter company, boosted
profits to FFr40m. Distribution made a profit of FFr1.4m.
The only loss-making area of activity was the hotel division, where
Nouvelles Frontieres lost FFr4.7m.

<TEXT>
CALTAGIRONE, an Italian construction group, yesterday beat consortia
including representatives of both the Ferruzzi and Agnelli groups in the
race to win a controlling stake in Cementir, Italy's third-largest cement
manu-facturers.
Caltagirone is believed to have offered around L480bn (Dollars 388m) for the
51.78 per cent share in Cementir, which was put up for sale last year by
IRI, the Italian state holding company, as part of the country's sporadic
privatisation programme.
The price represents a premium of almost 100 per cent over the stake's
current stock market value, and will come as a welcome shot in the arm for
IRI, which is suffering severe financial difficulties.
Its holding in Cementir had a book value of L307.5bn, while the sale price
is also well above the L340bn estimate by SIGE, the Italian merchant bank
which valued the holding.
Cementir had sales of L426bn and produced 3.85m tonnes of cement last year.
The company, which has almost 1,400 employees, had around 9.5 per cent of
the Italian cement market, trailing Italcementi and the Agnelli-controlled
Unicem group.
After a long process, the number of bidders was whittled down to six and
then three, prior to yesterday's final choice. However, the last stage in
the battle maintained the auction's reputation for controversy. The
consortium led by the Ferruzzi Calcestruzzi building arm angrily criticised
a lack of transparency in the adjudication process.
Shares in Cementir, which were on Tuesday suspended pending the outcome of
the auction, will resume trading today.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Rover dives to losses of Pounds 83m -
Recession affects most British Aerospace divisions, though Gulf war benefits
defence and construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROVER Group motor vehicle operations plunged from profits of Pounds 103m
to pre-tax losses of Pounds 83m last year in the face of the deep recession
in the UK new car market.
Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, also suffered an additional
extraordinary loss of Pounds 45m arising from the withdrawal from the US car
market and the costs of closing Sterling Motor Cars, its US car marketing
subsidiary.
Vehicle operations suffered a trading loss of Pounds 52m (profit Pounds
65m). The trading performance improved in the second half of the year,
however, with Pounds 45m of the overall trading loss coming in the first
half.
Turnover at Rover was virtually unchanged last year at Pounds 3.74bn (Pounds
3.79bn) and accounted for a third of BAe's group turnover.
Despite a fall in sales volume and production, Rover's turnover was helped
by an improved model mix and prices increases. The company also stood
largely aloof from the discounting price war started by Ford, the UK market
leader, last summer.
Rover's vehicle production fell by 16.2 per cent to 419,861 (501,323). The
fall was cushioned by a 36 per cent jump in output to 35,952 of the Honda
Concerto (included in the above figures) at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham,
assembly plant.
Honda, the Japanese car maker, owns a 20 per cent stake in Rover's vehicle
operations.
Excluding the Honda production, Rover's car output fell by 19 per cent to
329,335 (406,253), while output of Land Rover four-wheel drive vehicles
(including the Range Rover, Discovery and Defender ranges) fell by 20.5 per
cent to 54,574.
Rover car sales worldwide fell by 12 per cent to 351,588 (400,821) with the
main decline coming in the UK with a 21 per cent decline to 224,278.
Car sales outside the UK rose by 9.2 per cent to 127,310 helped by
significant increases in Italy, Spain and Germany. Japan also remained
Rover's biggest single market for the Mini.
Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman and deputy chief executive of BAe, said
that Rover had reduced its workforce by 6,000 last year (including 2,000
salaried staff) to 35,500 at end of 1991 and a further 400 jobs had been cut
in January.
Rover's financial performance in the second half of last year had improved
'substantially', thanks to swift actions taken to cut costs - Pounds 50m was
taken out of annual fixed costs during 1991.
Inventories had been reduced significantly and had shown a year-on-year fall
of more than Pounds 200m.
The group's break-even manufacturing level had been reduced by 80,000-90,000
vehicles and was now significantly below 450,000 vehicles a year, he said.
Investments this year were expected to fall from Pounds 255m to just over
Pounds 200m in 1991.
Mr Simpson said that Mr Kevin Morley, formerly managing director for Rover
Cars' commercial operations, had left the company during the recent
reshuffle of top management. He remained a non-executive member of the Rover
board but was 'no longer an employee of the company'.
Mr Morley had formed his own company, Kudos, to provide 'integrated
marketing services' to Rover, but it had not yet been decided which services
Kudos would provide and which would be supplied by sub-contractors.
Mr Simpson said that the formation of Kudos was aimed at reducing Rover's
marketing costs per vehicle.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Commercial aircraft side deeper in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REGIONAL aircraft business remains the Cinderella of British Aerospace.
Both Sir Graham Day, BAe's interim chairman, and Mr Dick Evans, chief
executive, conceded yesterday that the company's regional aircraft
activities faced an extremely tough year in 1991 and that the company was
currently talking with other regional aircraft manufacturers to try to
rationalise the sector.
BAe's commercial aircraft operations reported a trading deficit of Pounds
37m last year compared with a Pounds 14m surplus in 1990 in spite of
achieving profits from its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus airliner
programme and its corporate jet activities.
Mr Evans said that in the regional aircraft market there were 'too many
producers producing too wide a variety of aircraft types'.
But he added there was now emerging a consensus among manufacturers to find
a 'common ground' and a 'way forward' for the regional aircraft busi-ness.
BAe produces the 146 regional jet, the Advanced Turbopropeller Aircraft and
the smaller Jetstream turbopropeller commuter aircraft.
These programmes have faced intense competition in a market which has
suffered from the dire financial difficulties of smaller commuter and
regional airlines.
Sir Graham confirmed yesterday that BAe would no longer consider financing
the development of a new commercial aircraft on its own. But although talks
were continuing with other manufacturers, there had been no concrete
indications so far of an imminent partnership deal between BAe's regional
aircraft business and other manufacturers.
However, Mr Evans said the decision of splitting BAe's commercial aircraft
activities into three separate units - including its Airbus activities,
regional aircraft and corporate jets - was expected to help the company
negotiate a partnership deal in the regional aircraft sector.
He also said there were no similar plans for the company's profitable
corporate jet operations.
'Our executive jet business is not on the market', he insisted.
BAe continues to see its stake in Airbus as providing the best prospects for
its commercial aircraft activities. BAe produces all the wings for Airbus
air-liners.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lone bright spot is defence with Pounds
553m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE CONTINUED to provide the backbone of British Aerospace's operating
profits last year in spite of a reduction in military sales.
The group's defence activities, regrouped this year into one division,
showed trading profits of Pounds 500m, up from Pounds 486m in 1990. Profits
before tax and exceptional costs emerged at Pounds 553m (Pounds 504m). Apart
from its construction interests - partly defence-related through military
infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia - defence was the only sector in the
black in 1991.
This was despite British government defence spending cutbacks and a tough
world market. These combined to reduce BAe's military sales during the year
by 8 per cent to Pounds 4.27bn, notwithstanding the rush of extra business
during the Gulf conflict.
The profit boost came mainly in the first half of the year, with profits of
Pounds 281m from defence, including military aircraft, guided weapons and
munitions.
Exports, principally to Saudi Arabia, made up 70 per cent of defence sales.
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said he expected contracts under the second
phase of Britain's Al Yamamah agreement with Saudi Arabia to be concluded
'in the fairly near future'.
The framework agreement for further UK arms exports including more
Anglo-German-Italian Tornado fighter-bombers and BAe Hawk jets was signed by
the two governments over 3 1/2 years ago.
Mr Evans poured cold water on reports that Saudi Arabia might be poised to
take a shareholding in BAe. 'It has never been discussed with us. We don't
have knowledge of it,' he said.
Development of the European Fighter Aircraft with German, Italian and
Spanish partners was 'progressing well', he said, predicting that the first
two prototypes would be flying soon after mid-year.
Mr Evans said he expected a UK government to decide 'very soon' on a
close-range air combat missile for the RAF - a decision crucial to the
future of the company's guided weapons business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FBD Holdings, the insurance and property development group, has increased
its interests in Spain through its FBD Properties subsidiary.
It has become the sole owner of Ranchos Reunidos, which is currently
developing La Cala Golf and Country Club in southern Spain and in which it
previously held a 48 per cent stake.
FBD is now accelerating completion of the 620 acre project, which currently
has one golf course and club house finished. The next phase includes
residential properties, shopping centres and a hotel.
Total cost of the project to date is Pounds 25m and a further Pounds 7m will
be invested before the year-end. Pre-bookings, of sales to be completed,
exceed Pounds 8m and the company is confident that the sales budget for the
year of Pounds 10m will be achieved.

   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southdown Building Society incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.8m in 1991,
after bad debt provisions of Pounds 14.1m.
The loss was the fourth to be announced by a society in 1991. In November
Southdown agreed to merge with Leeds Permanent after it was evident it was
heading for a loss.
Southdown said that about half the provisions were made against residential
mortgage lending and the rest against losses on building finance and
commercial lending.
At the end of 1991, the society had assets of Pounds 746.3m. Members of the
society will vote on the merger with Leeds at a special general meeting on
March 11. Savers will receive a 1 per cent bonus on the lowest balance in
their accounts between November 23 and the merger, and borrowers will be
given a 0.5 per cent cut in their interest rate for six months.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Clegg denies unlawful share dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Clegg, who resigned three weeks ago as managing director of Wace
Group, the printing services company, denied last night that he had in any
way been involved in potentially unlawful dealings in the shares of Parkway
Group, one of Wace's most ambitious acquisitions.
Mr Clegg left the company after a press article on January 26 alleged links
between Wace and the IRA. Wace immediately denied any such links.
It has become clear that Wace's funding was investigated last year by
security forces, and no evidence was found of links with the IRA.
However, Wace's internal inquiry since Mr Clegg left has revealed that up to
4m shares in Parkway - about 9 per cent of its capital - were bought in the
names of Mr Clegg's cousins and others at the same addresses in the months
before Wace's bid on August 1 1990.
Wace has passed a dossier on these dealings to the Department of Trade and
Industry.
Mr Clegg said yesterday, in a statement issued through his solicitor, 'I
have never acted on, or provided to others, any price-sensitive information.
I am more than happy to co-operate in any enquiries which may be conducted
by the London Stock Exchange, or the DTI.'
He had 'little alternative but to resign' as the other directors of Wace
'became concerned at the possibility of continuing rumours regarding myself
and my family which in the climate created by the original article they felt
might be damaging to Wace.'

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad surges to Pounds 31.6m
despite international instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO make their living selling foreign holidays to the British
continued to defy the recession yesterday when Owners Abroad, the UK's
second biggest package tour company, announced full-year pre-tax profits
more than doubled from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 31.6m.
The results, which beat City expectations, came at the end of a year in
which the travel companies were rocked by international instability.
Apart from the general downturn in consumer spending, the Gulf war reduced
holiday bookings last January and February to unprecedently low levels. The
civil war in Yugoslavia resulted in the industry losing what had previously
been the holiday destination of some 500,000 Britons. Owners Abroad did
benefit, however, from the collapse last March of International Leisure
Group.
Although the number of charter package holidays sold in the UK fell from
11.7m to 10.4m last year, Owners Abroad's results suggest that many
consumers are continuing to buy foreign holidays, despite cutting back on
the purchase of other goods.
Mr Howard Klein, chairman, said: 'I believe this is largely due to the fact
that a foreign holiday is no longer regarded as a luxury but as a necessity,
and that people are extremely reluctant to give up something for which they
have worked hard and saved hard and looked forward to all year.'
Turnover rose from Pounds 497.9m to Pounds 643.6m. Fully-diluted earnings
per share improved to 12.6p (8p). The proposed final dividend of 2.2925p
brings the total for the year to 3.2p (2.9p).
As a result of the Pounds 28.9m rights issue last March the company held a
cash balance of Pounds 73m at the year end.
COMMENT
It must be galling to see your shares fall after you have more than doubled
profits in the midst of arguably the worst recession in living memory. The
3p drop in Owners Abroad's shares yesterday to 117p was, however, widely
seen as profit-taking by a market which had largely anticipated the good
news. Even so, to anyone unfamiliar with the history of package travel in
the UK, the shares look cheap. Expected pre-tax profits for the current year
of Pounds 37.5m and earnings of 13.2p put the company on a prospective
multiple of slightly less than 9. The low rating partly reflects nervousness
about a possible price war. The company insists that the industry has learnt
the lessons of the late 1980s and that its price-slashing days are over. It
insists it is driven by profit rather than market share and believes the
same is true of other large travel companies. However, Thomson, the leading
operator, has vowed it will protect its market share against Owners Abroad
and Airtours, the industry's number three. While the industry continues to
talk tough, it can hardly complain if memories of its misspent youth still
linger.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Redland resumes war of words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND, the building materials group which is making a hostile Pounds 625m
bid for its rival Steetley, yesterday resumed its assault after receiving a
favourable indication from the trade and industry secretary on Tuesday.
With Steetley's rival plan to merge some of its operations with Tarmac
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Redland has written to
Steetley shareholders amplifying previous criticisms and making new claims
about cost savings.
It has not so far moved on its offer of 85 shares for every 100 of
Steetley's, with a mainly cash alternative. The offers value Steetley's
shares at nearly 400p or 361p respectively, compared with the target's
closing price of 388p.
The latest document attacks Steetley's profit performance over the past five
years, its high gearing - 67 per cent on net debt of Pounds 242m, low
interest cover and intention to pay an uncovered dividend.
It questions its claim to have a focused business and criticises its efforts
at expansion overseas, notably in France.
The new claim for annual cost savings of Pounds 30m raised eyebrows at
Steetley. Mr Richard Miles, managing director, said: 'We don't believe that
figure.' He challenged Redland to spell out how it would be done.
He also retaliated against the comparison of profit records, saying that
Steetley had performed better than Redland over the past 10 years in terms
of increases in pre-tax profit, earnings and dividend.
The Takeover Panel said yesterday that the bid timetable would resume after
the secretary of state announced that the Redland offer would definitely not
be referred to the MMC. The announcement was expected soon after February 25
and 'day 39' would be two days later.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons hit by Alma collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMA, the confectionery company which went into receivership yesterday, was
the second largest holding in the portfolio of Drayton Consolidated
Investment Trust.
The trust said it had already written down the value of its holding in Alma
last year, as part of a review of its unquoted portfolio which resulted in a
Pounds 37m provision.
But even after the write-down, Drayton advanced further loans to the company
before attempts were made to sell the company late last year after its
performance had deteriorated sharply. Drayton's final exposure in terms of
equity and debt was Pounds 19.8m, equivalent to 11 per cent of its total
portfolio.
The trust, managed by Invesco MIM, said that 'no recovery which would be
material in the context of net asset value is expected from the equity or
loans in Alma'. The effect of a complete write-off will be to knock about
57.8p off the trust's net asset value, which at the last balance sheet date
was 422.4p.
In August, a sudden fall in its share price prompted Drayton to issue a
statement detailing its exposure to unquoted companies. Drayton's share
price has fallen from a peak of 587p in late 1989.
A number of investment trusts specialising in the unquoted sector revealed
write-downs of assets last year, as the recession battered the finances of
smaller companies. Investors have questioned the methodology used by
investment trust managers to value unquoted assets.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BP board changes 'unconnectedwith results'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL CHANGES to the main board of British Petroleum were announced
yesterday, a move which will strengthen the role of executive directors. BP
will also get its first female director.
The changes were triggered in part by the departure yesterday of Mr James
Ross, the managing director in charge of BP's US operations, to become chief
executive of Cable and Wireless. Mr Ray Knowland, another managing director,
is leaving having exceeded retirement age. Sir Campbell Fraser, a
non-executive director, is retiring after 14 years on the board.
In their place, BP is appointing three executive directors, Mr Steve
Ahearne, chief financial officer, Mr Rodney Chase, who will take over Mr
Ross' US responsibilities, and Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP
Chemicals.
A new non-executive director is Ms Karen Horn, chairman and chief executive
of Banc One, the Cleveland banking group. She will become the first woman to
penetrate the BP boardroom.
The changes mean that all BP's principal divisional heads now have seats on
the board under Mr Robert Horton, chairman and chief executive. Last year,
Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, and Mr Russell Seal,
chief executive of BP Oil, were made managing directors.
The changes give BP eight executive directors and nine non-executive.
BP said the changes were unconnected with last week's poor set of 1991
results. BP denied at the time that there had been any divisions in the
board over dividend policy.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington gets Dollars 40m for Coburn
Optical
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington, the glass group, has agreed the sale of Coburn Optical
Industries, a US subsidiary which makes spectacle and contact lens
processing machinery, and expects to receive the Dollars 40.3m (Pounds
22.9m) cash consideration by its March financial year end.
Coburn was put on the market last May when Pilkington hoped to sell it for
more than Dollars 50m. It said yesterday that in the current climate the
price achieved was not disappointing. It is likely to see a small loss on
the sale. The purchaser is a private company controlled by Mr Robert Jepson,
a US businessman.
The disposal is part of Pilkington's programme of selling non-core
activities which has raised about Pounds 200m over the last two years. The
money will be used to reduce debt.
Pilkington acquired Coburn when buying Visioncare, Revlon's eyecare
business, for Pounds 361m in 1987, but it was not considered an essential
part of that business.
Although Coburn was profitable, Visioncare plunged into losses and its
future was uncertain. When Pilkington reported interim figures in December
it said that Visioncare had returned to trading profits, and since then has
said it would not sell Visioncare.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bank adopts peacemaking role - 'Honest
broker' attempts to end Brent Walker/GrandMet dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England has been acting as a peacemaker to end the dispute
between Grand Metropolitan, the drinks conglomerate, and Brent Walker, the
leisure group.
'The Bank has been acting as an honest broker', said a banker with a close
knowledge of the talks. A settlement with GrandMet has been the last hurdle
to be cleared by Brent Walker in its year-long attempt to reconstruct its
balance sheet and avoid receivership.
However, it also emerged yesterday that the refinancing of Brent Walker  -
which owes Pounds 1.5bn to more than 50 banks - could go through as soon as
next week, whether or not a deal with GrandMet is struck.
Brent Walker owes GrandMet the Pounds 50m deferred payment on its Pounds
679m purchase of the William Hill bookmaking chain. But it is
counter-claiming almost Pounds 300m, which it said is owed by GrandMet,
because William Hill's profits have been less than expected.
The banks had originally stipulated that they would only reschedule their
loans to Brent Walker and convert some of the debt into equity if GrandMet
also agreed to defer its Pounds 50m claim on Brent Walker.
But a banker said that the banks' patience was almost at an end. So the
banks are likely to drop the condition that Brent Walker reach agreement
with GrandMet before the refinancing is finalised. They are no longer
frightened of the consequences if GrandMet exercises its right to put Brent
Walker into receivership.
'In the short term, the losses for us on our loans to Brent Walker would be
identical, whether or not it is in receivership', a banker said.
An offer has been put by Brent Walker to GrandMet that - as part of the
reconstruction - Pounds 20m owed to GrandMet should rank ahead of the banks'
loans in the pecking order for repayment and that the remaining Pounds 30m
should rank alongside the banks' loans. 'We have made GrandMet a very
attractive offer', said a banker.
'If it does not accept and puts Brent Walker into receivership, it will end
up with nothing', said another banker. The banks have also told GrandMet
that they would provide funds to a receiver to allow the receiver to pursue
GrandMet through the courts for payment of the Pounds 300m.
'GrandMet will not come to the negotiating table', said one of the group's
principal bankers, who are owed more than Pounds 1.5bn. Because of its
reluctance, Standard Chartered, the bank acting as co-ordinator of Brent
Walker's banks, recently arranged for officials at the Bank of England to
attend a meeting between Brent Walker and GrandMet.

FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life declines to Pounds 305.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, yesterday announced profits
before tax of Pounds 305.5m for 1991, a 4.2 per cent drop compared with the
previous year.
The share price fell 11p to 379p on the news, mainly in reaction to the
company's decision not to increase its final dividend. The total for the
year is 17.3p, up from 17p last time.
The company pointed out that pre-tax profits in its insurance businesses
rose from Pounds 263.5m to Pounds 294m, and it was optimistic that its core
strategy of selling life assurance and pensions to the customers of Lloyds
Bank would continue to succeed.
However, Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, admitted: 'Our non-insurance businesses
have once again been severely affected by the recession, with bad debts in
Lloyds Bowmaker continuing at a high level and the deeply depressed property
market further reducing profits in the residential business of Black Horse
Agencies.'
Within its insurance businesses, Black Horse Financial Services, which sells
life products to customers of Lloyds Bank, saw pre-tax profits increase by
34 per cent from Pounds 67m to Pounds 89.5m, and Lloyds Bank Insurance
Services, selling general insurance, advanced 12.1 per cent from Pounds
48.7m to Pounds 54.6m.
However, Abbey Life barely improved its position, increasing pre-tax profits
by only 0.4 per cent from Pounds 142.3m to Pounds 142.9m.
On the non-insurance side, pre-tax profits at Lloyds Bowmaker dropped 55 per
cent from Pounds 50m to Pounds 22.3m, while Black Horse Agencies incurred a
loss of Pounds 1.4m.
Mr Roman Cizdyn, an analyst at Smith New Court, pointed out that from the
point of view of the dividend the profits had been made in all the wrong
areas of Lloyds Abbey's business. He said: 'A lot of the profit is not
distributable because it is embedded in the life business.'
However, Mr Roger Harvey, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the dividend had
always been a 'finely balanced decision'. He said it reflected a prudent
approach by the new chairman to the recession, and had not been forced on
the company by any unforeseen circumstances.

FT  20 FEB 92 / A cautionary tale of banking in Spain: The fall from
investment glamour of Ibercorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-five years ago, when Mr Manuel de la Concha, former president of the
Madrid stock exchange, was a mere agente de bolsa, or stock market notary,
one of the people who entrusted an investment portfolio to him was his good
friend Mr Mariano Rubio, now the governor of the Bank of Spain. He must now
be wishing he had not.
For Mr de la Concha's story has become a cautionary tale of modern Spain and
threatens the credibility of a chunk of Spanish investment banking.
Taking advantage of the economic good times after Spain joined the European
Community in 1986 and a rush of Spanish brokers and bankers into new
financial services, Mr de la Concha and his partner, Mr Jaime Soto, built
their Ibercorp group into the most glamorous of the small new investment
banking conglomerates. By last year, Ibercorp's clients had placed some
Pta21bn (Pounds 116.3m) under its management, ranking the group's bank among
the country's top 20 in that category.
Ibercorp was one of the first of the new boutiques which marketed themselves
as personal fund managers and pioneered a Spanish twist to the mergers and
acquisitions strategies they were learning from bigger competitors.
The small Spanish financial groups - especially after the liberalisation of
the stock markets in 1989 made it clear there would not be much margin in
straight broking - began to buy weak investment targets and restructure them
before floating them off or selling them directly to foreign buyers.
This worked well but then the Gulf crisis throttled the stock market.
Ibercorp bought and tried to float a metal shelving company but had to sell
it back to its original owner in late 1990. Earlier, it had bought an office
furniture group, Sistemas AF, turned it around and then sold off the assets,
keeping the holding company for itself.
Some of the money Mr Rubio had lodged with Ibercorp was invested in this
rump, now renamed Sistemas Financieros. In spring of 1990, its stock came
under heavy selling pressure, with one of the big buyers being the company
itself, which accumulated heavy treasury stocks. Soon after, the shares
collapsed.
Among the shares bought back at good prices by Sistemas Financieros, were Mr
Rubio's, along with some other public figures. They are now being accused by
the press of receiving favoured treatment from Sistemas Financieros while
other shareholders were left to take losses.
Mr Rubio is in considerable trouble, especially as his second term of office
ends this summer. He confirmed that last Monday he offered his resignation
to the finance minister but was told to stay on. His going would be a pity,
because he has skilfully presided over the liberalisation in Spanish
banking. Mr Rubio's total portfolio is worth only Dollars 120,000 (Pounds
68,400).
'I never paid any attention to my portfolio,' he said yesterday. 'I had
always said that if I needed to know something about the portfolio I would
ask.' Mr Rubio is to appear before a parliamentary commission today to
answer questions on the affair.
Mr Rubio's real problem, it seems, was in leaving his portfolio with
Ibercorp in the first place and that Mr de la Concha invested it in a
company he controlled. As the Spanish stock market has slumped, it has
become clear that many of the small financial services groups created in the
past four years simply do not have the the capital with which to cushion
themselves against hard times.
The Bank of Spain, which has handed out banking licences to boutiques since
1986, got its first taste of trouble last year when Banco Europeo de
Finanzas, the head of a mini financial services conglomerate, found itself
unable to meet a Pta17bn obligation in the interbank market. The bank was
sold off to its creditors.
The BEF saga frightened larger Spanish banks into freezing interbank
business with the boutiques and Mr Rubio was forced to set aside about
Pta40bn to ensure that others did not get into similar trouble. 'For a while
we simply stopped lending to small banks,' says a senior Madrid banker.
Spain's banking crisis of the early 1980s, in which about 40 banks had to be
rescued, still jangles nerves.
Every time a niche opens in Spain - the latest is unit trusts - the
boutiques and their larger foreign and domestic competitors have rushed to
fill it. 'In the good times,' says the governor, 'everyone wants to do the
same things.' But as the scope of the boutique business has spread, so have
Mr Rubio's nerves been stretched.
Earlier this year, the finance ministry and the Bank of Spain took the
unusual step of declaring that no bank would be allowed to go to the wall.
Now, as some small banks report tight conditions on the interbank market,
the Bank of Spain is again offering to help with liquidity.
'The other small banks will have time to deal with any problems,' Mr Rubio
promises, but conceded that the scandal surrounding Ibercorp was creating
problems for the bank.
Not only is Ibercorp being accused of favouring powerful clients but when
the stock market commission began investigating the share sales by Sistemas
Financieros, Mr de la Concha inexplicably altered the names of some of the
sellers - Mr Rubio became 'M Jimenez', Jimenez being his mother's name. The
media assumed he was trying to disguise the names.
This is dynamite in a country concerned about its international image as a
cliquey, corrupt and impenetrable place of business. It has also become
clear that an audit by Arthur Andersen of the Ibercorp group stated its 1990
losses were some Pta2.5bn higher than the Pta473m group loss Ibercorp had
publicly declared. Ibercorp is now up for sale. The Bank of Spain has
offered it, in vain, to almost all of Spain's large commercial banks. 'We
have always done this sort of thing when banks get into trouble,' Mr Rubio
said, but 'this is not a very good year for banking. The market is very
competitive.'
He said there was 'some optimism' that a buyer could be found 'but it is not
certain'. Ibercorp, he said, would normally easily survive, but constant
attacks in the press 'can create problems for any institution'. Investors
have withdrawn about Dollars 11m from Ibercorp's managed investment trusts -
about a third of its unit trust portfolio - since late last week.
If Ibercorp fails, so could Spain's experiment with specialised investment
banking. And Mr Rubio's position as chief regulator could become untenable.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Drayton Consolidated hit as Alma appoints receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Drayton Cons-olidated Investment Trust fell 43p to 147p yesterday
on the announcement that receivers had been appointed to Alma Holdings, an
unquoted confectionery company in which Drayton was a main shareholder.
Alma, which is headquartered in Dundee, Scotland, owns some of Britain's
oldest and most popular sweet brands, including Barker &amp; Dobson, Keillers,
Bensons, Hacks and Victory Vs. It has about 7 per cent of the sugar
confectionery market.
Mr Rod Owen of receivers KPMG Peat Marwick said his immediate priority was
to sell the company, and that he was in contact with several prospective
buyers. The company would continue trading, and all staff would be kept on
for the moment.
Alma, with six operating subsidiaries which have been placed in
receivership, has annual turnover of about Pounds 52m and employs almost 800
people. In the 18 months to June 30 it made a Pounds 10.5m operating loss.
Drayton first invested in Alma in October 1988, when the family-owned
company underwent a Pounds 29m management buy-out led by Mr Mario Maciocia,
whose father founded Alma, and simultaneously acquired the Barker &amp; Dobson
confectionery business for Pounds 9.75m.
Since then, the company has been rationalised and opened a factory. A new
management team was appointed in 1990. However, its financial performance
was handicapped by unexpectedly large losses at Barker &amp; Dobson and by a
high level of debt, which stands at Pounds 22m.
Mr Maciocia was reported to have admitted that Alma over-stretched itself to
buy Barker &amp; Dobson.
Drayton said yesterday that a buyer had been sought for Alma after sales in
the final quarter of last year fell well below budget. Following a worldwide
tender process, discussions began with an unnamed prospective bidder.
However, following a further deterioration in Alma's performance this year,
the bidder withdrew 'in favour of an asset-based purchase'. A receiver was
appointed after it became clear that such a deal would have rendered the
rest of the business insolvent and that Alma's bankers and shareholders were
not prepared to extend financing.
Alma has factories in Dundee, Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes and a sales office in
Manchester.

FT  20 FEB 92 / BAe maintains dividend despite Pounds 81m loss: Shares rise
11% as City welcomes strengthened cash flow Defence profits increase to
Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE reported yesterday a pre-tax loss of Pounds 81m last year
compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 376m in 1990.
The result was much in line with City expectations but better-than-expected
cash flow in the second half of last year, as a result of a reduction of
working capital, sent BAe shares 11 per cent higher. The shares closed
yesterday at 303p, up 30p in a day which saw the highest volume of trading
in the company's shares since July 1988.
The company maintained its final dividend at 16.1p bringing the total for
the year to 25p a share, the same as 1990.
Profits before tax and exceptional items amounted to Pounds 154m against
Pounds 400m. This was Pounds 4m higher than its autumn forecast.
Exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 235m were taken to cover the
company's rationalisation programme.
However, after a substantial cash outflow in the first half of last year,
the company said it achieved an underlying cash inflow of Pounds 630m in the
second half mainly because of strength in its defence activities and a
reduction in working capital at its Rover car subsidiary.
With the benefit of its Pounds 432m rights issue, the company finished last
year with a net cash balance of Pounds 323m against Pounds 711m.
BAe's defence business accounted for the lion's share of the group's
earnings with trading profits before interest of Pounds 500m compared with
Pounds 486m. Commercial aircraft operations reported a trading loss of
Pounds 37m compared with a surplus of Pounds 14m. The regional aircraft
operations faced particularly difficult market conditions, said Sir Graham
Day, BAe's interim chairman.
The Rover car subsidiary faced tough market conditions but contained trading
losses before interest to Pounds 52m, compared with Pounds 65m the year
before.
The property development business saw its losses grow to Pounds 24m last
year from Pounds 8m, while construction activities increased profits to
Pounds 40m from Pounds 28m.
The group's total sales were virtually flat at Pounds 10.56bn last year
compared with Pounds 10.54bn in 1990.
Sir Graham said BAe expected to appoint a chairman and finance director at
its annual meeting in April or May.

The strangest thing about the board changes at BP is their timing. A week
ago, the poor annual results were accompanied by sincere expressions of
boardroom solidarity. Now that looks distinctly hollow. The individual
changes may be logical enough, but as a whole they give an impression of
turmoil. BP's chairman has been out wooing the big institutions of late.
After yesterday that is going to be an even harder job.

FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: German banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German banks are preening themselves on their bumper profits in 1991 in
spite of the steeply inverted D-Mark yield curve. Apparently they have
learned from the early 1980s when Commerzbank in particular ran into trouble
through mis-matching assets and liabilities. But the banks also received
generous help last year through a combination of high loan demand and a
supply of retail deposits at rates well below those that applied in the
money market.
Neither benefit is likely to last. Credit demand will fall away as the
economy slows, while persistently high money rates will make depositors more
demanding. Hardest hit will be savings banks, but even large commercial
banks will be hard pushed to grow their lending profits. The race is on to
cut costs and raise fee income, which helps explain why banks are taking a
tough line with the unions. For all the machismo of its dividend increase,
even Deutsche Bank will have to work hard. It has a large stock of retail
deposits and has invested heavily in becoming the largest player in the
former East Germany.

FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It says much about the nervous disposition of the Japanese equity market
that it should have fallen by 1.2 per cent on reports, later confirmed, that
Sony Corporation is heading for its first annual operating loss since its
listing in 1958. Sony's difficulties were evident at its interim results, so
the news should have long been in the price. By the same token, there is
widespread talk in Tokyo of nasty profit falls at the corporate year-end in
March. When a market is this apprehensive, it takes a brave investor to
decide that all the bad news is discounted.
Indeed, the slide in the Nikkei index over the last week has been
sufficiently alarming to have reopened the prospect of emergency measures
should it threaten or fall through the 20,000 level. Those who remember the
rigorous defence of the equivalent technical level in 1965 think a repeat
performance is coming: the favoured intervention by the authorities is a
sharp cut in interest rates, perhaps of  3/4 point.
Such a knee-jerk response should at least stabilise the market by making
equities cheaper. It might also be justified on domestic economic grounds.
But the yen, weak already, would surely suffer on the foreign exchange
markets. That might cause capital adequacy problems of a different sort for
the banks because of their still large overseas assets. It would also leave
any investors left in the market looking for stocks most heavily geared to
the US economy including, ironically, Sony.

FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Abbey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was presumptuous yesterday to expect a more generous final payout
from Lloyds Abbey Life. Distribut-able profits in 1991 surpassed dividends
by 25 per cent, but it is hard to see the company being comfortable with
cover much below the 1.4 to 1.5 times favoured by the old Abbey, and by
Hambro Life before its takeover by BAT.
A more legitimate question for investors is where future profits will come
from to sustain the present rating of the shares. After-tax profits of the
established insurance business have grown just 17 per cent over the last
four years, and are bound to feel the draught this year from the newly
created J Rothschild Assurance. Bowmaker is in the doldrums, and may well
require a further Pounds 100m provision in 1992 as individual and small
business borrowers suffer disproportionately at this stage in the cycle.
Black Horse Agencies desperately needs a turnover increase in the housing
market, but few expect the current increase in inquiries to translate
quickly into higher sales. All this puts enormous pressure on the company's
continuing ability to sell life and general insurance products through the
bank - a market which is far from exhausted but which cannot continue to
grow indefinitely.
On the face of it the shares look well supported with a 6 per cent yield and
an historic multiple of just 12 at last night's closing price of 379p. That
is forgetting the cloudy dividend prospects and the sharp premium which
investors are paying over embedded value. They are not yet cheap.

FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BAe begins the long haul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,536.7 (-19.2)
Even after yesterday's figures, it requires considerable faith to believe
that the shocks are over at British Aerospace. Certainly, the effort to
improve cash-flow, particularly the inventory cutback at Rover, is
impressive. But after last year's upset, a still suspicious market will want
to double check the annual report for signs of window-dressing to boost the
cash position. BAe also has to demonstrate that it can continue to contain
its working capital and even squeeze it further.
In theory the company should be looking forward to an eventual period of
rapidly improving profits as its Airbus investment pays off, its promised
defence contracts with Saudi Arabia are finally signed and a turnround in
the UK car market produces a steep jump in Rover's margins. But none of
these cash-rich prizes are yet secure. Meanwhile, the regional jet market is
depressed; the Airbus programme still requires heavy investment spending;
and the company has no permanent chairman to shape its long-term future.
The shares thus retain an essentially speculative quality in spite of their
31p jump to 303p yesterday. That gives a historic yield of 11 per cent, more
than twice the industrial market average. But Sir Graham Day was careful not
to commit his successor to any future dividend policy. On past performance
BAe seems most comfortable with a dividend cover of about three, requiring
earnings of at least 75p. With that still a distant prospect, the payout at
best may only be maintained for several years to come.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: Percentage route to resolving problem of skilled
staff transfer fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Like many of your readers I have been wrestling for years with the
practical difficulty of silver handcuff transfer fees as some recompense for
the training costs of employers whose skilled staff are poached or hired by
others.
The problem is to give the losing employer control of the funds from which
to reimburse himself while protecting the employee from unfair restrictions
on movement or a loss of any withheld earnings.
A solution might be to allow an employer to withhold a percentage of gross
salary from the first two years' earnings of any employee earning over, say,
Pounds 250 per week.
The money would be held in an external fund outside the company like a
pension scheme. The employer could reclaim 100 per cent of the employee's
deductions if they were to leave within, say, two years and 50 per cent if
they leave within three years.
If the employee remains, he or she can reclaim the money plus interest, less
tax, in year four or perhaps pass it over to their company or personal
pension fund, tax free.
In practice a new employer would probably be pressed to offer a golden
'hello' matching any deductions sacrificed by recruits and this would shift
some of the training costs borne by the old to the new employer.
If the current employer went bust the fund, assuming it's not a Maxwell type
group, would not be a corporate asset and employees would receive their
deductions plus interest as part of a tax-free termination payment.
Let me stress that employers would be free to deduct or not deduct, as they
saw fit, and would probably only use this technique for staff whose
departure would represent a very serious loss to the company of training or
contact skills.

Sir, In your article, 'Sony chief says accountants should not lead
industry', (February 7) I could not agree more with Mr Akio Morita. Only I
would dare to go further in saying that the basic experience of entire
boards of directors of most companies today are founded on heavy financial
backgrounds. This leaves the important decisions being made by managers who
have no true understanding of their own manufactured product.
And, worse, it leaves no common ground in their relations with the
workforce, which itself is rich in the grassroots experience required for
the overall creation of the product. That detachment can most definitely
lead to great, and unnecessary, financial and labour losses.

Sir, While it is true, as reported by Clive Cookson ('BTG sell-off likely to
see only two bidders' February 19), that our joint venture with Sir Ronald
Mason has withdrawn from the bidding process for BTG, the inference drawn
that we are dissatisfied in any way with Price Waterhouse is incorrect.
In extremely difficult circumstances imposed by government on the
privatisation process, Sir Ronald Mason and I found the PW team to be
unfailingly helpful and highly professional. We would like to record our
thanks to them.
The tortuous and constrained process imposed by government has, no doubt,
been affected to some extent by the imminent general election.
However, the twin objectives of obtaining the highest price, while requiring
continued investment in new technologies, may be unattainable through a
venture capital route and privatisation.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: ILO will see off critics, insists TUC leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Some of your readers may have been alarmed by your headline reporting
Prof Keith Ewing's description of the International Labour Organisation as
moribund (Employment, February 17).
Contrary to what was reported, the body of international labour conventions
has continued to grow in significant ways in the 1980s with the adoption of
new instruments on collective bargaining, safety and health at work, and
last year on working conditions in hotels and catering.
Prof Ewing was quite right to focus attention on the damage done to the ILO
by the British government in persisting in its violations of conventions
protecting basic human rights. But he was wrong to imagine that a body
which, almost alone among international agencies, survived the demise of the
League of Nations and took the withdrawal of the US for two years in its
stride, will not prevail.
I am heartened by the firmness with which the ILO supervisory bodies have
withstood the attacks on them by the British government. Of course, it does
weaken the ILO when a government of the country which has made a greater
contribution than any other in building it up as the most effective agency
in the UN system for promoting development and social justice, shows an
invincible insolence towards its well-based criticisms of GCHQ and of
several policy areas. This is not without its costs to Britain in terms of
embarrassment to allies and charges of hypocrisy.
I recall that not so long ago the regimes in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania
and Brezhnev's Soviet Union adopted a similar approach to the ILO's
criticisms. My money is on the ILO to see off present attacks and strengthen
its role in protecting working people in all countries for which it is
uniquely equipped and which is more than ever needed.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Give 2 3/4 cheers for a hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We used to be told by psephologists that a hung parliament - one in which no
party has an absolute majority - was very unlikely in the UK, however close
the two main parties seem to be, because of the vagaries of the British
voting system. Now, however, the same experts seem to regard it as much more
likely; and I hope they are right.
Most City writers have expressed an opposite opinion. Until very recently,
they were saying that a hung parliament would be the worst possible outcome
for sterling. The cliche explanation is that uncertainty is bad for markets
 -which ignores the fact that players in financial markets earn their living
by dealing with risk and uncertainty and should thrive on so doing.
A stock remark used to be that a government dependent on third-party support
would shrink from taking tough unpopular measures. But which tough measures
exactly? The economy needs a fresh monetary or fiscal squeeze like a hole in
the head. What is needed is a willingness to exercise patience until Germany
has got over the hump of its unification problems and interest rates in
Frankfurt start to fall. It means accepting that, whatever small changes in
British interest rates can be squeezed in, the UK is basically in the same
boat as Germany. It means, too, avoiding huge spending increases or
unaffordable tax cuts.
But, alas, my advice to concentrate in the Budget on purely temporary and
self-reversing measures to boost investment and spending has fallen on deaf
ears. There may be some temporary measures. But the emphasis is all too
likely to be on the cruder type of tax bribes such as real increases in the
tax allowances, 1p or 2p off the basic rate, or quite likely both. This will
be combined with some other morsels such as a reduction in the Uniform
Business Rate (for which a case can be made) and cuts in Inheritance Tax or
Stamp Duty.
John Lipsky and Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers, who canvass a list of
this kind, usefully remind us that the 1991 Budget contained an overspill of
Pounds 1.6bn of extra revenue not due until 1992-93, owing mainly to the
delayed effects of the VAT increase and National Insurance contributions on
company cars. The Treasury could call this bonus in aid, to make a tax
remission of Pounds 4bn look more like Pounds 2bn. Indeed, I can imagine
Norman Lamont being personally more hesitant about fudging his medium-term
tax strategy than either his political colleagues or even some of his
official advisers.
It would only take a moderate shortfall in economic growth below that
assumed in the Autumn Statement and a moderate tax give-away to take the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement to the Pounds 25bn to Pounds 30bn range
in 1992-93. This would represent 4 to 5 per cent of gross domestic product.
It takes the eye of faith to believe that deficits of this size are entirely
due to the recession and that the Budget is still in balance over the whole
cycle - remembering too that privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn per annum
are abnormally large and almost certain to go down in the next parliament.
I do not want to pretend to austere fiscal beliefs which I do not really
have. Even the Maastricht treaty, of which the Bundesbank approves, allows
for a Budget deficit of 3 per cent of GDP; and no less a financial hawk than
the Bundesbank vice-president, Hans Tietmeyer, accepts that this should be
considered over the whole economic cycle. Moreover, the UK has a small
public debt ratio compared to other European countries.
But that is hardly a reason for moving in the wrong direction. An excessive
budget deficit in the coming couple of financial years would be like a slow
fuse. Tax moves of the size for which we are being prepared would be
chickenfeed as a Keynesian fiscal stimulus, but enough to cast doubts on the
government's medium-term fiscal strategy. My own view is that the timing and
extent of the climb out of recession will depend on the usual mixture of
animal spirits and monetary policy. The latter will depend more on German
wage bargaining than on anything Mr Lamont can do.
The best case that can be made for cutting income tax is that by increasing
the likelihood of a majority Conservative government it will cheer up
business and middle-to-affluent consumers - an argument I have heard even
from Labour-voting economists.
This takes us straight back to the hung parliament with which I began. Those
who fear it have not realised that under a so-called weak government, the
power over interest rates will shift decisively to the Bank of England.
There has already been a partial and pragmatic shift under the influence of
European developments and economic fashion. It would go much further under a
chancellor who could not even tell the governor that he had a parliamentary
majority.
The most satisfactory long-term result would be two hung parliaments in a
row, which really would put electoral reform on the map. From a purely
short-term financial point of view, there is much to be said for a Labour
government dependent on Liberal Democrat support. Mr Paddy cards here better
than Jo Grimond, Jeremy Thorpe and David Steel did in the past - would
prevent Labour from pushing up marginal tax rates to 60 per cent, although
he would sensibly help it to abolish the ceiling on employees' National
Insurance contributions. As Giles Keating of Credit Suisse First Boston
writes: These pressures 'plus the Liberals' . . . commitment to making the
Bank of England independent could offset the pressure on sterling which
might otherwise be caused by political uncertainty.'
But from the more important long-term viewpoint of constitutional reform, a
Conservative government dependent on Liberal Democrat support  - and not
strong enough to get by with Ulster Unionist support - would be a better
bet. For since the Second World War, whenever Labour has formed a minority
government, the electorate has finished the job by increasing Labour's
strength the second time round.
In the last analysis, attitudes to two hung parliaments in a row should
depend, not on financial market reactions, but on whether one would like to
see constitutional reform, which would include a move to proportional
representation.
Unlike many PR supporters, I have never used the argument that PR would be a
'fair' system. My reason for supporting PR is that there would be less
danger of party zealots trying to impose 'irreversible transformations' on
British society not by persuasion but by what Lord Hailsham called 'elective
dictatorships'.
One of the few contributions that has made me pause is a pamphlet* by the
Oxford political scientist Nevil Johnson, who was formerly sympathetic to
these arguments. He has changed his mind, not as a result of cheap debating
points about changing Italian governments, but of studies concentrated on
Germany where PR has produced stable administrations. He is now impressed by
the absence in Germany of the personal 'competition and risk' existing in
Britain under which politicians 'perform on a high wire without a safety
net'. In Germany, by contrast, members of the political class are there for
life with little danger of losing their seats or their livelihood.
The main reason why I still back PR is that the danger of elective
dictatorships, although less obvious than in the 1970s and 1980s, is dormant
rather than dead. Moreover, the present system still gives undue influence
to those interest groups and clusters of attitudes which are
over-represented in the Labour and Conservative parties. Other checks and
balances are, of course, required, including a constitutional court and an
independent central bank - all much less likely under the winner-takes-all
system.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: Total Quality Management more than blind faith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD DENSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Writing about the Baldrige award in his interesting article
(Management, February 3), Martin Dickson struck a rather controversial note
by describing Total Quality Management as 'a kind of corporate religion'.
While accepting that strong commitment is needed, I believe this description
could discourage many practically minded chief executives from adopting TQM.
In this UK-based consultancy, TQM is regarded as applied common sense, not
least because it improves customer satisfaction, while substantially
reducing costs, leading to a marked increase in net profit. Blind faith
would rarely have this effect.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Beating up on Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE is it written that New Hampshire always gets it right. But, as often
as not every four years, this small New England backwater sends a message to
those who would lead the United States. It did not shirk its duty this time.
The obvious lesson of Tuesday is that President George Bush can be turned
out of office in November if the Democrats can find the right candidate,
which is still by no means certain. Not even New Hampshire's notorious
cocktail of iconoclastic conservatism and current recession can disguise the
fact that in the Republican primary Mr Patrick Buchanan racked up a protest
vote comparable in numbers to that won by Eugene McCarthy in 1968, which
helped persuade Lyndon Johnson not to seek re-election. This is serious
stuff for a sitting president, even if Mr Buchanan himself has a minimal
chance of being the Republican nominee.
Slow tempo
But it takes at least two to dance and, on the Democratic side, the tempo is
still slow. The victory of Mr Paul Tsongas, from neighbouring Massachusetts,
may be considered a local preference, unrepeatable as the battle moves south
and west. It may suggest that his sober, sensible campaign struck some
chords which could yet resonate nationwide. Governor Bill Clinton's relative
recovery from the smears that had surrounded him means he lives to fight
another day on more favourable turf. The write-in vote for Governor Mario
Cuomo was, predictably, negligible, underlining the difficulty for late
entrants, no matter how famous. Nothing is yet resolved except to make more
likely an early winnowing of the field.
Until now, the two races have proceeded on parallel tracks, crossing only to
the extent that Mr Bush has been the target of both his party challenger and
the Democrats. But this now changes. How the president responds to Mr
Buchanan will be avidly noted for later use by the Democrats, as will be any
clear hits the challenger scores.
Worst option
So what should, or rather will, Mr Bush do? The worst option would be to
descend into a battle on Mr Buchanan's chosen ground over who is the more
isolationist and the more xenophobic. Mr Buchanan has flourished by picking
holes in the once impregnable Bush aura, not by presenting viable
alternatives. It follows that the president should concentrate on what he is
good at, primarily the management of external policies. There is enough on
this agenda in the shape of Gatt, the Middle East and helping the former
Soviet Union, to occupy any president to the public's satisfaction. But this
must be supplemented, even exceeded, by initiatives to tackle the domestic
problems which are so much on the electorate's mind. These will need to be
better than as outlined in his disappointing state of the union address last
month. All this might amount to a modified Rose Garden strategy.
There is something in Mr Bush's character and record, however, which
suggests an aversion to the electoral high road. He seems to love a fight
but not to know how to wage one, unless, as in 1988, he is run by hardnosed
political operatives. Their absence this time should not be mourned but,
without their script, Mr Bush seems bereft of direction. This spells more
trouble unless the economy revives or the Democrats again pick a turkey.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Leading Article: In defence of local politics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE three good reasons for welcoming yesterday's report from the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation calling for a new relationship between central
and local government.
First it lifts its eyes above the UK parish pump to look at what is
happening in the rest of Europe. It finds that the UK is unique in the EC in
the degree of conflict between central and local government and in the
reduction of the functions and financial freedom of local government. Yet
local government offers a means of delivering local services which is more
diverse and responsive to local needs than central administration. It is
also a vital part of a pluralist democracy, which encourages participation
and a sense of community.
A second reason for welcoming the report is its emphasis on the desirability
of finding cross-party agreement on the role and structure of local
government. There has been little gained and much lost from 20 years of
organisation and reorganisation in local government in response to the
pendulum swings of politics. There is still no end in sight to the turmoil:
the rest of the 1990s will be largely devoted to bedding in a successor to
the poll tax and introducing unitary authorities. It would be worth the
upheaval if it produced a stable outcome commanding support across the
political spectrum. Unfortunately, this is not yet in prospect.
Third, the report stresses the need for finance, functions and structure to
be inter-related. A patchwork of reforms is unlikely to break the cycle of
decline. This lesson has not been digested by either of the main political
parties, both of which are currently peddling replacements for the poll tax
in the absence of a clear blueprint for structure and functions in local
government.
The report rightly comes down heavily against further emasculation of local
authorities. The government's assumption that councils are irresponsible and
inefficient is not only corrosive to relationships between central
government and local government. It also weakens local government by making
it unattractive to men and women of ability. It is appropriate that public
services which require local discretion and initiative should be the
responsibility of local government. Education and social services fall
obviously into this category; local councils could also take an increased
role in a devolved health service.
That does not mean returning to the all-providing municipal socialism of
old. The model of the enabling council, which promotes the delivery of
services by private companies, co-operatives and - occasionally - the
in-house team now enjoys sufficient support across the spectrum for its
survival to be no longer in doubt.
The report is also correct to stress the importance of giving local
government a substantial and stable tax base. The recommendation that at
least 50 per cent of local revenue should come from local taxation, compared
with less than 20 per cent now, should be a starting point rather than a
target. If local authorities were to continue to do what they now do, a
local income tax or some other additional tax mechanism would be
inescapable.
But if local authorities are to levy income taxes, they need to become more
representative. The capricious and dictatorial one-party council will not be
abolished by proportional representation, but it would become far less
common.

POWERBROKERS: AN INSIDERS' GUIDE TO THE FRENCH FINANCIAL ELITE
Leslie Mitchell de Quillacq
Lafferty Publications Pounds 500
Pity the poor Enarchs. The graduates of France's elite Ecole Nationale
d'Administration (ENA) enter the school hoping to learn how to run the
country, or to chair a big company. They leave it only to find themselves
pilloried by the French press and haunted by the government's threat to
banish their alma mater from Paris to Strasbourg.
Now the Enarchs' role in the French financial establishment has been
scrutinised by Leslie Mitchell de Quillacq in Powerbrokers.
This book is not just concerned with Enarchs, but with the background of
everyone who occupies a powerful position in French finance, most of whom
happened to study at ENA.
'The path to influence and status in the French financial sector is clear,'
concludes the author. 'It's best to be born into an upper-class family and
go to a top Parisian lycee, then to the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de
Paris (Science Po), and then to ENA, where it is necessary to graduate in
the top 10 in order to become a member of the Inspection des Finances (part
of the inner circle of the Finance Ministry). This should be followed by a
stint in the French Treasury and time in a ministerial cabinet to get the
requisite political patronage.'
None of this is new. It only takes a cursory acquaintance with the men -
they are almost all men - who run France's big banks and insurance groups to
realise that their lives have run in tandem since they first bashed each
other over the head with their Babar books at the age of three.
But Mitchell de Quillacq does work out who really matters in this world by
applying a system devised by Professor Charles Kadushin of the Yale School
of Management.
The method involved compiling a list of all the people in senior positions
within France's financial institutions. They were then asked who else should
be on the list. Each interviewee was asked to name the 20 people whom they
believed to be the elite. They were also asked who had influenced them
personally and whom they considered to be their friends.
The author was left with a list of 124 people, two of them women. She then
compiled two 'top 20s' - one of the 'elite', the other of the 'wielders of
influence' - weighted according to the number of votes received by the voter
so that 'the elite, in effect, chose the elite and the influential'.
There were a total of 27 names (all male) in the two top 20s (that is, there
were names on each list that did not appear on the other). Both were topped
by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, once assistant director of the private office of Mr
Pierre Mauroy, the former Socialist prime minister and now chairman of Union
des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group.
Mr Claude Bebear, his counterpart at the private-sector insurer Axa, was
second in the elite list followed by Mr Michel David-Weill, the senior
partner of Lazard Freres, the Paris-based merchant bank. Two other bankers -
Mr Andre Levy-Lang of Paribas and Mr Michel Pebereau, the chairman of Credit
Commercial de France - came second and third respectively in terms of
'influence'.
Having identified the 124, Mitchell de Quillacq could then calculate exactly
how many of them really did conform to the educational cliche of a stint at
Science Po followed by a spell at ENA.
The short answer is almost all. Two-thirds of the top 27 went to Science Po
as did half of the 124. The same proportions of both groups went to ENA.
Almost all Enarchs went on to join the civil service, later moving into a
ministerial cabinet or private office.
Perhaps the best illustration of the narrowness of background of France's
financial elite is that half the top 27 and two-fifths of the 124 went to
one of three Parisian lycees: Louis le Grand, Henri IV or Janson de Sailly.
Mitchell de Quillacq undoubtedly succeeds in identifying who wields the
power in French finance and the common strands in their histories. What she
does not do is examine whether ENA's influence is any more pervasive in
France than that of other elite institutions' elsewhere. Think of Tokyo
University in Japan, Oxbridge in the UK or the Ivy League in the US.
Nor does she analyse the effect of filling the top positions in France's
financial establishment from such a tightly defined pool of people. The
reader is left with very little idea as to whether this is good or bad, and
as to what sort of people they are other than that they probably went to
ENA.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Hands off Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago the world went to war to re-establish the frontier between Iraq
and Kuwait, which President Saddam Hussein had presumed to remove. It did so
on the basis of UN resolutions calling on Iraq to withdraw its forces 'to
the positions in which they were located on 1 August 1990'. It is reasonable
to assume that almost all those involved in the war, on the coalition side,
believed they were fighting to restore Kuwait's territorial integrity as of
that date, and not to assert any Kuwaiti claim to territory until then held
by Iraq.
After the war, however, the UN Security Council became 'conscious of the
need for demarcation of the said boundary', and set up a commission to
demarcate it. That commission is now reported to be about to award to Kuwait
several oilfields hitherto owned and exploited by Iraq, and part of the
Iraqi naval base at Umm Qasr.
Whatever the historical basis for this finding, no Iraqi, irrespective of
his or her feelings about Mr Saddam and his policies, is likely to regard it
as other than an assertion of jus victoris, in clear violation of the
much-vaunted UN principle that the acquisition of territory by war is
inadmissible. No Iraqi government will voluntarily accept it, and if the
Security Council imposes it by force it will, in effect, be inviting Iraq to
try the fortunes of war again, choosing a more opportune moment.

If British, European and world champion Wilf O'Reilly doesn't win the gold
medal in the 1000m short track speed skating final in the Winter Olympics
today it won't be for lack of interest among the broadcasters. The poor old
BBC have had so few British contestants to follow that they have gone wild
over Wilf. David Coleman will be describing his efforts in Olympics Today on
BBC2 (6.00) and again in Olympics 92 on BBC1 (11.25).
Happily Red Dwarf returns for a fifth series (9.00 BBC2). This is not
necessarily the most intellectually stimulating comedy ever written but it
does have several advantages: instead of being set in suburbia it is set in
a space ship, and instead of being middle-aged it is youthful. Having one
character who is a hologram and another who is a robot definitely extends
the comedy potential.
One of America's most popular middlebrow soaps also returns: LA Law
continues to mix the legal, social and sexual lives of its characters into a
steaming brew (9.00 ITV).
Channel 4 comes to the end of its series about The Germans (9.00) while BBC2
continues its series about the Spanish: Fire In The Blood (9.30).

FT  20 FEB 92 / Arts: Twyla Tharp and Dancers - City Center, New York / The
latest Tharp company and works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even if Twyla Tharp were never to make another great dance, she would have
already long been a symbol, an American success story and an icon of
crossover. She is the 1960s experimentalist who in the 1970s choreographed
for the Joffrey Ballet (Deuce Coupe, to Beach Boys music), for Baryshnikov
and American Ballet Theatre (Push Comes To Shove) and for John Curry (After
All); and who in the 1980s choreographed for the movie of Amadeus, for New
York City Ballet and the Paris Opera.
For many of us, though, she made her very best work on her own dance
company. When that folded in the 1987-88 season, Baryshnikov took Tharp,
those dancers who chose to follow, her repertory (and, it was said, her
debts) into American Ballet Theatre, which he then directed. But only a
season later Baryshnikov left ABT; and when her three-year contract there
ended, Tharp left too, taking her dancers and most of her repertory with
her.
Now (like Baryshnikov and his White Oak Project) Tharp is working with a
pick-up group: ie a company that is hand-picked, rehearsed, sent out to
perform on tour, and then disbanded. Twyla Tharp and Dancers (her old
company used to be called Twyla Tharp Dance) was formed last autumn for an
Ohio State University residency, where it rehearsed at length, learnt two
new works (Octet and Men's Piece), several old ones, and then performed. On
January 28 the troupe opened a two-week New York season at City Center; it
has now gone on to Japan for three weeks, and there is talk of a European
tour in the summer.
For the New York season, Tharp presented another new work, Sextet, and also
Grand Pas: Rhythm of the Saints, a pas de deux she had made for the Paris
Opera last autumn. All four new works were warmly acclaimed by audiences;
and, unlike many of Tharp's 1980s productions, all were economically
produced and unobtrusively lit. Three of them were definitely ballet, with
women on pointe and with turned-out legs; and they raise the questions that
has kept growing larger ever since Tharp began choreographing for ballet
companies: is she really classical? Can she, the great crossover
choreographer, cross over the whole way?
If you can accept that there is much that is ballet that is not classical
and - more important - much that is classical that is not ballet, then you
can accept that Tharp was a classical choreographer before she ever came to
ballet.
She says that Men's Piece is about the twist: which, she reminds us, in the
late 1950s and the '60s tore men and women from each other's embrace. Will a
man and woman be able to dance together again? She tries various solutions.
The most exciting is a march for Tharp and all four guys, working together
on equal terms, filling the stage with one great dance arc after another;
and the most touching is an Astaire-type ballroom duet to Gershwin's 'He
Loves And She Loves', because Tharp shows not only the romance of bygone
convention but also her mixed feelings about committing herself to that.
The point of Men's Piece was to let us know that she is going to go on
experimenting. It was pleasingly unfinished, un-slick. A lecture-demo, a
collection of sketches in progress, a life-in-the-day-of-the choreographer,
it is a real grabbag work. No scenery; dancers in rehearsal kit. Tharp -
baggy overalls over her dance gear, her mop of hair now elegantly grey -
dances with her old lithe authority; and she talks - to her dancers, to the
sound technician and to us.
Septet and Octet reaffirm my belief that no choreographer today is working
in ballet with Tharp's command of the form's dance potential. (But then,
these are bleak days for ballet.) Sextet, a Latin ballet for three couples,
is set to a commissioned score by Bob Telson that mixes various Latin dance
rhythms with a basic bubble-rock beat. Tharp's choreography, masterfully
arranged round this, is a frothy carnival of steps, an audience pleaser, but
strangely anonymous.
Octet, to a new rock-cum-classical music by Edgar Meyer, is more tentative,
less amiable, more rewarding and more Tharpian. Its four couples - women in
black leotards and shorts, men in black vests and trousers, all against a
black backdrop - fuse ballet vocab. with streetwise, rock-related
characteristics. The mood keeps changing - aggressive, floating, sportive,
tense, ebullient - and one level of your mind floods with admiration just as
another thinks 'So what?' It is a remarkable work, but it is also Tharp
saying 'See what I can do.' (Her Opera pas de deux, Grand Pas: Rhythm of the
Saints, is something one wishes she could not do: a smug Parisian joke about
the standard classical ballet gala item.)
The season also featured five older Tharp works. The Little Ballet is one
she made in 1983 for Baryshnikov to Glazounov music. Not even Balanchine
made Glazounov sound so American and contemporary as Tharp does here; and
she makes her hero look not princely but modern. I have never known a Tharp
dance more limpid and open-hearted. Another '80s dance, The Golden Section
(from The Catherine Wheel, 1981), was under-rehearsed, but Nine Sinatra
Songs (1982), with its seven contrasting dance/love duets, was as
overwhelming as when the Tharp company danced it at Sadler's Wells in 1983.
From the 1970s came the revivals of two pop pieces - Ocean's Motion (1975),
a light bubblegum work to Chuck Berry songs, and Deuce Coupe - or, as Tharp
calls her latest version, Deuce Coupe IV. The characters here are just kids,
too; alongside the ballerina in white who, central to proceedings but
removed from them, goes through her lexicon of steps. Everyone else is pop,
swinging, rippling. The beauty - you can't miss it - is that she's Tharpian
too. Pop and classical meet as equals.
Tharp's illustrious array of dancers gives new significance to the word
'pick-up.' They come from New York City Ballet, from downtown New York
modern dance troupes, from the Paris Opera, from Tharp's own former company;
and several of them reached new highs in their careers. Here are just three:
the exquisite Delphine Moussin, on leave from the Paris Opera (she danced
the Deuce Coupe ballerina with ravishing stretch and delicacy); Robert
LaFosse, on leave from New York City Ballet (giving The Little Ballet his
own boyish sweetness); and Jamie Bishton, virile and spontaneous, a true
Tharpian who followed Tharp into American Ballet Theatre and, three years
later, out of it again.
But the great wonder was to see them and their colleagues together on the
same stage in the same choreography. True, this company will fold; true,
these dancers will go their several ways. And yet this season was a happy
one. It brought back something into the air that so many bygone Tharp
seasons used to bring and that had been missing: optimism.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Arts: Cumbre Flamenca - Sadler's Wells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cumbre Flamenca is returned to Sadler's Wells, and that is sufficient news
to send the faithful flocking as to a shrine. The production and the cast
remain much as on previous visits - La Chana, she of the purring heels and
headlong energies, is alas not with the group this season, though her
replacement, Mariquilla, is a grand acquisition - and the cumulative power
of the evening is as tempestuous as ever.
We go to watch Flamenco of this quality to be astounded by wild virtuosity
from dancers, singers, guitarists. We also go, and this is the deeper
reason, to see interpreters who become possessed by their art. Isadora
Duncan's words after a transcendent performance were 'The god was with me',
and the preliminary half of each Cumbre Flamenca scene seems an invocation
to the divinity who will, if all is well, then drive the artist onwards for
the final intoxicating and intoxicated outburst - and this is as true of the
musicians as of the dancers. It is fascinating to see the performers
starting from cold, relying upon skill and savoir faire, and then becoming
(or at least seeming to become) taken over by the style and the language of
their art.
It is thus, at Tuesday night's opening, that we were first held by Nino del
Tupe's tremendous guitar solo, in which he brooded over melody, probed and
developed it, and drew us into his world as he caressed notes or spat them
out at us. So, too, with the tiny, stalwart Mariquilla, starting her
Alegrias on what looked like automatic pilot, and then gradually yielding to
the urgings of singers and musicians as her legs flashed out and embroidered
the dance's metre. At her best, at her most self-sacrificing, she generated
a heady combination of spontaneity and exact rhythmic control.
The other dancer to take similar fire was Cristobal Reyes in an astonishing
partnership with Pedro Montoya's clapping. The opening sequence was fine,
and not a little cliche-ridden (whence the arched body, and the 'You have
insulted my sister' look), but when driven by - and echoing - Montoya's
prodigious hand-claps, Reyes lost every predictable mannerism, and burned
his way into the dance. Our applause was incense - the god was pleased - and
the brilliantly controlled improvisations and variations goaded feet and
limbs to fresh marvels.
An especial merit of Cumbre Flamenca is the varied talents and styles of the
five dancers - three women, two men - and I salute the opulent manner of
Angela Granados as she manipulated a train whose ruffles became an essential
aspect of her art. By turns carapace and coils from which her body reared,
as if to strike at us, her dress amplified every step. Juana Amaya is a
traditional artist, and fine, but I find her most interesting when she
appears at her angriest - stamping in solid, heavy movement; striding the
stage and suddenly squatting into a step - and the dance becomes raw,
dangerous.
There is nothing raw or dangerous about Antonio Canales' performances: these
are polished, elegant, and alone among his colleagues he seems determined to
remain in complete control of his dancing. Its gloss and bravura look oddly
out of place in an evening in which we can still sense certain earthy truths
about dance and our response to it.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Unaudited figures leave annual reports
in the shade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE INVESTORS rarely do it; financial journalists don't often do it;
even analysts supposedly poring over the figures do not always seem to do
it. Lots of people fail to scrutinise companies' annual reports.
Most focus instead on interim and preliminary announcements, reacting
rapidly to the information they provide. This makes auditors feel rather
insecure about their role, and some are now calling for the figures to be
audited.
Interim announcements generally contain simple profit and loss information
on a company's half-year results. Preliminaries contain similar information
for the full year. Both are issued as soon as possible after the figures are
prepared because they are price-sensitive. Neither is audited.
The consequence is that half-year externally verified figures appear in the
annual report and accounts only months after the interims, while those for
the full-year may be published several weeks after the 'prelims' come out.
The announcements are released to the Stock Exchange regulatory news
service, and accompanied on the same day by a flurry of press releases and
company briefings for analysts and journalists. These, in turn, rapidly
generate newspaper articles and reports from securities houses.
The annual report, by contrast, is a neglected animal. Research into its
significance is equally neglected. Little has been added to the academic
literature since a study more than 10 years ago by Mr David Tweedie, now
chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, while he was professor of
accounting at Lancaster University and technical director of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
From questionnaires sent to the private shareholders of Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries, he showed that the chairman's report was the most
frequently read part of the entire document. Just over half said they read
it thoroughly. At the other extreme, 37 per cent said they did not even look
at the notes to the financial statements.
In a separate survey, he found that even among institutional investors and
stockbrokers, 20 per cent did not read the notes to company accounts
thoroughly, while about 10 per cent did not scrutinise the balance sheet and
9 per cent did not study the profit and loss statement closely.
The importance of the unaudited figures over the delayed but more
comprehensive and audited ones is clearly indicated by share price
movements. As the graphs for Wellcome and ABF illustrate above, a company's
shares often move sharply after its prelims are announced, as well as after
interims. The release of its annual accounts rarely inspires more than a
blip, however.
The issue is generating angst among accountants. A technical release just
produced by the financial reporting and auditing group of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales addresses the weaknesses with
existing arrangements for prelims*. The nature of interim statements is
currently under the scrutiny of both the Auditing Practices Board and the
Cadbury Committee on corporate governance.
Nor is the concern entirely new. Mr Edmund Dell, secretary of state for
trade in 1976-78, chaired a committee supported by Coopers &amp; Lybrand on 'the
audit judgment' in 1987, which was subTrade and Industry. It recommended
that auditors should carry out a review of interims before they are
published, and consent to the figure in the prelims before they are
released. Both should be accompanied by an audit statement, it said.
'It is depressing that so much effort goes into something that attracts
little attention,' says Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse and
vice-chairman of the auditing committee at the institute which introduced
the topic for discussion late last year. 'There is something slightly
anomalous when the primary document governing the communication of results
doesn't have particularly stringent rules governing it.'
The rules governing the contents of interims are sparse. There is no
legislation, and the only guidelines that exist are the listing requirements
issued by the Stock Exchange, which stipulate basic profit and loss account
information. Those for prelims are even less comprehensive, although they
state that the accounts should have been agreed with the auditors as the
basis for completing the annual report.
'It would be a foolish board of directors which publishes information
knowing the auditor disagrees,' says Mr Ward. But he stresses that the
degree of co-operation shown varies considerably. 'The reality is that
auditors have neither the power to prevent the publication of a preliminary
announcement, nor the right to comment if they disagree with (its) form or
content,' his paper concludes.
He argues that prelims which are released unaudited leave open the potential
for inaccuracies. There may still be formal confirmations outstanding on
certain figures, including balances and receipts, and reports from overseas
subsidiaries. There may also be post-balance sheet events to be taken into
account. 'While most material issues should be confirmed by then, there are
still judgments to be made on the numbers,' he says.
Mr Ward suggests that with a little more planning - and the encouragement of
stricter Stock Exchange requirements - the auditors and the directors could
easily co-operate to produce audited prelims, while delaying their release
only slightly, and with little extra cost.
What his paper omits is the extension of the argument to interims, where
many of the same issues arise. It also fails to consider what additional
information both statements could usefully provide - although Mr Ward says
he personally would like to see greater balance sheet information and a
distinction drawn between continuing, acquired and discontinued operations.
Examples of actual differences between the figures quoted in the prelims or
interims and those published in the annual report, are also hard to find.
The Stock Exchange says that it conducted some research a few years ago but
it was unable to unearth any cases where variations arose.
Nevertheless, the issue certainly deserves a wider debate. Since most users
of accounts seem to pay so little attention to annual reports, they ought at
least to give serious thought to the nature of the figures on which they do
so much rely.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Technology: Catalogue grows of IT woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and European information technology managers share a common headache:
trying to find a match between their information systems strategy and their
company's business goals.
The problem emerged as the central issue in surveys carried out last year by
the US consultancy CSC Index among senior information systems executives at
444 US and Canadian organisations and 122 European companies.
The surveys reveal a worrying lack of co-ordination between IS departments
and corporate planners. In the US, for example, 41 per cent of technology
executives said they were insufficiently involved in the planning activities
of their organisations.
The results of the survey*, now in its fifth year, also show a measure of
disenchantment with the results of IT. Using IS for competitive advantage
for example, a hot topic throughout the 1980s, has dropped to 11th place on
the European managers' list of concerns and 14th on the US list.
At the top of the table in the US are bread-and-butter worries like
re-engineering business processes through IT, creating an information
architecture and utilising data. The Europeans are chiefly concerned about
developing an IS strategic plan, and improving the quality of their IS
staff.
The results confirm surveys which show the difficulty companies are having
in extending efficient data processing - accounting and payroll, for example
 -to effective IT.
Data processing budgets will continue to be shaved as a consequence of the
recession and pressure to produce a better return on investment. In Europe,
average IS budgets are estimated to grow only 5.2 per cent this year
compared with 9.2 per cent in 1991. In the US, comparable figures are 3.5
per cent and 5.3 per cent.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Technology: Robots set sail for Thamesport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two hundred tons of steel come to a precise halt, a hoist is lowered, the
spreader locks on to a 40-foot container and winches it more than 100 feet
into the air.
At first sight there is nothing particularly unusual about the towering
cranes going about their business at the Pounds 140m Thamesport deep water
container terminal on the Isle of Grain, the first purpose-built container
port in Britain.
But these are 'robot' cranes and they are being controlled and monitored not
by a chunky mainframe, but by a desktop PC sitting several hundred yards
away in the port's office block.
What is more, the computer knows the position of every container in the
seven quarter-mile long 110-foot high 'stacks'. It uses magnetic swipe cards
and radio modems to direct a truck driver to the right position to collect,
or to deliver, a load.
Thamesport, which began operations in May 1990 and will have a capacity of
400,000 con-tainers when the last of its three development phases is
completed, is probably the world's most automated port.
Three years ago, when Thamesport was still in the planning stages, Keith
Archer, Thamesport's business systems manager, was charged with developing
an automated container port system which would provide a quick and efficient
service with the minimum manning levels and cost. And, unlike conventional
ports, it would permit the servicing of ships and haulage independently.
'I had to get it up and running fast,' Archer recalls. Initially he looked
for a packaged software system to control the port's complex administration,
communications and cargo handling needs. He settled on a customised solution
based on the Global 3000 Development Suite from TIS Software, a subsidiary
of the Misys computer services group.
Working with Farnborough-based software house Advanced PC Products, Archer
designed the main elements involved in the automation of the port, the back
office administration system and port control system.
One of the most innovative features of the Thamesport's system is the
control of remote peripherals. Using customised communications software,
radio modems and swipe cards the system supervises the movement of all
machinery within the port, including the five monster ship-to-shore 'robot'
cranes and the 14 gantry cranes, which unload the containers from the ships
and then organise them into the storage stacks before loading them on to
trucks. At the moment the cranes are still manned, but are expected to go
fully automatic shortly.
Truck drivers entering the port to load or unload cargo are guided and
monitored remotely by the system. System peripherals verify customs'
clearance, photograph the container, direct the lorry to the appropriate
gantry slot and print an itinerary of the driver's stay at the port. A swipe
card identifies the truck and its load. On average 350 trucks enter the port
each day and 85 per cent of them are inside the Thamesport gates for less
than two hours.
The system also provides the communications facilities. Electronic data
interchange, fax and telex message functions connect Thamesport with data
processing systems at its customers, HM Customs and Excise, government
departments, overseas ports, banks and insurers.
Despite the complexity of the port's operations Archer was able to get the
system up and running within 15 months, and incorporate additional hardware
as the port's facilities have expanded. The core hardware cost Pounds
200,000 and Archer says the port could be run on three PCs, one for
accounting and office systems, one for control and one as a back-up.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Technology: Man in sheep's clothing - Transgenic animals are
providing humans with a variety of valuable proteins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the space of a few thousand years, animal breeders have genetically
engineered wild dogs into pugs, Pekinese and pit bull terriers. But this
week the idea of changing animals to please humans took its first step
towards becoming a high-technology industry.
Bayer, the German chemical giant, is paying Pounds 10m to a Scottish
company, Pharmaceutical Proteins, for the right to use a medically valuable
protein produced in the milk of a sheep called Tracy. She was genetically
engineered in a laboratory to make that protein.
The business even has a name: pharming, the use of genetically altered
animals as biological factories.
The close study of DNA, the molecule which controls inheritance, means that
the characteristics of an animal can be fine-tuned. Well-understood
fragments of genetic material can be taken from one species and put into
another. The result is a transgenic animal.
Tracy is a sheep like any other except that the combination of nutritious
proteins that make up her milk contains one protein that no sheep has ever
made before - alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT).
Humans make AAT to control the growth of internal organs, but one in every
2,000 people does not make enough. In 10 per cent of these cases its absence
leads to ever-larger holes in lung tissue because an enzyme, normally held
in check by AAT, is not functioning properly. Sufferers undergo long-term
treatment for emphysema.
AAT is difficult to make in a factory and there is a world shortage. Bayer
estimates that there are 100,000 people in Europe and North America
suffering from AAT deficiency. With a herd of transgenic sheep, sales of AAT
could rise to more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) a year. It will take at
least until 1997 for transgenic AAT to go through clinical trials and be
approved by regulatory authorities.
There are many proteins that transgenic animals can produce:
GenPharm in California is developing calves which produce the human milk
protein, lactoferin. It is antibacterial and may help patients with weakened
immune systems or be included in babies' milk. The infant formula market is
worth Dollars 600m in the US alone according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers.
Snow Brand Milk, a Japanese manufacturer of dairy products, has produced
human growth hormone with a relatively high concentration - 0.1 per cent -
in rat's milk. Snow Brand has said it expects to be producing drugs in such
rats on a commercial scale within five years and marketing them in 10. The
market for human growth hormone, today mostly made by genetically engineered
bacteria, is already worth more than Dollars 500m a year. Transgenic
Sciences of the US has also developed mice that make human growth factor in
their milk.
DNX of the US has transgenic pigs which produce human haemoglobin in their
blood. DNX intends to file an 'investigational new drug application' for a
human blood substitute with the US Food and Drug Administration in 1993.
This would allow human clinical trials to begin.
The French National Institute for Agronomy Research has rabbits which
secrete two human proteins into their milk. The proteins are Factor 7, for
treating haemophilia, and the anti-anaemia drug, erythropoietin. The size of
the Factor 7 market is difficult to estimate because of alternative
therapies available for haemophilia. Erythropoietin is a more exciting
prospect. The potential market size is Dollars 3.5bn by mid-1990s, according
to Lehman Brothers, which would make it the biggest-selling drug in the
world. It is currently made using genetically engineered mammal cells by
Amgen of the US and Celltech of the UK for Johnson and Johnson, the US
healthcare giant. Drug companies Bohringer Ingelheim and Chugai sell it in
Germany and Japan respectively. Sales are already Dollars 700m a year.
Pharmaceutical Proteins, the Edinburgh company which developed Tracy, is
also working on producing another blood product, Factor 9, in sheep. The
absence of Factor 9 causes Christmas disease, a rare form of haemophilia.
The first sheep with the gene for making Factor 9 are due to be milked this
spring. Pharmaceutical Proteins says the market is worth Pounds 40m a year
worldwide.
Genzyme, in the US, has goats making tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)
which tackles heart disease by dissolving blood clots. The potential TPA
market has been estimated at up to Dollars 500m a year, although other drugs
perform similar functions and some companies are making TPA by other means.
TPA sales are now less than Dollars 200m in the US and not growing. Volumes
from goats are still small and Genzyme says it is at least five years away
from commercial exploitation. A Japanese company has contributed a Dollars
7m research grant to Genzyme's work. Genzyme has also produced CFTR, which
can treat cystic fibrosis, in mouse milk.
The process by which Tracy was created is relatively simple, although the
techniques used are highly skilled.
Genes that instruct cells to behave in certain ways have two parts: the
instruction and the timing switch/location indicator. The former tells cells
what to do and the latter when and where to do it.
To make Tracy, scientists chemically isolated the part of the human gene
that instructs cells to produce AAT. They did the same with the sheep gene
that tells cells to make a milk protein called beta lactoglobulin (BLG).
The sheep gene's timing switch/location indicator was then separated from
the BLG-making instruction and attached to the AAT-making instruction.
This compound gene was injected into the centre of a newly fertilised sheep
egg using a microscopic hypodermic needle. In 2-5 per cent of cases, the
compound gene became incorporated into the sheep egg, which was then put
into a surrogate sheep mother in a manner similar to that used in in vitro
fertilisation (test-tube babies) of human eggs.
Five months later Tracy was born with every cell incorporating a fragment of
the human genetic material. The timer and the location indicator parts of
the gene told her cells to produce the protein in her milk after she gave
birth.
Genetically, Tracy is slightly human. And her offspring have a 50-50 chance
of receiving this piece of humanity.
Milk production is especially suitable for commercial exploitation. It can
be taken from the animal without ill-effects.
The only other method of producing many of these proteins is with animal
cell cultures in vats. However, cultures are prone to contamination and need
a delicately controlled environment to survive. Tracy comes complete with an
immune system and temperature regulator.
Unlike sufferers from AAT deficiency, Tracy and her flock live in luxury.
AAT costs Dollars 100 a gramme and Tracy makes up to 70 grammes in a litre
of milk.
'These are valuable animals. They will lead cosy lives,' says Ron James, the
managing director of Pharmaceutical Proteins.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Dirty tricks between
the TV dramas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a speaker at a conference on advertising accountability* gives a paper
called '24 ways to con a client' accompanied by 'You gotta pick a pocket or
two' from the musical 'Oliver]', fireworks are bound to follow.
Last week, John Terriss, vice chairman of the CIA Group, one of the UK's
largest media buying agencies, delivered just such a paper. He claimed that
some media buying agencies were increasingly resorting to dubious practices
such as 'slushing' - illicitly transferring funds from one client's account
to boost the advertising spend of another - or, simply, to fabricating the
sale of TV advertising space.
Even though Terriss is not a neutral player, his assertions must alarm
advertisers given that some Pounds 1.6bn is spent annually on television
advertising space in the UK.
His concern was less to attack malpractice but more to argue for greater
auditing of media buying and advertising to boost the industry's
credibility. His fellow speakers, both advertisers and advertising agencies,
all addressed the same basic issue; how, in a recession, to ensure that
money spent on advertising is worthwhile?
There was no consensus. One agency said it had jettisoned the traditional 15
per cent commission system in favour of one based more on payment by
achieving pre-agreed aims. Advertisers disputed the value of using agencies;
all demanded greater evidence of advertising's accountability.
Robert Lauterborn, principal of the transatlantic marketing services agency
Morgan, Anderson, said: 'Gone is the blind faith that advertising is good
and lots of advertising is better; therefore, gone is the system that paid
agencies simply to create and place that advertising'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Broad brush to sell
Lautrec in Paris - The walking sticks, gloves and dinner plates on offer at
the Grand Palais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Grand Palais staged a retrospective of Paul Gaugin's paintings
three years ago, people stood shivering in the Paris drizzle for three or
four hours as they queued to get in.
Anxious to avoid another round of rain-drenched visitors, the Grand Palais
has adopted a different strategy for its next big retrospective the
Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition, which opens on Saturday.
The Lautrec is the first important French art exhibition where the tickets
have been sold in advance. For weeks, the streets and subways of Paris have
been plastered with posters of one of Lautrec's least sleazy scenes of fin
de siecle Parisian low life with the slogan, 'Reservez", slapped across in
red.
Bookings began in November. So far, more than 50,000 individual tickets have
been sold and all the 31,500 group tickets have gone. The Lautrec show is
almost certain to be a sell-out.
Advance booking is one of a number of marketing ploys harnessed by the Grand
Palais for the Lautrec, an expanded version of the recent retrospective at
the Hayward Gallery in London. The exhibition is one of the most ambitious,
in terms of marketing and merchandising, ever staged in France.
Merchandising is already an established part of exhibition organisation in
France, as in most other countries where museums sell catalogues, prints and
postcards as souvenirs of their shows.
But the Lautrec retrospective sets new standards in the scale of its
merchandising activity. The Reunion des Musees Nationaux, the body that runs
France's big museums, has adopted many of the methods used for the recent
Van Gogh retrospective in Amsterdam.
It hopes that, thanks to its merchandising revenue, the Lautrec will not
only cover its costs, but produce a profit of around FFr15m.( Pounds 1.53m)
A huge white tent has been pitched outside the Grand Palais to act as a
'supermarche Lautrec' throughout the exhibition.
The merchandise includes all the customary catalogues and T-shirts, but also
runs to souvenirs evoking Lautrec's life and the world of the Montmartre
demi-monde in the early 1900s.
In the tent, visitors will be able to buy anything from a FFr315 dinner
plate festooned with a Lautrecesque flourish, to a FFr195 pair of gloves
like those worn by Yvette Guilbert, one of his favourite models, and even a
FFr1,200 replica of the artist's cane complete with a secret phial which
could secrete two glasses of wine, or, if it was still legal in France,
demon absinthe.
The Musees Nationaux has modelled the marketing of the Lautrec show on the
methods developed by the large US art galleries.
The Museums of Modern Art in New York and Los Angeles and the Metropolitan
Museum in New York were among the first to present exhibitions to the public
in a populist way.
Toulouse-Lautrec lends himself perfectly to populism.
The story of the sickly, absinthe-addicted artist, who left his gilded life
among the French aristocracy to struggle on the fringes of the Montmartre
arts scene, conforms to all the Hollywood cliches of the impoverished
painter.
His pictures of prostitutes and their patrons are now among the best known
examples of early 20th century art.
The Grand Palais expects the exhibition, which runs until the end of May, to
attract at least 500,000 people.
However it hopes that the final tally might equal other popular Paris
retrospectives, the Manet exhibition of 1983 which attracted 735,000
visitors, the Gaugin with 662,000 and the Renoir show of 1985 which holds
the record of 790,000.
The final cost of researching, organising and staging the Lautrec
retrospective should be about FFr15m.
The Musees Nationaux has already recouped a significant - though unspecified
 -part of that by roping in as sole sponsor Ferruzzi Beghin-Say, the French
arm of Ferruzzi, the Italian industrial group.
For Ferruzzi, which began publicising its involvement at Christmas by
sending out Lautrec catalogues as corporate gifts, the sponsorship offers a
discreet opportunity to high light its commitment to France.

A FRESH attempt to break the deadlock on reform of the Sunday trading laws
was made yesterday in a backbench bill which would allow limited types of
shop to open but sets stiffer penalties for those which break the law.
General stores, petrol-station shops, souvenir shops in zoos, museums or
parks, antique shops and shops at sportsgrounds would be allowed to open at
any time on a Sunday, as could petrol stations and airport shops.
Supermarkets would not be allowed to do so.
Other shops, such as garden centres and chemists would be able to open for
more limited periods. Stores trading illegally on a Sunday could face fines
of Pounds 50,000.
Although the new opening hours would apply only to England and Wales, the
bill would extend to Scotland in its protection of employees against
dismissal for refusing to work on a Sunday.
The bill, to be debated tomorrow, has some cross-party support, but .

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US, EC set deadline in Airbus subsidy row
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND EC negotiators yesterday began a second day's talks to resolve their
long-running differences over Airbus Industrie subsidies with one point
already agreed: the issue must be settled by March 31, Nancy Dunne reports
from Washington.
Failure, after years of transatlantic bickering over Airbus, could mean
unilateral action by US companies under Section 301 of 1988 US trade law; a
complaint under the countervailing duty statute is considered most likely.
The US trade representative last year brought two cases to Gatt and won one.
A dispute settlement panel condemned German exchange-rate support for
Deutsche Airbus, the German partner in the four-nation consortium. An EC
proposal submitted last October to return to bilateral negotiations was
accepted after Christmas.
'The open question for any industry thinking about filing a (domestic) case
is when do you reach a point that that option is preferable to letting
events continue on the point that they are now on?' said Mr Bob Robeson Jr,
vice-president for civil aviation of the Aerospace Industries Association.
He would not confirm the industry's intention, but McDonnell Douglas has
been losing ground to Airbus competition and has turned to Taiwan for a
partnership and new capital. The industry, Mr Robeson said, 'prefers a
negotiated settlement with effective disciplines and a deal acceptable to
both sides.'
The focus in the talks has been on the level of subsidies to be allowed for
aircraft development. The EC has offered to cap such subsidies at 45 per
cent. The US has sought 25 per cent. But further complications remained, Mr
Robeson said. "
The US industry is insisting that terms and conditions of repayment
represent as closely as possible the commercial markets. The EC wants a
royalty-based scheme, the US either a normal repayment stream or uniform
stream of royalty repayments with guarantee of repayment at the end.
Transparency has become a great 'sticking point', Mr Robeson said. The US
wants to know enough about deals to ensure that the EC is meeting its
commitments. EC officials argue too much transparency would release
commercially sensitive information.

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Chevron to learn fate of Kazakh venture
'in month'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas company, expects to learn within
a month whether its long-delayed joint-venture plans to develop Kazakhstan's
Tenghiz field will get the green light, according to Mr Ken Derr, the
group's chairman.
'It will be a very high-risk deal from our point of view,' Mr Derr said in
London. 'On the other hand, it is unique in terms of the size, and could
have a meaningful impact for a company the size of ours for a very long
time.'
His comments come in the wake of a deal signed by Elf Aquitaine, the French
oil group, to explore for oil in Kazakhstan. The former Soviet republic is
understood to have potential reserves of almost 100bn barrels. Elf has said
exploration costs could amount to more than Dollars 600m (Pounds 342m), with
production targeted for 1995.
Chevron's plans to develop the Tenghiz field, one of the world's largest
with total reserves estimated at 20bn barrels, and recoverable reserves of
about 4bn barrels, have been severely disrupted by the upheavals of the past
two years inside the former Soviet Union. Talks began three years ago, and
went into top gear after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president,
visited the US two years ago.
Two expert commissions set up by Moscow to examine Chevron's proposals
called the terms of the deal into question. The break-up of the Soviet
empire led to the newly independent Kazakh government setting up a its own
negotiating committee, with fresh proposals from Chevron being presented in
autumn last year.
'In 1990, I said the deal would be settled by the end of the year. I said
the same at the end of 1991. Now I have quit making forecasts,' Mr Derr
said. 'All you can say is that there is nothing the country needs more than
developments like this.'
First the Soviet government, and now the Kazakhs, have sought foreign
collaboration because of peculiar difficulties in developing the Tenghiz
field: 'It's a high pressure, high-sulphur, high-cost project, with a lot of
gas recovery involved,' Mr Derr added. Full development would involve total
investments of up to Dollars 1bn.
The break-up of the Soviet empire has added complexity not just because of
the confusion and disruption it has caused: pipelines from the field pass
through Russia to the Black Sea and to Russian refineries. Any significant
increase in output from the field would need new pipelines to be built
across Russia.
Until the break-up, arrangements could be negotiated with a single Soviet
entity: now, any joint venture set up between Chevron and the Kazakhs would
have to negotiate with the Russian authorities over pipelines and access to
ports and refineries.

</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DELEGATION of Canadian cabinet ministers and farm leaders arrives in
Europe today, hoping to win sympathy for the non-tariff barriers which
protect Canadian poultry and dairy farmers.
These barriers are threatened by the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation
talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Ottawa recognises that, except for Japan and South Korea, its
supply-management system has little backing in Gatt.
But vigorous lobbying by farmers has forced the government to put on a
display of opposition to the Uruguay Round proposals, which would replace
import and production quotas with tariffs.
Mr Michael Wilson, trade minister, who is leading the group to various EC
capitals and Geneva, told parliament Ottawa would defy Gatt's early-March
deadline for tabling its final negotiating offers on supply-managed
products, including milk, eggs, butter, cheese and chickens.
Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, told farmers earlier this week
that 'marketing boards are unique, they work, and why should we give them
up?' He promised to 'fight day and night non-stop on behalf of the boards'.
Thousands of dairy and poultry farmers are expected to demonstrate in Ottawa
tomorrow in support of continued protection. The dairy industry has mounted
a newspaper advertising campaign to win public support.
The supply-management system has put Ottawa on a political tightrope in the
Uruguay Round.
It has strained Canada's relations with other members of the Cairns group of
food-exporting countries which are seeking elimination of non-tariff
barriers.
The government has also faced the dilemma of balancing demands of dairy and
poultry farmers for protection with the drive by hard-pressed grain farmers
for liberalised trade in farm products.

FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Australia and NZ face up to closer links -
Differences are emerging in the approach taken by each country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER nearly a decade of economic convergence, Australia and New Zealand are
starting to face a series of uncomfortable questions about the goals of
their 1983 agreement on Closer Economic Relations (CER).
Both sides are playing down the significance of talks due to begin next
month between Mr Philip Burdon, New Zealand's trade minister, and Mr John
Kerin, his counterpart in Canberra.
But the success of CER has stimulated a debate on whether the convergence
process should eventually lead to a single market, a common currency, and
even political union. The immediate aim of CER was to remove artificial
barriers to trade between the two countries, which have developed separately
for most of this century in spite of their shared language and culture.
Progress was slow at first, but by mid-1990 all bilateral tariffs and import
and export curbs had been removed, together with export incentives,
production subsidies and anti-dumping legislation. Also, free trade has been
set up for a wide range of services, and public sector contracts in both
countries are open to tenders from companies in either.
The changes stimulated average growth in merchandise trade of 14 per cent a
year between 1983 and 1990/91, from ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 550m) in 1983 to
ADollars 4.7bn. Trade in services, still subject to some curbs, was worth a
further ADollars 2.3bn in 1989/90. The Australian Bureau of Industry
Economics estimates New Zealand has done eight times better out of CER than
Australia, mostly because of its increased access to the Australian market.
New Zealand's merchandise trade with Australia is now in balance, against a
3:1 imbalance before 1983, and Australia is its largest trading partner and
source of foreign investment. Australia has gained less obvious benefits
from access to the New Zealand market, but New Zealand is its fourth largest
trading partner and source of foreign investment.
Both countries say the forthcoming review of the accord will be restricted
to detailed discussion of specific problems, notably trade in services. New
Zealand will urge abolition of trade union restrictions which limit
competition on the Tasman Sea shipping routes, and for a joint aviation
market, benefiting Air New Zealand.
Wellington is keen to iron out discrepancies between the two countries'
customs and quarantine services, and recognition of professional standards.
Australia's priority is removal of impediments to trans-Tasman investment
caused by differences between the two countries' taxation and corporate law
regimes.
Canberra officials say businesses in both countries are seeking changes
allowing creation of more trans-Tasman companies such as Goodman Fielder
Wattie, the foods group, and Fletcher Challenge, the resources and
construction group.
But differences are emerging in the approach taken by the two countries,
mainly over the Australian pursuit of harmonisation, which New Zealanders
tend to see as a threat to sovereignty. 'Harmonisation is not the word to
use in this relationship,' says Mr Burdon, who prefers to see the process as
a search for 'complementarity' between two systems with a common British
root.
Mr Burdon says the CER process has been of 'enormous importance' to New
Zealand, mainly in the light of the long period of slow growth caused by
extensive structural economic change since 1983. But the government is
anxious not to raise expectations about the current round of talks, which it
says do not involve discussions on the kind of 'grand vision' which started
the process eight years ago.
'We intend to go a lot further, but this particular review is strictly nuts
and bolts. In some respects, CER had got ahead of itself, and we need to
sort that out,' Mr Burdon says. This relaxed approach is echoed in Canberra,
where Mr David Richie, director of the foreign affairs department's New
Zealand section, recently pointed out that 95 per cent of Australian trade
is with countries other than New Zealand.
'In other words, it would be silly for both governments to approach CER with
the overriding objective of creating a single market of 20m people in
Australasia,' he said. Nevertheless, Australian officials expect pressure
for closer links to continue to mount, particularly from the business
sector, which increasingly regards the two countries as a single market.
Mr Len Bayliss, a former New Zealand Treasury economist who now runs a
Wellington consultancy, says New Zealand has already progressed well down
the path to economic union, which he claims has 'huge silent support' from
business. As evidence, Mr Bayliss points to the listing of most of New
Zealand's larger companies on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the
participation of New Zealand ministers in most of Australia's federal/state
ministerial conferences.
'New Zealand is becoming a de facto, if not a de jure, state of Australia,'
he says. 'Sydney has become the financial and economic centre of the region,
and the reduction of tariffs and import controls is going to continue making
that more noticeable.'
So far, there has been little detailed consideration of how further economic
integration could be carried out, although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
has pointed out that difficulties could arise in linking the NZ dollar to
Australia's commodity-driven currency.
Mr Burdon says the government is not ideologically opposed to a common
customs area and a common currency, if clear benefits could be demonstrated,
but sees no advantages in political union. 'There has been no demand for it
in the last 91 years. Why would we want to change now?' he says.

<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN countries are preparing to combat cholera which is threatening to
reach the islands after sweeping through Latin America. Officials say
fighting an epidemic would be costly for the financially-strapped
governments, and could severely damage the region's tourist industry, on
which many island economies depend heavily.
Three confirmed cases in Belize in Central America have increased concern in
the islands.
Although there have been no deaths from the disease in the islands, the
Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, which operates in 19 countries, has said
preparations are being made to contain it. The infiltration of cholera is
'inevitable,' according to Dr Franklin White, director of the centre.
However, 'the potential for transmission of the disease would be limited in
most of the Caribbean countries because of a more favourable environmental
health situation compared with Latin American nations'.
The appearance of the disease in Venezuela has caused the government of
Trinidad and Tobago to declare a health alert. 'The latest report on cases
in Venezuela means that cholera is now in our backyard, a mere seven miles
away,' said Mr John Eckstein, Trinidad and Tobago's health minister.
He said cholera could not be kept out, given the movement of people between
Trinidad and the mainland.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Democratic campaigners turn to a broader canvas: The race
for the party's presidential nomination speeds up with a series of big
primaries on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER weeks when candidates trod on each other's toes in the tiny state of
New Hampshire, the nature of the campaign for the Democratic party's
presidential nomination now changes.
In New Hampshire, candidates could concentrate on a single state and 'retail
politics,' meeting face to face with voters. Now, however, the race speeds
up with two small votes in Maine and South Dakota followed by a series of
big primaries on March 3, 7 and 10. 'You have got to campaign on March 3 in
six states, and you cannot do that retail,' says Mr Bob Beckel, a Democratic
campaign adviser.
But Tuesday's primary has changed another element in the campaign. The
strong showing of the two leading candidates - Mr Paul Tsongas, the former
senator from Massachusetts, and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - has
severely reduced the likelihood that a new candidate, such as Senator Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas or Congressman Dick Gephardt of Missouri, might decide to
run.
Democratic party leaders have been voicing doubts about the quality of those
now running and encouraged speculation that a heavyweight candidate might
enter the race. But Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, has made it clear he
expects the nominee to be chosen from the current candidates, and several
Democrat campaigners have scoffed at the theory that a late entry might
still be possible.
One party activist said: 'The thought has come up in every presidential
election I can remember. The only time it worked was with Eugene McCarthy in
1968, and the rules have changed since then.'
Mr Tsongas, looking his usual lugubrious self after winning in New Hampshire
with 34 per cent of the vote, set off for New York yesterday to try to raise
more campaign funds on the strength of his success.
He is planning a whirlwind tour in the next few days which will include
South Dakota and Georgia, but is expected to concentrate his efforts on the
Maine caucuses this Sunday, on Maryland's March 3 primary, and on his home
state of Massachusetts on March 10.
Mr Clinton, by contrast, was beaming as he labelled himself 'the Comeback
Kid' after shaking off a press assault over what he calls 'a woman I didn't
sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge'.
His 26 per cent vote gave him a strong second place that six weeks ago might
have seemed a failure, but appeared a triumph when viewed in the light of
his prospects last week.
To kill the questions that have been raised about him, Mr Clinton needs to
perform as strongly on March 3 and in March 10's 11-state Super Tuesday as
he did in New Hampshire.
That means outright victory in states like Georgia, Florida, and Texas,
which should provide the natural political base for this moderate southern
Democrat.
For Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, with 12
and 10 per cent of New Hampshire votes respectively, the crucial test will
be next Tuesday's primary in South Dakota, which borders both their home
states.
The sparsely populated state carries little electoral weight, but both
candidates need a strong showing if they are to gain momentum for their
fund-raising activities.
'People don't get out of this race because they don't think they can win
some place down the road. They get out because the money dries up,' says Mr
Beckel.
In this respect, Mr Clinton is comfortably ahead of his rivals. Although he
has had to spend more heavily than he had intended in New Hampshire to
restore his battered fortunes, he still has a bigger campaign war-chest.
If both the Tsongas and Clinton campaigns can emerge from this crucial
period still leading the Democratic field, the scene could be set for a
decisive contest in the big mid-western states of Illinois and Michigan,
which both hold their primaries on March 17.

<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, forecast yesterday that Mr
Patrick Buchanan would not gain national support in his challenge to Mr
George Bush for the US presidency, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Hours later he backed off, however, apparently fearful his comments would
inflict further damage on US-Japanese relations.
'I should not publicly comment on elections in other countries. It is too
early to predict the outcome of elections being held throughout the US which
have just begun,' he said.
The prime minister, mired in political problems of his own, earlier told
reporters he had thought Mr Bush would win more than 60 per cent of the vote
in the New Hampshire primary election on Tuesday.
Mr Bush took 58 per cent of the ballot, against 40 per cent for Mr Buchanan,
in the first test of his candidacy for the November presidential election.
Mr Miyazawa said he thought 'Mr Buchanan will not gain currency in all of
America. I believe it is only that state (New Hampshire), as the economy
appears to be in recession'.
The Japanese, who feel they have become a target for Americans frustrated
with a sluggish economy, are concerned that Mr Buchanan's criticism of Mr
Bush could lead to isolationist policies.
In the US, 'Buy American' campaigns have sprung up in a grassroots effort to
hit back at Japan and reduce the US trade deficit.

ISRAEL launched renewed air and artillery attacks on targets in southern
Lebanon yesterday after an Israeli town was hit by rockets fired across the
border by Lebanese militiamen seeking revenge for the killing of Sheikh
Abbas Musawi, leader of the Shi'ite Moslem fundamentalist organisation
Hizbollah.
The fighting, the most intense in the area for years, went on unabated for
the third day running following the death of Mr Musawi in a rocket strike by
Israeli helicopters in south Lebanon on Sunday.
It prompted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to warn that Israel was ready to
use 'all our might' to stop the rocket attacks on its territory, although he
denied suggestions that he was planning a large-scale action similar to the
1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
He was speaking after visiting a bus station in an Israeli border town hit
by Katyusha rockets yesterday, the most dramatic Hizbollah strike to date.
No one was injured, but 13 people were treated for shock. Residents of
Kiryat Shemona and other border towns have spent much of the time since
Sunday in bomb shelters.
Later, Israel rocketed from the air - apparently using US-supplied Apache
assault helicopters - an alleged Hizbollah base in the village of Jibsheet.
No-one was reported hurt.
Iranian-backed Hizbollah, which normally confines its actions to attacks on
Israeli forces and their local allies occupying a strip of Lebanese
territory, has fired dozens of Katyushas across the Lebanese-Israeli border
since Mr Musawi was killed.
'They have a lot of Katyushas, but we will overcome them and disarm them,'
Mr Shamir said. 'There is no doubt the (army) and the whole state and all
our might are ready to give the answers which will grant the whole area
security."
Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister who as defence minister led the 1982
invasion, was reported by Israel Army radio as calling for a northward
extension of the 'security zone' controlled by Israeli forces to push the
Hizbollah rockets out of range of the border.
But Mr Shamir said: 'It will not be the same as it was in 1982. I think in a
few days we will have full security.'
Officials in the area said Israeli shelling of Hizbollah strongholds, which
has driven hundreds of local residents to flee their villages, intensified
sharply after the bus station attack.
Casualties have been surprisingly light in the fighting, which Israeli
authorities hope will gradually subside.

<TEXT>
THE head of the UN commission overseeing the destruction of Iraq's most
dangerous weapons is going to Baghdad to warn of serious consequences if
President Saddam Hussein continues to defy Security Council resolutions,
writes Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent in New York.
Mr Rolf Ekeus was directed last night to make the trip after he reported at
a closed-door council meeting that Iraq continued to display 'serious,
grave, even appalling disdain' for the world body and its decisions.
He will undertake the mission amid continuing speculation about possible US
measures to overthrow Mr Saddam.
Mr Ekeus has constantly complained of Iraqi duplicity in its attempts to
hide weapons of mass destruction and failure to meet even some of the most
elementary obligations in mandatory UN resolutions. Baghdad says the
requirements are excessively intrusive and violate its sovereignty.
Meanwhile Iraq has told the UN it plans to send a high-level delegation to
New York to plead in the Council for the lifting of sanctions.
The Iraqis seem certain to claim that sanctions are hurting old people,
women and children. However, Mr Saddam's refusal to accept UN terms set last
August for a limited lifting of the oil embargo to provide funds for
medicines and other humanitarian supplies will not help his case.
President George Bush and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, both
emphasised during last month's Security Council summit session that
sanctions must continue. Mr Bush said they could not be removed while Mr
Saddam remained in power.

<TEXT>
MR Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, yesterday accepted the
resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski, the finance minister, as a two-hour token
rail stoppage challenged the government's tough new pay policies.
The strike for higher wages was called by the Solidarity trade union only
days after the government announced its intention to reduce real wages by 5
per cent this year. Mr Lutkowski offered his resignation on Monday because
of fears that the government's new economic policies, designed to boost
investment and growth, would prove too inflationary.
Two previous post-communist governments were frequently forced to concede
demands for higher railway pay. They also proved powerless to discipline
rail management which regularly overshot pay guidelines.
Under the wage system state enterprises are obliged to keep wage rises well
below inflation or pay punitive taxes. By the end of last year the railways
had a large unpaid penalty tax bill. Delayed tax payments from the railways
and other state enterprises are a principle cause of the budget deficit.

MR Karel van Miert, the European Community's transport commissioner,
yesterday came out strongly in favour of making road transport companies pay
the full cost of the damage they do to the environment
His appeal came as the European Commission published a green paper which
called for environmental factors to be taken into account when setting
transportation policy. The paper noted that over the next 20 years, the
growth in road haulage would be 42 per cent, rail cargo 33 per cent, air
passenger traffic 74 per cent, while the number of cars would increase by 45
per cent.
It was particularly essential, Mr Van Miert said, for road hauliers to bear
the full costs of the damage they did to the environment. He called for
action to bring vehicle taxes into line across the Community to prevent
distortions in competition.
Increased taxes would provide more incentive to use other forms of transport
such as the railways, inland waterways and the sea, he added.
In another move to make EC transport more environmentally friedly, the
Commission yesterday proposed that governments should cut excise duty on
biofuels, made from agricultural products, to one tenth of that on regular
petrol and diesel. Such a move would provide alternative uses for Community
farm surpluses and reduce pollution.
The Commission claimed that with such a tax incentive biofuels could become
a commercial proposition, accounting for perhaps 5 per cent of overall
petrol consumption in the long term.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner responsible for tax matters,
said recent technical advances had brought down the cost of making biofuels.
For instance, the wholesale price of 'diester', a fuel derived from
vegetable oil, was now about Ecu300 (Pounds 212.70) per 1,000 litres, not
very far above that of diesel, which was around Ecu200 per 1,000 litres.
According to the Commission, use of biofuels would cut pollution from carbon
and sulphur dioxide. But the European Environmental Bureau in Brussels said
these reductions would be marginal from a tax scheme which might only
encourage more driving and more 'industrial' farming.
Though there appears to be some government and industrial interest in
France, Italy and Germany in the Commission proposal, many EC governments
will not want to see their excise revenue reduced. All EC tax plans require
unanimity to pass.
The Commission yesterday put on hold controversial proposals that would
require environmental vetting to be built into planning procedures across
the EC far earlier than is now the case, Reuters reports from Brussels.
Commission sources said that Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment
commissioner, failed to win backing from a majority of his colleagues in the
17-member EC executive for issuing such a proposal in the near future.
His plan, the precise scope of which is still being discussed, would oblige
public authorities to assess the environmental impact of development
decisions well before they turn into concrete projects.
Internal drafts of the proposal have already created a furore in Britain,
which is at loggerheads with the Commission over a charge that environmental
assessments carried out on seven large projects around the country were not
adequate.
Present rules agreed by governments in 1985 require such vetting - for new
motorways, industrial plants and other large schemes - only at the project
stage. Many say this is often too late to minimise damage to the
environment.
The plans have also met stiff opposition from aides to the Commission
president, Mr Jacques Delors, who have argued that planning procedures
should be left to national authorities to determine, the sources said. They
said Mr Ripa di Meana's plans would be reconsidered when the Commission
discusses proposals to revise the existing rules for vetting projects.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Ukrainian leaders see little future for CIS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SENIOR Ukrainian leaders believe the Commonwealth of Independent States is
doomed as an effective long-term force and will have only a 'transitional'
function in enabling the states of the former Soviet Union to go their own
way.
Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, said the CIS was a
'form which helps the states of the former Soviet Union go through a divorce
process'. The CIS, he said, was 'on the edge of a precipice' and he accused
Russia of seeking to re-establish union structure. 'Under the cover of
co-operation, they really wish to govern.'
Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, chief political adviser to the Ukrainian president,
said the meeting of CIS heads of state in Minsk last Friday 'decided
nothing' and held out little hope that more definite decisions would be
taken at their next meeting in Kiev in March.
Prof Volodymyr Vasylenko, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian government, said
the Ukraine would seek to avoid an open rift before 1994, the deadline for
removing all nuclear weapons from the republic.
The Ukrainian view of the Commonwealth as an institution designed for
breaking apart rather than working together is at odds with that of other
member states and could influence western policy towards the former Soviet
Union.
Western anxieties have already been raised by the deterioration in relations
between Ukraine and Russia, the two largest CIS states. Military tension
between them has risen after six bombers were flown from a base in Ukraine
to Russia and Ukraine retaliated by taking over a strategic bomber base near
Kiev.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukrainian president, speaking in Kiev to foreign
journalists yesterday, again attacked his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris
Yeltsin, for announcing a reduction in nuclear weapons in Washington earlier
this month without reference to the presidents of other states of the CIS
and demanded consultation in the future.
'I am not against a reduction of nuclear arms but it must be founded on
reality. We must know how the reduction will be carried out, in what
stages,' he said.
Ukrainian officials assert their republic's intention to apply for
membership of the Council of Europe and ultimately the European Community as
an independent state. Mr Pliushch said that he 'resented' the fact that
Russia was seeking to negotiate with European institutions on behalf of
other CIS states.
Mr Mykhalchenko said of Mr Yeltsin: 'The leader of Russia says one thing at
breakfast, another at lunch and a third at supper. This is impossible.'
Mr Kravchuk said that while he would not describe Russia as imperialist
there were 'imperialist forces within its government.'

Meat is available in Moscow, for a price - a price beyond the means of most
old people like this elderly woman looking at joints on a street vendor's
stall. A majority of Russia's 150m population is living below the poverty
line as a result of last month's price liberalisation, Ms Ella Pamfilova,
social affairs minister, said yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton. These were
people who could not afford the Rbs 1,300 (Dollars 13) minimum cost of a
basket of basic goods.
Meanwhile, Mr Fyodor Prokopov, chairman of the Russian employment committee,
announced he was preparing for a surge in unemployment this autumn as
further market reforms begin to bite. He expected 7m-8m people, 10 per cent
of the workforce, to lose their jobs by the end of the year.
But the government, which is trying to pursue a tough monetary and credit
policy, was also able to report some good news. It revalued the fixed
'market' rate for the rouble yesterday to Rbs100 from Rbs110 to the dollar
after the rouble strengthened for a third week. At Tuesday's weekly currency
trading, it fetched Rbs170, down from Rbs210 the previous week, and a high
of Rbs230 at the end of January.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Canada breaks ranks with G7 over credit for Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S decision this week to open a CDollars 50m (Pounds 24m) credit line
to the Ukraine appears to have weakened the common front on Soviet debt
repayment put up by the Group of Seven most powerful industrial countries.
The G7 nations, most vocally Germany, have maintained that Ukraine would be
denied promised foreign credit until it agrees to assume 'joint and several'
responsibility for the Soviet Union's foreign debt together with other
former Soviet republics.
Canadian diplomats yesterday confirmed that the credit to Ukraine had been
unfrozen on Tuesday. According to Professor Volodymyr Vasylenko, a senior
adviser to the Ukrainian government, this followed a proposed compromise by
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk in a letter to Mr Brian Mulroney, the
Canadian prime minister. In addition to its agreed 16.37 per cent, or
USDollars 13.42bn, share of the debt, Ukraine would take responsibility for
some of the debts of the smaller republics, Mr Kravchuk wrote.
Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian national bank,
estimates that Ukraine could assume about 21.13 per cent, or Dollars
17.32bn, of the total debt, with Russia shouldering the remainder.
Yesterday, Mr Savchenko applied for CDollars 5m of the Ottawa credit to pay
for the new Ukrainian currency now being printed in Canada. Spokesmen for
the Canadian Bank Note Company said yesterday the first shipments of notes
would be ready to be flown to Ukraine within two to three weeks.
Fresh from a conference in Brussels, where they reached an agreement with
Russia on introducing a new currency, senior Ukrainian officials were
hopeful that the G7 and the Paris Club of creditors would soon be reconciled
to the Ukrainian position.
'Very slowly they are changing their positions,' said Mr Boris Soboliev,
deputy minister for foreign economic relations. The Canadian decision could
foreshadow a deal at the scheduled March 3 meeting of the Paris Club
allowing Ukraine to pay its debt independently, he added.
In tandem with a debt agreement, Ukraine will press for a more equitable
division of the Soviet Union's foreign assets. Russia, which has
unilaterally taken over all the assets, has ducked the issue. But Ukrainian
officials say it will be at the top of the agenda when they host the next
Commonwealth of Independent States meeting on March 20.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (9): Benefits may
outweigh risks - The distribution trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTING OUT distribution services to third-party operators by both
retailers and manufacturers has spawned a thriving logistics industry in the
UK. And many specialist distribution companies, such as NFC, Securicor,
Christian Salvesen, Hays and United Transport have grown big and clever in
the process.
Contracting out has many benefits in terms of creating commercial
flexibility and eliminating the need for costly capital investments. But its
major potential drawback is that it places an essential business service in
the hands of an outside agency.
Nevertheless, many companies clearly believe the benefits outweigh the risks
and the move towards contracting out has trundled on. 'In the UK there has
been no let-up in the trend towards contracting out of transport and
warehousing services that has been happening for the past six or seven
years,' says Mr Raymond Horsley, director-general of the Institute of
Logistics and Distribution Management.
One area in which a strong symbiotic partnership has evolved in contracting
out distribution services has been the food retailing sector. Working
closely with such retailers as J. Sainsbury and Tesco, logistics companies
have developed sophisticated distribution skills. Several of them are now
touting for business in mainland Europe, offering their know-how to
retailing companies which have yet to appreciate the benefits of integrated
supply-chain management.
But such contracted-out services, particularly in the food business, require
enormous trust. On the one side, the retailer entrusts the logistics company
with distributing products in pristine condition in an environment in which
late deliveries inevitably result in lost sales. On the other hand, the
logistics company has to invest substantial sums to build and operate a
warehouse that may have little or no alternative use if the contract is
lost.
For both parties, the relationship touches on delicate areas of commercial
activity, requiring an open exchange of sensitive information and a shared
responsibility for such emotive issues as food safety and hygiene.
One example of such a relationship has been struck up between Waitrose, the
supermarket group owned by the John Lewis Partnership, and Hays, the
business services company floated on the stock market three years ago.
Hays runs an 80,000 sq ft distribution centre at Theale, in Berkshire,
delivering short-life food products to 97 Waitrose supermarkets. It receives
goods from 200 suppliers and handles 2,500 chilled product lines and 440,000
cases of products a week, or more than 22m cases a year.
As an example of the longevity of the relationships required, Hays has
concluded a 25-year contract with Waitrose to build another distribution
site in Milton Keynes.
However, not all are convinced by the virtues of such arrangements. Some
retailers, such as T&amp;S Stores, the discount newsagents and convenience
stores chain, have retained all their distribution services in-house,
believing that the cost advantages of contracting-out are illusory.
Significantly, Tesco has also retained full control over some of its vast
distribution centres to provide a measure of security and establish a
control against which it can judge its third-party distributors.
Just as in retailing, a revolution has occurred in the distribution
arrangements of many manufacturing companies, spurred on by the arrival of
Japanese companies, with their just-in-time mentality. Sony and Nissan have
built greenfield sites allowing them to benefit from logistics arrangements,
providing them with an advantage over indigenous manufacturers.
The Japanese increasingly have been looking to contract out distribution
services to the most efficient Japanese distribution companies. That is a
prospect that many European logistics companies privately admit fills them
with terror.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (7): Mrs Mopp gets
polished - Cleaning Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANINA WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YOU CAN forget the all-enduring image of cleaning
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the Mrs Mopp of flowered pinafore and crinkled stocking fame - getting
someone else to do the dirty work has become a sophisticated multi-billion
pound industry.
Commercial contract cleaning - sometimes thought of as a Cinderella industry
 -has tried on the glass slipper and it fits, to the tune of being worth
Pounds 2bn in a private and public sector cleaning market worth Pounds
4.3bn.
It also appears to be buttoned up against the chill wind of recession better
than most as companies seeking to cut overheads contract out services and it
continues to sop up the gravy poured by government's privatisation of the
public sector.
The major player is Initial Contract Services - a subsidiary of BET - while
other big league names include Office Cleaning Services, ISS Servisystem and
RCO Support Services.
The modest capital outlay involved in setting up as a contract cleaner makes
it the perfect breeding ground for the entrepreneur and it is believed there
are more than 5,000 small businesses throughout the UK.
Not surprisingly the scope of services, like the companies offering them,
vary enormously in size and sophistication - from a cleaner armed with a tin
of polish and a Hoover to one with the specialist knowledge to clean a
hospital operating theatre.
At one end of the scale, services would cover a full-time manager and staff
on site responsible for everything from dusting light fittings to degreasing
the canteen while at the other there will be a couple of cleaners working a
few evenings a week.
Some companies offer frill or luxury services such as sprucing up telephones
and office equipment or doing extra cleaning at weekends - it is in this
area that the industry appears to have seen some of the recession's effects
as clients prune costs by getting back to basics.
However, according to Mr John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and
Support Services Association, whose membership makes up 80 per cent of the
industry, the market on the whole is extremely buoyant.
Mr Hall says: 'Generally speaking there has been increased performance by
between 11 and 15 per cent a year over the past five years.'
He attributes this to recession-hit companies cutting costs by putting
ancillary services out to tender and what he describes as the pro-active
government approach - opening up the public sector to market forces.
Compulsory competitive tendering for NHS catering, laundry and domestic
services was introduced in 1983 and for local authority services in 1988. Mr
Hall estimates that 28 per cent of NHS and 30 per cent of local authority
cleaning business is now in the hands of the private sector.
Initial Contract Services claims to be one of the largest providers of
contracted out cleaning services to the NHS and local government. Its
healthcare services division, according to Ms Jennie Harvey, its director,
has an annual revenue of Pounds 35m.
'A lot of hospital contracts are still in house at the moment but we have
made a few million this year and expect to make a few million next year,'
says Mr Mark Aldridge, ICS chief executive. 'Steady growth is the order of
the day in a niche market which demands high quality service.'
Ms Harvey explains that hospital cleaning contracts are about controlling
infection and not just about tidying up. Her staff not only clean but also
carry out patient-related work: that varies from one hospital to another,
but covers serving meals, preparing d r i n k s, making beds and changing
curtains.
At Office Cleaning Services, Mr Peter Goodliffe, acting managing director,
says the company has moved from a standing start two years ago to an annual
turnover of Pounds 10m in local government and NHS contracts.
'By introducing compulsory competitive tendering, the government opened up
an enormous area of business potential,' he says. 'This sector is the main
expanding area in contract cleaning and is three times the size it was 10
years ago.'
As the industry expands into more specialist areas, so has training in
techniques and the use of chemicals and equipment.
Plans are currently in the pipeline for a new national basic cleaning
qualification to be introduced by the end of 1992 and training is now a
matter of course for a large number of companies.
Mr Goodliffe says that more than half of his full-time operational staff are
currently on in-house training schemes.
'Over the past 10 years there has been a quantum leap in how much training
goes on - qualified staff are essential if we are going to compete,' he
explains.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (8): The caterers are
growing fat - The sector is buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN FOR an industry well known for bucking recessions, contract catering is
witnessing remarkable growth, with a 21 per cent increase in outlets, and a
35 per cent increase in meals served since 1988, according to the latest
survey by the British Hospitality Association.
The sector boasts a workforce of 90,000 and an annual turnover of Pounds
1.4bn; a far cry from its roots half a century ago when the law forced
employers with more than 250 staff to provide 'wholesome meals at reasonable
prices' to boost morale.
Several factors have kept the sector buoyant in the current recession,
leading many observers to believe that contract catering is the natural base
from which, eventually, 'total facility management' will evolve.
While many contract caterers are consolidating their market in the recession
and refusing to dilute their expertise and energies by diversification,
there is little doubt about the trend for the 1990s.
Gardner Merchant, one of the big three with a turnover of Pounds 751m,
provides a typical example. In 1991 it took on a contract at BBC Wales'
Cardiff headquarters, with a turnover of Pounds 1.2m. Nine services are
provided within the building: printing, mailroom, catering, ground
maintenance, switchboard, porters, and two subcontracts provide maintenance
and security.
The trend is bolstered by the sector's current strength. Sutcliffe Catering,
also among the big three with a Pounds 340m turnover, claims cost savings of
10-20 per cent over client-run contracts and a 10 per cent improvement in
uptake. In the depths of recession, these savings are irresistible. Fixed
price contracts are on the increase, putting a high risk factor on the
caterers, as against the traditional management fee system where the client
meets costs.
Government policy on privatisation, the internal market in the health
service and reform of education services have all provided spectacular
growth. Figures from the British Hospitality Association show a jump from
250 healthcare outlets in 1989-90 to 337 in 1991-92: similar figures for the
ministry of defence are 68 and 190; and for state education from 262 to 450.
The Food Safety Act has also played a significant role, placing on employers
the need to demonstrate 'due diligence' in the event of food poisoning as
well as enforcing a code on training, temperature control and storage. Many
companies now use contract caterers as a form of insurance.
While contract caterers originally helped boost wartime morale, many
companies now employ caterers to enhance company image. Compass, also in the
big three with a Pounds 265m turnover, found in a survey last July that 46
per cent of respondents saw company catering as a perk, valued more highly
than a company car.
Innovative ventures are becoming more common in the sector as is the search
to find new markets. Sutcliffe has set up a joint venture with BP Oil at
Hemel Hempstead, north of London, using the petroleum company's facilities
to provide general catering and a turnover of Pounds 100,000. New markets
can range in from British Telecom's 600 outlets to the Youth Hostel
Association or P&amp;O Ferries.
Diversification is not limited to the big three. Kent-based Russell &amp; Brand,
with a 1990 turnover of Pounds 7.58m, has picked up 100 contracts in three
years and offers a total facility management package including 24-hour close
circuit TV security.
Perhaps the real challenge facing the sector as a whole is whether it can
protect its market in a post-recession economy.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (4): New laws mean
new business - Impact of Legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE next decade, contracted business services in the broadest sense are
destined to grow, partly because of the raft of legislation on environmental
and safety standards in Britain and the European Community.
An early impetus for the growth of contracted services came in 1983 when
compulsory competitive tendering was introduced in the national health
service.
The 1988 Local Government Act extended competitive tendering to many local
government services.
The government's current white paper, called 'Competing for Quality',
envisages the compulsory extension of contracting out to other local
authority services provided by lawyers, architects and other professionals.
However, the legislation is making a tortuous path through parliament. But
if and when a new local government act covering competitive tendering for
professional services is enacted, this will further expand the scope of the
contracted business services industry.
Some idea of the size of the industry can be obtained by looking at the
Cleaning and Support Services Association. The CSSA's 180 members employ
250,000 people. Some members do go in for catering, but not many.
Few of the CSSA members are involved in building maintenance or what is
increasingly being called buildings health. Nor are many involved in
professional services. Cleaning and support services are a small part of a
large and growing industry.
It is an industry which has been relatively unhurt by the recession. Mr John
Hall, director-general of the CSSA, says: 'In a perverse way, we have
benefited. Companies are concentrating on their core businesses and
contracting out marginal services to cut down on staff and costs.'
After the recession, further growth can be expected because of legislation
on environmental standards, which grew out of heightened public awareness of
environmental issues and concern about food safety.
Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (Coshh) regulations came into
effect in 1989. The Food Safety Act took effect in 1990 as did the
Environmental Protection Act.
Earlier this year the new Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of
Legionella in Water Systems came into operation.
Mr David Pearce, an industrial relations officer at the CSSA, says: 'The new
laws about environmental standards have meant more business for our members.
The larger companies are now offering complete packages covering not just
cleaning but also health and safety standards.'
Mr Hall says: 'There is no question that the laws on environmental
protection and safety standards have meant increased business for the more
enterprising contracting companies. An important part of our role is to make
sure that our members know the latest state of play on standards. Not many
of them belong to trade associations any more, so they rely on us to keep up
to date. They now have to be up to date on the law if they want the business
and generally speaking they are.'
Rentokil is an example of a company which has flourished by being aware of
the fast-moving legislative background to contracting out services.
It was once best known as a company specialising in dry rot in houses and
domestic pest control, but these now account for only 7 per cent of the
company's turnover.
It has branched out into industrial cleaning in a big way. It offers a
service which will clean walls, floors, girders, fittings and cable
conduits, to a standard consistent with hygiene regulations.
It also offers risk assessment for buildings, covering chemical emissions,
subsidence and water control. Mr Peter Bateman, of Rentokil, says: 'The
tightening of standards has generally meant more business for our company.
Look at air conditioning, water towers, water supplies, industrial safety -
areas which we would not have been involved in a few years ago.'
Rentokil's sales have been growing at a rate of 20 per cent for the past
five years. Its turnover in 1990 was Pounds 305m, half of which was in
Britain.
At the other end of the scale in terms of turnover is Environmental
Monitoring Services (EMS). This company, which employs 22 people and has a
turnover of Pounds 1m after six years in business, specialises in monitoring
the health of buildings.
Mr Rex Barnes, a managing partner of EMS, says: 'There is a still a
considerable lack of knowledge as to the legal responsibilities for building
environment.'
His company is involved in all aspects of buildings including the exteriors
and the working conditions within.
'There has only recently come an awareness that standards within buildings
are important. The legislation is responsible for that.'
The rules and regulations will go on being tightened. In addition to the
British laws, the EC is considering a number of directives under the general
rubric of the 1992 legislation to form an internal market. These will deal
specifically with the co-ordination of procedures on the award of public
service contracts.
Few British contracting companies have a large involvement in Europe at
present, but this should grow in line with the legislation.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (5): Guards to be
qualified - Security Staff

usually attached to a gun. However, it is not just the crime rate that is
responsible for this dedication to security. In fact, some US towns are
safer than UK inner cities. 'Americans are very territorial,' explains one
former policeman who crossed the Atlantic to study the system. 'But they are
also very sensible. Staff and customers are easier to attract when they feel
safe, whether in a supermarket or an office block.'
The UK is moving rapidly along the same path. Two decades of terrorist
scares have left few reception areas unattended, although stricter firearms
laws preclude shows of extreme force. Managers are also more aware of the
treasures held in their buildings. Docks and factories have always been wary
of pilfering, yet even an average office block nowadays can hold a fortune
in computer technology.
Security means more than a watchful pair of eyes above an intimidating
uniform. It involves a wide variety of skills ranging from guard duties to
secure storage, computer protection, credit card distribution and even
cleaning. 'The days of Mrs Mopp have gone,' says Mrs Ann Perkins, commercial
director of Securicor. 'Companies want to be sure the people wandering round
their offices at night are trustworthy.'
All Securicor staff are now selected through psychometric testing, which
reveals characteristics such as reliability and honesty. 'It helps us retain
staff by filtering out the wrong people,' says Mrs Perkins. That helps the
clients by ensuring they get a stable workforce.
The price of extra care is small considering the Pounds 1bn turnover of this
part of the industry, but it is probably more than customers themselves
would fork out. Few could stretch to such specialised techniques.
The industry as a whole is encouraging the move towards higher standards.
For three years it has worked on a special certificate of competence, a
national vocational qualification (or the Scottish equivalent), which should
be in place by mid-1992.
One problem with creating a national standard is matching experts as varied
as an emergency alarm fitter with an armoured van guard, so two panels were
created to handle training on each side of the business, the Security and
Emergency Systems Lead Body and the Security Services Lead Body.
A dozen companies are currently carrying out trials on the guarding
qualification and large customers have already made clear that companies
refusing to take part will not get their business. So the long-term problem
of cowboy operators muddying the industry's image may at last be solved.
Securicor already runs several training schools, where staff attend
residential courses. This attention to skills is important in an industry
which covers such a wide spectrum of demands. These range from a small
company looking for reception staff to provide a smart and efficient
service, through to archiving of high-security documents and software for a
major financial or legal group.
The recession has taken its toll of mature markets such as large-scale
cash-carrying, but new areas are emerging to help ease the blow. Hospitals,
for instance, were made tragically aware of their need for tighter security
after assaults on patients and staff. Some schools and colleges could soon
be on the agenda as they switch to running their own expenditure. But small
businesses are currently the main growth area, partly because the recession
has boosted raids but also through an awareness of cash-carrying services
tailored to their needs.
Shopkeepers, for instance, need no longer face the choice of storing takings
overnight or creeping furtively to the bank with a plastic bag full of cash.
'We have recently taken on Pounds 2.5m worth of this kind of business,' says
Mrs Perkins.
Many outlets are now in covered shopping centres, of course, where patrols
are almost mandatory to guard the expensive fittings from vandals. Money
transfers may be part of a security package contracted out by the mall
managers, as can the stocking of cash machines for banks and building
societies.
The variety of tasks also means a wide range of charges, and some customers
have become increasingly nervous about what they are paying for. Sterling
Security, part of the P&amp;O group, has tackled this by investing heavily in
software, according to Mr David Evans, its commercial director. 'This
enables us to monitor the costs of providing a security service to a
particular site,' he says.
Businesses can now specify levels of pay, hours worked and the type of
staff. Instead of being charged the traditional hourly rate, they pay only
the direct costs of a contract, plus a management charge.
Mr Peter Hobbs, property manager of Esab, a manufacturing group based in
Waltham Cross, says the new service 'gives me far more control of
expenditure and the terms and conditions of employment of security officers.
'It seemed a good compromise between in-house security and using a
contractor on the hourly rate system.'

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (6): Cost-cutting in
the air - Travel Expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1980s was the decade in which business travel got out of hand, says Mr
Charles Parry, a senior London-based consultant with Arthur D. Little.
'It was the era in which the airlines competed with each other to pamper the
business traveller, making him feel he was in first class when he wasn't,
really,' he says.
Frequent business travellers and travel agents agree that the last year has
been a period of relative austerity. Company employees who need to travel to
meet colleagues and customers are still doing so. But their organisations
are paying much more attention to how much they spend on their air fares and
hotels.
During times of recession, companies frequently contract out services which
were previously done in-house - from cleaning to security to data
processing. Business travel is different because most organisations have
always relied on outside travel agents to make arrangements for their
employees. Only the largest organisations have tended to make their own
travel bookings.
What companies do during hard times is take a greater interest in the work
of their travel agents, urging them to find cheaper airline and hotel
bookings for their staff.
Some insiders say that the real change in company attitudes was brought on
by the Gulf War rather than by the recession. Senior company executives
began to review employees' travel plans. Many started to think about the
cost and purpose of business travel in a more systematic way than in the
past.
'The Gulf War enabled companies to bring in some legitimate measures to
control travel,' says Mr Clive Adkin, the director in charge of business
travel at Thomas Cook. 'Nobody likes to have to toughen up travel policy. In
a way, companies hid behind the Gulf War to gain control of travel and many
have never gone back to the old ways.'
Mr Parry, a frequent traveller, concurs. 'It was inevitable that at some
stage companies would wake up to the fact that there were essential savings
to be made.'
The result has not been to stop business people travel- ling. The increasing
volume of business many UK companies are doing in continental Europe means
frequent travel is as important as ever. 'But what companies are trying to
do is insist people travel economy rather than business class,' Mr Parry
says.
A recent survey by American Express confirms that companies have not
abandoned business travel as a result of the Gulf War and the recession. The
survey of 2,000 companies in Germany, France, the UK, Switzerland and the
Netherlands revealed that spending on business travel and entertainment
accounted for 5 to 6 per cent of total company costs and was rising faster
than inflation. The average European expenditure per employee was about
Dollars 2,000, compared to Dollars 2,121 in the US.
Although companies are taking a greater interest in what their employees
spend on travel, the survey showed that many organisations have yet to
appoint senior executives to deal with the issue. Only 40 per cent of the
European companies had appointed an executive to handle travel expenditure.
Fewer than 60 per cent of the companies had a written policy document
dealing with travel.
However, a separate American Express survey of the UK appeared to reveal a
determination to cut travel costs. Of the UK companies surveyed, 68 per cent
were economising on business travel expenses. They were still allowing
employees to travel but examining more carefully whether the trip was really
necessary. The survey found that 43 per cent of the UK companies were
reducing the number of trips taken by employees and 65 per cent were
downgrading the class of travel and hotel.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (2): Challenge of
competition reaches the public sector - Government and the Marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been dubbed a 'British disease' but there are signs that a cure is
finally on the way.
For most of the post-war period, central and local government in Britain
successfully resisted the idea of relinquishing any hold on their extensive
responsibilities and handing over elements of the job to the disciplines of
the competitive marketplace.
It was a national trait which, in the opinion of such critics as Mr Michael
Ivens, director of Aims of Industry, the right-wing pressure group, spawned
costs and inefficiencies on a scale which could no longer be tolerated in a
modern economy.
According to a paper written by Mr Ivens and published last month by the
Centre for Policy Studies, the passion shown by public bodies in Britain for
'doing it themselves' has proved unique in the capitalist world.
But public services, he says, have finally had to admit they must learn from
private business and can no longer resist the tide of events.
He suggests, for example, that if competition were extended to all general
non-medical services in the National Health Service, annual savings could
reach Pounds 500m. With schools now also able to seek grant-maintained
status, handing them responsibility for most of their own budgets, there is
potential for education to follow the same route. Others want to go further
still.
The issue of introducing the rigours of the free market into the public
sector has traditionally provoked an intense political debate which only now
appears, gradually, to be giving way to a broader consensus. The era of the
citizen's charter has arrived and the major political parties are laying at
least as much emphasis on a fair deal for the consumers of public services
as on the fate of those who have traditionally provided them.
Recently, Mr John Major, the prime minister, promised a comprehensive plan
for buying outside skills into public service. He said he was determined to
ensure 'there was no hiding place from the challenge of competition for the
sloppy or second-rate'.
Labour, whose own charter proposals include binding 'customer contracts',
claims that the local councils it controls, far from representing the worst
models of local authority management, are now among the most efficient. It
accepts the role of private sector contractors, though it questions their
ability to provide high quality services and has threatened to remove the
compulsory element to the tendering process.
But while the political debate continues, the actual process of opening up
is well under way.
Over the past 10 years, competitive tendering has created a management
revolution in local government, with a range of services having to go out to
tender at regular intervals. Though the majority of contracts is still
awarded to council workforces, managers have found the threat of
contracting-out a powerful argument for improving the efficiency of
services.
Last year, the government acted to reinforce moves towards contracting out
in local government, publishing a consultation paper on improving
arrangements for competitive tendering and for extending the process to some
white collar services.
Competitive tendering has also been introduced in all central government
departments for services such as cleaning, laundry, maintenance, catering
and security, where total spending is around Pounds 250m a year. Savings are
put at more than 10 per cent.
Until now, however, Whitehall itself has been notable for its failure to
subject itself to the competitive regime which it has imposed on local
government.
Ministers have looked primarily to the Next Steps programme of executive
agencies to deliver improved central government services, but critics see
the move as an essentially managerial initiative which still shields civil
servants from market pressures.
Mr Graham Mather, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs,
says that while Next Steps has improved the management of the civil service,
it has nevertheless protected Whitehall from the challenges and disciplines
of competitive tendering which have applied in local government for several
years.
Mr Mather, one of the advocates of 'government by contract', has gone as far
as to suggest that a civil service of 500,000 people could be cut to as few
as 10,000, their responsibilities confined to the narrow Whitehall tasks of
assisting ministers and supervising the awarding and enforcement of
contracts for the remainder of all civil service functions.
Even if his views are unlikely to be implemented fully, a new government
initiative means that Whitehall is in for a shake-up. At the end of last
year, the government published a white paper entitled 'Competing for
Quality', intended to increase competition and, hence efficiency, within the
civil service.
It proposes the appointment of management consultants to government
departments to help identify opportunities for putting more work out to
competitive tender.
Beyond the traditional support services which have so far been contracted
out, new areas to be considered include: professional and specialist
services like accounting and auditing, clerical operations, office services
such as records storage and messengers and estate and construction services.
A public competition and purchasing unit will be set up in the Treasury to
help tenderers with applications.
Though the proposals may meet the same sort of resistance within Whitehall
which greeted earlier competitive initiatives directed at the country's town
halls, there seems no doubt that a huge, additional customer base is slowly
opening up to those businesses who can provide services on a contracted
basis.
Organisations like P&amp;O Total Facilities Management, the business support
services company, have been quick to capitalise on the potential within the
public sector. P&amp;O is negotiating, for example, with West Berkshire Health
Authority to take over some of its non-core services. A contract worth over
Pounds 6m could lead to annual savings in excess of Pounds 500,000.
Mr Robin Booker, managing director, believes the opportunities for support
services in the public sector are 'enormous' and says the culture which
dictates the provision of public services is undergoing a revolution. He
expects the sector to become increasingly competitive as more providers
enter the marketplace.
Mr David Hepworth, marketing director of BET, the business services
conglomerate, reckons the public sector will represent a market at least as
big as that available in the private corporate sector: 'We have been up
against long- standing custom and practice which has refused to acknowledge
there are better ways of doing things.
'But those attitudes are now shifting throughout the public sector as
increasing numbers of clients, always under pressure to stretch resources to
the limit, begin to see how much further their money can go if they bring in
the private sector'.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (3): The case for
outside help - Workplace Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE chairman got stuck in a lift, his company suddenly acquired a
facilities manager. When it jammed again, in came a specialist contractor.
Workplace managers enjoy recounting this fable, if only for its punchline.
During the second breakdown the chairman became quite chatty with two people
in the lift whom he did not recognise. They turned out to be the facilities
manager and a maintenance contractor already taken on by the new man.
The message is that many bosses know little and care less about the
buildings in which they work. 'A recent survey threw up 100 companies where
property made up a third of their assets. Yet fewer than half used property
management systems,' says Mr Ted Watts, president of the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors.
Even the more aware may dump the whole task on someone already responsible
for an operational department, often the personnel director. And if the lift
breaks down often enough to appoint a specialist, he or she will be well
down the management hierarchy, expected to keep things ticking over rather
than play a part in decision-making.
'That is asking for trouble,' says Mr John Jack, a former property director
for IBM (UK) now running Procord, his own property management company. 'It
is essential that facilities managers are brought in early enough and at a
high enough level to forecast potential problems.'
Mr Watts recalls an office building where, at the first stage of planning,
one computer was specified for every 10 desks. A year later, this had
changed to one in six and by the time the building was finished there was a
screen on every desk. 'Facilities managers have to look forward and make
allowances for such things,' he says. The rate of technological change makes
planning all the more important, and often requires the help of outside
experts.
A battalion of consultants and contractors now exists purely to take this
load off the shoulders of untrained managers and work alongside inhouse
specialists. But it took a recession to confirm this role. Companies under
pressure to cut costs are taking a new look at accommodation services.
Moving is often out of the question: with so much empty new space around,
they are unlikely to get rid of existing buildings. So it is a question of
making the best of what they have, and that often means calling in outside
help.
'Companies need to concentrate on what they are good at - their core
business. But they are entitled to expect a similar level of expertise from
contractors,' says Mr Jack. He is spreading a gospel practised at IBM, as
Procord is effectively a management buyout of the computer giant's property
management department. This includes a drastic reduction in space per
employee, recognising that many IBM staff are out of the office much of the
time.
Setting up workstations accessible from anywhere inside or outside the
building has cut space needs by 20 per cent. Consolidation also enabled
staff to be moved from high-cost central London buildings, reducing
occupancy costs by more than 30 per cent. An energy conservation plan
achieved 20 per cent savings within four years.
Energy is a clear-cut cost easily grasped by any chairman, but some figures
that contractors can achieve will startle him. Careful planning and
monitoring can reduce bills by 30 per cent, says AHS Emstar, the energy
management group formed last November when two leading UK contractors
merged. It has refurbished the 43-acre Heaton works in Newcastle where NEI
Parsons produces turbine generators, switching from oil to gas and
installing more than 5km of piping. Savings should reach almost Pounds 1.5m
over the seven-year maintenance contract, it claims. After paying back the
Pounds 650,000 capital cost - which AHS Emstar provided - Parsons will
pocket a saving of Pounds 150,000.
Cost-cutting is not the only pressure forcing consumers to seek specialist
advice. New laws spinning out of Westminster and Brussels will severely
curtail emissions, forcing reappraisal of energy systems, and facilities
managers are already having to tackle increasing red tape. Every item of
portable electrical equipment such as typewriters, kettles and screens must
be tested; all potentially hazardous substances noted; and cold water
systems must be screened for Legionella.
'Training needs to be a very high priority to keep up with all the changes,'
says Mr Mike McCloskey of Lorne Stewart, part of the BET plant services
group. 'This is costly and time-consuming. No wonder the building
owner/operator is turning to outside help.'
Health fears came to the fore following Legionella outbreaks during the
1980s which threatened companies with hefty lawsuits from those struck down
 -or their surviving families. Then the buildings themselves started to fall
sick. Staff complained of rashes, headaches and nausea.
'Two-thirds of the nation's workforce think their productivity would improve
if working conditions were raised,' says Mr John Astley of support services
group Mitie. The worst problem seems to be the quality of air in offices,
which was condemned by more than a third of workers questioned in a Gallup
poll.
Employers often brush off such claims, particularly when they have just paid
a fortune for a new building. But productivity is becoming more important as
costs rise, profits disappear and skilled staff drift away from congested
city centres. Contractors are finding their hands full creating cleaning and
engineering maintenance programmes tailored to individual buildings.
Mr Astley says that package deals more than pay for themselves. 'Mitie
estimates that multi-service building maintenance contractors can save
facilities managers up to 25 per cent compared with in-house operations.'
Considering that building management costs almost Pounds 11.5bn a year in
the UK, that is a lot of saving. Add energy management and cost reductions
can be as high as 35 per cent, he says.
This is why more companies are moving towards outside contracting.
'Facilities management is coming of age,' says Mr Jack. 'It is still a
little way off, but there are encouraging signs such as the development of
professional qualifications.' In future, contractors will play a more
integral role in management, not just cleaning and maintaining existing
space but advising whether companies should up sticks and move altogether -
then helping plan a new home.
One simple sign may indicate that the sector has attained the respectability
of the customers it serves, however. The chairman goes back to using the
lift.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (1): Recession's
silver lining - Rather than damaging the business support services sector,
the recession may have given it a boost. More companies are concentrating on
core businesses, contracting out other operations for a better use of
capital and personnel
</HEADLINE>

INSOLVENCY specialists, it seems, are not the only breed of business to
flourish during recession. The drive within companies to improve efficiency
and cut costs without compromising quality has given fresh impetus to a
fast-developing sector of the economy.
Call it contracted business services, facilities management or outsourcing,
the process by which companies hive off non-core activities to outside
specialists is one which was already set to become an everyday part of the
vocabulary of modern management.
Pre-recession forecasts suggested that the total business support services
sector in Britain could be worth Pounds 80bn a year by the year 2000,
roughly twice the present estimated level.
Leading players in the business support sector claim that the tough economic
situation has concentrated corporate minds to their advantage. Increasingly,
companies are tending to concentrate on the business they know best -
'sticking to their knitting' as one management guru has described it - while
stepping up the search for greater cost-efficiencies.
The resulting, gradual change in management culture, combined with the
opening up of new public sector markets for the support services companies,
has produced a contra-cyclical increase in their business.
Mr Peter Davies, commercial director of BET Contract Services, one of the
UK's largest business contracting operations, says conditions are
'absolutely booming' as growing numbers of companies wake up to the benefits
of utilising professionally managed external support services.
Serco, the international task management contractor, says the recession has
led directly to more companies contracting out elements of their business
and reports the winning of contracts from big-name clients such as Marks and
Spencer, British Aerospace and British Steel.
Drake &amp; Scull Technical Services, the business support arm of Drake &amp; Scull
Engineering, recently reached agreement with British Airways to maintain all
the airline's buildings, facilities and specialist equipment at Heathrow and
Gatwick airports for 10 years. The deal is thought to be one of the largest
'total provider' contracts yet signed in the UK.
The potential for facilities management in particular, the area of activity
most directly associated with the care and control of physical assets, has
recently been highlighted in a study by the Building Services Research and
Information Association. BSRIA identified significant prospects for
facilities management but concluded that the UK market was still at an early
stage in its development.
It added: 'The potential is obviously vast. With a typical contract value of
between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 2m, if only 1 per cent of the 30,000 large
industrial, retail and commercial sites in the UK take out a facilities
management contract, the market would be worth Pounds 300m in the private
sector alone.'
The growing importance of facilities management is also reflected in the
decision of the Confederation of British Industry to join with the
Association of Facilities Managers in organising a three-day conference in
London which starts next Tuesday. Unlike most trade shows, the event has
doubled in size since last year.
As the support services sector grows, so its parameters are expanding. A
study conducted by the Henley Centre for Forecasting on behalf of Rank Xerox
Business Services, one of the many recent newcomers to the sector, concluded
that the phenomena of contracting out security, cleaning and catering will
extend to other areas, requiring more highly-skilled managerial
capabilities.
There is plenty of evidence that the broadening process is already well
under way. A service that was initially property-oriented now extends to
most aspects of personnel management, through legal and accounting services
to marketing, sales, distribution and information technology systems.
Also, there will be new markets to conquer. The recent sea-change in
political thinking has already opened up local government contracts to the
disciplines of private sector competition and the process is gathering pace.
The government has now also published its proposals for exposing central
government organisations to the same process. Departments will be expected
to set annual targets for putting new areas of activity out to tender and to
publish progress reports.
The new regime has been put to the test and the Treasury says average cost
savings of 25 per cent have already been achieved. Savings from contracting
out will be ploughed back into improving services.
There will added opportunities still further afield. The European Commission
has produced single market proposals for the procurement of 28 identified
services by central, regional and local governments throughout the
community. The result will be to open up to competition the market for the
supply of many business support services.
The logistic difficulties of providing business support services at
locations around Europe, however, will be immense, making it likely that
those companies wishing to exploit the opportunities offered by the single
market will consider expansion by acquisition or joint venture. The process
will be a two-way affair.
So why are increasing numbers of companies entrusting critical but
peripheral elements of their operations to outside experts? Mr John Kerry,
head of outsourcing at Ernst &amp; Young, the management consultants, lists a
number of reasons.
They include pressures on costs, skills shortages, variable workload
patterns and 'management stretch' - spreading management across areas not
well understood and, therefore, not effectively managed.
Mr Kerry also cites some reasons why companies have resisted the trend. They
may be suspicious of permitting access to outsiders or doubt the ability of
contractors to deliver services as required. Another obstacle may be an
internal culture which prevents executives from objectively considering why
they assume responsibilities that have no impact on their business
performance.
According to Mr Kerry, the benefits for corporate converts can be enormous.
The process can lead to redefinition and better control over services - even
if they are not always contracted out - and can relieve management of daily
responsibility for potentially disruptive and possibly complex support
services.
Costs can be reduced, although this is not always the case. A more useful
result may be greater control of those costs incurred. Used extensively,
outsourcing can transform the cost base of a business and substantially
reduce the capital investment required for buildings and equipment.
But the process can present major risks unless handled carefully. An overlap
of responsibilities between client and contractor can lead to wasted
contract work and fractious relationships. Contracts must always be well
defined to ensure that there are no misunderstandings over requirements
while any contracting out programme predicated on the reduction of marginal
costs must be accompanied by an aggressive strategy intended to recover
them.
One wider concern centres on the calibre of the new entrants in the
contracted services market. Contractors which have traditionally provided
only a single support function to companies are expanding their service
portfolios but some doubts exist as to their ability to manage multi-service
packages.
BET's Mr Davies says: 'Lots of organisations are coming out of the woodwork,
claiming they can provide the full package of support services. While they
can subcontract the services they do not have in-house, many simply lack the
management skills required and there is a risk they will give the sector a
bad name.'
Professional management is the key to contracting out, according to Mr
Lionel Prodgers, chairman of Facilities and Property Management, one of the
new generation of business support specialists which has introduced an award
scheme to promote standards of service.
FPM operates on an independent, 'front-desk management' basis, installing
its own managers within the buildings of clients to be responsible for the
provision of all services required. Contractors are constantly monitored to
ensure they maintain high standards.
Mr Prodgers says: 'Inefficiencies in the provision of services are often
brought about by office politics, with individual empires jealously guarded
against intrusion from other parts of the business. Managers are more likely
to cede some of their responsibilities to an independent contractor than to
someone else inside the organisation.'
Contracting out, of course, may not always be the answer. A company may be
too small or too large, supplier bids may be uncompetitive or the risks of
having to change back to internal systems may be regarded as too great. It
could be, of course, that everything already runs very smoothly. And as Mr
Kerry of Ernst &amp; Young puts it: 'If it ain't broke - don't fix it.'

FT  20 FEB 92 / Turkish coalition ready for tax fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL proposal offering Turkish businessmen a tax amnesty is set
for a bumpy ride when it goes before parliament today.
The bill, under which all legal action against corporate and individual tax
offenders would be dropped, is seen as the first real test of the
government's economic programme, and a challenge to Turkey's fragile
two-party coalition. The proposal will allow the Finance Ministry to waive
the backlog of tax disputes and concentrate on this year's tax collection.
Officials hope it will encourage businesses and wealthy individuals to
declare their tax liabilities, a move which should boost tax revenues and
help the government to reduce the budget deficit, which in 1991 was running
at 11 per cent of GNP and is one of the main causes of Turkey's 70 per cent
annual inflation rate. On Tuesday the prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel,
attacked those opposed to the tax amnesty, including deputies from his own
True Path party, who last week joined opposition politicians calling for
amendments to the bill. The amnesty has been criticised as favouring the
wealthy friends of politicians and raises issues of official propriety at a
time when the government is publicly investigating corruption charges
against the former administration.
Turkey remains one of the least taxed economies in the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Economists are calling for
more radical measures. The budget forecasts a 13 per cent real rise in tax
revenue, but without further reform the target may be hard to achieve.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Urals Russians put a new slant on making money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS SIDERENKO is a Russian entrepreneur who has given the concept of
'making money' in Russia a whole new meaning, writes Gillian Tett. In the
Russian Urals, Mr Siderenko and other local businessmen have become so
frustrated with the collapse of the rouble they have devised and printed
their own 'parallel' currency.
'It's called the Ural franc,' says Mr Siderenko, fanning out a sheaf of
elegantly printed banknotes. 'We hope to introduce it here as an alternative
to the rouble.'
The scheme sounds far fetched, but Mr Siderenko and his colleagues are in
earnest. For as the economic and political disintegration of the former
Soviet Union continues, it is not only the separate republics which are
considering setting up customs posts and printing their own currency - but
also separate Russian regions, like the Urals.
Two million banknotes have already been printed on the presses of Gosbank,
the state bank of the former Soviet Union, with a planned circulation of
more than 50m Ural francs.
This is tentatively forecast to represent a value of up to Rbs50bn,
according to Professor Vitali Nayshul, a Moscow economist, and architect of
the scheme. Reserves of hard currency and commodities (particularly iron ore
and minerals) are being amassed to provide backing and joint venture
negotiations are under way with western banks to provide further support,
and a banking framework.
Prof Nayshul expects the Ural franc to be brought into circulation in the
Urals within the next two months - although he admits that he is not yet
sure whether it will be used solely for trade within the Urals, or for
particular commodities traded between the Urals and other regions.
Spiralling inflation is the driving force behind the scheme. Faced with the
increasing worthlessness of the rouble, enterprises and individuals are
abandoning and are being forced into two options: paying in hard currency,
or resorting to direct barter deals.
'It's easier to buy things with a train full of wood than with a stack of
roubles. Factories want wood; they don't want roubles,' says Prof Nayshul.
But hard currency is in short supply and barter clumsy and time consuming,
even though many large enterprises now employ whole departments whose sole
occupation is to arrange barter deals.
The Ural franc scheme is intended as an alternative. 'We want the Ural franc
to be a 'hard' convertible Russian currency, to exist alongside the rouble,'
explains Prof Nayshul hopefully.
However, he and his team have yet to convince sceptics that their 'currency'
will turn out to be anything more than a short-lived example of the economic
anarchy in the former Soviet Union.
For, as teams of beleaguered Russian economic advisers are discovering,
'making' money is one thing. Making it credible, is quite another.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER BENZ, Germany's biggest industrial company, has managed to find new
jobs for 1,400 of the 2,700 employees working at its AEG Olympia typewriter
and office equipment plant in Wilhelmshaven. The factory is being shut after
losing heavily for several years.
Most of the new jobs are at other Daimler subsidiaries.
The decision, finalised at a meeting of AEG's supervisory board in Frankfurt
yesterday, has been taken after intense pressure from the port city of
Wilhelmshaven to mitigate the effect of the closure on one of the most
depressed regions of western Germany.
Last October Wilhelmshaven predicted that closure of the factory, coupled
with planned job losses in the navy, would drive local unemployment from 15
to nearly 30 per cent.
The powerful IG Metall union has also set itself against the job cuts, and
union members yesterday mounted a demonstration outside AEG's Frankfurt
headquarters for the second day running.

FT  19 FEB 92 / French Gaullists will try to block Maastricht pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S Gaullists have served notice that they will campaign against the
terms of the Maastricht treaty recently signed by the European Community.
Their main objection, as set out this week by Mr Alain Juppe, the party's
secretary general, is to the provision for extending the vote in local
elections to nationals from other EC countries.
'It is completely out of the question to give foreigners the possibility of
having municipal councillors, who could then endorse a candidate for the
presidency, elect senators or become mayor,' Mr Juppe said on radio.
The party also objects to the explicit target of a single European currency,
at the end of the process of European monetary union. It would be better, Mr
Juppe argued, to develop a 13th single currency, rather than 'rush into an
adventure whose consequences we cannot assess'.
He also demanded that the treaty be coupled with an amendment to the French
constitution, to give parliament a greater role in decisions on Community
legislation.
After several years of the party acquiescing without enthusiasm in President
Francois Mitterrand's European policy, these objections to the Maastricht
treaty represent a clear-cut reversion to the traditional nationalism of
Gaullism.
In the short run, this will make it easier for the Gaullists to adopt a
frankly nationalist position in next month's regional elections, and thus
compete more openly for the nationalist vote now swinging towards the
extreme right-wing National Front.
But it is not yet clear whether the Gaullists, even in tacit alliance with
the Front, can mobilise an effective opposition to ratification of the
treaty. If the other half of the conservative opposition, the centre-right
UDF group, sticks to its traditional principles, it will support the treaty,
virtually assuring ratification.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRE yesterday destroyed one of the most eye-catching pavilions of the
Seville Universal Exposition, which opens on April 20, writes Tom Burns in
Madrid.
Firemen fought a four-hour battle to extinguish the blaze at the Discoveries
Pavilion. Conceived as a Time Machine that used a combination of visual
effects to explain five centuries of discoveries, invention and
technological applications, the pavilion was a key component of Expo '92's
commemoration of Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World 500 years
ago.
Although the fire's cause was not known last night, security experts have
voiced fears that Expo '92, which groups some 90 pavilions representing
nations and multinationals, would be a target for terrorist groups.
The destroyed complex, which consisted of eight modules spread over 12,000
sq metres, was expected to draw about 20,000 visitors a day.
Other buildings on the Expo site, which stands on an island in the middle of
Seville's Guadalquivir river, were not affected.
Mr Jacinto Pellon, Expo 92' chief executive, said last night: 'This is a
profound setback.'

<TEXT>
Plans for an institute in Russia to employ atomic scientists in civilian
endeavours may be insufficient to keep Soviet nuclear know-how from
spreading to other countries, Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign
minister, said yesterday, AP reports from Bonn.
A day earlier, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, announced in
Moscow that the US would be providing Dollars 25m to help create an
international clearing house in Russia that would gather proposals for
employing former Soviet nuclear scientists in commercial projects.
Germany is also sponsoring the plan. A primary purpose of the project is to
keep the scientists and engineers from selling their knowledge to other
countries. Mr Genscher - a principal architect of the institute scheme -
called Monday's announcement 'an important first step'.
However, the German foreign minister said other measures were needed,
including the 'international isolation' of countries that 'procure
technology for weapons of mass destruction'. He said UN sanctions should be
imposed against such countries.
'I believe that the Security Council should fully make use of the means at
its disposal, especially sanctions, in cases of violations of
non-proliferation principles,' he said.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (9): Busy gateway to China
 -Hong Kong is the most developed gateway into China, with travel companies
and hotels in the colony offering a range of tours, tickets and services. It
is probably quicker to get a visa in Hong Kong rather than apply early in
one's home country, writes Angus Foster.

LO WU was once no more than a rickety bridge across the Shenzhen river,
where visitors  - lucky enough to have permission - left the comforts of
Hong Kong and came face to face with the suspicions and aggression of
Chinese communism.
Now, more than ten years after China opened to the world, a new
multi-storeyed Customs Hall greets foreigners flush with travellers cheques
and 'compatriots' from Hong Kong or Taiwan laden with presents for mainland
relatives.
Suspicions have been replaced by indifference. More than 30m people passed
through Lo Wu last year, some of them Hong Kong residents commuting daily to
factories in southern China. As the country continues to try to attract
foreign businessmen and tourists, travelling within China has never been
easier.
Hong Kong is the most developed gateway into China with travel companies and
hotels in the colony offering a range of tours, tickets and services.
Visitors can also deal direct with China Travel Service (HK), a Chinese
state-owned organisation which oversees visas, bookings and reservations.
Visas can be processed in less than a day and cost between HKDollars 150 and
Dollars 480, depending on processing speed and numbers of entries required.
It is quicker, and probably cheaper, to get a visa in Hong Kong rather than
apply early in one's home country.
Many businessmen enter China on tourist visas since they are quicker to
process. Business visas require a letter of introduction from a sponsoring
organisation in China.
As China has opened up, making travel arrangements has become easier and
easier. Scheduled flights are now available between Hong Kong and more than
ten Chinese cities and chartered flights are also popular. Even medium-sized
destinations have foreign joint venture hotels which can be booked from Hong
Kong. Travellers cheques and credit cards are increasingly accepted while
the Hong Kong dollar, rather than the Chinese renminbi, is sometimes the
only acceptable currency in the south.
Visitors to China usually head for one of three initial destinations;
Guangzhou, or Canton in the Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong; Shanghai,
China's largest city; and Beijing, the capital and home to all ministries
and political bodies. Generally, travel options decrease the further north
you go.
Links between Hong Kong and Guangzhou are very well developed. China
Southern Airlines, part of state airline CAAC, operates three flights a day
to the city which cost between HKDollars 400-Dollars 590 one-way and take 40
minutes. However, Chinese airlines are often frightening, despite recent
improvements. Taking into account travelling times to and from airports,
flying to Guangzhou is probably not much quicker than taking a train.
Direct trains to Guangzhou leave from Kowloon and take just under two and a
half hours. There are four each day and single tickets cost HKDollars 183.
Tickets should be booked in advance through CTS. If the trains are full,
travellers with time on their hands can take a Hong Kong train to Lo Wu,
cross the border by foot then catch a train to Guangzhou from the other
side. However, this can mean total travelling time of more than four hours
because connections are sometimes poor.
By far the most romantic route is by nightly ferry which arrives in
Guangzhou early the next morning. Services on board are limited and you may
find yourself sharing a compartment. Tickets cost HKDollars 150-Dollars 250,
again available from CTS.
Guangzhou is the natural launching pad for visits throughout Guangdong
province, the favourite destination for Hong Kong executives doing business
in China. It is also used by some business people as the place to plug into
China's domestic travel network, some of which cannot be booked from Hong
Kong.
For example, flights from Guangzhou to other Chinese cities are cheaper than
direct flights from Hong Kong. Sometimes, tickets are available on domestic
flights when international flights to the same destination are full.
However, the same safety questions apply and domestic services are rapidly
filling up as the country becomes richer. Finally, extra time should be
allowed in case your optimism about China's travel system proves unfounded.
Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, opened a new airport last
year and this provides another option for linking into the domestic network.
Citybus, a Hong Kong bus company, operates daily bus services to Shenzhen
airport which cost HKDollars 100 and take two and a half hours. From
Shenzhen there are flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Chengdu,
although none are daily.
Travellers headed for Shanghai have three options. The easiest is a flight
on Dragonair, an airline specialising in China routes which is partly owned
by Cathay Pacific. Dragonair has five flights a week to Shanghai, costing
HKDollars 1,290 one way. If these flights are full, CAAC operates daily
services on the two hour route.
For less urgent engagements, a train from Guangzhou to Shanghai takes about
32 hours and leaves each morning. On overnight Chinese trains a sleeping
berth (either hard or soft sleeper) is strongly recommended. Alternatively,
ferries from Hong Kong to Shanghai depart roughly twice a week and take 60
hours. Enjoy the on-board swimming pool or, perhaps, the HKDollars 5,600
'presidential suite.'
For Beijing, Dragonair flies five times a week and a one way ticket costs
HKDollars 1,850. CAAC flies daily. Trains are not an option, unless you have
three clear days  - two for travelling and one to recover.
Businessmen needing interpreters are often better off making arrangements
after arriving in China through their hotels. CTS can arrange interpreters,
which cost around HKDollars 2,000-Dollars 4,000 a day plus expenses, but
they are unlikely to be able to cover technical topics.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (8): Such tempting
destinations - Weekend Breaks: exotic Asian locations such as Bali and Kota
Kinabalu are just a few hours' flying time from Hong Kong, says Angus
Foster.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
equal to the time needed for a Friday night drive from London out into the
country  - you can be anywhere from Bangkok to Manila, Ho Chi Minh City or
Shanghai.
Hong Kong's position at the fulcrum of Asia means getting away for a couple
of days is deliciously tempting. Whether your goal is lying on a beach on a
remote tropical island, trekking among hill tribes or jostling through a
Chinese city, Hong Kong offers the launch pad, base station and, on your
return, recovery centre.
Hong Kong's myriad of travel agents arrange flights and package tours to
most of the following locations. Ask your hotel or a local friend for advice
on which agents to try. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair, Hong Kong's two
airlines, also offer package deals which, although sometimes cheaper,
usually limit your options on when and where to travel.
Getting flights at short notice can sometimes be a problem, especially
around Christmas, Chinese New Year and bank holidays. Asia's best hotels
also fill up quickly, so unless you have booked early, expect to lower your
sights.
BALI:
Some old Asia hands turn up their noses at this Indonesian island, believing
its charms have been soured by coachloads of backpacking World Travellers
and plane-loads of tourists.
But Bali is still one of the most beautiful places on earth. Away from the
tourist stronghold of Kuta the island's charms are untarnished. The town of
Ubud, with a long artistic tradition, is a good place from which the explore
Bali's scattered villages and winding tracks in a rented jeep.
For those with more time and an urge to get away from the crowd, Bali can
act as the stepping stone to the islands of Lombok and Flores to the east.
Lombok is a 30-minute flight away and offers a more relaxed pace of life as
well as some excellent beaches. Flores, another domestic flight away, is
sometimes compared to Bali 20 years ago.
Cathay Pacific offers a three night package in Bali, including flights and
hotels, departing Hong Kong each Saturday for about USDollars 770 per
person. Flights alone, which are cheaper on the Indonesian carrier Garuda,
cost between Dollars 350 to Dollars 450, economy class.
THAILAND:
The favourite destination for Hong Kongers, attracted by the country's
climate and low costs, who pack Kai Tak airport for the morning flights to
Bangkok. Thailand's success as a tourist destination in the 1980s has left
some parts, notably around Pattaya, ruined by over-zealous development and
poor planning, so check carefully.
Most short-term visitors either head for Bangkok, to explore the city's
tourist sites and night life, or the beaches in the south.
Phuket is a favourite beach destination, while those looking for a slightly
more peaceful location could try the nearby Pipi islands or Krabi. Hua Hin,
a three and a half hour drive from Bangkok, has become very popular and
boasts the colonial splendour of the Station Hotel.
Another option is to go trekking in the north from Chiang Mai or,
preferably, Chiang Rai. Two or three day treks can be organised locally or
in Hong Kong and combine leisurely walks with mountain tribes, elephants and
river rafting.
Flights between Hong Kong and Thailand are plentiful and cost about Dollars
250. A three night Cathay Pacific package in Phuket costs around Dollars
700.
KOTA KINABALU:
Located in Sabah, eastern Malaysia, Kota Kinabalu is a three-hour flight
from Hong Kong. Designed for those who only want to relax away from it all,
you could lie on the beach or by the pool, play some golf or visit the
surrounding islands.
With a bit more time, you could explore the local countryside or climb Mount
Kinabalu for a 4,000 metre high perch from which to watch the sunrise over
the jungle.
Both Cathay Pacific and Malysian Airlines offer three night packages to Kota
Kinabalu for about Dollars 640.
BORACAY:
Reknowned as one of the most idyllic of the many paradise islands in the
Philippines, Boracay is about two hours from Manila by domestic flight, then
boat.
The island has no electricity; visitors stay in huts but it is a favourite
spot for expatriates and Hong Kong Chinese wanting a relaxing few days of
sun, sea and sand. The scuba diving and snorkelling is good, but wear plenty
of sun protection. Between June and October typhoons regularly hit the
Philippines and either wreck the weather or your travel plans.
The one-hour flight to Manila costs about Dollars 250 while Philippine Air
offers a two night package in Boracay, including domestic flights and
accommodation, for a further Dollars 103. A three night package to Boracay
with Cathay Pacific costs about Dollars 560.
CHINA:
China offers many alternatives for short visits and in the last ten years
travel options, standards of service and spoken English have all improved
dramatically. However, China remains a difficult and often frustrating
country in which to travel. You may find that a trip to China will leave you
needing a real holiday.
Because of China's huge size and travel times between cities, it is
unrealistic to try and combine any of the following options within a short
visit.
For a taste of China, the southern city of Guangzhou, or Canton, is only a
two hour train journey from Hong Kong. Often overlooked by tourists because
of its dowdy appearance and aggressive Cantonese lifestyle, Guangzhou in
fact has much to offer for a weekend break.
Colonial architecture on Shamian island, a stomach-turning animal market and
some worthwhile parks and temples keep a visitor busy during the day, while,
in the evening, Guangzhou's nightlife of restaurants, bars and cinemas is
the most lively in southern China. A walk along the Pearl River is
interesting at any time, and throws up surprises like bird markets and
outdoor dentists. See the article on gateway to China.
Guilin, a one and a quarter hour flight from Hong Kong, is one of China's
most famous tourist spots and is especially popular with honeymooning
locals. They come to gaze at the distinctive limestone peaks, which rise
sharply out of paddy fields.
In fact, although the tourist hotels are all in the city, Guilin is an ugly
town and the downriver village of Yangshuo has a more enchanting atmosphere
for those not demanding a smart room.
Dragonair offers a two night package to Guilin at prices starting at Dollars
282 with daily departures. CAAC, China's national airline and to be avoided
unless desperate, runs a similar package, which it describes as first class,
for Dollars 495.
Shanghai, China's largest city, has retained a flavour of its former
opulence despite 40 years of Communist rule. Short-term visitors can savour
past glories by strolling along the Bund among colonial architecture, then
dinner and the jazz band at the Peace Hotel.
Shanghai also acts as a staging post for visits to Suzhou, about two hours
away by train, a relaxed town famous for its gardens, and Hangzhou,
eulogised by poets for the West Lake.
A three-night Dragonair package to Shanghai costs upwards from Dollars 407
with four departures a week. The airline also offers longer breaks including
stops in Hangzhou, which is about five hours by train from Shanghai.
Many first-time visitors to China instinctively head for the capital,
Beijing. The city abounds in tourist sites, but its proximity to communism's
nerve centre, and memories of the 1989 killings, lend an uneasy atmosphere.
It is also where China's internal political and economic contradictions come
most sharply into focus. Beijing is a fascinating city, but may leave you
with a less-than-favourable view of the Chinese.
There is so much to see in Beijing  - Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City,
the Great Wall to the north, the Temple of Heaven, countless parks and
museums  - that some visitors find they overstretch themselves on a short
visit. Try to reserve an afternoon for walking or cycling through the back
streets, away from the icons of centralised power but closer to real life.
A three night package from Dragonair costs from Dollars 566, or Dollars 665
first class, with four departures a week. The same package on CAAC, again
first class, costs Dollars 935 with daily departures.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (10): Exotic menus to suit
all tastes - Eating Out: choices abound in Hong Kong, from the entire
spectrum of traditional Chinese cuisine to European, American and Japanese
restaurants, says David Dodwell
</HEADLINE>

TAKE a kilo of fine pacific prawns, still live and succulent. Drop them into
a wide bowl filled two inches deep with Madeira wine, and positioned at the
centre of the diners' table. Leave the prawns to swim for five minutes or so
(making sure to cover the bowl because they thrash around a lot as they
drink in the wine). Then lift them from the wine, and drop them into boiling
water. Drain and serve, once pink. 'Drunken prawns' will taste like none you
ever savoured before  - so long as you still have an appetite after the
experience of watching prawns drink themselves to death.
Feasting off the beaten track in Hong Kong is not for the faint of heart.
But if you don't suffer from squeamishness, it can offer a culinary orgy
hard to match anywhere in the world. Expect to eat chicken with the
bedraggled head of the chicken staring up from the dish at you. Suckling pig
may be displayed before you, glazed chestnut brown, with fruit stuffed in
its now-silent snout.
Many seafood  - including lobsters, crabs or abalone  - may be brought to
the table alive, or still twitching. Sometimes the proprietor will simply be
showing you how fresh everything is. Sometimes, he may be leaving it with
you for you to cook yourself before it walks off the table.
Across the spectrum of regional Chinese cuisines, you can eat Shanghai hairy
crab by the dozen in autumn, snake soup throughout the winter months,
clay-baked beggar's chicken (a Hangzhou speciality), Peking duck or meat
dumplings from the far north of China, or mandarin fish from the lakes in
central China along the Yangtze river.
As the city has prospered, and locals have become more cosmopolitan, so the
spectrum of western cuisines have found a home. French and Japanese
restaurants spread across the territory rank among the best (and sometimes
the most expensive) in the world. The latest vogue is for regional Italian
restaurants, and for Californian cuisine. Some have become so abashed about
the sudden rush of Californian-style restaurants, that they are trying
somewhat implausibly to set themselves apart as south-western American.
Hong Kong's prosperity has also led to soaring restaurant prices. Most foods
are imported  - including fresh fish, because local waters are too polluted,
and vegetables, which come over the border from China. This of course adds
to costs. A meal for two will cost very much the same as it would in London
or New York. If it includes steamed fish, or exotic foods like shark's fin,
abalone or birds' nest, prices could leave you breathless. Some general tips
on eating out might be worth setting out:
Many of Hong Kong's best restaurants are in hotels. Unlike hotels in Europe,
which often keep guests in solitary splendour, Hong Kong's hotels are
frequently at the heart of shopping arcades, and positively encourage local
people to come through the doors.
When eating Chinese food, try to have at least three of you eating together,
and try to ensure a Chinese friend does the ordering.
Menus in Chinese restaurants are often written only in Cantonese, and then
in such flowery language that it is all but impossible to detect from the
name what food is involved. If you have no Chinese friend to hand, do not
feel embarrassed walking from table to table with a waiter behind you,
pointing over shoulders at dishes you think would appeal to you.
In Chinese terms, a good restaurant is a busy one. The best are often close
to pandemonium, with a din inside, and milling crowds wait-listed outside.
Chinese eaters spit bits of inedible food out onto their plates, burp
loudly, and slurp soup. They also use toothpicks with great vigour. Believe
it or not, they claim good reasons for all of these unsightly habits, so you
should try not to be shocked. Since a table cloth can often be used as a
temporary rubbish bin, do not worry about stains, marks or splashes on it.
At the end of most robust meals, the table will look like a battlefield.
Chinese food, much of it chopped to small pieces, is often much more easily
handled by chopsticks than knives and forks, even if you use chopsticks
poorly. You lose a lot of 'face' by using western table weapons, so
persevere unless you are really starving.
Don't bother drinking wine with Chinese food. Wine is expensive in Hong Kong
(it is one of the few items to be taxed), and anyway rarely suits the
flavours of Chinese cuisine. Instead, drink tea (jasmine or chrysanthemum if
you have a fragrant palate, bo lei for something darker and stronger), or
beer  - San Miguel is the local brew, but China's Tsingtao is the most
flavoursome.
Entertaining a client:
Choices abound in Hong Kong, both inside and out of hotels. If you opt to
eat Chinese food, and a number of guests are Chinese, it is wise to ask one
of the Chinese to do the ordering. Otherwise, it is not a bad idea to dine
in your own hotel's best Chinese restaurant, asking the head waiter
beforehand to concoct a good balanced menu for a particular price per head.
If you say you need to impress, the waiter will rarely let you down.
Pinpointing favourite restaurants is invidious, but in Central, the Hilton's
Eagle's Nest and the Mandarin's Man Wah take some beating. In Kowloon, the
Shangri-la's Shang Palace is often praised, as is the Regent's Lai Ching
Heen. Near Wanchai, the Island Shangri-la's Summer Palace has many fans, as
does the Grand Hyatt's One Harbour Road.
Outside hotels, Fook Lam Moon is renowned, as is the Spring Deer in Kowloon
(for its Peking duck), and Sun Tung Lok for its shark's fin dishes.
Entertaining in a western restaurant will be easier, though many of Hong
Kong's more traditional Chinese dislike the heavy north European flavours,
often avoid lamb and cheese, and pass on wine - particularly those afflicted
with a common Chinese allergy to wine which turns them bright red with less
than half a glass.
Many of Hong Kong's business elite dine in clubs at lunch time  - like the
Hong Kong Club, the Pacific Club, the American Club, the Shanghai Club and
the China Club. Some of these clubs have reciprocal relationships with clubs
overseas, so if you are a member of a club in your home country, it can be a
good idea to check if such reciprocity exists. You could then entertain at
one of these clubs, gaining great face, and probably paying less at the same
time.
The single most popular French restaurant would probably have to be Gaddi's
in the Peninsula. Also in Kowloon, the Restaurant de France in the Regal,
Margaux at the Shangri-la and Plume in the Regent Hotel would be fierce
competitors.
On Hong Kong Island, the Mandarin's Pierrot and the Shangri-la's Petrus take
some beating, though quiet retreats like La Rose Noire and Cafe de Paris in
the Lan Kwai Fung area above Central have loyal followings. Stanley's on the
southern side of Hong Kong island is popular for dinner, but too distant to
be practical for lunch.
For American cuisine, the Bostonian in Kowloon's Ramada Renaissance, and the
Verandah in the Peninsula were first to set the standards. Among the
Italians, Grissini at the Grand Hyatt, Nicholini at the Conrad, and
Capriccio at the Ramada Renaissance, offer delectable north Italian cuisine
at sobering prices. Among the Japanese, Tomowa in Causeway Bay has many
fans, while the two Nadaman restaurants in the Island and Kowloon
Shangri-las, and Genji at the Hilton, have prime locations for entertaining.
Power breakfasts:
Most prominent hotels provide tables large and secluded enough to manage a
useful breakfast meeting. The Mandarin Grill is probably in a league on its
own for style as well as convenience.
Dim Sum:
These chinese 'hors d'oeuvres' can be delicious, and at the same time - to a
western palate at least  - disgusting. They are certainly worth trying, and
offer a much more nutritious lunch than a Big Mac or Pizza. Many restaurants
serve little but dim sum between 11.00 in the morning and 3.00 in the
afternoon. They are rowdy places, with diners being served by waitresses
pushing trolleys around the restaurant, each trolley specialising in one dim
sum or another. Menus are rarely in English. Waitresses rarely have the
patience or ability to explain in English what they are offering.
If you want to avoid dishes of chickens' feet, marinated tripe or pungent
1,000-year-old eggs, then it is advisable to try such a restaurant firmly
alongside a Hong Kong person.
Exotica:
These should rarely be tried without locals at your side, but can add a
memorable dimension to Hong Kong as a gourmet experience. The seafood
restaurants at Lei Yue Mun, north east of Kaitak airport, are among the most
marvellous in the territory, but are a devil to find. In a labyrinth of
streets awash with tanks full of fish, molluscs and crustaceans, diners
order seafood directly from the fishmonger, who carries it to the restaurant
you are dining in.
Snake restaurants in the Western district are popular in winter (snake meat
is thought to be heating, and to make a man virile).
Throughout the year, locals eat the semi-medicinal turtle jelly to cleanse
their blood and improve their complexion. These inconspicuous shops usually
have large brass urns at the entrance, which are used to dispense a pungent
herbal tea that is supposed to complement the turtle jelly.
Molluscs of every conceivable variety can be consumed al fresco in Temple
Street night market in Mong Kok. Alternatively, the Lung Wah in Shatin
specialises in pigeon  - baked pigeons, pigeon eggs, roasted Shek Ki
pigeons, and even steamed pigeon hearts. It serves an average of 2,000 a
day, and more than 1m a year.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (7): Conventions on a
grand scale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN June this year, 35,000 Lions Club members will descend on Hong Kong,
putting the territory's three-year-old Convention and Exhibition Centre to
its first real test, writes David Dodwell.
For the first time, Hong Kong will be home to the annual Lions Club
international convention. Three years ago, the territory had neither the
hotel rooms, nor the conference halls to cope with an inundation of even a
quarter this size.
'Hong Kong was very busy, very full rand very expensive,' recalls Ms Amy
Chan, chief executive of the territory's Convention and Incentive Travel
Bureau.
Since then, 18 hotels have been opened, with a further 10 due to open this
year. Hong Kong's hotel room capacity will have more than doubled to 35,000
rooms.
Most critically, however, the 194,000 sq ft Convention and Exhibition Centre
opened in June 1988, allowing Hong Kong to compete for the first time with
Singapore as the prime conference location in Asia.
Panoramically poised on the Wanchai waterfront in the heart of downtown Hong
Kong, it is served by six luxury hotels, and claims to offer one of the
world's best-equipped and most versatile facilities.
And after the Lions, what next? Most ambitious of all, Hong Kong is bidding
hard to host the 1997 World Bank meeting  - 'and life doesn't stop with
1997,' says Amy Chan. 'We are making 40 to 50 bids every year to host
conferences, some of them on a 10-year lead time.'

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (5): It's all a gamble in
Macao - Bets of all kinds: whether at the crowded races in Hong Kong or in
the round-the-clock casinos of the neighbouring colony of Macao, the
Cantonese show their love for money and taking risks. But few get rich, says

THEY stop talking. There is time for one last drag on a cigarette which is
then tossed below into the melee of shuffling feet, fast-food cartons and
crumpled newspapers listing triangles of numbers.
The crowd pours down another step, urged forward by latecomers who have
sweated anxiously in front of betting booths, wishing the queue would hurry,
watching the clock count down towards the off.
'Race Number 6 in 2 minutes' flashes across the giant electronic scoreboard
listing its own triangle of numbers, the odds for the next race. Blinking at
the bottom are totals betted on the race, win, place, tierce and quinella.
The figure passes HKDollars 100m and the crowd cheers.
This is Hong Kong racing: 50,000 people jammed into high rise stands in
Happy Valley, the tight bends of the track illuminated by floodlights and
the stadium, this amphitheatre of Mammon, dwarfed by surrounding tower
blocks.
The whole operation mixes avarice and enlightened despotism. Last year Hong
Kong people gambled more than HKDollars 47bn on horses, equal to the GDP of
Sri Lanka. Most of it is paid back as dividends. But few get rich. The Royal
Hong Kong Jockey Club, purveyor of the colonial monopoly for supplying this
gambling opiate, donates the surplus to charity and makes it all seem
respectable.
The slick sophistication of the game, and the exceptional facilities, should
make the Jockey Club in the 'home country' blush and provide strong
arguments in favour of doing away with bookies.
It is all slightly seedy, too. Leading trainers and jockeys, eulogised in
the press, are regular visitors to the colony's courts, some playing lead
roles and bit parts in sex scandals and race fixing jaunts. But all is
forgotten come the next meeting when attention turns to the racing pages and
jockey, horse, raceform and trainer are rolled into one, a blinking number,
calling like Sirens from the giant scoreboard.
Hong Kong's preoccupation with gambling is often sneered at: 'expats' feign
contempt for a Cantonese love of money, forgetting they themselves are
usually in Hong Kong for little else. But the contempt also masks envy. At
the races or in the casinos of the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macao, it is
the ability to go to the edge, to stare ruin in the face, to experience that
level of risk, which is most admired.
This is a human condition, not unique to Hong Kong or the southern Chinese.
The difference is that in Hong Kong, an immigrant society facing the fears
of 1997  - when all bets could be off  - life itself contains risks with
which most would be uncomfortable.
While this man gambles with his savings on the tables, that man is gambling
with his marriage by emigrating to Canada for a foreign passport, leaving
behind his wife and family. Or take that one, the young guy in a suit beside
you in the street: maybe he is gambling with his career, chucking it in for
a fast-buck job to try and get ahead in case, or before, things go wrong.
And the rest? There is the hope. Like the mainland Chinese tourist who last
year won close to Pounds 1m on a one-armed-bandit in Macao. Or the Hong Kong
man who backed a triple for HKDollars 4m. There is always the hope.
Macao also has a race track, gleaming new on Taipa island, the brain child
of Taiwanese businessmen. They had the vision of beaming racing from Macao
'live' to Taiwan, another immigrant Chinese community, once its ban on
gambling was lifted.
But the project failed to attract enough punters from Hong Kong, so it was
rescued by Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's gambling king, and his friends. Mr Ho
could well afford it: he is reckoned to own about one quarter of STDM, the
jealous guardian of Macau's gambling monopoly which pays more than HKDollars
2bn in taxes each year.
The casinos stay open around the clock. At each table the faces are
familiar, mainly working class Hong Kong people of varying ages. Families,
here for an hour on a day out, mix with veteran gamblers who will be here
tomorrow morning. Faces are lit by the hope, all eyes fixed on the card,
ball or button. When a game is over, the eyes look up and meet, sharing in
each other's communion.
Macao was overtaken by history when its harbour silted up and the British
moved 50 miles east across the Pearl River Delta to Hong Kong in 1841. The
Portuguese stayed behind and Macao has kept a Mediterranean tempo. Amidst
its walled villas and scented gardens, or standing among the crumbling
Catholic cathedral, there are few echoes of Hong Kong's intensity and drive.
Hong Kong views Macao rather like a relative who has fallen on hard times.
Macao's plans for a new airport, port and industrial zones are seen as
quaint but inconsequential, being dwarfed by Hong Kong's own projects.
But both colonies face the same future. Macau is to be handed back to
Chinese sovereignty in 1999, two years after Hong Kong. To them both, Peking
has given the same specious of promises of 'a high degree of autonomy' in
internal affairs.
While the red Chinese flag flutters discreetly in Hong Kong, it drapes a
casual arrogance in Macao. Except for a period of ugly tension during
China's Cultural Revolution, relations with the Portuguese have been better
than with Britain. China's wishes are rarely questioned in Macao.
Every evening, the coterie of gamblers and tourists heads for home
strapped-in aboard jetfoils, also courtesy of Mr Ho and his friends, which
ply the 45-minute route to Hong Kong. The craft buzz across the South China
Sea like sea planes unable to quite lift above the water.
On board there is time for one more gamble. A salesgirl walks the lines of
passengers and sells 'scratch and see' lottery tickets. She seems bored. Few
people risk their cash on the way home. She is peddling the hope, offering
one last fix before return to Hong Kong. There, life is less immediate than
gambling, and it will take several years to know if the bets have paid off.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (2): Fresh signs of
confidence - The Economy: prospects are promising, but a threatened trade
war between the US and China could injure Hong Kong's manufacturing
industry.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG has the sort of economic problems that many a recession-obsessed
finance minister would sell a grandmother for: it saw real growth below five
per cent last year; there are acute labour shortages, with unemployment
below two per cent; it is struggling to take the steam out of a residential
property boom that lifted prices by 50 per cent last year; domestic exports
stagnated as manufacturers shifted operations over the border into China  -
moves that lifted re-exports by 28 per cent. It seems that every blessing is
mixed.
More genuine headaches hover, nevertheless. Inflation sticks doggedly over
10 per cent, driven by the labour shortages. Most unnervingly, a threatened
trade war between the United States and China could injure many of the
territory's toy, electronics and garment manufacturers. It is also unnerving
for an economy dominated by exports to see main export markets like the US
and the UK still deep in recession, with Japan and Germany slowing down.
A year ago, there was much greater cause for gloom. The Gulf War cast a
shadow over the world's economies, and brought Hong Kong's
critically-important tourist industry to a juddering halt. The war came as
the second body-blow to tourism in the territory: the Tienanmen massacre in
Beijing in June 1989 brought tourism in China to a grinding halt, and with
it the number of visitors transiting Hong Kong.
The ostracism of China that followed Tienanmen hurt exports from the
mainland, denting the volume of re-exports through Hong Kong. The result was
that in 1990, growth in the economy slowed to 2.8 per cent, while Hong
Kong's container port lost its place as world leader to Singapore.
The rebound since then has been strong. Tourist arrivals recovered to pass
6m in 1991 as Taiwanese visitors have poured into mainland China. This has
lifted hotel occupancy rates back above 75 per cent, even though eight new
hotels opened during the course of the year. Tourism earnings reached about
HKDollars 40bn for the year.
While exports to the US fell by 8 per cent on the year, and sales to Japan
stagnated, exports to Germany in particular, and Europe in general, more
than compensated, lifting total exports by almost 20 per cent for the year.
Hong Kong stands as the world's 11th largest trader, with exports of
HKDollars 89bn in 1991, and imports of HKDollars 90bn making a visible trade
total of HKDollars 179bn.
The Kwai Chung terminal handled 6.2m units over the year  - a record, and 20
per cent better than 1990. The terminal has recovered its leading world
position, once again leading Singapore and Rotterdam.
Consumer spending rose by almost 20 per cent, while residential property
prices leapt by 50 per cent in a six-month period, and are expected to surge
further ahead this year. This has provided a strong underpinning to the
local stock market, which rose by more than 40 per cent on the year,
bettered only by Mexico.
Stock market confidence has also been bolstered by the successful settlement
in January of a long-simmering dispute between the US and China on the
protection of patents and copyright.
Whether this confidence can be sustained will depend critically on a much
more serious and wide-ranging trade conflict between China and the US that
could jeopardise China's most favoured nation (MFN) status, due for renewal
in June.
It has become clear that loss of MFN status, which would lead to duties on
many Chinese exports of 100 per cent and more, would have a catastrophic
effect on the fast-growing export economy of southern China. Hong Kong's
manufacturers in China could not expect to be unscathed: they account for
about 25,000 factories, employing almost 3m people. As re-exports through
Hong Kong would be decimated, the territory would suffer indirectly as as
the volume of freight passing through the container port slumped.
It is estimated that port throughput would fall by 25 per cent, with more
than 40,000 jobs being lost in Hong Kong, and GDP growth cut by about 1.5
per cent.
Needless to say, the Hong Kong government, and manufacturing interests, are
lobbying Washington hard to prevent a trade war with China. But in an
election year, they are nervous that both Congress and the Bush
administration could act unpredictably.
With the exception of the MFN cloud, economic prospects otherwise appear
more promising. The government is forecasting economic growth to reach 5 per
cent this year  - below the 1980s average of 7.8 per cent, but respectable
by world standards.
Agreement with China to build a new airport in Hong Kong, which will involve
projects worth more than HKDollars 100bn over the coming six years, means
there will be strong domestic impetus behind economic growth, with labour in
very short supply for several years to come. The US market may take some
time to provide a fillip to exports, but growing demand throughout Asia
(including China) is likely to provide important compensation.
Most significant of all, the 1990s are likely to see the progressive decline
of Hong Kong as a manufacturer, with most production already shifting over
the border into China. Instead, the territory is emerging as a major
entrepot for China, and the effective capital of a south China region
encompassing 120m people in Guangdong, Fujian and Taiwan. It will also be
critical as a services hub for an increasingly prosperous east Asia region,
providing financial and business services, telecommunications links, and a
pivotal port and airport.
All in all, Britain's recession feels light years away.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (4): The Chinese way of
working - Business and Social Etiquette: few people are as cosmopolitan and
tolerant as the Hong Kong Chinese, yet beneath the western veneer you have a
Chinese city that has very Chinese ways of working and playing, explains
David Dodwell.

<TEXT>
AS the taxi turned away from Kaitak airport and into the tightly packed
night-time streets of Kowloon  - an orgy of dubious tenement blocks and
garish neon  - it was impossible to ignore the tin containers scattered
along the pavements and on the street corners with flames leaping out of
them. Families were feeding paper money to the hungry ghosts.
Scratch Hong Kong's colonial and expatriate veneer and you have a Chinese
city that has very Chinese ways of working and playing. Its taipans may be
cosmopolitan enough to forgive a visiting barbarian his ignorance of these
ways, but without some knowledge, it will prove hard to share the moral high
ground.
A visiting business-person can get a long way with scant knowledge of hungry
ghosts. At the most fundamental level, most Chinese business people are
highly conservative. This means they dress conservatively, are uncomfortable
with body contact, and prefer a polite distance. They can be appalled by the
robust bonhomie typical of some American businessmen  - all shoulder hugs
and first name terms. Dressing conservatively means suit and tie for a man,
even in the soporific humidity of Hong Kong's summer months.
It is not only for reasons of etiquette that Chinese prefer to keep their
distance. Put bluntly, they find that many westerners smell. It's all to do
with being hairy, and open-pored. Lots of showers and deodorants will be
more than usually important  - and not only in torrid summer.
For a woman, crisp neutral elegance is safer than anything flamboyant. Both
white and royal blue are funeral colours among Chinese, so are best avoided.
There is a strong undercurrent of chauvinism among Chinese men which is
disguised by taboos on body contact, discrete body language, and the
presence of many Chinese women at the very highest levels of business,
government and industry. Behind a tendency to be dismissive of women is a
respect for those who apply a sharp, no-nonsense intelligence in their work.
So a visiting woman executive can earn respect, but should be under no
illusions that she will have more to prove than a male to win the confidence
of a Hong Kong client.
A lack of promptness will go down badly. Hong Kong works as a highly
efficient place, where the value of time is calculated carefully. The
physical compactness of the city means that many meetings can be crowded
into a day, from power breakfasts to after-dinner discussions. Just because
a meeting is over lunch, or dinner, or in a nightclub should not blind a
visitor to the fact the agenda is strictly business.
One US-educated Chinese businessman confided: 'I find it excruciating to
have a client chatting to me about his wife, her breast cancer, his
daughter's divorce, and other very personal details. It's so embarrassing. A
Chinese would never bring his personal life into a business meeting."
The result of this is that Chinese appear to many westerners to lack
polished edges. They tend to 'get straight down to business,' rather than
banter at the beginning of a meeting, and shuffle rather stiffly through the
pleasantries.
'If you think a Chinese businessman is unpolished, you may not be wrong,'
one Chinese executive notes: 'Some have little in the way of formal
education, and have got to where they have got by hard work and two bare
hands.'
This is less likely to be the case among younger Chinese. Those who arrived
in Hong Kong as refugees from China during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s have,
where possible, made sure their children have had the educations they never
had chance to obtain.
As a result, the universities of Vancouver, San Francisco and London are
awash with diligent and successful Chinese students. Many have returned to
run their own, or family companies, or to swell the ranks of Hong Kong's
professional classes. The point to remember is that money, and business
acumen counts for more than a PhD. The result is a surprisingly meritocratic
respect for anyone who has acquired wealth, whether or not it is underpinned
by impressive academic success. At the same time, it is often sensible to
draw a discrete veil around the question of someone's origins, or how his
wealth was first amassed.
Linked with a powerful sense of personal dignity is the Chinese concept of
'face'. In fact, much more is made of face than is necessary, since
westerners have their own very similar concepts of giving or losing face. At
a practical level, it usually means more than treating people with respect
and politeness. In Hong Kong it may mean that difficult or confrontational
issues would if possible be dealt with by junior staff: it is thought
unseemly for taipans to exchange harsh words unless it is absolutely
necessary.
'Face' might also mean that someone whose grasp of English is uncertain will
pretend to understand even if he does not. It is important to remember that
one's counterpart is doing business in his or her second language. By
talking simply, avoiding idiomatic English, and encouraging one's
counterpart to summarise as a way of confirming understanding, later
embarrassment can be avoided.
Even among sophisticated, cosmopolitan young business people in Hong Kong
(and it is worth noting that Hong Kong is an extremely young society, with
many large companies run by people in their twenties and thirties),
'Chineseness' shows through in an all-pervasive regard for superstition.
Even those converted to Christianity show a healthy respect for the pantheon
of Taoist deities that populate the lives of the majority. Belief in natural
harmony  - the balance of the polar forces of yin and yang  - and of energy
forces flowing through the environment  - understood as the forces of
fengshui, or wind and water - reside deep in Chinese minds. So does ancestor
worship, belief in auspicious and inauspicious dates, and superstition
linked through word play and puns with lucky and unlucky numbers, colours
and words.
For a westerner, it is often enough to be a knowing observer on these
subconscious forces in every Chinese life. Sometimes, however, a more active
awareness may be called for. A telephone number with lots of '4s' in it, or
a hotel room on the 44th floor, would be seen as singularly inauspicious.
The number four in Chinese sounds much the same as the word for death. By
contrast, the numbers 3, 8 and 9 are full of good luck: the first sounds
like the word for life, the second for wealth, and the third for long life.
This may sound far-fetched, but it is bemusing to stand in the Central mass
transit railway station at rush hour and watch how reluctant passengers are
to exit through turnstile number 44.
Gifts for a client also need to be carefully chosen. A bell or a watch or
clock are unlikely to be welcome, since they suggest death is not far away.
In the unlikely event that shoes are being considered for a gift, forget it:
they augur that the recipient is going to walk out of your life.
Belief in fengshui is pervasive, and keeps a large number of geomancers and
fortune tellers in considerable wealth. The imposing Bank of China
headquarters caused consternation when it was completed in 1988: its mirror
walls reflected angry spirits into many surrounding buildings. A tree had to
be planted in the Governor's garden nearby to prevent evil spirits being
reflected into his house (given the governor's recent untimely resignation,
one might wonder whether the tree was wholly effective).
There was much consternation during the early 1980s, when the Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai banking corporation headquarters was being rebuilt. Their site in
Queen's Road, Central, is at a particularly auspicious junction of positive
natural forces, and the dispersal of staff to temporary offices around the
city was seen as terrible for the bank, and for the territory as a whole.
Worse still, the two bronze guardian lions at the entrance to the bank had
to be kept in storage, laying the territory exposed to any number of
unauspicious forces. No wonder, then, that Hong Kong went through one of the
most turbulent periods of its history during the early 1980s, with currency
crises, bank collapses, and two years of tempestuous negotiation between
Britain and China over its future beyond 1997. It was not just conservative
Chinese who sighed a relief when the new headquarters were completed, and
the lions back on guard.
At a more mundane level, fengshui dictates how a room or office should be
furnished. Many a Columbia educated Chinese graduate has been discovered
realigning desks and chairs in his or her office, putting mirrors up, or
placing a fish tank in a particular position, after advice from a geomancer.
even if they are sceptical about fengshui, pragmatism tells them it is best
to hedge bets.
The forces of yin (the female or cooling principle) and yang (the male, or
heating principle) also play a subtle part in Chinese lives, and should
always be kept in balance. For a visitor, they come into play most clearly
around the dining table, where 'heating' foods like red meat should always
be counterbalanced by 'cooling' foods like fish or vegetables. Guinness or
brandy are yang, while gin or white wine are yin. Fried foods are yang;
poached are yin. It is not just chopsticks one has to wrestle with at the
dining table.
In fact, it is probably at the dining table that the tables are turned on
Chinese who regard westerners as uncouth or barbarian: Chinese table manners
can be shocking to western sensibilities. They may burp and belch; they may
slurp soup or tea with great gusto; they may spit shell and other inedibles
onto the tablecloth by the plate. They may conduct elaborate explorations
with toothpicks. After a chinese meal, a tablecloth is as likely as not to
look like a battlefield.
No offence is meant by any of this. Also, do not be discomfited if the host
serves you personally. It is seen as natural politeness, and need not be
reciprocated. You should try not to use personal chopsticks in the central
serving bowls - this is seen as unhygienic. Also, do not be surprised if a
host draws proceedings quickly to a close once the final course has been
consumed. It is not a Chinese habit to dally at the table after eating  -
perhaps not surprising, giving the mess it may be in.
After making such a meal of the idiosyncracies of Chinese culture, it is
perhaps worth re-emphasising that few people are as cosmopolitan as Hong
Kong Chinese. They are highly tolerant of different cultural habits, and
will tend not to take offence if you are ignorant of theirs. Many are so
westernised that their sensibilities are very similar to our own. Few could
be easier to do business with.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (6): Paradise for hagglers
 -SHOPPING: bargains about, but haggling in Hong Kong has been refined to an
art form in which most western shoppers are timorous amateurs. says David

A PETITE, and well-dressed Chinese woman picked up a linen embroidered
tablecloth in a bustling store on Kowloon's Granville Road, and gestured to
the shopkeeper asking a price. After a long preamble describing the fineness
of the work, and the hundreds of hours spent on it by needleworkers in
Suzhou, he confided it would cost about HKDollars 6,000.
There followed much sucking of teeth, accompanied by gestures of disbelief,
and many minutes of commentary about how many shops sell such tablecloths,
and how cheaply they are made in China.
In the minutes that followed, the mysterious rituals of haggling unfolded.
Voices were never raised. There was much smiling and laughing. There were
many restatements of honourability, good faith and being a good customer.
Promises were made about bringing more business to the shop by getting
friends to come. There were inquiries about a better price if she bought
two. Emphasis was placed on the fact she could pay in cash.
It all took half an hour. Both seemed happy as a deal was sealed and the
cloth gift-wrapped  - though the shopkeeper made occasional protests of how
much money he was losing. When she emerged, she had in fact paid HKDollars
1,250.
Haggling in Hong Kong has been refined to an art form in which most western
shoppers are timorous amateurs. While certain shops stick to fixed prices,
haggling is taken for granted in most of them, and most western shoppers
miss out on the sport that for many Hong Kongers appears to be the principle
point of any purchase: it is the travelling, rather than the arriving, that
makes it all worthwhile.
While the example of the tablecloth is real, it is rare in the width of the
chasm that was breached by shopper and shopkeeper. I suspect she had an
inkling of how much the shopkeeper had paid. It is nevertheless not rare for
a realistic sale price to be half the marked price of any item, whether it
is a stereo system or Gameboy, silk flowers or a piece of Paris fashion.
Two important starting points ahead of a serious haggling session are to
know what price you would have to pay for the same thing back home -
including any tax the customs and excise might put on it as you try to slip
inconspicuously through the green channel  - and to be willing to walk away.
Once a shopkeeper scents your reluctance to walk away, he has an upper hand
that you are unlikely to overcome.
Other points to keep in mind are:
Anything you set your eyes on in a street market might be fake, or stolen.
The most obvious fakes are the Rolexes touted from folding tables in street
markets like Temple Street in Kowloon.
'But this isn't a real Rolex,' a friend once protested as he weighed the
offering in his hand. 'No,' replied the tout without embarrassment or
hesitation: 'But real Seiko inside.'
American Express cards are next to useless in the territory, claim some
observers. Hong Kong shopkeepers hate the delay in payment, and the fee they
have to pay, and will add at least six per cent to the price, even if a deal
has ostensibly been sealed.
While Hong Kong is not the bargain basement it once claimed to be, (for best
prices, a shopper must nowadays be in Bangkok), there are still good reasons
to shop here in earnest.
As for electronic goods, the territory is among the first in the world to
get its hands on new Japanese gizmos. You can be sure to find models in Hong
Kong which are unlikely to arrive in shops back home for a year or two. This
applies as much to cameras and camcorders as it does to personal organisers
or portable compact disc players.
Many factory outlets offer haute couture fashions at prices that would
inflame trend-setting purchasers in Paris or Rome. This happens because
quota limits for various countries often prevent the export of everything
made for the big name fashion houses in Europe or the US. Factory outlets
are dotted all over Hong Kong and Kowloon, and are listed in a booklet
published by the Hong Kong Tourist Association, (see section on key facts
for visitors).
Leather goods, most made in mainland China, are beginning to be well styled,
and cost a fraction of leather goods in Europe.
Chinese arts and crafts are more difficult to guage. Prices are likely to be
lower than in tourist outlets in mainland China, and the range of products
available is unlikely to be matched elsewhere. But the territory provides a
convenient hunting ground for many of the world's most expert and most avid
collectors of Chinese arts  - and prices reflect this. Bargains can
undoubtedly be found in areas like Holloway Road above Central, but it will
take luck, patience, and a very good eye to trip over them.
Myth has it that men should have suits tailored in Hong Kong. Needless to
say, in 1986, the FT conducted a straw poll of 'best dressed men' in Hong
Kong only to discover they all had their suits made elsewhere. Italy and
London seemed then to be the preferred locations. It is nevertheless true
that good suits can be made in the territory. Hotel concierges are probably
the best source of tips on where to go. They are likely to be cheaper than
from Savile Row, and if you either offer a suit you already own to be
copied, or have the patience to have at least three fittings, money could
well be saved.
Perhaps the most daunting prospect for any newly-arrived shopper is to
choose the direction in which to point. One can be forgiven for feeling the
territory is wall-to-wall shops. At one end of the spectrum are modern,
luxurious air-conditioned plazas full of Guccis and Ferragamos, and charging
prices similar to those in Paris. These seem to be frequented mostly by
Japanese tourists. At the other end of the spectrum are sweltering outdoor
night markets with a powerful barrow-boy bustle about them.
Air-conditioned shopping is practically well essential in the day time in
summer. On Hong Kong island, the new Pacific Place is impressive, as is the
nearby cobweb of Japanese department stores. In Kowloon, Harbour City and
Ocean Terminal next to the Star Ferry offer miles of fascinating shopping,
while the newly-opened Hong Kong Place in east Tsimshatsui claims to be the
largest shopping complex in Asia.
Out of doors, the liveliest single market is Temple Street in Mong Kok,
which comes alive around seven in the evening, and goes on to midnight.
Stanley Market on the south of Hong Kong island has lots of casual wear in
western sizes. In Central, the tightly packed streets above Queen's Road  -
like Li Yuen streets east and west  - offer handbags, scarves, sweaters,
dresses, toys and imitation jewellery.
The jade market in Kowloon is a popular destination, while the quest for
handicrafts and fine art is concentrated on Holloway Road, Cat Street and
Stanley Main Street. Chinese Arts and Crafts emporiums, owned by mainland
Chinese, are dotted around the territory, and offer an immense range of
goods from across the border.
While Hong Kong is without question a haggler's paradise, it is also the
home of 'caveat emptor.' Once bought, an item will only rarely be returnable
to the seller if it is found to be fake or faulty. Shops carrying the Hong
Kong Tourist Association symbol (a red junk in a circle) offer the highest
level of reliability, but 'caveat emptor' remains the watchword of every
sensible shopper in Hong Kong.

   THE Hong Kong Tourist Association publishes a wide range of guides
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
on hotels, on shopping, on eating out and nightlife, for example. They also
publish excellent walking tour booklets.
Among the best guide books are the APA guide; and Introduction to Hong Kong
(Odyssey Guides; the Guidebook Company).
Business:
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council publishes a guide called Hong Kong
for the Business Visitor, as well as a wealth of more specific material on
different industries, and regions of China.
Chambers of Commerce, including the HK General Chamber, publish helpful
material, but the best by far comes from the American Chamber of Commerce
based in Swire House (tel: 526 0165). You do not have to be American to be
able to buy their publications, which include:
Living in Hong Kong; Doing Business in Today's Hong Kong; Establishing an
Office in Hong Kong; PRC Business Firms in Hong Kong &amp; Macao; Doing Business
in Guangdong
(The American Chamber also offers a Business Briefing service where, for the
price of a 'power breakfast,' a panel of executives with relevant local
business experience will brief you on their experience of operating in Hong
Kong and China. The Chamber likes four weeks notice to arrange appropriate
panellists.)
The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation publishes a valuable guide to
doing business in the territory as part of its 'Business Profile' series
that also includes many countries in Asia, and a large number of Chinese
provinces and cities.
Other business publications are listed in the section on key facts on Hong

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (1): A shock for the
senses - First impressions: From the moment that you land in bustling,
colourful Hong Kong, the experience sends the adrenalin rushing, says David
Dodwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Head glued to the window of the jumbo descending into Hong Kong, you first
get seriously alarmed when you realise you can see the chopsticks of the
family eating supper in the tenement block passing beneath the outstretched
wheels.
Just when you are sure the undercarriage is about to rip nests of television
aerials from the rooftops, the plane banks judderingly right, and you hit
the runway, with brakes full on and nothing but sea on either side.
You would not be human if the adrenalin were not rushing. It is a rare human
that does not find the adrenalin rushing in similar fashion throughout a
stay in the territory: 'Hong Kong shocks the senses from the moment you
land,' a fellow passenger noted: 'It may thrill you. It may appal you. But
it is certain to shock the senses.'
Whether it is the teeming streets, the Manhattan skylines, the maritime
hub-bub, the night-time neon technicolours, or joss-scented Taoist temples,
one walks Hong Kong wide-eyed.
Small wonder that it provides home for some of the world's most creative
entrepreneurs, and counts among the world's most bustling business centres.
Small wonder, too, that the world's recession appears to have passed it by.
Here you can hold seven meetings in a day, and still have time for cocktails
before dinner. You can eat haute cuisine from every corner of the world. You
can rest your head in some of the world's best hotels, paying a fraction of
what even mediocre European or US hotels would cost. The community is as
cosmopolitan as New York  - the city with which it is most frequently
compared, and which it most resembles.
In less than a decade this will be China. Some say this will spell the end
of Hong Kong's 'golden age.' Others say that Hong Kong can forge its own
future as the capital of a south Chinese economy that encompasses 120m
people in Guangdong, Fujian and Taiwan. At present, as the leadership in
Beijing edges nervously towards creating a more open society, there is a
good chance Hong Kong's optimists will be right.
It is these optimists that are driving growth that has averaged almost 8 per
cent a year over the past decade. They have put down 25,000 factories inside
China, where they employ about 3m people.
They are encouraging the metamorphosis of Hong Kong from a simple
manufacturer into a centre of sophisticated services ranging from product
design to quality control, including the panoply of business and financial
services, and providing the main communications hub for east Asia. Few
places are likely to be more exciting  - or, for the business person, more
fruitful  - in the decade ahead.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (3): Visitors spoiled for
choice - Hotels: the recent opening of new luxury hotels has triggered a
fierce competitive response from older marble palaces which appear regularly
among the world's top ten hotels and offer every conceivable service, says
David Dodwell

<TEXT>
THE Gulf War, and a rush of new luxury hotels opening their doors, have
given Hong Kong hoteliers an unaccustomed taste of the real world in 1991 as
occupancy rates slipped to average 75 per cent.
In Europe or the US, many hoteliers would be cracking champagne bottles if
they achieved such occupancy rates, but in Hong Kong, after years during
which occupancies have averaged close to 90 per cent all year round, this
has been a sobering time. Particularly vulnerable have been the newest
hotels, and those reliant on the much-depressed US rag trade.
The upside for visitors is that room prices have tumbled, allowing a taste
of unalloyed sybaritic luxury for the price of an average motel in Europe or
the US. Nor has it been essential to make bookings months in advance during
the hectic peak of September to December - a hassle that has humbled many a
business traveller in recent years if he was rash enough to fly in convinced
he would find something on the night.
It is often difficult for a business traveller brutalised by the experience
of hotels in Europe or the US to anticipate the cossetting that can be
assured in any one of 30 of the territory's 81 leading hotels. These marble
palaces (heaven knows how many thousands of acres of marble are shipped into
the territory every year) house every conceivable service - from meals 24
hours a day to laser disc players, and fax machines in your room with your
own personal number.
Even Hong Kong's stateliest and most traditional hotels, like the Peninsula
with four staff to every guest, are awash with the latest electronic gismos
that swish curtains open and closed, dim lights in every nook, pull
satellite channels onto the television screen, bring messages onto the
screen overriding whatever programme you are watching, and activate
personalised answering machines on your room telephone.
A decade ago, choice of the right hotel in Hong Kong was a comparatively
simple affair. If you were visiting bankers, brokers or government officials
your chairman or chief executive stayed at the Mandarin Oriental on Hong
Kong island. Other executives would stay at the Hilton nearby. If you were
in town to visit industry - whether garments or electronics - your chairman
or chief executive stayed at the Peninsula or the Regent on Kowloon side.
Lesser mortals stayed at one of the three Omni hotels near the Star ferry,
or at the Shangri-la, or a neighbour on the east Tsinshatsui waterfront.
All of these hotels appeared regularly among the world's top ten hotels, so
even the middle-ranking executive could be assured of uncommon luxury. The
only problem was booking a room in the first place.
Today, choice is a more perplexing affair. For traditionalists, perhaps
there will never be an alternative to the Mandarin, the Peninsula or the
Regent. But arriviste hotels like the Grand Hyatt, the Conrad and the Island
Shangri-la (all on Hong Kong island) and the Ramada Renaissance and Hotel
Nikko in Kowloon can offer services that match, and often better, the
territory's grand dame hotels, which must make do, of course, with
comparatively older property.
The biggest single new influence has been the opening two years ago of Hong
Kong's massive Convention and Exhibition centre on the Wanchai waterfront on
Hong Kong island. The centre itself houses two hotels - the Grand Hyatt and
the New World Harbour View  - with three others at nearby Pacific Place. As
the volume of conference and exhibition business grows in Hong Kong, so an
increasing number of visitors are likely to shun the hotels of Kowloon and
Central, staying instead at one of the five hotels closest by.
It is not the Convention Centre alone that will draw visitors away from
traditional haunts. The Grand Hyatt has flooded the hotel industry with
hype, but has so far offered a quality that lives up to all but its most
extravagant claims - such as that which claims it provides a 'neo-nostalgic
celebration of the sophisticated turn of the century.' But what exactly is
'neo-nostalgia'?
In Pacific Place, a glittering palace to the main Hong Kong religion of
shopping, the Conrad and the Island Shangri-la will compete hard with the
Hyatt for quality and service. The third hotel, the Marriott, feels modest
only when set against the likes of the Grand Hyatt, and anyway has such
strong loyalty from among US visitors that it could well maintain the
highest occupancy rates of the three.
The recent opening of these hotels has triggered a fierce competitive
response from older hotels. In Kowloon, the Regent has refurbished suites,
and enlarged its gymnasium. The Peninsula is pressing ahead with plans to
add a 30-storey extension that will (for the first time) give guests a pool,
a health centre and a business centre.
Perhaps the most vigorous response has come from the Hilton in Hong Kong's
Central district. Having several years ago been the first in the territory
to introduce executive and non-smoking floors, it has launched for Japanese
guests a 'wa no kutsurogi' service that will allow them to be checked in on
their own floor by Japanese-speaking hotel staff, with all hotel room
literature in Japanese.
A new 'Meetings 2000' service is intended to meet all the high-tech needs of
executives wanting to use the hotel as a base for presentations or other
functions. It is aimed at warding off fierce competition from hotels like
the Conrad, which has a 54-seat lecture theatre along with usual business
centre and meeting rooms, and the Island Shangri-la, which has a genteel
library as well as state of the art meeting rooms in its expansive business
centre. Such new hotels offer extensive in-room facilities like data lines
for computers and faxes, and double telephone lines. Nevertheless, for sheer
value for money, the Hilton is hard to beat.
A second recent development has been the appearance of a host of excellent
three- and four-star hotels aimed at tour groups, and visitors with more
limited budgets, many from Taiwan, south east Asia, and even China. A total
of seven opened in 1991, with a further nine expected to open this year.
Perhaps the most ambitious is the 1,000-room Panda Hotel in the outlying
area of Tsuen Wan, which may rely heavily on visitors from mainland China
and Taiwan. The 500-room Century hotel in Wanchai is certain to attract
budget-conscious overspill from the Convention Centre. It opened only a
couple of months ago, but has attracted favourable mention so far.
Help in picking the right hotel is hard to give, such is the luxury of
choice and the wide range of executive services offered by so many hotels.
Hong Kong's roads nevertheless become increasingly congested  - particularly
around the main harbour crossing  - so an increasingly sensible rule of
thumb is to pick a hotel close to the venue of most meetings.
Idiosyncratic needs are easier to meet:
Transiting overnight  - stay at the Regal Airport hotel.
Keen on jogging  - stay at the Regent on Kowloon-side, to jog along the
Tsinshatsui waterfront, or the Hilton, Island Shangri-la or Conrad on the
island, since these give good access to Bowen Road, one of the world's most
panoramic jogs.
Keen on swimming  - most hotels have excellent pools. However, the Mandarin
pool is a marble-lined puddle, and the Peninsula has none, so sybaritic are
its guests.
Keen on squash  - the Ramada Renaissance in Kowloon has a good court.
Afraid of heights  - stay with traditional stalwarts like the Mandarin, the
Hilton or the Peninsula. Many hotels make the most of spectacular views, so
you may need to carry sweets in a pocket to help your ears 'pop' as you leap
past the 50th floor.

FT  19 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gains extended as volume increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE from the stock index futures sector helped the UK stock market to
extend its gains yesterday. A modest improvement in sterling against the
D-Mark encouraged optimism for early cuts in base rates, although few
analysts expect such a move until the date for the UK general election has
been announced.
UK institutions were buyers of equities in London yesterday. Firmness in the
dollar brought gains among the international blue chips, which also
responded to a firm re-opening by Wall Street after its one-day holiday.
The Footsie Index staged two attempts at regaining the important 2,550 mark
before finally closing modestly above that level. The closing reading of
2,555.9 on the FT-SE Index showed a rise of 14.9 on the session. In very
late deals, London was helped by early bullishness on Wall Street.
Mr Richard Lake, the equity chart strategist at Hoare Govett, commented that
the index has not yet 'decisively' established itself above the 2,550 level,
a move which he believes would be required if an upward trend is to be
re-established.
This week's resurgence of optimism for an early reduction in UK base rates
continued, although analysts warned that another half-point cut has probably
been fully discounted in the stock market. The debate has long been over the
timing of such a move, and recent actions in the London money markets by the
Bank of England have not encouraged suggestions that rates will be cut
before the Budget day, March 10.
Shares opened higher but once again prices did not move up strongly until
the stock index futures market opened, and the March contract on the Footsie
Index quickly established a premium of around 20 points against the
underlying index, a level it effectively sustained throughout the remainder
of the session's trading.
The Footsie quickly bounced to 2,557.1 but as quickly fell back to 2,546.8
as traders found the 2,550 mark a little forbidding in what was at that
stage a fairly quiet market. Later, the institutions began to buy stock,
often on the back of recommendations from UK broking houses.
The market moved ahead but was still fairly cautious until Wall Street
returned to business with a gain of 11 Dow points in UK trading hours.
London brightened up again but was still shy of the Footsie 2,550 level and
closed below the top of the day.
Trading volume picked up smartly towards the close and the day's Seaq total
of 559.3m shares compared with 465.5m in the previous session; Monday's
retail, or customer, business in equities totalled Pounds 832.6m, which was
considered a relatively satisfactory figure in view of the holiday closure
on Wall Street.
Interest rate hopes, while encouraging across the broad range of equities,
had a somewhat irregular effect on retail and building shares, which have
become closely linked to such prospects.
Some retail stocks advanced sharply, while others held back. Building shares
made little response, and interest focused around current takeover bid
situations, with Steetley moving up strongly on hints that Redland might
increase its offer for the equity now that the rival bid from Tarmac has
been sent for scrutiny by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  19 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson finds US buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THOMPSON

<TEXT>
CONGLOMERATE Hanson saw the biggest percentage rise among the FT-SE 100
stocks as it received enthusiastic support from US investment house Goldman
Sachs. The shares moved ahead 7 1/2 p, or 3.7 per cent, to 210 1/2 p on very
heavy turnover of 17m. There was also exceptionally heavy volume in the
options market.
Mr Jack L. Kelly, Goldman's conglomerates analyst in New York, shifted his
stance from 'attractive' to a strong buy. He said the stock was at a
significant discount to the London market and yet offered an above average
yield. On both a five-year and a one-year basis, Hanson is at a discount to
the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index, while BTR, to which it is often compared,
is at a premium.
Mr Kelly added that some of the factors which have been holding the Hanson
shares back, particularly worries over the successors to Lords Hanson and
White, were reduced following Friday's presentation by the company.
More than 50 per cent of Hanson's turnover is now derived from US or US
overseas subsidiaries. This was reflected in the rise of the shares from the
strength of the dollar yesterday. Finally, they were firm ahead of a hefty
and positive note from County NatWest due to be published very shortly.
L &amp; G reviewed
Dealers said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, was instrumental in
pushing Legal &amp; General sharply higher. The stock closed 9 ahead at 360p on
turnover of almost 1m shares.
Mr Youssef Ziai, an insurance specialist at UBS, now expects L&amp;G to announce
a small profit for the year when it reports preliminary figures on March 19.
Previously he had been looking for the group to announce a sizeable deficit
after bad general insurance losses and heavy provisioning for mortgage
indemnity losses. He also forecast a 5 per cent increase in the final
dividend.
He shifted his expectation because L &amp; G had sold two unit-linked life and
pensions subsidiaries to its main life fund and would treat the proceeds as
an exceptional item and not as an extraordinary item. He said the sale
proceeds, taken above the line, would offset the big losses on insurance and
mortgage indemnity.
Heavy switching between Barclays and NatWest and between Lloyds and Midland
triggered an upsurge in turnovers ahead of the preliminary reporting season,
which starts on Friday. The heaviest activity, 9.7m shares, was in Barclays,
which settled 3 up at 380p. NatWest ended 4 higher at 289p on 4.6m, Midland
5 firmer at 232p on 3.7m and Lloyds 2 better at 393p on 3.6m.
Details of the Royal Insurance link with Aachener &amp; Munchener, of Germany,
and Fondiaria, of Italy, were much as the market had expected and Royal
closed 2 better at 232p. A BZW buy note stimulated support for Sedgwick,
which settled 3 up at 218p.
BP holdings
The slide in BP, triggered mostly by last week's dreadful results but also
by worries about the latest Opec agreement, was halted yesterday after
official confirmation that US investors have sharply increased their
holdings in the UK's premier oil group over the past three months. BP ended
2 firmer at 265p after turnover of 21m shares.
Guaranty Nominees, which holds BP stock on behalf of US investors, said it
held 8.46 per cent of BP's equity. Specialists said US holdings had roughly
doubled in size over the past three months and heavy buying from the US last
week had helped to prevent an even greater slide in the share price. It was
not clear whether the Guaranty Nominees holding disclosed yesterday took in
any of last week's purchases of BP shares.
Second-line oils were mauled again as the market picked up hints that one of
the UK's big integrated houses was about to chop its earnings forecasts for
many of the stocks.
Clyde Petroleum bore the brunt of some heavy selling, closing 5 lower at
62p. However, suggestions of possible delays to the development of Clyde's
Gryphon field were rejected by sector analysts. Hardy Oil &amp; Gas was down 8
at 119p, after 117p, while Lasmo lost the same amount to 206p and Enterprise
6 to 405p.
British Gas, given a sharp push by Strauss Turnbull, the broker, rose a
further 4 to 252p.
Dealers spoke of more exceptionally heavy activity in the utilities. Water
stocks, heavily supported on Monday after a welter of broker buy notes,
encountered a flurry of profit-taking. The regional electricity issues
managed minor gains in spite of hints that some institutions had been
selling the Electricity Package into the market ahead of the expected
cessation of trading in the Package later this year. Up to Pounds 2,835 at
one stage, it closed Pounds 22 ahead at Pounds 2,815.
Stores continued to advance on expectations of a cut in interest rates
before the general election and a possible reduction in income tax in next
month's Budget. Speculation that today's January retail sales figures will
show some recovery from the 0.9 per cent fall in December also provided
support. The sector is now at its best level since the summer of 1988, but
analysts pointed out that on a historical basis stores are not highly rated.
Improved sentiment pushed Great Universal Stores 'A' up 27 to 1508p, while
Sears rose 1 1/2 to 106p on turnover of 12m, responding to the recent
appointment of Mr Liam Strong as chief executive. Argos, depressed of late
by adverse comments from brokers, bounced 10 to 283p and Kingfisher rose 16
to 523p.
Allied-Lyons added 7 at 632p, gaining support from news that the deal to
lease 734 of its public houses to Brent Walker had been completed. The
Office of Fair Trading has threatened legal action against Allied, on the
basis that these pubs still form part of the tied estate, which it has been
ordered to reduce by government legislation. There is growing optimism,
however, that Allied will win the argument.
HP Bulmer, recently volatile on the European Commission's questioning of
cider's favourable tax position, fell 7 to 267p.
The slump in Alexandra Workwear continued, with the stock, which stood at
153p in September, falling 6 to 38p on unusually heavy turnover of 800,000.
Persistent worries about the company's financial situation have deterred
investors from picking up any available stock, but Alexandra's broker was
bidding for and offering shares, suggesting a level may have been reached.
Ladbroke gained 4 to 231p as investors looked forward to an expected
increase in the leisure group's dividend next month.
Hotel group Forte, which suffered from some switching into Ladbroke,
continued to edge up, adding 2 at 227p - a penny above the level that
warrants attached to a maturing bond may be exercised.
Rank Organisation continued its post-results surge, climbing 8 to 713p.
However, some analysts believe the stock may come off when it goes ex the
dividend on Monday.
A squeeze sent GKN climbing to 336p, although as stock appeared at the
higher levels the shares slipped back to 334p, up 9 on balance. Sporadic
buying ahead of today's full-year results helped British Aerospace to harden
3 to 273p. The market expects the results to reveal a loss of between Pounds
80m and Pounds 85m.
Favourable weekend press comment continued to lift Inchcape, which gained
another 9 at 451p as volume rose to 1.8m.
Securities house BZW was reported to have been the seller of Tiphook. The
shares dropped 27 to 316p.
Specialist chemicals and industrial group BTP fell 6 in both the old shares
and the nil-paid to 229p and 25p respectively. Kleinwort Benson has been
telling clients that the shares do not have much 'upside potential' in the
short term following a good run ahead of the recent rights issue.

FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reverses early climb on
Fed's surprise move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets staged a remarkable turnround yesterday, with share prices
falling sharply from early highs in the wake of an unexpected announcement
from the Federal Reserve that it was cutting bank reserve requirements,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.24 at 3,224.73,
having earlier in the day been more than 20 points ahead and nearing its
record close of 3,276.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a sharp 5.10
off at 407.38, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks showed
a drop of 10.02 at 626.41. Turnover on the New York SE came to 235m shares.
The Fed's announcement that, as from April 2, it was reducing reserve
requirements on bank transaction accounts from 12 per cent to 10 per cent
initially lifted sentiment, on the grounds that the move would allow banks
to pass on lower funding costs to customers in the form of cheaper credit.
Within hours, however, the market had turned around as investors took their
cue from a decline in bond prices, which were depressed by fears that the
Fed's actions ruled out another interest rate cut. As the falling 30-year
bond pushed benchmark long-term interest rates up towards 8 per cent, equity
investors took flight.
The news of the reduced reserve requirements, however, helped some bank
stocks. Chase Manhattan rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 24, Citicorp Dollars 1/2
to Dollars 16 1/2 , BankAmerica Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 and Banc-One
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 .
Airline issues were in the limelight in the wake of positive comments on the
sector from analysts at two broking houses, Shearson Lehman Brothers and
First Boston, and lower crude oil prices. UAL advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 148 1/4 , AMR (parent of American Airlines) Dollars 2 to Dollars 76,
Delta Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 70 1/8 and USAir Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17
3/4 .
Walt Disney jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 146 1/2 after the entertainment
group announced plans for a four-for-one stock split.
On the American Stock Exchange, Greyhound Lines slipped Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 10 7/8 after the bus operator said it would purchase new buses for
Dollars 24m. Turner Broadcasting 'A' eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 5/8
after news that the company will soon unveil plans for a new cartoon
television network.
Among mostly weaker oil shares, Phillips Petroleum receded Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 22 7/8 after stating that it would cut its workforce by 1,100 by the
end of June, and Occidental declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 1/2 in spite
of revealing that it will sell a variety of coal properties for Dollars 41m.
Marvel Entertainment, a relative newcomer to the market and which has
enjoyed explosive growth in its share price since flotation, plummeted
Dollars 11 3/8 to Dollars 54 5/8 in the wake of press reports highlighting
that the comic book publisher remains highly leveraged.
Canada
A LATE sell-off in the US and Canadian bond markets dragged Toronto stocks
down in moderate trading.
The composite index fell 19.6 to close at 3,551.2. Declining issues
outnumbered advances by 335 to 255, while volume amounted to 27m shares.
Dominion Textile slipped CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 8 1/2 . The company said
it will discontinue operation of its Dominion Fabrics unit, and will
permanently close two plants run by the unit.
Abitibi-Price reported a fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 48.1m, or 70 cents
a share, after a restructuring charge of CDollars 24.4m. The stock was
unchanged at CDollars 15 3/8 .

FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Yugoslav ceasefire helps Vienna to
recover - But the peace dividend is offset by domestic economic concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much to the relief of Austrian stockbrokers, bankers and the business
community, the ceasefire in neighbouring Yugoslavia is providing an
incentive for foreign investors to return to the Vienna stock exchange. But
international political initiatives are facing a counterweight, in domestic
economic concerns, as the stock market attempts to emerge from a
disappointing 1991.
According to the FT-Actuaries World Index series, Austria fell 14.2 per cent
last year, against a rise of 12.5 per cent for Europe, including the UK.
This year's recovery has been almost as remarkable: Vienna's 18-share ATX
index closed at 1,083.95 yesterday, down 10.34 points, but up 22.7 per cent
from the end of December, against an FT-Actuaries Europe rise of under 5 per
cent for the same period. But traders say the index is unlikely to improve
much further during the rest of this year.
Foreign institutions have also been responsible for an increase in volume.
Mostly from the US and the UK, they have been buying shares in the reliable
utilities sector and the construction industry. Turnover in January totalled
Sch14bn (Dollars 1.2bn), compared to Sch9bn in December and in January last
year.
Mr Christian Gutlederer, a senior official at the Vienna bourse, says:
'There are signs that a rebound is taking place. But any increase in the
index is still dependent on so many factors.'
One of these factors is the slowing down of the Austrian economy, which
traders hope will not dip into recession. Estimates for GDP, which grew by 4
per cent in 1990 and 3 per cent in 1991, have been revised down to 2.3 per
cent for 1992 - still relatively high compared with other OECD economies.
Inflation is only expected to rise by 0.3 of a percentage point to 3.6 per
cent, and unemployment should increase slightly, to 6 per cent.
The sluggish growth in GDP, however, is not the main reason for the decline
in corporate investment which, according to WIFO, the Vienna Institute for
Economic Forecasting, will decrease this year from 6 per cent to 3 per cent
of profits; nor is the latest round of wage-bargaining, which agreed to a
4.8 per cent rise. Rather, it is interest rates, and the uncertainty in the
former Soviet Union, which continue to dull confidence in the bourse.
Because the schilling is tied to the D-Mark, Austria has had to bear
correspondingly heavy interest rates. The recent dip of 0.3 points to 8.2
per cent in bond yields has had little effect on the bourse. 'Interest rates
are still too high,' says Mr Peter Szopa, a senior analyst at Vienna's
Girozentrale bank. 'Normal credit rates are about 13 per cent. This is too
expensive.' Any decline in German interest rates would be welcomed in
Vienna.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union has been a mixed blessing. Shares in
IGM, the computer parts manufacturer which supplied the Soviet market, have
fallen by over 50 per cent since last August.
However, the construction industry, particularly Wienerberger, Poor, and
Maculan, is thriving in eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.
Maculan, for example, is being paid by the German government to build
housing for Soviet troops returning from eastern Europe. Order books in the
construction sector are up 22 per cent on a year ago, and earnings are
expected to grow by 3.5 per cent in real terms.
'I am cautiously optimistic. But I think we are between two phases,' says Mr
Szopa. 'On the one hand, the foreigners are returning, slowly. On the other,
we are waiting not only for new forecasts due at the end of March, but for
indications that the US, the UK, and other western economies will emerge
from the recession later this year. If not, we cannot expect any upswing in
the bourse.'

FT  19 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Another sterling day for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar powered ahead on the foreign exchanges yesterday, reaching its
highest level in three months against the D-Mark, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The US unit closed 2.5 pfennigs stronger at DM1.6480 in London, after having
enjoyed an early morning surge that carried it as high as DM1.6515. Although
the dollar fell back slightly, dealers said they expected it to trade in a
new range, which could see the US currency as high as DM1.70 in the near
term. In New York the dollar eased to DM1.6440.
Although the dollar's recent rallies had been rumoured to be the result of
speculative buying out of the Middle East, there was evidence that
yesterday's rise was due to long-term players, such as investment trusts.
Economists expected the dollar to continue its rise this week, albeit at a
much slower pace than recently. Tomorrow's Humphrey Hawkins address to
Congress from Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan is expected to add
further fuel to the dollar's rise.
The US currency was trading on the alleged brink of intervention against the
yen, bumping up against the Y128 level for most of the day. It closed in
London at Y128.00, compared with Y126.95 on Monday.
By the afternoon in New York, the dollar was trading higher still, but it
finished back at Y127.93. Rumours were rife that the US Fed had been
checking prices, sparking fears of intervention.
Fears of Bundesbank intervention, and rumours that the German central bank
had also been checking prices, kept the D-Mark from weakening even further
against the dollar.
However, market sentiment now appears to be firmly set against the D-Mark.
Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, reinforced this view with
comments which implied that even if money supply figures out this week were
far worse than expected, the German central bank would not change monetary
policy.
The German unit weakened against the yen, falling to Y77.54. Dealers said
they expected the next D-Mark/yen resistance level to focus on Y77.30.
Sterling crept up slightly against the D-Mark, and just edged into the
narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism against the D-Mark.
However, sterling's rise was more the result of a weaker German unit, rather
than any inherent strength.
The pound finished at DM2.8850, compared with DM2.88 on Monday. Speculation
of a UK interest rate cut before the general election appeared to have
little effect on sterling.
The tension within the ERM grid increased last night, as the peseta reached
its uppermost limit against sterling. The Spanish currency closed at Pta
180.61 to the pound.
The D-Mark turned in the weakest performance in the European Monetary
System, although it was cushioned against the lira by intervention from the
Bank of Italy. The German unit ended at L750.55, against L750.12 on Monday.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate rumours revive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST when you thought it was safe, the rumour mill starts grinding again.
The UK markets were in turmoil yesterday, looking for an interest rate cut
behind every statistic.
Sterling's foray into the narrow band of the European exchange rate
mechanism against the D-Mark, for the first time in several months, and its
strength against the German currency were seen as prime opportunities for
the authorities to make that long-anticipated move.
However, economists were less enthusiastic, saying the government was
unlikely to cut rates so far in advance of the general election, which is
widely forecast for April 9. The pound was still sitting on the bottom of
the ERM grid, and the risk was too great.
The most likely date for a rate reduction was still the Budget on March 10.
Econo-mists were more optimistic on the level of rate cuts, however. They
suggested that there could be room for a  1/2 point cut at Budget time -
boosting the chances of a Conservative victory in the general election - and
a further   1/2 point reduction after the poll.
The Bank of England kept the markets guessing about the immediate course of
interest rates, with no action to stem the forecast Pounds 550m shortage in
its early morning operations. However, when it operated, it did so with a
flourish.
Virtually all of the shortfall was eliminated by noon, with the purchase of
Pounds 450m in band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The final Pounds 100m
was taken out early in the afternoon, also through band one bank bills at 10
3/8 per cent.
Late assistance added an extra Pounds 70m, which 'opened the floodgates' for
paper that had still been scarce at the time, said one dealer.
The forecast shortage was comprised largely of treasury bills and maturing
assistance.
The Bank's generous actions pushed overnight rates as low as 7 per cent
towards the end of the day, although they recovered to close at 10 9/16 -
7/16 per cent.
The key three months interbank rate eased  1/16 of a point to 10 5/16 - 3/16
per cent, while one month money was also easier at 10 1/2 - 7/16 per cent.
In Germany, call money was steady at 9.55/65 per cent, a fraction under the
Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Traders were expecting the
Bundesbank to keep liquidity tight.
Funds in the US averaged 4 per cent, the presumed Federal Reserve target.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Long end slides as Fed cuts reserve
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices nosedived at the long end of the maturity range yesterday
after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lowered bank reserve requirements.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at
100 3/16 , yielding 7.973 per cent. The two-year note, however, was up  1/32
at 99 5/16 , yielding 5.232 per cent.
After the Presidents Day holiday, which closed the markets on Monday, US
investors returned to work with little incentive to buy Treasuries. Early
on, however, demand from Japanese investors in Tokyo, provoked by the
strengthening dollar, kept prices in positive territory.
The market took a sudden turn soon after midday, when the Fed announced
that, as of April 2, it was cutting the reserve requirement on transaction
accounts from 12 per cent to 10 per cent. The idea behind the Fed's move is
to free up capital that banks can lend to corporates or consumers, and thus
stimulate the flagging economy.
Bond investors took fright on the news because they believed the move makes
another interest rate cut less likely. In contrast, prices at the short end
held up because investors were betting that banks would use some of their
additional capital to invest in short-term Treasury securities.
THE UK government bond market opened up a quarter of a percentage point,
helped by sterling's strength, but prices later slipped to close unchanged
following the weakness in the US Treasury bond market. The pound's strength
against the D-Mark fuelled buying interest from both domestic and
international investors, traders said.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 97.31, up from Monday's close of
97.23 and traded up to a high of 98.07, before ending the day at around
97.29.
Volume in the Liffe futures contract was above average at over 23,000
contracts. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 116 5/32
and traded at 116 3/8 late.
GERMAN government bonds traded in a narrow range as participants await the
release of the German M3 money supply figures for January.
The figure is expected to show an increase from December's 5.7 per cent to
between 8 and 10 per cent in January.
The Bundesbank's 1992 M3 target range is 3.5-5.5 per cent growth. The Liffe
bund futures contract closed almost unchanged on the day at 87.87.
JAPANESE government bonds ended little changed with the benchmark No 129
yielding 5.385 per cent after trading in a narrow range.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Equity Issues: Global telecom sector set to
expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOBAL telecommunications sector is expected to generate a flood of new
equity issues - both domestic and international - over the next few years.
According to Mr Richard Ryder, head of telecommunications research at
Salomon Brothers in London, the market capitalisation of the listed global
telecommunications sector may increase by between Dollars 80bn and Dollars
100bn from its current level of Dollars 445bn over the next three-to-five
years due to substantial new stock issues.
Privatisations and share sales in Telefonica de Argentina, British Telecom,
STET of Italy, Telmex of Mexico and Telecom Corporation of New Zealand,
raised over Dollars 13bn during 1991.
Both Singapore Telecom and OTE, the Greek telecommunications group, are due
to be floated this year. In the case of Singapore Telecom, investment
bankers believe domestic investors will be able to buy the shares more
cheaply than foreign investors.
International equity offerings are also expected from the following:
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the German state telecom monopoly;
Telebras, the Brazilian state-controlled telecom company;
Telecom Corporation of New Zealand (Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, two of the
big US regional telephone companies, reduced their individual shareholdings
to 34.17 per cent each last year after an international equity offering, and
a further offering is expected since the New Zealand government requires
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic to reduce their combined holdings to 49.9 per
cent or less by September 1993);
Telekom Malaysia, which followed its privatisation in November 1990 with a
convertible bond issue last March (with Dollars 200m in bonds to be
exchanged for 50m shares), may now be considering a tender offer;
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the Japanese telecommunications
utility, in which foreigners may be permitted to buy a 20 per cent stake.
Telecom shares often appeal to international investors for a variety of
reasons: they are utilities which investors find easy to understand, they
often enjoy a monopoly position at home and they tend to be among the
largest capitalised stocks in the domestic market.
Fund managers often regard them as a suitable blue-chip substitute for the
foreign stock market as a whole and capable of providing a good income
stream. Telecom companies in the lesser developed countries are often
considered particularly attractive because of their growth potential.
'It's clear that an international telecom sector is building up, what with
Mexico, New Zealand and the UK last year,' said one banker.
The factors which can deter international investors are the regulatory
environment and the management - especially if the bureaucrats dating from
the period of state ownership remain in place.
Investment bankers point out it can be difficult to provide a valuation,
especially in countries plagued by hyperinflation and where the accounting
principles and the accountants do not follow international standards,
although such standards are increasingly becoming more widespread.

<TEXT>
TNT Express Worldwide, the express delivery arm of the Australian freight
group, announced yesterday it had established a 'linehaul' agreement for
Transatlantic freight with Memphis-based Federal Express.
There has been speculation recently about possible links between the two
companies.
Federal Express has been losing money on its European operations and
confirmed last week it was looking to restructure its international
business. Analysts have speculated this could involve joint venture
arrangements, and TNT's name has been touted as a possible partner.
TNT said the announcement had been made partly in response to queries
arising from press speculation. But, neither TNT nor Federal Express would
state if this was the full extent of talks between them.
TNT said the agreement was a 'routine commercial decision', and Federal
Express claimed it was similar to deals with other freight forwarders. TNT
will transport express freight from Cologne, where it has a 'hub' operation,
to Stansted in the UK. There it will be loaded on a daily Federal Express
DC-10 and flown to JFK Airport, New York. A similar arrangement will operate
eastbound.

<TEXT>
HONEYWELL, the US controls group, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net
income of Dollars 102.6m, compared with Dollars 109.2m a year earlier, in
spite of the impact of the US and international economic recession.
The profits, which worked through at Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with
Dollars 1.49, were struck on sales which rose 2.3 per cent to Dollars
1.71bn, with each of the company's three main businesses showing revenue
gains.
The group's operating profit was Dollars 199.4m, down from Dollars 203.9m.
Honeywell said operating profits had improved in the home and building
control and industrial businesses, and remained steady in space and
aviation.
For the full year, Honeywell reported net income of Dollars 331.1m, or
Dollars 4.70 a share, compared with Dollars 382m, or Dollars 5.03 a share,
in 1990.
However, the 1990 figures benefited from a lower tax rate - 28 per cent
against 35 per cent - as well as a gain of Dollars 14.3m from asset sales
and Dollars 10m of income from discontinued operations.
Mr James Renier, the chairman, said the 'stable, solid results' were a
dramatic improvement over past recessions and reflected the success of its
strategy in concentrating on the core control business.
The home control division earned fourth-quarter operating profits of Dollars
88.5m, up 3.5 per cent, while orders showed a double-digit increase. The
industrial business made Dollars 66.2m, up from Dollars 65.6m.

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOM New Zealand, the former state-owned utility privatised last year,
has announced a 20.6 per cent advance in net profits for the first nine
months.
Net profits for the nine months to December rose to NZDollars 292.8m
(USDollars 159m) from NZDollars 242.8m a year earlier. This puts Telecom NZ
on track to meet earnings of NZDollars 401m for the full year.
Profits before tax rose NZDollars 17.6m to NZDollars 413m. There were no
extraordinary items, but minority interests produced a bottom line of
NZDollars 290m, up 22 per cent on the same period of last year.
Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chairman, said it was a pleasing result given the
tough economic conditions and increasing competition. Cost-savings from
increased efficiencies in all areas of Telecom NZ's operations contributed
to the result, which matched budget expectations.
Strongest growth in the nine months was from directories and cellular
services, while revenue from product sales and leased services grew strongly
in the quarter.
Operating revenue for the nine months rose 5.7 per cent to NZDollars 1.9bn.
Current assets fell 27.4 per cent to NZDollars 746m, and current liabilities
fell 27.9 per cent to NZDollars 807m. Total assets fell 2.5 per cent to
NZDollars 4.6bn. Total shareholders funds rose 5.1 per cent to NZDollars
2.7bn.
The results announcement follows this week's resignation of Mr Peter
Troughton, managing director, half-way through his five-year contract with
the company. His departure comes amid reports that Telecom NZ's US owners,
Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, which control 56 per cent of the company, were
unhappy with the way he was handling competition with Clear Communications,
Telecom NZ's main rival, in a bitter price-cutting war.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM plans powerful addition to
range of minicomputers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday announced additions to its range
of AS/400 minicomputers, one of the company's few strong sellers over the
last year. The AS/400 was introduced in 1988.
IBM said the new computers were up to 70 per cent more powerful than the
current generation of AS/400 machines, and incorporated several technology
advances, including a new generation of 16-megabit memory chips.
'It represents IBM's first step in applying this new technology across our
product line,' said Mr Paul Low, IBM vice-president and general manager,
technology products.
'We plan to introduce 16-megabit technology in new products this year and
beyond, taking advantage of the increased capacity and performance this new
chip provides.'
The new top-of-the line AS/400, the model E90, is the first to use IBM's
one-gigabyte 3 1/2 inch disk storage device. IBM said this would
significantly reduce the cost of data storage for its minicomputer users.
The company announced new AS/400 software, including a new version of the
operating system, which it said would make them more open and easy to use.
In the US, IBM announced a rebalancing of prices on memory and peripheral
options for the AS/400 line. Prices of displays, memory and disk storage
were reduced by up to 40 per cent. US prices for the new E model processors
are the same or slightly increased over current models.
Typical configurations, including peripherals and software, provide 30 per
cent better performance at 10 per cent less cost, IBM said. The new models
will be available next month, US prices range from Dollars 38,000 to Dollars
1.2m.
IBM's UK subsidiary has decided to dispense with list prices for the new
mid-range machines, writes Alan Cane.
The move seems an extension of a trend of the past few years where the price
paid by a customer for an IBM mainframe has had little relation to the list
price.
It is thought to be the first time IBM has thrown away the price book for
low-cost machines.
The UK market is thought to be IBM's toughest, and the company is taking the
opportunity to test new marketing methods and pricing policies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JURY award of over Dollars 550m against Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San
Francisco investment banking group, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international
accounting firm, in a fraud case brought by former investors in Miniscribe,
the now defunct computer disk drive manufacturer, has been set aside by the
Texas judge hearing the case.
The parties agreed to an undisclosed out-of-court settlement. The judge
ruled the jury verdict against Coopers &amp; Lybrand was 'contrary to the great
weight and preponderance of the evidence'.
The accounting firm said it was unaware of allegedly fraudulent activities
by former managers at Miniscribe. The case was brought by an investment
management firm on behalf of former Miniscribe bondholders.
The jury awarded Dollars 20m in actual damages and Dollars 530m in punitive
damages to investors who had purchased about Dollars 18m in bonds on the
basis of misleading financial statements from Miniscribe.
Jurors assessed Dollars 250m in punitive damages against Mr Q. T. Wiles,
Miniscribe's former chairman, who served as a director of Hambrecht and
Quist until 1989. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the decision to dismiss the verdict
corroborated its stand that it was the victim of fraud by Miniscribe and
that any failures on its part were based on information deliberately
misstated by Miniscribe.

HERSHEY Foods, the largest publicly traded manufacturer of chocolate and
confectionery products in the US, may be looking for more acquisitions in
Europe.
Mr Richard Zimmerman, chairman, was reported to have told securities
analysts the group was 'looking for two to three good acquisitions that
might string together to become a potent force'.
There was no immediate comment from Hershey's head office in Pennsylvania.
According to reports from the meeting, Mr Zimmerman suggested the US company
was looking for market niches that would give it exposure to Europe without
creating a backlash from competitors.
Hershey Foods has taken one recent step into Europe with the purchase last
May of Gubor Schokoladen, which makes pralines and seasonal chocolates under
the Gubor name.

MANPOWER, the temporary employment business which was taken over by
Britain's Blue Arrow but has now redomiciled in the US, yesterday reported a
fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 20m, down from a loss of Dollars 60.2m in
the same period of last year.
The figures included Dollars 19.5m of goodwill amortisation and Dollars 10m
of restructuring charges compared with Dollars 20.1m and Dollars 51.5m
respectively in the same period of 1990.
After-tax earnings, excluding amortisation and restructuring, came to
Dollars 9.5m, down 16.2 per cent from the Dollars 11.3m of 1990. Corporate
revenues were Dollars 709m, down from Dollars 766m.
For the full year, earnings excluding amortisation and special charges
totalled Dollars 29.4m, down 50 per cent from 1990's Dollars 59.6m.
Mr Mitchell Fromstein, president, said the 1991 results reflected severe US
and UK recession in the first half and a modest US recovery in the second
half.
The company felt the worst was behind it, in that sales levels compared with
the previous year had improved modestly but continuously since mid-summer
and it expected the trend to continue for the first quarter of 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, posted record non-consolidated
pre-tax profits for 1991. The company attributed the result to strong sales
in its premium-priced luxury beer, Ichibanshibori.
Unconsolidated pre-tax profit rose 1.8 per cent to Y86.4bn (Dollars 680m),
while after-tax profit increased by 2.4 per cent to Y36.7bn.
Overall sales, however, fell 3 per cent to Y1,315.7bn due to the separation
of Kirin's soft drink division in January last year to a Tokyo-based joint
venture with Tropicana Products of the US. The venture, Kirin Beverage,
markets orange juice and other Tropicana products. If the soft drink
division had remained and contributed to the latest earnings, it would have
added some Y120bn to Kirin's sales.
Last year, Kirin recovered its 50 per cent share of the Japanese beer market
thanks to brisk sales of its lager and premium beers. Sales of the beer
division - the group's largest earner, accounting for 98 per cent of overall
turnover - rose 6.4 per cent to Y1,284bn, on a 5.2 per cent rise in volume
to 3.4m kilolitres.
For the current year, Kirin expects a 0.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits,
to Y87bn, on a 4.9 per cent increase in sales to Y1,380bn. The company
expects rising costs to squeeze profit margins.
Kirin said it expected to increase capital spending by 6.4 per cent to
Y79bn. It said it would draw down internal reserves to cover redemption of
Y54.3bn in warrant bonds.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese ministry inspects
housing loan groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance has started to inspect the country's eight
housing loan companies, which face an increase in bad loans due to the slump
in the property market.
The move reflects increasing worries at the ministry over the companies'
deteriorating property-related loan portfolios, which include funds extended
to resort and golf course developments.
Japan's housing loan companies were set up in the 1960s to finance housing
and property projects for individuals. However, the companies sharply
increased their exposure to high-risk developments during the years of loose
credit in the late 1980s. Financial problems at the housing loan companies
will burden the commercial banks, which lent heavily to the loan companies.
According to Teikoku Data Bank, a Japanese credit agency, loans extended by
the eight housing loan companies to corporations which failed last year
totalled Y90.7bn (Dollars 737m). Teikoku added that since the housing loan
companies were not required to book defaulted loans until more than a year
after a borrower had stopped making payments, the underlying amount of
non-performing loans could be very large.
Last year, Chigin-Seiho Housing Loan asked its creditors and shareholders to
co-operate with its restructuring plan. The company had lent to Nanatomi, a
property developer and stock speculator which went under with outstanding
debts of Y286.3bn.
Nippon Housing Loan, a leading housing loan company, said it received a
request from the ministry for a special inspection. Nippon Housing Loan had
outstanding loans of Y2,028bn as of last July. The company procured funds
through Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, and Sanwa Bank,
commercial banks, which had outstanding loans over Y500bn as of last
September.

A broadly-based recovery on Pacific stock exchanges following the end of the
Gulf war enabled net asset value at TR Pacific Investment Trust to increase
from 66.2p to 79.9p over the 1991 year.
However, recessionary forces prevented the upturn from being sustained and
most markets weakened in the second half. The interim net asset value was
92.7p.
A low level of borrowings resulting in a fall to Pounds 150,000 (Pounds

bank charges, were behind an increase from Pounds 354,000 to Pounds 696,000

Earnings per share were 1.039p (0.528p). The proposed single dividend is
maintained at 0.25p with an additional special distribution of 0.45p.

turning in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 211,000 for the half year to October 31.
That came from turnover of Pounds 2.71m and compared with a profit of Pounds
155,000 on sales of Pounds 3.94m last time.
The success in reducing borrowings was reflected in interest charges down
from Pounds 504,000 to Pounds 271,000.
Losses per share were 0.69p (earnings 0.4p).

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Shipping downturn cuts Norex to Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The depressed state of the shipping and business travel markets affected
performance at Norex, which turned in reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.52m for the six months to December, down from Pounds 3.56m.
The sale of Norgulf Shipping earlier in the year had a strong impact on
turnover, which declined from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 4.67m, and the results
were further affected by a write-down in the value of small vessels.
The insurance division, however, was ahead of last year despite the sale in
May of the Australian subsidiary.
Earnings per share came out at 6.09p (14.67p).

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Plant hire behind fall at Ashtead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHTEAD GROUP, the equipment rental combine, saw pre-tax profit slide by
Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.5m in the half year to October 31, the whole reduction
being attributable to the UK plant hire side.
However, the group finished the period with a strong balance sheet. Gearing
was halved to 42 per cent. Net cash flow, excluding the rights issue, was
Pounds 2.6m.
Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said operating profit in UK plant hire fell from
Pounds 2.93m to Pounds 1.53m, but despite the harsh UK environment the board
had not adopted a 'siege mentality'.
More than Pounds 2m had been spent on plant additions and replacements and
Pounds 1.8m on parts and spares, which will enable the group to take
advantage of opportunities when the recession ends.
Operating profit in US plant rental rose to Pounds 164,000 (Pounds 149,000),
in UK survey and inspection rental to Pounds 391,000 (Pounds 361,000), and
in Middle and Far East survey and inspection rental to Pounds 61,000 (Pounds
42,000).
Turnover fell to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 17.3m). Earnings per share were 4.6p
(8.3p) and the interim dividend is again 1.1p on increased capital.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Del Monte Foods poised for flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEL MONTE Foods Interna-tional, the processed fruit manufacturer, is
preparing for a Pounds 450m flotation on the London stock market.
The share sale will be one of the biggest non-privatisation flotations for
several years. It will make multi-millionaires of the company's four
executive directors, who together bought 5 per cent of its shares in a
management buy-out in May 1990.
DMFI is completely separate from the Del Monte fresh fruit business, which
was bought by Polly Peck, the fruit and electronics conglomerate that
collapsed in 1990. Polly Peck's administrators are also thought to be
planning to float their Del Monte business, although probably in the US.
Both companies were for many years part of RJR Nabisco, the US food and
tobacco group.
When Nabisco was bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out
specialists, in February 1989, Del Monte was sold and broken up.
DMFI has exclusive rights to use the Del Monte name for processed foods in
most parts of the world except the US. Its biggest market is Italy, where
its annual sales are Pounds 80m, followed by the UK, where the turnover is
Pounds 70m.
While other big buy-outs in the past couple of years have struggled to hit
their financial targets, DMFI's profits have grown rapidly. In the year to
November 1991, profits before interest and tax rose 24 per cent to Pounds
29.5m, as sales grew 13 per cent to Pounds 252m.
'No business is recession proof,' said Mr Leon Allen, chairman. 'However, we
have succeeded in pushing up both the volume of sales, by 10 per cent last
year, and in widening margins.' The company is confident of at least
maintaining its profit and sales growth.
The business is being floated by Charterhouse, the merchant bank whose
investment funds own half of DMFI, and Cazenove, the stockbrokers.
The share sale is scheduled for the autumn. There will be a London listing
although many of the shares will be offered to institutions in Europe.
Between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m of shares will be offered to individuals
and institutions, with existing shareholders keeping the rest.
Of the shares being sold, about Pounds 200m will be new equity to redeem
preference shares and pay off debt.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BIM accountants knew of deficiencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the pension fund manager
owned by Mr Robert Maxwell, found serious control weaknesses and
deficiencies as early as February 1991. These included the absence of
controls on stock lending and the failure to record investments in the name
of the pension fund.
In testimony before the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security,
officials at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte said that despite the deficiencies,
they saw no need to qualify the accounts for BIM nor did they feel it was
their responsibility to report the shortcomings to regulators or to the
fund's trustees individually. Copies of their management report were sent
solely to the pension fund manager.
In a copy of a February 1991 management letter submitted to the Select
Committee, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte detailed a number of serious
shortcomings in the way BIM managed the Maxwell company pension funds.
They included an absence of regular review of fees generated by stock
lending activities and the failure to ensure that stock lent had proper
collateral. The accountants recommended that BIM document its stock lending
activities and regularly review the value of collateral.
They also found that shares bought by the pension funds from two other
Maxwell-owned companies, Maxwell Communication Corporation and Pergamon
Media Trust, remained in the name of their former owners.
Further findings of the accountants included the inability to locate
supporting documents for a number of payments and that the terms of an
agreement with IBI Holding Company, a Maxwell-related company, were verbally
changed after its signing. The investment administration and accounting
departments were not informed of the change.
Separately, Mr David Shaw MP said that the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension
Fund appeared to have no minutes of meetings of its investment committee at
which decisions about stock lending or self-investment should have been
discussed. He noted that minutes of one meeting on September 2 1991, showed
that Mr Robert Maxwell discussed sending a letter to Invesco MIM, fund
manager for a portion of the pension fund, reassuring the company about
stock lending activities.
On the subject of self-investment, Mr Ian Pittaway, solicitor to the MGN
pension scheme, said that he periodically reminded the trustees of the
Occupational Pensions Board's recommendation that self-investment should not
exceed 10 per cent of total investments.
By April 1990, more than half the MGN pension fund's 20 largest investments
were in some way connected to Mr Robert Maxwell or his private interests.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Banks continue to support YJ Lovell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YJ LOVELL Holdings, the UK housebuilder and property developer, yesterday
announced that its bankers had agreed to continue to give financial support
to the group.
The group warned in December that it was in breach of loan covenants
affecting net worth and interest cover and that it was having talks with its
banks over the future of its borrowing facilities.
Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive, said yesterday that the banks, led by
Barclays, had agreed to maintain loan arrangements in return for security
against the bulk of Lovell's land bank and other assets.
Mr Sellier said that the banks had conducted a full financial appraisal and
had been satisfied that there 'were no black holes.' The banks would look at
the position again in 12 months time.
'They have been very fair and we are under no pressure to make disposals
although our main intention will be to reduce borrowings,' he said.
Net debt at the end of last September, including about Pounds 40m
off-balance sheet borrowings, totalled Pounds 111.4m compared with
shareholders funds of about Pounds 70m.
'Our intention is to reduce gearing to 50 per cent. Obviously we will not be
able to achieve that target in the current year, although debts are coming
down,' said Mr Sellier.
The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.3m in the year to September
30 compared with a profit of Pounds 19.4m. The latest figures included
provision of Pounds 61.5m against housebuilding and property operations.
The group said in December when it announced the loss that it would be
unable to pay a final dividend. Last April, when launching a Pounds 31m
rights issue, it had promised to maintain the dividend.
Mr Sellier said that there had been an increase in interest from potential
house purchasers since the beginning of this year but that it was too early
to say whether that marked the beginning of a recovery in the UK housing
market.
Lovell's share price rose 4p to 25p following the announcement compared with
last year's rights issue price of 130p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI, the chemicals group, is to phase out production of the two main
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 1993 and buy in supplies from
Akzo of the Netherlands to satisfy rapidly declining demand.
Akzo announced yesterday that it had agreed with ICI that the two companies
would concentrate their European production of CFCs 11 and 12 at the Dutch
company's plant in Weert, near Maastricht.
The agreement, already approved by the UK and Dutch authorities, has been
submitted to the European Commission in Brussels for approval. It marks the
first time that two European companies have set up a 'community of
production' as envisaged by the Montreal Protocol, which calls for worldwide
industrial rationalisation as a means of reducing CFC production.
In 1993, ICI will halt production of CFCs 11 and 12 at its plant in Runcorn,
Cheshire, where it also produces CFC alternatives. ICI said it hoped the
effect on employment would be neutral because of the launch of production of
alternative substances.
The Runcorn site is ICI's only wholly-owned CFC plant. Besides its Weert
factory, Akzo also has a small plant in Australia.
Permission from the EC is required because the concentration of the two
groups' European CFC production in the Netherlands will lead to a temporary
rise in output in Weert. This will fall as demand for CFCs declines.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Virgin Atlantic incurs Pounds 9m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways lost Pounds 9m before tax last
year on its continuing businesses according to its previously unpublished
financial results.
Voyager Holdings, the private holding company for the airline and its tour
operator, is looking to raise Pounds 55m by selling a 20 per cent stake.
Its search for partners, at the same time as Mr Branson's negotiations to
sell Virgin Music Group, his record company, for a reported Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 570m), has prompted speculation that the airline needs cash
urgently.
The airline's results show it did not escape recession and intense price
competition with British Airways and other transatlantic rivals, but its
debts did not rise precipitously last year, contrary to industry comments.
Mr Branson, last said: 'We don't need cash at all if the airline were to
trade just with the routes it has now. But it is a cheap time to expand, and
we like to bring in partners before we need them.'
He added: 'Even if we do the music deal, we've gone a fair way with the
airline placing and we'll probably go ahead anyway.'
Virgin is marketing the airline stake - through Salomon Brothers, the US
investment bank - against the backdrop of severe recession throughout the
airline industry worldwide.
Voyager's pre-tax profits slumped to just Pounds 775,000 in the year to July
1991 from Pounds 8.5m in 1989-90 as the Gulf war pushed up fuel costs and
deterred potential passengers.
Although the airline saw turnover leap to Pounds 248.3m from Pounds 180.5m
as it started flights to Boston and added flights to Tokyo, it made a Pounds
3m pre-tax loss - compared with a Pounds 7.3m profit the year before - after
taking a Pounds 6m book profit on selling one of its 747 aircraft.
Virgin Atlantic started flying out of Heathrow in July 1991, launching a
battle for market share with British Airways.
The year to July bore the heavy start-up costs of the new routes,
particularly six months advance training of crews, but received none of the
revenue.
In spite of the recession, Virgin Atlantic maintained its policy of low
fares and add-on incentives, which squeezed profits.
The airline losses were partly offset by Virgin Holidays, the tour operator,
which more than doubled its profits to Pounds 3.3m.

FT  19 FEB 92 / The bank that has to say 'whoops': Problems faced by
Kleinwort Benson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slipping on banana skins has become almost a way of life for Kleinwort
Benson, the 200-year-old City of London merchant bank. The familiar cry of
'whoops' will be uttered by the bank's executives once again on February 26
when its 1991 results are published.
In the six months to June 30, Kleinwort made pre-tax profits of Pounds
24.7m. However, analysts believe profits for the full year were in the
vicinity of Pounds 30m, a meagre return on the group's equity of Pounds
412m.
In other words, Kleinwort made tiny profits in the second half, even though
Mr David Peake, chairman, was expressing 'cautious optimism' about prospects
last April.
In four out of the five years since the stock market was deregulated at the
end of 1986 - including 1991 - Kleinwort's financial performance has been
worse than management or outside analysts had been expecting. The nadir was
1990, when it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 68m, due in large part to a
Pounds 34m loss from the bungled sale of shares in Premier Consolidated
Oilfields. But even in its best year of late, 1989, it failed to meet its
target of pre-tax profits equivalent to 25 per cent of capital.
Much of the blame for the poor performance lay with its stockbroking
subsidiary, which had been acquired in stages in the mid-1980s. But
Kleinwort's executives say the broker - now called Kleinwort Benson
Securities, though its original name was Grieveson Grant - is performing
adequately. So it is all the more galling for them that pre-tax profits in
1991 are still below par. On this occasion the problems have arisen in one
of its traditional businesses: lending to companies. Analysts believe that
Kleinwort's results will include a Pounds 40m bad debt charge.
However, the losses could have been far greater, if management had not
decided to shrink the loan book. When Mr Peake and the chief executive, Mr
Jonathan Agnew, took the helm at the beginning of 1989, Kleinwort had total
loans to companies, excluding undrawn facilities, of Pounds 2.3bn. By the
end of 1991, this had been more than halved. Indeed, Kleinwort's rate of
loss as a proportion of total loans does not compare unfavourably with many
banks.
Its Pounds 40m charge is thought by analysts to consist of a great number of
provisions against small loans. Kleinwort executives admit they were were
too slow in reducing exposure to small and medium-sized companies, the
corporate sector recession. But the error was spotted 18 months ago and now
loans are made only to big, sound companies.
There is one bigger exposure - of Pounds 18m - to the French publisher
Hachette which is causing concern to analysts. Kleinwort acquired this
exposure in an indirect fashion, via an investment in the French cable
television company, La Cinq, which filed for bankruptcy at the beginning of
the year. Kleinwort had been given an indemnity against possible losses on
the La Cinq investment by Hachette, which already owned 25 per cent of the
TV company. It is confident that its 'risk is on Hachette'. So analysts are
not expecting it to make any significant provision against the La Cinq
exposure in its 1991 results, though they point out that Hachette itself is
burdened by big debts.
But for all these problems, Kleinwort has no intention of completely
withdrawing from lending to companies, though some merchant banks, such as
Lazards and SG Warburg, have almost no presence in the lending business.
However it will reduce its loan portfolio - perhaps by another Pounds 300m.
But what about the recent performance of Kleinwort's other businesses? Even
if the loan losses are ignored, Kleinwort's profits were disappointing in
1991 - the return from the merchant banking division, which includes
stockbroking, earned a rate of return on capital probably half the company's
target rate.
Progress has been made by its stockbroker, which now has a market share in
'UK customer business' - deals with investors rather than with other
marketmakers or wholesalers - of around 7 per cent and is making a modest
profit.
But the management and financial resources devoted to saving this business
may have deprived other activities of support, at some cost. Kleinwort's
corporate finance department, the traditional heart of the group which gives
advice to companies, has lost ground to rivals such as Schroders and
Warburg, on the basis of various league tables of merchant banks' activity.
Mr Agnew and Mr Peake undoubtedly inherited problems. However, shareholders'
patience - including that of the Kleinwort family, owner of 20 per cent of
the shares - may soon start to wear thin.
One possible remedy was mooted last year. In March 1991 Kleinwort began
talks with France's Banque Nationale de Paris about an alliance between
their international merchant banking operations.
Such an agreement would involve BNP boosting its holding in Kleinwort from
4.8 per cent to at least 20 per cent. Indeed, a full takeover of Kleinwort
cannot be ruled out.
Such a link would give Kleinwort access to a continental network matched
only in the City of London by Morgan Grenfell, whose parent is Deutsche
Bank, Germany's biggest bank.
However, these talks are currently on ice, pending completion of BNP's
negotiations on establishing a mutual co-operation arrangement with
Germany's Dresdner Bank, which is expected in May.
So Kleinwort is keen to play down the importance of a BNP deal, which will
not take place until the year end, if ever.
In the meantime Mr Peake and Mr Agnew have a higher priority. They are on
permanent banana skin alert.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Bank backs City panel to clarify legal uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CITY PANEL to tackle problems in the UK's financial markets caused by grey
areas in the law was called for yesterday by the Bank of England's Legal
Risk Review Committee.
The committee was set up in April in response to widespread concern in the
City after the Law Lords ruled that local authorities did not have the
capacity to enter into interest rate swap transactions.
Another of its recommendations was that the doctrine of ultra vires should
be abolished. Under this doctrine, transactions which are outside the vires,
or capacity, of one of the parties involved are void.
Launching a consultation paper, the committee's chairman, Lord Alexander,
who is also chairman of National Westminster Bank, said a range of problems
caused by legal uncertainty had been raised with the committee. However, he
did not believe this represented an indictment of City practices.
The committee was aware that there was no lack of challengers to London's
pre-eminence as the financial centre of Europe. But Lord Alexander added:
'We want to avoid drama on the threat to London.' What the proposals were
designed to do was consolidate London's advantages, he said.
The City's contribution to the UK economy last year was Pounds 4.4bn. The
City was also host to around 500 foreign banks and was the largest treasury
centre in the European Community.
The committee proposes the establishment of two standing bodies - a
Financial Law Panel and a Financial Law Liaison Group.
The panel, comprising market and legal practitioners, would act as a
problem-solving body. In co-operation with existing market bodies, it would
warn practitioners of potential problems, set out its views on good market
practice and clarify how the law would apply in certain technical areas. It
would also act as the focal point for the consideration of the potential
impact of EC legislation.
Some issues would require more than a City self-help solution, however, and
so a second-tier body comprising civil servants and market practitioners
would also be set up.
The liaison group would discuss problems brought to it by the panel, decide
whether government involvement was needed and if so how the necessary
changes in the law could be made.
The committee proposes that both bodies should be resourced and funded by
the City.
Lord Alexander made it clear that it was never intended that the Bank's
committee should find solutions to all of the problems drawn to its
attention. It had only made specific recommendations in relation to ultra
vires because the matter had been raised by more than 50 per cent of
respondents.
The committee hopes to present its final report to the Governor of the Bank
of England by the end of June.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Britain and France may fund new fighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE and Dassault Aviation of France expect to receive funding
from their governments to study co-operation on a future generation of
fighter aircraft.
The companies have been discussing possible collaboration for about two
years, it emerged yesterday.
A senior Dassault executive said: 'In the coming months we will make joint
proposals to our two governments to secure study contracts so that we can
prepare for the future together.'
Revival of Anglo-French co-operation would not affect the two fighter jets
in which the companies are separately involved, the European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) and the Rafale. Both are due to be in service in the late
1990s.
France took part in the early stages of the EFA project before breaking off
in 1985 because of different requirements and arguments about project
leadership. This left the UK to develop the Dollars 20bn-plus EFA with
Germany, Italy and Spain. France is developing the lighter-weight Rafale on
its own. A new generation is not expected before 2020.
The renewed contacts are believed to have been instigated by the French and
British defence ministries in the belief that Europe cannot afford more than
one project.
BAe said it had been holding talks with Dassault on 'specific technologies'.
These 'could be applied to some future project beyond EFA and Rafale in line
with the wishes of both governments for closer industrial co-operation in
the defence field'.
It added that it was also discussing sharing technologies with McDonnell
Douglas of the US, its partner in the Harrier II jump-jet, and Saab-Scania
of Sweden.
Dassault made clear that its co-operation with BAe could be extended to
other European companies.
Deutsche Aerospace, a partner of BAe in EFA, wants to use the EFA consortium
as the basis for forming a combined European military aircraft group which
could eventually bring in Dassault.
Prospects for Dassault continuing on its own have dwindled in recent years
as its military aircraft exports have dried up and the French government has
cut equipment spending.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: Minister dismisses criticism of government's human
rights stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs LYNDA CHALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ann Clwyd in her letter (February 12) alleges that the government
allows short-term interests to overrule concerns on human rights.
This is unworthy. We have shown ourselves perfectly willing to take action
in recent months on Kenya and Sri Lanka - and in both cases this has had a
beneficial effect, although these countries have more work to do before the
international community will be fully satisfied. Before that, we cut off aid
to Burma, Sudan and Somalia. The point is that we did so as a last resort.
There are many ways in which we can make our views known, and we must make
the best use of these to achieve our aims - not simply move to cut off aid
as a rhetorical gesture.
Mrs Clwyd cites the case of Indonesia in the light of the appalling events
that occurred in East Timor on November 12. She alleges that the government
only reacted following pressure of world opinion. The truth is quite
different. As she knows, the Indonesian ambassador was summoned to the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office on November 13 to be told of the
government's grave concern at the killings.
President Suharto has expressed his shock at the Dili incident. He has
removed the military commanders from their posts and promised there will be
no repeat. The Indonesians have accepted a visit by the UN secretary
general's personal representative, Mr Wako, to clarify the Dili incident.
At their meeting on February 5, Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told
the Indonesian foreign minister that he welcomed the action that had been
taken so far but sought assurances that they would complete, as promised,
the next stages of the investigation to bring to justice those responsible,
search for the missing and take measures to prevent a recurrence.
Indonesia remains one of the 50 poorest countries with the fifth largest
population. It has a well deserved reputation for sound macro-economic

FT  19 FEB 92 / Multiple damages: Lloyd's faces a crunch on several fronts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past year City observers have watched in horror as the Lloyd's
insurance market and its participants have apparently driven towards an
unavoidable brick wall. There has been much waggling of the steering wheel,
a great deal of tooting of the horn, and some heroic work on the brake-pedal
 -but the relentless skid has continued.
This may be a somewhat apocalyptic view, but events over the past week - in
which Lloyd's has been pilloried in the House of Commons and the press -
have done little to dispel the impression.
In reality, the crunch has two components: financial and legal.
Multi-million-pound insurance claims from asbestosis and pollution-related
claims in the United States, and from a string of catastrophes between 1988
and 1990, have driven hundreds of the market's Names to seek legal redress
for their losses. Now the impact of the legal cases themselves could begin
to aggravate the market's underlying financial problems, as some Names seek
court injunctions to avoid having to pay out on claims.
The Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement won by Outhwaite Names last week is
likely to prove a significant contributor to a wave of further legal action.
Names are the individuals whose personal assets support underwriting at
Lloyd's; they are committed to risks by managing agents acting on their
behalf. In the Outhwaite case, 1,614 members of a syndicate managed by Mr
Richard Outhwaite ran up losses of more than Pounds 200m as a result of
reinsurance contracts that fell foul of court awards to victims of
asbestosis in the US. Just under 1,000 of the Outhwaite Names brought a
lawsuit against 81 Lloyd's agents, which resulted in a settlement giving
them back more than 90 per cent of money paid out so far in claims.
The Outhwaite settlement could spur further action in three ways:
The demonstration effect. Evidence that suing brings success could stimulate
new actions by Names in addition to the seven actions under way at the
moment (four in the UK and three in north America).
The 'me, too' effect. The Outhwaite settlement did not apply to 627 Names in
the syndicate who did not join the legal action. Many of these were 'working
Names' who may have found it difficult to take action because their
employers were either Lloyd's agencies or brokers. These non-litigating
Names are now considering legal action of their own.
The 'why me?' effect. The settlement passed the costs of the Outhwaite
losses on to the agents' 'errors and omissions' insurers - which cover the
cost of legal awards against syndicate managers. Many 'e and o' policies are
written by Lloyd's syndicates.
The Outhwaite case is not the only spur to legal action, however. Also about
to join the fray are Names on 'spiral' syndicates. These are catastrophe
reinsurance syndicates which reinsured among themselves in a continually
evolving spiral of reinsurances. They are in desperate straits as the claims
from catastrophes at the end of 1989 and beginning of 1990 - Hurricane Hugo,
the San Francisco earthquake, a Phillips Petroleum explosion in Texas and
storms in January 1990 - come home to roost.
Syndicates managed by Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young, Gooda Walker and
Devonshire agencies are among those affected. In some cases solicitors are
advising their Names to seek court injunctions to stop Lloyd's drawing down
on funds deposited with their agents. A firm of solicitors  - Michael
Freeman - is seeking injunctions on behalf of 600 Names on the grounds that
the cash calls were legally 'improper'. Another group of Names believes that
the reinsurance contracts may be 'voidable' - contain flaws which would
allow Names to apply to have them set aside. If legal advisers agree,
another group of Names may seek separate injunctions.
Separately, Names are also conducting a vigorous public relations campaign,
which has recently heightened the political profile of these matters. The
most influence has been brought to bear by a loosely knit alliance including
action groups formed by members of the Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and
Devonshire syndicates.
These groups have links with the Society of Names, an umbrella group formed
by Mr MP, last year. They have contacts with several backbench Conservative
MPs, including Mr Paul Marland, who is a member of the Gooda Walker and Rose
Thomson Young syndicates.
The protesters have made a wide range of allegations about the way Lloyd's
works, including accusations that underwriters are overpaid and that the
market is prey to malpractices that favour insiders.
Some of their allegations - especially those about the scale of remuneration
of some Lloyd's participants - are well-founded, although the information on
which they are based has been in the public domain for some time.
Much of what they say must be treated with considerable caution: some of the
syndicates accused last week of being given better-quality business because
they are dominated by Lloyd's insiders actually made losses in the last
underwriting year.
Evidence cited in an extensive review by a 14-man task force into the
market's business structure shows that in two of the last three underwriting
years, outside Names obtained better results than their counterparts who
work in the market.
More general allegations about malpractice also appear overblown. The
market's regulation has improved markedly since the Lloyd's Act of 1982. An
independent inquiry into Lloyd's in 1987, headed by Sir Patrick Neill,
reported: 'We know of no equivalent organisation which has accomplished such
a major programme of reform in such a short timescale.'
But the complaints, though distorted, have served to highlight the market's
problems at a time when it is facing acute financial difficulties.
Over the next six to 12 months, the combination of continuing losses and
legal challenges from Names refusing to pay up could be devastating. Lloyd's
would be especially vulnerable if Names continue to enjoy the legal
successes they experienced in the Outhwaite case.
Lloyd's solvency is not under threat. The market's ability to pay claims is
backed by at least Pounds 18bn which represents the gross assets of more
than 20,000 Lloyd's Names.
However, the market's liquidity and cash-flow problems are serious. At least
Pounds 2bn must be paid out in losses between June 1992 and the end of next
year. These losses, together with a flood of legal challenges, could eat
into the immediately available reserves of more than Pounds 4bn.
Many syndicates are desperately short of cash, especially of sterling.
Reserves have been depleted by several recent claims: last September's
Japanese typhoon is the latest. Ironically the Pounds 116m needed to pay the
errors and omissions claim incurred as a result of the Outhwaite settlement
could exert further pressure.
'There is a serious shortage of sterling on the market,' said one agent this
week.
These worries explain why some leading market figures have started
preliminary talks with ministers and the Bank of England about what could be
done to ease a cash crunch should one arise in the next few months. Neither
the Lloyd's Corporation - which provides back-up services for the market -
nor the Lloyd's Council - the market's governing body - have been involved
in the discussions.
But the dynamic of current developments is such that future high-level talks
cannot be ruled out. At the least, recent events will keep the pressure on
Lloyd's to implement the 65 recommendations of the task force which reported
last month. In particular, Lloyd's would need to initiate changes in
legislation if the market wanted to attract corporate capital.
The three scenarios sketched out by the task force all assume that Lloyd's
will eventually be forced to supplement its existing source of capital -
from individual Names - with capital from corporate entities. One scenario
envisages 'legal challenges threaten(ing) the sustainability' of the
relationship between Names and their agents and suggests that limited
liability capital could rapidly become the predominant form of capital in
the market.
Two months ago the authors of the task force report were expecting that
process to take from five to seven years. Given the pace of legal, financial
and political developments over the past few weeks, the move towards a
market dominated by corporate capital could be much quicker.

One by-product of the collapse of Australia's famous entrepreneurs is that
Australian banks are now world experts at disposing of seized collateral.
However, Westpac Banking Corporation is maintaining a discreet silence about
its latest asset - Kalgoorlie's Pink House brothel in the heart of Western
Australia's goldfields.
Westpac took possession of the property after Madame Cherie failed to keep
up mortgage payments on the 14-bedroom house, which also boasts a spa,
swimming pool, and various 'entertainment areas'. The brothel operates
legally under the Western Australian state government's vice-containment
policy.
But there is no prospect of a Westpac-sponsored executive relief centre.
According to the fine print, corporations are barred from running brothels;
these can only be operated by women acting without financial backing from
men.

There is some justification in the Liberal Democrats' complaint that they

spokesman, is not helping his party's case. First, he composes a press
release which accuses the Home Office of seeing the rise in crime as 'the
ineluctable epiphenomenon of universal wickedness'.
Then he talks about 'offenses' instead of 'offences'. When practising as a
barrister, it was said that his written opinions were much valued because he
was such a boring speaker in court. His latest offering is not helping his
reputation.

At the mention of any big job in British television up pops the name of
Michael Grade. There have been endless rumours, for example, that the ITV
companies are desperate to recruit the Channel 4 chief as their central
scheduler responsible for masterminding the Pounds 500m plus programme
budget.
Yesterday Grade came as close as he ever will to ruling himself out of the
running for this post. 'I ought at this stage to make it quite clear that
despite all rumours to the contrary I am not considering taking the new
central scheduler job. To quote Sam Goldwyn 'Include Me Out'.'
Clearly, Grade is constrained by Channel 4's golden handcuffs and he also
wants to see his channel successfully selling its airtime in competition
with ITV. However, some believe that Grade is playing an even longer game
and has his eye on the top job at the Beeb.
He seemed to be lining up for audition for that job at yesterday's FT cable
and satellite conference. By praising the BBC governors for realising that
it was time to stop concentrating so much on news and current affairs and
move more money into popular programmes, he is setting himself up as the man
for the job if John Birt were ever to stumble.

The Treasury has been forced to drag itself into the late 20th century; it
has relaxed its rules over pre-Budget purdah.
This year, the curtain, which otherwise normally shields Moslem women from
strangers, has been lifted because of a recent high-level review of the more
than slightly absurd custom of muzzling ministers and officials for three
months before the annual Budget statement.
Presumably, the new thinking is that silencing Norman 'recovery is round the
corner' Lamont and his colleagues would give the opposition an unfair
pre-electoral leg-up.
Anyway, the worst secret - notably the less-than-dazzling condition of the
economy - is long out of the bag.

Why is Poland having so much more difficulty than countries like
Czechoslovakia and Hungary in keeping its financial institutions of state
fully crewed?
Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, is the latest to jump ship
following a difference of opinion with the rest of the government on
financial policy.
But if he hadn't walked the plank, it sounds as if several of his deputies
would have. Lutkowski was not an easy man to work with, they say.
A permanent replacement for Janusz Sawicki, Poland's official debt supremo
who resigned under a cloud last autumn, has still to be found. Across the
street at the National Bank of Poland,
Grzegorz Wojtowicz - sacked for not preventing the Art B scandal - has still
not been replaced.
If that were not enough the British government is now pressing the NBP to
appoint a Pole as head of the banking supervision department. The present
head, Stanislaw Bereza - seconded from Barclays - was only supposed to be a
temporary fixture.
Little effort seems to have been made to find a replacement and as ever more
problems loom in banking, Britain wants its man to adopt a lower profile.
The implication is that the plug will be drawn on
Bereza's Know-how Fund funding, if the Poles do not start trying to put
their house in order.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Arts: Collins and Johnson - two young British clarinet
virtuosos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are many thousands of people who go often to orchestral concerts, and
sometimes to solo recitals by singers, pianists and even violinists, but
would never think of going to hear a mere clarinet or oboe with piano. They
are misguided. True, there are not many solo masterpieces in the repertoire
of either instrument - an 'adventurous' programme is almost inevitably an
excursion into dusty material (however amiable and fluent) or avant-garde
pieces (often grimly un-fluent); but there are quite a few master players,
and when they strut their best stuff the result can be as rewarding as any
Liederabend.
Thus Michael Collins' clarinet recital on Monday at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall, with the supererogatory bonus of Mikhail Pletnev as virtuoso
accompanist. Though they drew a good house, amongst whom there were
doubtless a hundred young clarinettists or more, it was sad to think how
many more listeners would have been delighted if they'd found themselves
there. Collins is one of the best players in the world, and his programme
included about half of the first-rank music for his instrument with piano:
Schumann's op. 73 Fantaisiestucke, the Poulenc sonata, one of the two op.
120 Brahmses and the Debussy 'Premiere Rhapsodie'. There was never a
'Deuxieme', and one more recital could finish off all the major works - the
other Brahms sonata, the Hindemith, and Stravinsky's three unaccompanied
pieces; after that it is down to minor German Romantics, minor Frenchmen and
Edwardians in thrall to Brahms.
Though a clarinet cannot sing words, Collins phrases, articulates and
colours like a great Liedersanger; and of course the instrument enjoys the
extra-vocal possibilities of brilliant tongue-and-finger routines, and of
the riches of sonata form. He does not go in for visionary, disembodied
effects like Richard Stoltzmann - the Collins clarinet is always a resonant
wooden thing which transmits a live, intelligent voice; but his elegantly
orthodox manner leaves room for a sharp sense of humour, a constant threat
of cheerful subversion, that we've missed since Gervase de Peyer decamped to
America.
Collins and Pletnev were marvellous in their Poulenc, switching between the
deliberate extremes of feeling, operatic flurries and wry reflection,
without batting an eye. Their Debussy was exquisite. I have not heard
Lutoslawski's '5 Dance Preludes' rendered in such vivid contrasts, nor so
searchingly. In Brahms and Schumann they were coolly admirable, but slightly
thin-blooded in effect: with piano lid half closed, Pletnev was too
solicitous for his partner to allow the piano textures their full warmth.
After the interval the piano was flung open, and their exuberant Poulenc and
Lutoslawski were followed by Weber's irresistibly glitzy Grand Duo and an
extravagant Andre Messager morceau de concours as encore. Hugely enjoyable,
and twinkling with musical insights - ironic, sentimental, knowing. I should
add that for Collins, Pletnev is a partner in a million: not only does he
match his inflections to an ESP nicety, but somehow they even echo each
other's timbres.
In the Barbican Hall on Monday there was another brilliant young English
clarinet virtuoso, Emma Johnson, keeping company with the English Chamber
Orchestra under Sian Edwards, and playing the concerto she had commissioned
from Michael Berkeley for the Huddersfield Festival last November. This very
striking piece, much more sinewy in idiom, tougher in subject matter and
tauter in unfolding than we have come to expect from Berkeley's pen,
concerns itself with the double aspect of childhood, its terrors and
enchantments - the composer is currently at work on a Kipling opera with
such a theme, for which the concerto is apparently a study-piece.
It begins with a dry rattle on the timpani and a sort of stuttering on the
clarinet. Both of these textural devices aptly presage the ferocious
struggles and sorties undertaken between soloist and chamber orchestra in
the first half. The abrasive sound-world thus conjured up often drives the
clarinet to hard, bright squeals in the top register; the drama is delivered
in a language that is at once harshly non-tonal and vividly gestural - even
if one fails to fathom the purpose of its every twist or turn, one can
hardly miss the urgency of its expressive import. Towards the end a more
peaceable, though not exactly easy, relationship is established between the
various forces.
Miss Johnson attacked the concerto with authority, vigour, and grace, giving
no quarter in battle, capable of sudden secretive lyricism; it is a work she
plainly relishes, and the ECO apparently do likewise. It formed part of an
exceptionally rewarding programme: alongside Berkeley there were David
Matthews, Bartok and a new piece, The Light Fantastic, by the English Satie,
Howard Skempton, that afforded 15 minutes of delicate delight. In it
Skempton weaves perfectly shaped spiralling patterns all the more
captivating for being couched in such modest terms.
Miss Edwards seemed to me not yet entirely in command of its gossamer
textures; similarly, I felt that she had not yet sunk herself fully into the
substance of Weill's Second Symphony, which closed the concert, and through
which the ECO were encouraged to drive with excessive forthrightness. This
great, crazily neglected work is a pure and noble descendant of the
'classical', chamber-musical Mahler; it requires flexibility as well as
forcefulness, and close characterisation of its bittersweet detail.
Still, the overall impact of the symphony was undeniably powerful; and the
conductor earned the passionate gratitude of at least one Weillian in the
hall for reviving it at all.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Arts: An artist who provokes a smile / Review of Thomas
Rowlandson in Richmond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD NEWBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Rowlandson, the regency caricaturist and watercolour painter,
travelled extensively and sketched prolifically. A rapid and brilliant
draughtsman, his drawings are a persuasive and amusing impression of his
age, although their documentary value is often limited. Rowlandson was quite
prepared to subordinate accuracy to his comic vision, or to the requirements
of his compositions. Not surprisingly, therefore, his drawings are
unreliable as topographical records. Luckily this has not deterred The
Museum of Richmond from assembling a loan exhibition of 35 of his drawings
illustrating Richmond and its environs.
Richmond was a fashionable resort in Rowlandson's time, and this was no
doubt an attraction for an artist with one eye on a market for his work.
However perfunctory Rowlandson's topography, he was certainly careful to
ensure that his views of Ham House, Hampton Court, Mortlake, Kew and other
spots along the river, were sufficiently accurate to be recognisable. He was
also attracted to Richmond for its 'rural' qualities, and this aspect of his
work is perhaps less familiar than his caricatures of metropolitan manners
and customs.
There is a mannered charm about Rowlandson's response to the countryside,
although landscape is seldom the primary subject of his drawings. His
representation of trees and foliage, usually highly stylised, nevertheless
has a whimsical appeal. It is a pleasant surprise to find that the artist
who - in the words of his companion Henry Angelo - 'burlesqued even the
burlesque' can also evoke a lyrical mood. The drawing entitled 'Richmond
Park' is close in spirit to some of Gainsborough's landscape studies, and
the scene of anglers beneath an arch of Richmond Bridge is an unexpected
exercise in the sentimental sweetness of Francis Wheatley.
Although Rowlandson does sometimes show sensitivity for landscape, his pen
moves with greater alacrity and power when drawing figures. His compositions
are frequently focused on a group of caricatured figures in the foreground;
surrounding figures may be drawn 'realistically', ingeniously lending a
credibility to the caricatures.
Rowlandson's repertoire of caricature types may seem predictable, centring
on leering yokels, dandified officers, foppish aesthetes, bloated parsons
and suchlike, but the figures themselves have a lifelike vitality thanks to
the artist's brilliant gifts as a draughtsman. His eye for movement and
posture, usually taken from life, accounts for the enduring success of his
caricatures, no matter how tiresome they become.
The centrepiece of this exhibition is perhaps 'The Star And Garter, Richmond
Hill', a drawing which features the famous view of the Thames from the top
of the hill. The horizontal format of
the composition allows Rowlandson scope for a panorama of narrative
incidents - a formula which
Frith later used, and perhaps exhausted, in his representations of Victorian
life. In the
foreground a prosperous middle class family ostentatiously ignore a begging
woman as they pass along the road.
This incident, clearly intended to be no more than amusing, is nevertheless
portrayed entirely without pathos, and indicates Rowlandson's limitations.
For all his genius as a caricaturist, his vision is superficial and
complacent. Unlike Hogarth,
whose comic spirit he inherited, Rowlandson does not emotionally engage with
his subjects
beyond indicating their comic potential.
Although this exhibition shows only a tiny fragment of Rowlandson's vast
output, it is nonetheless representative of his range. His popularity is
perhaps connected with his ability to persuade us that the regency period
was indeed prosperous, socially untroubled and rollicking good fun; this, of
course, cannot be entirely true - Rowlandson's metier was to provoke a smile
rather than a thought.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Management: Time to step aboard a flight to the interior:
Health Check - Dr Michael McGannon explains how regular travellers can avoid
the worst excesses of jet-lag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bush made news last month when he keeled over at a banquet in his
honour in Japan. Contrary to popular belief, the president was probably
suffering more from common jet-lag than from a rare intestinal virus.
Scientific evidence is mounting that long distance air travel can cause
health problems, ranging from sleep disturbances to heart disorders.
Moreover, jet-lag can blunt negotiating skills, putting you at a
disadvantage with well-rested locals. Surprise, surprise: some of that
disadvantage is of your own doing.
Dealing with jet-lag means understanding the nature of the problem. Proper
operation of the body's functions, including sleepiness, wakefulness,
appetite, intestinal function and body temperature, relies on the
light-dependent cycle known as the circadian (diurnal) rhythm.
When disturbed by flying across time zones, this rhythm becomes confused.
The result is severe fatigue, loss of mental lucidity and disorientation as
the rhythm searches for a new reference point.
Researchers at the Johnson Space Center in Texas have shown that the
prolonged immobility forced on passengers causes the body to excrete
excessive amounts of two essential substances: potassium and sodium.
This loss accounts for decreased muscle strength, weakened physical and
mental reflexes, confusion, and quite possibly, disturbances in heart
rhythm.
Given the differences between people, a universal remedy to jet-lag is
probably not possible. But the following suggestions have done the trick for
some of the 3,000 international executives I have worked with. Try them all.
BEFORE DEPARTURE
First, try to re-set your biological clock. For trips with a stay of a week
or more, it pays to change your daily rhythm before departure to simulate
your new local time zone.
If you are going from Europe to the west coast of America where you will be
going to bed about nine hours earlier, get to sleep one hour earlier every
day for 3 or 4 days before departing.
Though potentially disruptive to your pre-departure schedule, this can help
you arrive adapted to the local time.
For two to three day trips, attempt to 'tough it out' by sticking to the
home schedule. That way you will not be adapting twice in as many days and
you can arrive home hitting the ground running.
Johnson Space Center research suggests that physical exercise on the day of
the flight helps release potassium into the blood, thus compensating losses
resulting from flight immobility.
WHILE IN FLIGHT
To beat jet-lag, you must adhere to several 'absolutes'. Proper hydration is
essential because the humidity of the aircraft's cabin air can be
uncomfortably low.
Re-humidifying the air to more comfortable levels would require about two
tons of water on a Boeing 747 for a 10-hour flight: that would be very
expensive. Your strategy should be the same as the flight crew: re-humidify
yourself.
You can kill two birds with one stone by drinking at least one glass of
orange juice (potassium and water) every hour.
Resist the seductions of free alcohol and coffee, substances that will wring
your system dry and cause potassium losses, setting you up for the worst
case of jet lag possible.
Before dozing off (easier if you have previously exhausted your body with
exercise), do a few arm lifts: using the arm rests, lift your weight
(discreetly) off the seat several times. This will help to keep the blood
circulating well while you sleep.
AFTER ARRIVING
Arrange your schedule - perhaps by arriving a day early - to include a
work-out before meetings. This will provide vital organs, including the
brain, with well-circulated blood, richly saturated in oxygen.
Lastly, take the initiative in dealing with jet-lag because if you are
failing to plan, you are planning to fail.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Jobs: When to call for help from an HRC / A look at the
international growth in numbers of the human resource consultant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international growth in the number of Human Resource Consultants (HRC)
over the past decade has been meteoric, if not explosive. They go under a
fairly large number of titles such as 'business psychologist', 'staff
development professional' or 'organisational behaviour consultant'.
There are many reasons why this American-originated occupation has grown so
fast in Britain and Europe. HRCs come in many forms: the entrepreneurial don
(usually from a business school); the one-man band (often a personnel
officer given a golden handshake - or the sack); a small group of
like-minded people running a specialised consultancy; or the large, usually
international group, offering a wide range of consultancy services.
But what do HRCs do? Why spend up to Pounds 2,000 a day having some outsider
tell your organisation how to run it?
HRCs offer a number of skills, many of which are surprisingly absent from
most big organisations' personnel departments. This is mainly because the
nature and function of 'personnel' has changed and training is frequently
woefully inadequate. There are, I believe, four different and specific
skills offered by HRCs.
Diagnostics: HRCs can offer a 'second opinion'. They can bring objectivity
but also the potential experience of having seen the problem before. Such
HRCs may make their diagnostics in line with 'skill-solution'. In other
words, having a number of expensive solutions available, they will force the
diagnostics of the problem to fit their products. But one advantage of using
experienced and insightful HRCs is that they can show the organisation to be
fundamentally flawed in either its own diagnosis of the malady or the
proposed solutions. Organisations like to believe that easy solutions are
possible; they are also frequently unable to distinguish between explicit
and implicit messages from clients, customers or their own staff.
For instance, managers' complaints about the number of staff they have in
their department to complete work-loads could have as much to do with
problems in organisational structure, or a particular manager's ambitions,
as they do about staffing.
HRCs will tell you that diagnosis is more difficult and important than cure
and that therefore getting it right easily merits the 'modest' fee.
Measurement: Many personnel managers are not highly trained in measuring
human performance, abilities, needs or personal preferences. After gullible,
but enthusiastic and peer-pressured purchases of flashy, but not valid
tests, personnel managers often set about measuring line-managers
personality or the board's team-role preference. When the only tool you have
is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as it if were a nail. Hence
organisations measure what they can, more frequently than they need to. And
this is where the well-trained HRC can bring to bear a formidable array of
well tested measures. Over 100,000 tests are in print and a good HRC will
know where to look for the most appropriate measure.
There is a tendency to use inappropriate tests just because the organisation
has bought them. Rather than spend all one's effort measuring the
personalities of directors, the HRC may wisely recommend the measurement of
organisational culture (the values and norms of the organisation), the
climate (the perception of employees), the communication networks, the
clients, the customers or the competitor's perceptions. Measuring
instruments (questionnaires, tests) need to be sensitive, reliable, valid,
multi-dimensional, sensitive to faking, 'normed' for the appropriate
population. HRCs must, of course, not only choose and administer good tests
but know how to analyse them appropriately and interpret the data.
As HRCs know, many personnel officers shy away from objective 'hard' data,
preferring softer interviews, reports or selected quotes from 'key players'.
This may be one reason why they are often despised by their hard-faced
colleagues in accounts, strategic planning and even marketing.
Instruction: There is, and there will probably always be, a place for
'chalk-and-talk' training. Education, now more likely to be run with
impressive videos, self-instruction and completion booklets, plus elaborate
feedback reports, remains a central task of some HRCs. Training adults is a
challenging task for the HRC. There are those in organisations who are
themselves very bright and highly educated who may be extremely critical of
any 'outside consultant'. Equally, those with chips on their shoulders
because they never went to university, or did and did rather badly, may make
poor students flipping between the sycophantic and the cynical. But there
are others who are deeply appreciative and very good students.
The good HRC soon realises that training adults is rather different from
educating students. Training managers must be practical and concrete with
lots of memorable examples, helpful models etc. Whereas academics are
trained to be critical and sceptical, HRC instructors soon realise they are
more appreciated if they are enthusiastic about the cause. HRCs are
frequently extroverts with a self-confidence that extends somewhat beyond
the bounds of their ability. As a result they rarely fear the role of
teaching, training or instructing, though they may not be that good at it.
Good teaching is a rare combination of intellectual ability and knowing how
to put it across.
Certainly, instructing or teaching is a crucial function for many HRCs. For
many, alas, the term 'training' has a poor reputation and trainers are
considered, rather lowly (paid) sorts of consultancies especially when
teachers are trained to deliver 'packaged' courses.
Process: Some HRCs specialise in process or interpretation as opposed to
product. When, for instance, a management team is underperforming or
suffering low morale, the process-oriented HRC might be called in not only
for diagnosis but also cure. Process skills are closely akin to group
psychotherapy and indeed it may be how the consultant was trained.
Just as most accidents are the result of human error, so quite commonly poor
business operations are the result of human frailty. Whether one prefers to
use meaningless phrases like 'personality clash' or not, many people
recognise that the quality of human relationships in offices, teams and
departments contributes to business success or failure. It is the intangible
psychological factors of morale, conflict and lack of commitment that the
process consultant hopes to make manifest and explicit. Good HRCs, and those
with psycho-analytic training, are frequently able to reveal unexpected or
even paradoxical findings, such as depression amongst employees being a
consequence of their anger.
To some, 'process consultants' represent the wackiest California-type
psychological air-heads who ask both intrusive and daft questions primarily
to embarrass one. Furthermore, they may not even come to a conclusion, write
a report or deliver any tangible outcome. Insight alone is often the orally
explicit goal of the process consultant.
It is nearly always the case that process work has to be done by the outside
consultant. Politically, the personnel department may wisely judge it
necessary to lure in consultants, albeit at some critical (and financial)
cost.
Beware the HRC who claims to be equally competent at all the above
functions. But many business people do recognise that changing a business
requires dynamite and it is often the consultant who lights the fuse. Victor
Kiam once accused consultants of being like castrated bulls because all they
can do is advise, not act. The question, of course, remains of where to get
good advice
Knowing and understanding what HRC consultants offer and do well is crucial
for any company. No 'Which?' guide exists for the naive shopper, only
compendia or lists of companies that specialise in HRC. Fitting the
consultant to the problem is clearly as relevant as the employee to the job.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Election deadlock break seen - Poll
Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLL TAX would 'break the election deadlock in Labour's favour', Mr
Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, claimed yesterday as the party
published a survey of the provisional poll tax levels of 40 councils.
Mr Gould said the figures showed poll tax bills would damage the government
during a campaign, and repeated his claim that Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, was planning a 'Budget bail-out' to ensure that poll
tax bills were delayed until after the election. Mr Heseltine has ruled out
a 'Budget fix' for the poll tax.
The highest percentage increase in the 40 councils that have proposed tax
levels for the coming year is in Tory-controlled Ashford in Kent, where the
poll tax would rise from Pounds 176 to Pounds 244. Labour-controlled Oxford
plans to cut its poll tax from Pounds 344 to Pounds 311.
Highlighting the 17.3 per cent average increase for Tory councils against
the 6.5 per cent for Labour councils, Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local
government spokesman, said the figures exposed the government myth that
Labour councils would force up bills.
Most of the 40 councils are shire districts, many of which had scope for
increasing spending without being capped. Sixteen of the proposed poll tax
levels were lower than the government's target of Pounds 257, but six of
these included rises of more than 20 per cent.
When figures for the larger, metropolitan councils are set the pattern is
likely to be of lower percentage increases on higher cash figures.
Labour-controlled Birmingham yesterday set its poll tax rate for the coming
year at Pounds 295 - Pounds 29 higher than now.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said Labour had produced
nothing to alter the government's contention that average charges would be
close to the target. 'This thin attempt by Labour to give respectability to
its high-spending irresponsible councils smacks of desperation.' A 25 per
cent discount on council-tax bills was announced yesterday by the government
for households where a disabled person lives with a full-time carer who is
not a spouse or parent. The move was welcomed in the Lords, where the
legislation on the tax is being examined.

TORY FUNDS: More than half the 35 ministerial visits to Hong Kong between
1988 and 1991 involved party political fund-raising activities, Mr Frank
Dobson, shadow energy secretary, claimed yesterday.
Countering Tory charges that Labour is controlled by the unions Mr Dobson
said Mr John Major, the prime minister, had led efforts to beg for
'backhanders' from Chinese millionaires.
SCOTLAND: The Scottish Conservative party yesterday presented an opinion
poll showing that a majority of Scots would not be prepared to pay higher
taxes under a devolved assembly.
Under Labour's plan the Scottish assembly or parliament would have the power
to increase or lower income tax in Scotland by up to 3p.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday presented a Harris opinion poll
showing 58 per cent of Scots were not be prepared to pay higher taxes 'to
meet the cost of the assembly and its activities', against 30 per cent who
would. Some 12 per cent did not know.
JOHN MAJOR: Downing Street took the unusual step yesterday of refuting a
newspaper report which claimed Mr John Major had once backed proportional
representation.
Officials said remarks attributed to Mr Major when he first won his
constituency in 1979 were in fact said by the Liberal candidate. As prime
minister, Mr Major has said he opposes electoral reform.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, employment secretary, renewed the government's assault on
the consequences of Labour's trade union connections, David Owen writes.
He said last year's figure of 800,000 days lost to strikes compared with
more than 29m days lost in 1979. That was the winter of discontent which had
seen 'the collapse of the last Labour government's economic policies'.
Having been through 'difficult times', Britain was 'on the point of reaping
the rewards for low inflation, and for our strike-free industrial
relations'.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said there would be 'no return
to the trades union legislation of the 1970s' and suggested the government
was 'refighting' the battles of that era because it had no solutions to
current problems.
After combating unemployment, the main priority, he said, was to 'improve
the education of our workforce'. Britain had less than a quarter as many
apprentices as Germany, he said, criticising the government's decision to
cut training expenditure.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock scoffs at Majorism - Prime
Minister's questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN would face 'perma-nent high unemployment' if the general election
resulted in a fourth successive Conservative victory, Mr Neil Kinnock said
in the Commons yesterday.
With Labour's hopes of pulling ahead in the opinion polls now resting on the
depth of the recession, the Labour leader seized on the latest figures
showing a rise in the number of long-term unemployed to charge that the
government had to bear the blame. During another angry exchange at prime
minister's questions, he insisted: 'Majorism is not working.'
Labour will return to the theme later today, when Mr John Smith, shadow
chancellor, opens a full-scale Commons debate on the effect of the recession
on manufacturing industry.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'The only way of getting these
figures down permanently is to have the right structure of development
within the economy - low inflation and stable exchange rates.' Government
policies were designed to achieve these objectives, while Labour policies
would lead to 'permanent slump - no jobs, no prospects, no hope for the
future'.
Mr Kinnock sought to associate the prime minister directly with the view of
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that rising unemployment and the recession
had been the price 'well worth paying' to get inflation down. Mr Major
retorted: 'I have said no such thing and neither, in context, has the
chancellor.'
This denial brought furious protests from Labour with Mr Robin Corbett, MP
for Birmingham Erdington, recalling the occasion in May when Mr Lamont first
referred to the price 'well worth paying'. Downing Street later emphasised
that in correcting what it called a misquotation the prime minister had not
sought to distance himself from the chancellor.
In the Commons exchanges Mr Major argued that if Mr Kinnock was really
concerned about unemployment he would not be advocating policies which would
'cripple' industry. These included bringing back flying pickets and
restoring the legal immunities of unions 'with all the difficulties we saw
in the 1960s and 1970s'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's commitment
to recovery could best be judged by the fact that last week's announcement
of a 53,000 increase in unemployment had been followed by a Pounds 171m cut
in the training budget. Mr Major stressed that the provision for training
was the highest Britain had ever known.
He cited the Bundesbank's statement that Germany was now in recession as
further evidence that Britain's current difficulties had not been caused by
government policies.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Making Westminster user-friendly -
Parliamentary procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE SITTING a week in the morning, some Fridays off, and the prospect of
earlier ends to some parliamentary days are among proposals in a cross-party
report which aims to take some of the politics out of parliamentary
procedure.
The plans from the all-party committee of MPs chaired by Mr Michael Jopling,
a former Tory chief whip, hold out the prospect of more rationality and
common sense in Westminster arrangements. They do not, however, go as far
towards normal office hours as some campaigners will have hoped.
Automatic timetabling of legislation is proposed, and the plea for short
speeches - including those from ministers and their shadows - will be
renewed. More parliamentary days will close with a vote at 10pm rather than
the current later sittings.
Backbench bills would still be taken on Fridays and backbenchers would
retain the ability to raise subjects for legislation in afternoon 'prime
time' just after questions, even though such measures have little chance of
becoming law.
The plans, agreed yesterday and to be published on Friday in time for a
debate before parliament dissolves for the general election, are likely to
figure in more than one party manifesto as a way of making Westminster more
user-friendly. Certainly there was a great deal of cross-party common ground
in the committee.
Some who can remember the minuscule and indeed negative majorities of the
Labour governments of the 1970s wonder, however, how far the attempt to
adapt parliamentary procedures would survive a hung parliament or a
government with a single-figure majority.
One senior business manager commented that if the election result is as
tight as predicted, then automatic timetabling of legislation would not be
acceptable because it would cut the traditional rights of the Opposition too
far.
Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the all-party procedure committee,
dismissed the Westminster lore that delay is a strong opposition card.
It was, he said, a 'false belief that late-night sittings and filibusters
actually force the government to do anything'.
Some anecdotal evidence suggests that MPs have no stomach for extensive
sittings - but that is in the context of a government with a majority not
far short of 100. The possibility of ministers losing a vote if it were
delayed might stiffen the nerves.
But perhaps the real reason why those who currently back the reforms may
have second thoughts after an election lies in Sir Peter's comment that he
saw every reason why they 'should prove likely to be adopted by any new
government'.
With both the main parties expressing confidence of victory, they may change
their tune when addressing the plans from the point of view of a new
opposition.

COUNCIL TAX could produce as much administrative chaos as poll tax unless it

Nacab says in a report comparing plans for council tax with its experience

be made available well before its introduction.
Nacab also wants an option for taxpayers to pay weekly, and says they should
be allowed to pay any council-tax debts by 'realistic instalments' before
bailiffs are called in.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Decline in electoral registers 'reversed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLINE in the number of people registering on electoral rolls has been
reversed, Labour MPs said yesterday. They said that last year's national
total had been boosted by 116,000 people who had registered this year.
Mr David Blunkett, the party's local government spokesman, added that the
increase in the register had been achieved in spite of government
indifference.
'The government has spent almost Pounds 1m registering 34,454 expatriate
voters at a cost of Pounds 29 per vote while spending only Pounds 647,000 on
the registration of 40m domestic voters,' he said.
Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Bar, accused the government
of seeking a low turnout in the election for electoral advantage.
The MPs quoted a party survey based on information from more than 300
councils in England and Wales, under a variety of political control. Labour
said the most marked increases in registration had been in towns and London
boroughs containing marginal seats, such as Blackpool, Croydon, Lambeth,
Lincoln, Plymouth and York.
There had been concern that people were deliberately failing to register in
the hope that they would be less likely to have to pay poll tax. Some
estimates put the fall in the register between 1987 and last year at 750,000
voters.
Many of those deliberately failing to register came from from highly mobile
groups such as people in inner cities where voting tends to favour Labour.
Mr Rooker criticised particularly the decision of ministers not to set up an
advertising campaign before the election was called to advise housebound
voters of their rights. They would therefore have insufficient time to
exercise their rights. 'Failure to take action amounts to partisan action in
view of the evidence,' he claimed.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Old guard on the retreat in many Labour town halls: Policy
shifts by some of the party's top local politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST ALL the 57 urban areas eligible to compete for the Pounds 750m of
City Challenge funding announced yesterday have Labour councils.
Predictably, they joined Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, in
denouncing the competition as a 'game show pandering to the whims and
prejudices of an egocentric environment secretary'.
They will play the game all the same - with enthusiasm, in many cases. In
last year's competition, Manchester won cash for renovating its shabby Hulme
district south of the city centre. Mr Graham Stringer, Labour leader of the
city council, opposes the bidding element in City Challenge but declares
himself 'far from cynical' about the process of preparing bids.
'It has brought together government, council, tenants, businesses, churches
and voluntary bodies to help find a common solution to our urban problems',
he says. 'If Labour wins the general election we need to keep that process.
The contacts made are lasting.'
It is a typical response. The crusading socialism of the early 1980s is
little in evidence among today's generation of Labour council chiefs.
Leading lights such as Mr Stringer and Ms Margaret Hodge in north London's
Islington, once heroes of the hard left, are arch-pragmatists now. Others,
such as Mr Jeremy Beecham in Newcastle upon Tyne, were Kinnockite 'soft
left' from the start.
'The old left/right divide is obsolete,' says Mr Rod Hills, Labour leader of
York City Council. 'Now the division is generational, between innovators and
an old guard.' If Labour wins the election, much more than City Challenge
will depend on the respective influence of those two groups.
Both are largely united on five priorities: creation of single-tier
all-purpose authorities; the return of the fixing of business rate to
councils; a general power of competence for councils to act - and spend - as
they see fit; abolition of compulsory competitive tendering; and freeing of
councils' accumulated capital receipts for them to spend on housing and
other programmes.
Ms Janet Silet, leader of Norwich City Council, says: 'If they release part
of our Pounds 30m in capital reserves, we will start a house-building
programme the next day. We have sites designated and already have planning
permission.' Mr Gould has warned councils that Labour would relax spending
constraints 'progressively'. The rate of progress is likely to cause
tension.
Mr Gould is also committed to abolishing the compulsory aspect of tendering,
a process that highlights the gulf between the innovators and the old guard.
The old guard simply wants to be free of it and, like most of the
local-government trade unions, hankers for the old days in which work was
done automatically by councils' own labour forces. By contrast, the
innovators are keen to retain - and even extend - the cost centres, service
plans and quality targets that have been part of the competitive-tendering
process.
Mr Stringer, who is pressing ahead with service plans for every council
department in Manchester, says: 'Targets and effective monitoring are
crucial. It's amazing that local authorities often don't even know how many
they employ, let alone what they do.'
Under Mr Hills, York has pioneered a local citizen's charter, customer
contracts and annual performance indicators - seen as a models of their
kind. He supports Labour's proposed quality commission as a means of
spreading best practice, and favours it intervening in badly run
authorities.
Among innovators, partnership is the vogue word. It underpins a growing
commitment to community politics on the one hand, and the European Community
on the other. 'When I go to Brussels,' says Mr Stringer, 'I get a much
friendlier reception than in Whitehall these days.'
Radical attitudes to constitutional change are also evident. Support for
regional government, electoral reform and coalition politics is strong and
spreading among Labour councillors. Mr Stringer believes most councillors
back proportional representation. In Manchester, he says, 'we get 55 per
cent of the vote and 86 per cent of the seats - not an obvious recipe for
good government.'
Ms Hodge thinks on the same lines. As the most likely leader of Labour's
proposed Greater London Authority, which would be elected by PR, she may
soon be setting the tone for the rest.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Limited scope seen for Whitehall agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE of the limited scope for government agencies to improve their
business performance is disclosed today in the National Audit Office's first
report on an executive agency.
The report by the government expenditure watchdog examines the Vehicle
Inspectorate, which tests heavy-goods vehicles and public-service vehicles,
supervises the annual MoT tests for cars and enforces some driver and
vehicle legislation.
The inspectorate was the first executive agency set up under the Next Steps
initiative launched in 1988 to create arm's-length agencies to deliver
government services.
The NAO says the inspectorate has become significantly more efficient since
it became an executive agency in 1988. Between 1989 and 1991, efficiency
savings reached 8.8 per cent of costs compared with the government's target
of 3.7 per cent.
But scope for further improvements is limited by government policy, the NAO
says. The Vehicle Inspectorate is not free to close under-used testing
stations, some of which operate for only a few days a week. Moreover,
Treasury rules limit the discretion of agencies to compete with the private
sector for additional work.
These limitations are 'a useful illustration of the differences between an
executive agency and a market-led business', the report concludes.
'If the inspectorate were acting as a market-led business, they would now be
looking more radically at the resources they have and the services they
provide,' it says. 'For example, a business would be considering whether to
rationalise under-utilised assets or whether to seek new business that would
use assets more fully.'
The NAO finds that the inspectorate has become more responsive to the needs
of its customers since becoming an agency. According to a Mori opinion poll
conducted for the NAO last year, 40 per cent of customers considered that
the quality of service had improved since 1988 while 91 per cent considered
that the overall service was very or fairly good. Customer service
initiatives launched by the Vehicle Inspectorate since it became an agency
are evidence of a determination to improve services, the NAO says. But
success of the initiatives - which include Saturday testing and the sale of
technical publications - has been mixed because no detailed market research
or cost-benefit analysis was carried out.
The NAO says there are still some practical improvements which can be made
to the inspectorate's running. These include putting measures of quality in
targets and greater devolution of management responsibilities to district
offices.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BT concerned over union link with
Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT is threatening to withhold corporate information from its main union, the
NCU, because the union has started to recruit workers at Mercury, BT's main
competitor.
BT has said it is concerned to protect confidential company information
which is given to union officials as part of normal consultative processes.
Mercury does not recognise any union, but the NCU has begun to recruit
Mercury clerical workers.
The union claims a recent recruitment drive in Birmingham netted 102
members.
It has written to Mr Robert Johnston, Mercury's director of personnel,
raising issues connected with pay, training and health and safety.
As employee rights to corporate information become an increasingly important
industrial relations issue - not least through the European Community's
social legislation - the issue of confidentiality could worry some large
employers.
In many industries one union has often represented workers in competing
companies.
An AEU engineering workers' union official said, for example, that senior
officials covering the car industry were often trusted with confidential
corporate information.
'They trust us not to pass on the information and we don't,' he said. 'When
confidential information does leak out it is more likely to come from
managers in the industry who tend to meet socially.'
Mr Peter Jeffers, a BT manager, says in a letter to Mr Alan Harley, an NCU
national official: 'Over the years there has been a tendency for BT, and
previously the Post Office, to provide union reps with information of a
nature which we would not willingly provide to an 'external' union (ie one
representing people not employed by the company) especially if there was a
possibility of access by employees of a competitor.
'In the light of current developments the company will need to review its
present practices.'
BT is also concerned that NCU officials may be using time off granted by BT
to run recruitment drives in Mercury.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Toyota unveils range of family cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA has unveiled in Tokyo the large family-car range to be produced near
Derby from the end of the year as part of the company's Pounds 840m
investment in UK car and engine plants.
Production of the new-generation Carina - sold as the Corona in Japan - is
scheduled to begin at Toyota's Pounds 700m car assembly plant at Burnaston,
near Derby, in December.
Engine production at the company's Pounds 140m plant at Deeside, north
Wales, is planned to begin in August.
The car will be shown in Europe for the first time at the Geneva Motor Show
next month. It will be launched in Europe in the spring with supplies coming
initially from Japan and later from the UK plant.
The Carina will be the first car built by Toyota in Europe and will be the
main focus of its effort to increase its share of the western European
market for new cars.
It will also allow the Japanese carmaker for the first time to launch a
concerted attack on the UK market for company and fleet cars.
Sales in Japan are expected to reach 108,000 a year.
In the UK, the Toyota Carina will pose significant competition for models
such as the Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Sierra, Peugeot 405 and Nissan Primera,
the car built by Toyota's biggest domestic Japanese rival in Sunderland,
Tyne and Wear.
Toyota expects to produce 31,000 Carinas at Burnaston in 1993, the first
full year of production, with output set to rise rapidly to 100,000 a year
in 1995, of which 75 per cent will be for export.
By 1997, output from Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) is planned to rise to
200,000 cars a year.
To date the UK company has hired a workforce of about 400, but recruitment
is set to accelerate during 1992. Employees are being trained in Japan, the
US and Canada as well as in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.
The workforce is eventually due to increase to 3,000 at Burnaston and 300 on
Deeside when full capacity is reached.
Toyota is aiming to reach a 60 per cent local European content level by 1993
and 80 per cent by mid 1995.
European components purchases are planned to reach about Pounds 700m a year
at full production of 200,000 cars a year.
Toyota has given final supply contracts to 68 components suppliers in Europe
for the UK Carina production programme.
Eventually Toyota is expected to export some cars and engines from the UK
plants to Japan.

MEDIAN pay settlement levels in engineering companies fell to 4.5 per cent
in the three months to January. They dropped from 4.9 per cent in the
quarter to December, according to the Engineering Employers' Federation.
The November-January figures, collated from 258 settlements, include 15
settlements where no increase is to be paid for the foreseeable future. The
federation has also reported 16 other short-term deferments which have not
been included.
The upper quartile of the November-January settlements was 5.1 per cent
against 5.5 per cent in October-December. However, the lower quartile

A THIRD of senior managers at Manchester Airport have been told they must
apply for middle-management postions or take redundancy, Catherine Milton
writes.
Successful applicants will not lose pay for two years, after which pay will
drop to the rate for the job. The eight people involved are not guaranteed
jobs within the airport.
The airport said: 'Although cost-cutting is part of the motivation, it is
primarily a cultural change to drive the business to be more market-led and
customer-oriented.'
A further 30 jobs are likely to be affected next month when the review will
announce a new structure for middle management. Those affected will be able
to apply for re-designed middle-management positions or take redundancy.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Strike to end at GEC offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 400 workers at a plant owned by GEC-Alsthom, the switchgear
company, will today end a six-week strike after management said they would
otherwise lose their jobs, Michael Smith writes.
Some 430 employees at the plant in Openshaw, near Manchester, voted
yesterday to end the stoppage even though they had failed to persuade the
company to reinstate 12 colleagues made compulsorily redundant, the issue on
which they were striking.
Strikes have been rare during the recession, and government figures last
week showed that fewer working days were lost last year through stoppages
than in any year since records began 100 years ago.
The outcome of the GEC-Alsthom dispute is likely to deter others from
striking over redundancies or other issues. It was watched by workers at
other GEC plants where unions are fighting job losses and what they consider
to be poor severance schemes.
Since the strike began, the plant, which employs 650 people, has said it
wants a further 157 job cuts in a second round of redundancies.
National officials of unions including the AEU engineering workers and MSF
general workers advised members to return to work after weekend talks with
managers.
Mr Larry Brooke, MSF national officer, said continuation of the strike would
inevitably have led to the plant's closure. He said the strike had shown
that GEC workers were disgusted with the way the company handled
redundancies.
Mr Brooke and other union officials will be pressing the company to provide
the 12 employees made compulsorily redundant with the enhanced severance
terms they would have been entitled to had they accepted the loss of their
jobs voluntarily.
They also wanted the 157 planned job losses to be reduced. GEC-Alsthom,
which is owned jointly by GEC and Alcatel of France, said it regretted the
need for compulsory redundancies, but welcomed yesterday's decision.

A SECOND UK charter airline has decided to operate Airbus A320 narrow-body
airliners, whose sophisticated computerised control systems have recently
been under criticism.
This followed the crash of a French Air Inter A320 last month near
Strasbourg, killing 87 people.
Air 2000, the charter airline of the Owners Abroad tour group, said
yesterday it would lease four new A320s from ORIX Aviation Systems of
Dublin. The aircraft will be powered by V2500 engines built by the IAE
consortium which includes Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, and MTU of
Germany.
The first two aircraft will be delivered to Air 2000 for use this summer.
Meanwhile London City Airport received a boost yesterday with the
announcement that CityAir Scandinavia, a new Swedish airline, plans to
introduce daily services using British Aerospace 146 jets between Stockholm
and London.
Crossair, the regional carrier which is 51 per cent owned by Swissair, has
already announced daily services between Zurich and London City using BAe
146s. Ryanair, the independent Irish carrier, is expanding its flights from
London Stansted to Ireland with a daily service to Shannon from April 10.
The route is already operated by Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Lords to consider Lloyd's duty to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF London faces fresh embarrassment next week when the long-running
Oakeley Vaughan court case returns to a public arena.
Public hearings in the House of Lords begin on Monday to consider whether
Lloyd's has a duty of care to Names who lose money through the 'misdeeds' of
their agents.
The immediate dispute is over whether the matter should be decided as a
preliminary issue or as part of the main body of the case. The hearings are
expected to last four days.
The proceedings are related to a case in which members of syndicates managed
by the Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency in the 1980s allege that
negligence by Lloyd's was responsible for losses of more than Pounds 5m.
Meanwhile, solicitors acting for 600 Names expect today to issue motions for
'about 10' separate injunctions in order to prevent Lloyd's from drawing on
deposits held with agents.
The Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting at the insurance
market - are members of syndicates specialising in catastrophe re-insurance
which have made heavy losses.
Labour MPs are continuing to add to the series of early-day motions critical
of Lloyd's that have appeared on the Commons order paper recently.
Mr Max Madden, the MP for Bradford West, will today question whether Mr
David Coleridge is the right person to be Lloyd's chairman.
This follows yesterday's call from Mr Bob Cryer, his fellow Bradford MP, for
Mr Coleridge to condemn the use by working members of devices to divest
themselves of assets which might otherwise have been vulnerable to the
market's unlimited liability.
Also yesterday the authorities at Lloyd's distanced themselves from the
preliminary discussions that senior figures in the market have been holding
with ministers and the Bank of England about measures to ease the liquidity
problems of many agents.
Lloyd's said yesterday that 'centrally' it had not been involved in any
discussion with the Bank of England about possible financial assistance. It
also said it had made no request for assistance from the Bank or from
ministers.
Lloyd's insisted that the Corporation of Lloyd's - the body that provides
regulatory and back-up services to the market's 150 agents and 300 or so
underwriting syndicates - is free from debt.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICATION of school examination results in 'league tables' can be
seriously misleading if made without an estimate of 'added value', according
to a paper published by the National Commission for Education.
The paper, by Professor Andrew McPherson of Edinburgh University, calls for
'raw results' of tests and exams published by the government and local
authorities to be accompanied by an assessment of the contribution a school
makes to its pupils' progress. This should take account of each pupil's
prior level of attainment and other factors influencing progress.
The paper is the first to be published by the commission, a privately funded
body conducting an in-depth inquiry into Britain's education system.
The National Association of Head Teachers will seek a High Court injunction
tomorrow to prevent the governors of Stratford School in east London from
impeding the headteacher in the running of the school.

FT  19 FEB 92 / BTG sell-off likely to see only two bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY TWO buyers for the British Technology Group are likely to be left in
the field when the government's final deadline for bids expires tomorrow.
They are a consortium led by the BTG management and a British-American group
headed by Mr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics.
A third consortium headed by Sir Ronald Mason, former chief scientist at the
Ministry of Defence, and Mr Peter Homer of James Finlay Bank in Glasgow
pulled out of the controversial privatisation of the state-owned technology
transfer group last night.
'The tortuous, changing and time-limited procedures have now prevented us
from bringing together sufficient funds to support the grouping of
investors, universities and research organisations as envisaged in our
plans,' Sir Ronald said.
Mr Homer blamed the Department of Trade and Industry and its financial
adviser, Price Waterhouse, for 'withholding key information on BTG'.
Under the complex rules of the BTG sell-off, only consortia with at least
seven members may submit bids.
The BTG management consortium and Mr John Ashworth's Anglo-American group
say they will definitely bid. The latter includes Research Corporation
Technologies, the leading US technology-transfer organisation and BTG's
closest competitor. Neither consortium will reveal its other members.
There is still an outside chance of a bid from a group led by Strategy
International, a London consultancy. The company refused to comment
yesterday on its plans.
Other bidders have condemned the process for what they claim is unnecessary
secrecy and confusion about the criteria on which submissions will be
judged. Price is important - although bids are unlikely to exceed Pounds 50m
 -and so is long-term commitment to BTG's business of commercialising
university research.
The government hopes to complete the sale next month, so that it will not be
affected by a general election in April.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Hard line urged on directors' liability for accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES' ACCOUNTS should contain a statement of directors'
responsibilities which should be be approved by their auditors, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said yesterday.
It should state explicitly the legal responsibilities of directors in
preparing the accounts, which includes the requirement that the figures give
a 'true and fair view'. They should also give details of the maintenance and
effectiveness of internal financial controls.
The recommendations are based on a study conducted by a working party
established by the institute in April last year to examine issues of
corporate governance. It calls for the widespread adoption of audit
committees by companies and the strengthening of internal financial
controls.
Auditors are already legally obliged to highlight any directors' statements
they disagree with in the annual report. The recommendation for a more
detailed directors' report - which should not be a pro forma statement -
would strengthen auditors' powers to comment on a company's internal
controls.
Mr Ian Tegner, institute president, said that an audited directors'
statement would represent a move towards a more detailed, 'qualitative' form
of financial reporting, in that auditors would verify the content of the
statement as well as the figures in the company's accounts.
He added that a significant aim was to confront boards of directors with
their responsibilities and get them to take them seriously.
The institute argues that any additional costs incurred by auditors
scrutinising the directors' statements should be balanced by efficiency
gains resulting from improved internal controls.
The report has been submitted to the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance, which is expected to report in the next few months.
The report also echoes proposals now before the Auditing Practices Board,
which sets standards, for an expanded audit statement which would list the
responsibilities of directors.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Deprivation linked to increase in crime rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Metropolitan Police yesterday identified a 'social and economic malaise'
as a factor in record crime rates in London, Alan Pike writes.
Commander David Stevens, presenting the capital's crime trends for last
year, said the figures had to be viewed against the background of the
recession. A 26 per cent increase in street crime last year had occurred
largely in areas of social depriva-tion.
The pre-election atmosphere, said Commander Stevens, was an opportune one
for the community to influence policing.
Recorded crime in London rose 11 per cent to a record 926,200 offences last
year, and national figures are expected to show a similar trend.
The link between social deprivation and crime is not one which that appeals
to ministers, who denied that deprivation caused the recent Tyneside riots.
Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said the figures highlighted the
government's failure to tackle the causes of crime rather than its symptoms.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Swaps team finds no 'timebombs': Concerns raised over the
technicalities of dealing by institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are 'no specific unexploded timebombs' waiting to shake the legal
foundations of London's financial markets, Lord Alexander, chairman of
National Westminster Bank, said yesterday. But there are any number of less
significant legal difficulties which hinder the efficient workings of the
markets.
Lord Alexander was speaking on the publication of the report of the Legal
Risk Review Committee, which he had chaired. Established after the local
authority swaps saga - when the House of Lords ruled that councils could not
engage in the swaps market, and thus did not have to meet their liabilities
under swap contracts - Lord Alexander's committee had set out to identify
other potential problems which could undermine the workings of the financial
markets.
It concluded that institutions which act as counter-parties in the London
markets need greater certainty that they will not be tripped up by legal
uncertainties. Creating a solid legal platform on which financial business
can be conducted is essential to London's position as a financial centre,
the committee concluded.
Top of the list of concerns of market participants is the problem
highlighted by the local authority swaps debacle: are some bodies active in
the markets dealing outside their particular legal or constitutional powers
 -ultra vires - thus making their contracts legally void?
Following European legislation, and the 1989 Companies Act, companies in
Britain are no longer affected by the ultra vires rule. However, a wide
range of other institutions are, including local authorities, building
societies, industrial and provident societies - which include co-operatives,
credit unions and most housing associations - and friendly societies. Then
there are nationalised industries, and some statutory water and harbour
companies. Even some insurance companies and banks can be affected,
depending on the statutes under which they were founded.
Pension funds could also find themselves acting outside their powers, if
their trust deeds are not sufficiently broadly worded. The development of
new derivatives markets leaves open the possibility that some funds are
technically unable to participate.
Potentially, anyone dealing with these institutions could find themselves
unable to enforce a contract, if it is later found that the body concerned
did not have the power to enter it in the first place. But it is not always
clear what powers are available to each type of institution.
Building societies, for instance, are allowed under section 23 of the
Building Societies Act to engage in any hedging transaction designed to
'reduce the risk of loss'. For anyone dealing with a society, it is
impossible to determine whether this requirement is being met. Another
example is the power of local authorities to get involved in stock lending -
when a body lends shares it owns to others in the market and collects a fee
in the process. Some authorities do not engage in the practice because of
legal uncertainty, while others are less concerned.
According to the Alexander committee, restrictions on what particular
institutions can do may be sensible, but it is unfair to expect third
parties to police these rules. Ultra vires transactions are relatively rare,
but the effect of the rule is not merely to create an unnecessary and unjust
risk, but also to diminish the creditworthiness of the bodies which it was
intended to protect, the committee concluded.
While the ultra vires rule causes the greatest anxiety in financial markets,
comments to the committee indicated that the ability to net claims against
each other came a close second. This is the power available to an
institution, on the insolvency of a market participant, to set off one claim
against another and only to settle the net amount.
Netting and offset cause particular concern as they relate to the position
of agents such as brokers or trustees, the committee found. Also, 'some
difficulties were thought to arise in ensuring effective netting in new and
complex products and across a range of different activities'.
If these are the issues at the top of the markets' list of concerns, many
others are also included. Among them are the ability to enforce security
interests over particular assets; the operation of the Financial Services
Act, in particular the provisions of section 47 which outlaws market
manipulation; and the provisions of section 151 of the Companies Act, which
prohibits a company from giving financial support for the purchase of its
own shares.
These are some of the oldest chestnuts of the financial world, if not its
'unexploded timebombs'.
Having turned them up, though, the Alexander committee has provided little
hope that it can do better in solving the problems than other committees
before it.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Tories attack Labour's plan for companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES yesterday turned their election fire on the Labour party's
plans for business, claiming that a return to the 'failed corporatism' of
the 1970s would represent a charter for the destruction of jobs and
enterprise.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, emerged from his pre-Budget purdah to lead
a day of ministerial attacks on Labour's proposals for a more
interventionist industrial strategy.
His speech was accompanied by a Conservative analysis which concluded that
Labour plans for a medium-term industrial strategy would signal 'a return
ticket to the world of social compacts and social contracts and to the
Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and the National Enterprise Board'.
Among the threats to business, the speech listed proposals for new
regulations and red tape of 'baroque proportions'; plans for a minimum wage
and greater employment protection which would result in a 'massive' increase
in employment costs; the establishment of a 'training bureaucracy financed
by a payroll tax'; and interference in investment decisions.
Mr Lamont told the Institute of Directors that the Labour public relations
offensive was an attempt to disguise the extent to which the party still
rejected the central principles of the market economy.
'The fact is that Labour no more believe in a free, deregulated market
economy than you believe in a flat earth', he said. The Conservative attack
 -launched earlier in the day by Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry
secretary, and echoed in a Commons debate on industrial relations by Mr
Michael Howard, employment secretary - reflects ministerial concern that
Labour's approach has won respectability among industrialists.
Mr Lamont sought to contrast a Conservative stance based on 'properly
functioning markets free from unnecessary bureaucratic interference' with a
thinly veiled Labour commitment to constant intervention.
He argued that despite a change in rhetoric, the substance of the
Opposition's policy documents pointed to a tightly regulated and
centrally-directed business sector.
Labour would 'draw the teeth' of the Conservatives' union legislation, force
companies to submit their investment decisions to 'social audits', raise
employment costs by introducing a minimum wage and smother small enterprises
in red tape.
He characterised its planned training levy as an 'elaborate bureaucratic
interference' with the decisions of individual companies. At the heart of
every significant training decision would be 'compulsory consultation with
trades unions and local authorities'.
Labour support for the European Community's and its programme of directives,
meanwhile, threatened to add Pounds 5bn to the costs of British business.

FT  19 FEB 92 / IoD urges more help for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL rethink of the role of small businesses in the economy is needed
if they are to play a full part in improving its performance, the Institute
of Directors said yesterday.
In a document on small companies, published yesterday, the IoD argued that
companies employing fewer than 200 people - which made up 99.5 per cent of
the 2.5m companies in the UK in 1986 - were overburdened by taxation and red
tape.
'Despite a successful move towards the enterprise culture, Britain is still
far from a totally unregulated free market,' said the report.
According to the IoD small businesses spend a bigger proportion of their
time and turnover than bigger companies collecting taxes and paying
benefits.
'Companies collect five sixths of the tax revenue and pay for the
collection,' said Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the IoD. 'We want to
see this burden on business reduced, and we believe firms should be
compensated by the Inland Revenue for administering PAYE, National Insurance
Contributions and statutory sick pay.'
The report said the Treasury should ease the burden of taxation by:
Raising the limits of corporation tax.
Abolishing inheritance tax on business assets.
Raising the threshold for VAT.
Linking the uniform business rate to business benefits.
Giving discounts for prompt and early payment of taxes.
Big firms received a disproportionate amount of attention in the framing of
policy thanks to their ability to make the headlines through lobbying, said
the IoD. This over-representation led to the development of tax and
regulatory systems which imposed excessive burdens on smaller enterprises.
A great many regulations could be abolished, said the report, including many
licensing requirements, and the ban on Sunday trading.

ARGENTINA'S creditor banks have rejected demands by Mr Domingo Cavallo,
economy minister, for a 40 per cent cut in the country's Dollars 31bn
(Pounds 17.1bn) commercial bank debt under the Brady debt reduction plan.
They offered instead a 30 per cent reduction and insisted on a Dollars 1bn
cash payment to reduce more than Dollars 8bn in interest arrears. Mr Cavallo
had offered no cash payment. The banks also demanded higher interest rates
and shorter maturities on discount bonds Argentina will issue to replace
debt certificates.
Besides wanting to make as few concessions as possible, bankers want to
avoid precedents which Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor, would
exploit.
Mr Cavallo said last month when debt talks began that he wanted an agreement
as quickly as possible. However, he has been criticised for not demanding
greater concessions and for weakening his bargaining position by aiming for
a rapid settlement.
He hopes that operation of the Brady plan - named after Mr Nicholas Brady,
US treasury secretary - will increase capital flows to finance a
deteriorating balance of payments.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Fed eases pressure on banks' profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve Board yesterday moved to boost bank profitability by
announcing an unexpected reduction in banks' reserve requirements. With
effect from April, the Fed is reducing from 12 to 10 per cent the proportion
of current accounts that must be held as non-interest bearing reserves with
the central bank. This will reduce US bank reserves by nearly Dollars 9bn
(Pounds 4.9bn).
On Wall Street, the announcement was greeted by sharp falls in both bond and
share prices. The cut in reserve requirements was seen as offering some
relief to hard-pressed banks but not as a substitute for a cut in interest
rates.
Today, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is due to present his
six-monthly report to Congress on monetary policy. He had been expected to
come under pressure from some members of Congress to ease further the Fed's
monetary policy, on the grounds that December's cut of a full percentage
point in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent was not sufficient to prod the
sluggish economy out of recession.
The cut in reserve requirements is of largely symbolic importance but gives
the impression that the Fed is taking steps to boost the economy.
'This will make it easier for Mr Greenspan to defend not cutting interest
rates again,' said Mr Bill Dudley, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, the New York
investment house. The move would raise bank earnings by a few per cent but
did not represent easing monetary policy because the target for the federal
funds rate - the key short-term interest rate - was unchanged.
The Fed said after a board meeting yesterday: 'The reduction from 12 per
cent to 10 per cent in the reserve ratio on net transaction accounts
(current accounts) will reduce funding costs for depositories and strengthen
their balance sheets. Over time it is expected that most of these cost
savings will be passed on to depositors and borrowers.
'The reduction should strengthen the financial condition of banks and
thereby promote their access to capital markets, putting them in a better
position to extend credit.'
Just over a year ago the Fed cut reserve requirements on some deposit
accounts in a parallel move to ease the US credit crunch.
The Bush administration has been pressing for further monetary easing. Mr
Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, yesterday
repeated his view that the current low rate of inflation and the slack in
the economy left the Fed room for manoeuvre.
The Fed, however, is reluctant to cut interest rates further because it
believes the economy is likely to begin to recover by the spring.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Venezuela reform agenda is long - but time is short /
Examining the problems laid bare by the abortive coup against Perez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ABORTIVE coup two weeks ago has laid bare many of the problems facing
Venezuelan society but was not a direct result of the government's economic
reform programme, according to politicians, economists and diplomats in
Caracas.
A series of interviews suggested the need for reform in the armed forces,
the electoral and political system and improved provision of public goods
such as education and health. There was doubt about the capacity of the
government of President Carlos Andres Perez to address all these issues.
The president said in an interview that the coup of February 4 was being
planned before he took office three years ago. This version of events,
supported by others close to the armed forces, would rule out his economic
reform programme as the direct cause of the coup. However, the coup leaders
appear to have been influenced in their timing by the belief that support
for the government among the population had reached a low ebb.
This perceived lack of support - senior figures in the president's own
Democratic Action (AD) party say their polls suggest it is concentrated in
the middle classes rather than among the poor - amplified the dangers
presented by the coup attempt.
However, Mr Perez's assertion in the interview that there was little support
for the coup among the armed forces is questioned by some individuals close
to the army.
According to one of them, up to a quarter of the army's 40,000 officers and
men may have backed the coup, and as much of 80 per cent of its firepower.
That the coup failed was a consequence of ineptitude in its planning and the
rebels' failure to secure their first objective of capturing or killing the
president. The coup leaders had not gained support in the air force or in
the streets and did not take over the capital's television and radio
stations, a lapse that allowed the president to make a broadcast to the
country.
The origins of the coup lay with a group of soldiers who passed through the
Venezuelan military academy in 1974 and 1975. The rebel's ideology appears,
to a European eye, an anachronistic farrago of idealism and Latin military
machismo. Their leader, Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias, had charismatic qualities
which appealed to young officers, an increasingly disgruntled group whose
standard of living had declined dramatically under the last two governments.
According to Gen Italo del Valle Alliegro, a former defence minister and
head of the armed forces, Venezuela's military has tended to draw its
personnel from all of Venezuelan society. 'A military caste, such as in
Argentina, Ecuador, Peru and even Colombia, doesn't exist in Venezuela.'
The military's support for the democratic order appears, partly for this
reason, to have been taken for granted and the army, in common with other
institutions of state in Venezuela, left to decline.
Salaries are extraordinarily low. A general receives 70,000 bolivars
(Dollars 1,100) a month, now being increased by 30 per cent, a figure that
will do little but keep pace with last year's inflation. The perception
among some lower-ranking officers has been that many of the higher command
are raking off large sums of money.
Persistent accusations of corruption against politicians and senior military
men - and the failure of successive elected governments to improve the state
of the oil-dominated economy, particularly since the end of the 1970s oil
boom - have encouraged an ill-defined desire among some Venezuelans for a
'new beginning'.
According to one diplomat, this may be a signal that rather than
strengthening over time, democratic institutions begin to weaken. It is 34
years since the downfall of the last military dictatorship in Venezuela; the
memories of it are much fresher in Argentina, Brazil or Chile.
The government has reduced some opportunities for corruption, although even
the president admits it remains a problem. None the less, memories of his
previous administration, in power at the height of the oil boom - have not
helped his reputation as a fighter of graft.
The reputation of politicans and political parties is low. 'The government
doesn't set a very good example,' said Mr Freddy Rojas, president of
Fedecamaras, an organisation representing Venezuelan business interests. 'We
need to 'moralise' the government,' said Mr Julio Camino, an AD deputy.
Herein lies the importance of further electoral reform.
President Perez has moved some way towards this, introducing direct
elections at a local level. However, his proposals to introduce 'uninominal'
or direct voting of deputies to the national legislature have been blocked.
The current system has the parties creating 'slates' of candidates. Once on
the slate in the right area, a politician's future is thus guaranteed. His
loyalty thereafter is then to the party chiefs so that they keep him on the
slate, rather than to the people who voted for him. This system of party
patronage works right down to the lowest level. Rather as in the Soviet
Union, having a friend in the party determines, for example, whether an
individual gains access to a hospital bed.
In embarking on a Dollars 4bn programme to improve the provision of health
care, education and other aspects of social welfare, the government is
recognising that there is a lack of public investment in these areas,
although whether it will tackle chronic poor maintenance which blights the
Venezuelan public sector is another question.
Mr Robert Bottome, an economist and publisher, says the government has had
some success in cushioning the effects of its economic programme on the
poor, providing food and income support for mothers, for example, to cover
for increased costs associated with lost subsidies.
However, it had patently failed to provide goods associated with public
investment. Mr Bottome's solution, at a time of budgetary stringency, would
be to accelerate the privatisation of Venezuela's public sector enterprises
to generate funds for public investment in areas such as health. Even
excluding oil, the public sector in Venezuela accounts for 28 per cent of
gross domestic product.
The coup attempt, if not a direct result of the economic programme, can be
seen as a manifestation of a more general economic malaise. If President
Perez is going to tackle these problems, his agenda is a long one. The
events of two weeks ago suggest he may not have as much time as he thought.
A Venezuelan military court yesterday charged 33 mid-ranking army officers
with leading or helping to stage the attempted coup on February 4, Reuter
reports from Caracas. Those charged, who include alleged coup leader Lt Col
Hugo Chavez Fras, face a maximum of 28 years in prison.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Renamo rebels criticise UK troop training
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENAMO, the Mozambican rebel movement which has been fighting a 16-year
civil war, yesterday criticised Britain for training armed forces belonging
to the Frelimo government while at the same time advocating peace in the
country.
Mr Raul Domingas, the movement's chief negotiator at peace talks that have
been going on for 18 months in Rome, said in London that Britain's military
support for the Mozambique government was 'jeopardising all peace efforts'.
Britain was supporting a 'party army', he said.
The UK Foreign Office says that by the middle of next year up to 800
Mozambican soldiers will have been trained by Britain.
Mr Domingas, visiting London at the invitation of a group of Conservative
MPs, said the Rome talks had become deadlocked over the issue of the
country's constitution which Renamo says should be reviewed and multi-party
democracy institutionalised before a ceasefire could be agreed.
He claimed that the country's new constitution, which commits formerly
Marxist Mozambique to a mixed economy, freedom of the press, an independence
judiciary and multi-party elections, was designed to defend Frelimo
interests.
Mr Domingas recognised his movement had an 'image problem' but denied
reports of Renamo atrocities. Initially backed by Rhodesia and then South
Africa, Renamo has reached the negotiating table by way of a harsh guerrilla
campaign.

The state department spokesman, Mr Richard Boucher, said a Libyan hearing at

The two men, Mr Abdel Baset Ali Mohammed Al-Megrahi and Mr Al-Amin Khalifa
Fhimah, appeared before the media in a meeting room at the Libyan Supreme
Court. The appearance, which followed what Judge Ahmed al-Zawi described as
a routine investigation session, seemed designed to put to rest reports that
Libya had hidden or executed them to evade attempts to have them extradited.

<TEXT>
AFTER just one week in office Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's new prime
minister, has run headlong into a constitutional crisis over a High Court
ruling on Monday prohibiting a 14-year-old girl, allegedly raped, from
obtaining an abortion in the UK.
Opposition leaders were yesterday sharply critical of Mr Reynolds' new
attorney-general for having sought the High Court injunction against the
girl.
Mr John Bruton, leader of the Fine Gael party, said the ruling had 'created
an atmosphere of trauma, fear and uncertainty and may lead both to a failure
to report (rape) and a significantly greater incidence of abortion than
would otherwise occur'.
Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the Workers' party leader, said an appalling legal
precedent had been created which would haunt every Irish woman and girl.
'The attorney-general has displayed an appalling lack of sensitivity and
judgment'.
Mr Bobbie Molloy, a senior member of the cabinet and one of six deputies
from the Progressive Democrat (PD) party on whom Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail
party rely for support in the coalition government, said his party favoured
the abortion issue going to a referendum.
Mr Reynolds, who has five daughters, is to meet opposition leaders later
today in an effort to obtain cross-party agreement on the issue. He said it
was a tragic and distressing case of unique constitutional and 'humanitarian
importance' but went on to defend his attorney-general saying: 'I do not
believe the people of this country want or deserve a situation of nods and
winks in the application of the law. . . in the long run it would do great
harm to our country'.
Abortion is illegal under Irish law and, following a 1983 amendment to the
constitution, the state is obliged to guarantee the right to life of the
unborn, although it must also pay 'due regard to the equal right to life of
the mother'.
The anti-abortion legislation, strengthened by the High Court ruling, could
face a possible challenge through the European Court for its implications in
limiting the free movement of Irish women within the EC  - which would
contravene the Treaty of Rome - and as an issue of basic human rights.
It is estimated that several thousand Irish women have abortions in the UK
every year. They face prison sentences if found out.

FT  19 FEB 92 / BNL report hints at government links to loan scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORTHCOMING report by a special Italian Senate committee investigating the
scandal over Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of improper Iraqi loans made by the
Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) raises the
possibility of US and Italian government involvement in the affair, writes
Alan Friedman.
The draft report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times,
states that the BNL affair 'certainly cannot be considered a simple fraud
involving a few people'.
The report goes on to say there is evidence to suggest a broader scheme tied
to Iraq's military requirements and affected by 'international political
factors'.
The report, which places the affair in the context of the Iran-Iraq war of
the 1980s and US leniency towards Baghdad during this period, also laments
the lack of co-operation received from both BNL and the US Department of
Justice.
It states that the BNL loans, which helped to finance Iraq's development of
nuclear, chemical and missile projects, was not the sole undertaking of Mr
Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager.
Mr Drogoul and several others were indicted on fraud and related charges in
the US on February 28 1991.
One senior Italian investigator has told the Financial Times he believes
that US and Italian intelligence services were aware of BNL's Iraqi loans
and may have been involved. The Senate report quotes Mr Henry Gonzalez,
chairman of the US House of Representatives banking committee, expressing
scepticism that US and other intelligence services failed between 1987 and
1989 to track more than 3,000 telexes between BNL Atlanta and Iraqi
government ministries involved in military projects.
The Italian report, which is expected to be released next month, also notes
that FBI documentation from Atlanta remains incomplete.
Last year Mr Richard Thornburgh, then the US attorney-general, specifically
denied the involvement of any Reagan or Bush administration officials in the
BNL affair.

Western industry also had to work closely with the countries to build up the

Mr Huttl said the figures applied only to the 63 pressurised water reactors

RELATIONS between Ukraine and Russia suffered a fresh blow yesterday with a
squabble over ownership of military hardware.
Mr Viktor Batiuk, head of the international organisations department of the
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, said Ukraine had taken over a division of
long-range bombers in retaliation for the flight to Russia of Russian
airforce pilots in military aircraft based in Ukraine.
The republic's president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, has demanded an official
explanation from Moscow about the flight of the pilots in six Su-24 bombers.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the defence minister of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), said yesterday the aircraft had flown to a
military airbase near Smolensk and that the pilots would remain in Russia.
'A comrade is coming here so we can talk about the planes,' he said.
He made no specific comment about Ukraine's move to take over the 21 bombers
based at Uzin, even though they are part of the strategic forces which the
11 Commonwealth states agreed should remain under joint command. But he said
the fact that the unit commander had sworn allegiance to Ukraine did not
mean a section of the strategic forces now belonged to the republic.
Mr Volodymir Belashov, a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official, said Kiev's
position was that the hardware itself should belong to Ukraine but that the
nuclear weapons they carried would belong to the commonwealth.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is opposed to commonwealth leaders' decision to
allow for separate republican armies, nevertheless predicted that the former
Red Army would ultimately splinter into republican forces.
He said the break-up should be conducted in a 'civilised manner since we
call ourselves civilised people'.
Asked about reports that a military joint venture had sold military hardware
based in Ukraine, he said the armed forces had been authorised by former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to engage in commercial activity.
As commander-of-chief of the commonwealth armed forces, Marshal Shaposhnikov
said his room for decision-making was complicated by the fact that he had
eight republican masters for conventional forces and 11 for strategic
forces. But he also stressed the importance of protecting the commonwealth
'like a fragile baby' so it could survive the difficulties of its early
stages.
Turning to fighting in the Trans-Caucasus, he warned that unless Armenia and
Azerbaijan found a peaceful solution to their conflict over land, he would
press for the withdrawal of all commonwealth troops from the area. He said
he would not tolerate officers and their families becoming targets.
Reuter adds from Moscow: A top aide to President Boris Yeltsin warned
yesterday that a break-up of the commonwealth would provoke a military coup.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, Russian deputy prime minister, issued the warning to
members of his parliament in Moscow. 'I think that both politicians and
deputies realise one clear thing - the collapse of the commonwealth now is a
103 per cent (guarantee) of a military coup d'etat.'
TWO nuclear-powered submarines of the US and former Soviet navies collided
in Arctic waters off northern Russia last week, it was disclosed yesterday,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Moscow said it would protest to Washington over the incident, which it
claimed took place in Russian territorial waters.
Interfax news agency quoted a report by the navy of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) as saying the US submarine, which was identified by
US officials as the Baton Rouge, was in Russian waters illegally.
'The fact that a foreign submarine was operating secretly in our waters
can't help but provoke justified concern in the Russian leadership,' it
quoted the report as saying.
A US official travelling with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, in
Guatemala yesterday confirmed the incident but said the submarine from the
CIS had hit the Baton Rouge.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Setback for Bush as challenger beats poll hopes: Tsongas
takes New Hampshire lead for Democratic nomination
</HEADLINE>

   MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush suffered a serious setback to his re-election campaign
early today after a surprisingly strong showing by Mr Patrick Buchanan, his
right-wing challenger for the Republican party's nomination, in voting in
New Hampshire.
Exit polls indicated a narrow victory for Mr Bush, with Mr Buchanan likely
to capture more than 40 per cent of the votes in the republican primary
election in the state.
In the race for the Democratic party's nomination, former Massachusetts
Senator Paul Tsongas was heading for victory, with Governor Bill Clinton of
Arkansas expected to run a strong second.
New Hampshire was the first real test of the strength for candidates seeking
party endorsement for the US presidential election in November. The
conservative eastern state has a tradition of political upsets and voting
yesterday was no exception.
Republicans and independents in the state appeared determined - through the
Republican primary - to register a protest vote against Mr Bush, who has
come under fierce attack for failing to deal with the recession-hit economy
in the New England region.
Mr Buchanan's powerful showing would easily allow him to continue his
campaign, increasing the impression that Mr Bush is vulnerable in the
November election.
Mr Buchanan, a television commentator and former speech writer to Presidents
Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, appeared to have swung large blocks of
Republican votes with a platform of tax cuts and an 'America First' message
of protectionism and neo-isolationism.
Mr Buchanan appears ready to continue the fight next month in Georgia, South
Carolina and Texas. For Mr Bush, this raises the danger of a split within
the Republican party.
The White House early today said Mr Bush was delighted with his win and it
blamed his weak showing on the state of the New Hampshire economy. Mr Bush
said he understood 'the message of dissatisfaction' and pledged to campaign
vigorously against Mr Buchanan in the weeks ahead.
But the result was a humiliating one for an incumbent president who only six
months ago appeared invincible.
Most observers said the president needed a two-to-one margin to stave off
the challenge from Mr Buchanan who launched his campaign only ten days ago.
The unexpected Republican result threatens to overshadow the Democratic
results, which showed Mr Tsongas performing less well than expected.
Mr Tsongas, a pro-business liberal, has become an unlikely front-runner for
Democratic nomination. But leading Democrats have questioned his appeal
beyond his regional base and he needed a solid win to deter other candidates
from entering the race.
Exit polls suggested that Mr Clinton, coming a close second, had overcome
damage caused by unsubstantiated charges of adultery and draft dodging
during the Vietnam war.
Mr Clinton said early today: 'New Hampshire has made Bill Clinton the
comeback kid.'
The battle for third place in the Democratic race appeared tight between
Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. Both
needed at least a third place to continue their campaign.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UN aims to redraw border of Iraq and Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT looks certain to be given several Iraqi oil wells and part of a naval
base as a result of a United Nations border proposal.
Western diplomats in Kuwait said Baghdad would be infuriated by the
demarcation but there was little Iraq could do beyond complaining. Mutual
agreement on the new border 'is just something else which will have to wait
until the regime changes in Iraq', one diplomat said.
The United Nations Commission, established as part of the Gulf war ceasefire
agreement, is not expected to present its findings until April. However,
officials say the team has already decided on 'parameters' for the border.
These will lie several hundreds - in some cases thousands - of metres north
of what has previously been accepted as the border.
The demarcation will place in Kuwaiti territory between five and seven oil
wells in the Iraqi portion of the Rumalia oilfield. The UN experts have also
decided that the point at which the border meets the coast is virtually
certain to run through Iraq's main naval base at Umm Qasr.
The new border will anger Baghdad for a number of reasons. Iraq revived its
disputed claim to the entirety of Kuwait as justification for its August
1990 invasion. Iraq also claimed some southern portions of the Rumalia
oilfield, which dips into Kuwait, and had expressed irritation about its
limited access to the sea.
Umm Qasr has virtually been Iraq's sole serviceable port since the Shatt al
Arab waterway was closed in September 1980 by the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq
war. Iraq's president Saddam Hussein launched the war in part to gain full
sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab.
The commission's findings have been based on exhaustive research into maps
and documents held largely in British Foreign Office archives. These date
back as far as the early 1900s, when the modern states of Iraq and Kuwait
were shaped out of the crumbling Ottoman empire.
Once the decision is announced, the 120-mile (200km) common border will be
marked with border posts and will also receive formal UN sanction.
Common borders are finally a matter of bilateral consent between
neighbouring countries, but US officials say they will insist the new
boundary be respected as Iraq's southern border.
The present border is monitored by the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission,
which patrols a demilitarised zone running 10km north of the accepted border
and 5km south. Iraqi trespass over this border is considered an infringement
of the Gulf ceasefire terms.
The UN Security Council yesterday warned Iraq to start co-operating fully
with UN weapons inspectors or face grave, though unspecified, consequences,
AP reports.
The council decided in closed meetings to send Mr Rolf Ekeus, who heads the
special commission monitoring elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, to Baghdad at once to demand compliance with UN resolutions.
Diplomats say that economic sanctions could be tightened if Iraq does not
fall in line.
Iraq repeatedly has tried to conceal the extent of its nuclear weapons
programmes and other arms projects. It also has refused to co-operate in the
long-term monitoring and destruction of arms.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Maxwell lawyers risk clash with MPs by keeping silent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS acting for Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother Ian have risked a
confrontation with MPs by again refusing to answer questions sent by the
House of Commons committee investigating the raiding of Maxwell companies'
pension funds.
In a letter to the social security committee, lawyers for the brothers have
refused to allow even written responses to the MPs' questionnaire, in spite
of earlier indications that they might break their silence.
Their decision could prompt MPs to call for a full debate on the Maxwells'
apparent defiance of parliament's authority - although many MPs may be
anxious to avoid political rows so close to the general election.
Last month, when the brothers appeared before the committee, their lawyers
said they had a 'a precious constitutional right and a historic one' to
remain silent.
The Maxwells' lawyers have repeatedly referred to the possibility of their
clients facing legal action over the conduct of companies controlled by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell, and similar arguments are believed to have been used
in their letter to the committee.
They had previously indicated that written answers to the MPs questions
might be possible. However, they suggested guarantees would be required to
ensure that the information would not be made public until the risk of
prejudicing any trial had passed.
The cross-party committee is looking into ways of preventing abuse of
pension funds. It gave trustees of all the Maxwell pension funds, including
the Maxwell brothers, two weeks to reply to 70 questions on the Maxwell
pension fund raids.
The questionnaire asked how much was missing from each pension fund, when
the trustees had become aware it had gone, and how it had disappeared.
Trustees were also asked if they were party to the signing of any transfer
of funds.
About 50 questionnaires were sent out. Most have now been returned and the
responses are expected to be published by the Commons shortly.
The committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, will
meet soon to decide its response to the Maxwells' continuing refusal to
answer questions, and whether to recommend further action.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Pressure grows for cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, LISA WOOD, EMMA TUCKER and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS FOR an early cut in UK interest rates strengthened yesterday after
the pound firmed and news of a big rise in long-term unemployment increased
pressure on the government to stimulate the economy.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, also stressed the
potential problems for the UK economy when he warned that the confidence of
exporters could be damaged by a slowdown in the world economy.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's warnings coincided with news of the increase in
long-term unemployment, which was most marked in the relatively affluent
south-west, south-east and East Anglia.
Sterling rose half a pfennig against a weaker D-Mark to close last night at
DM2.885, its highest level in the European exchange rate mechanism since
mid-December. In New York it held on to its gains to finish at DM2.8855.
The pound's strength encouraged hopes that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
could cut borrowing costs while keeping the pound stable within the ERM.
The pressures on Mr Lamont intensified after the Department of Employment
said the numbers out of work for 12 months or more stood at 747,000 in
January, an increase of 93,000 on the previous three months. Long-term
unemployment is at its highest level for three years.
The unemployment figures sparked angry scenes in the House of Commons, where
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, protested that government policies
were making life a misery for hundreds of thousands of people.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the figures were 'extremely
unwelcome' but there was 'no easy way' to counter rising unemployment.
Mr Lamont has been urged by Conservative MPs and industrialists to cut
rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent for more than five months, in
an effort to stimulate the economy ahead of the election. There has been
speculation that he will do so either on or around Budget day on March 10,
possibly along with Budget measures to cut income tax.
The Bank of England is believed to have warned Mr Lamont that cutting rates
might be unsafe when the pound is well below its central ERM limit of
DM2.95.
However, the recent strengthening in the pound - from a low point in early
January of about DM2.83 - may provide the chancellor with the arguments he
needs to justify a cut in borrowing rates of perhaps half a percentage
point.
Sterling was helped by a stronger dollar, which led to more international
funds flowing out of the D-Mark and reduced the strains on the other ERM
currencies.
The dollar closed in London against the D-Mark at its highest level for
three months, at DM1.6480, for a gain of 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day. In New
York it eased to close at DM1.644.
On London money markets, the key three-month interbank rate - which shadows
base rates - eased   1/16 to close at about 10 3/16 per cent.
Speaking at an Engineering Employers' Federation dinner, Mr Leigh-Pemberton
said increased world economic uncertainty could affect export performance -
one of the few bright spots for the UK economy over the past year. In spite
of this, he remained optimistic about a recovery in the second half of the
year.
The Bank governor's fears on exports were reinforced by Sir John Banham,
director general of the Confederation of British Industry. He blamed the
'incessant politicisation' of the economy for hitting consumer confidence.
Back from a three-week tour of UK export markets, he said: 'The further you
get from London the better the UK economy looks. We are too prone to talk
ourselves down and our competitors up.'
The Employment Department said long-term unemployment was about half its
level of five years ago; among 18-24 year-olds it was at its highest since
April 1989, but this was also about half its 1987 level.
The figures showed a sharp rise in the number unemployed for more than six
months, up 136,000 to 1,338,000 in the three months to January.
Overall, the percentage of long-term jobless as a proportion of total
unemployment rose just 1 per cent to 28 per cent during the year.

FT  19 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Damages claim is validly assigned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINDEN GARDEN TRUST LTD v LENESTA SLUDGE DISPOSALS LTD AND OTHERS
ST MARTINS PROPERTY CORPORATION LTD AND ANOTHER v SIR ROBERT McALPINE &amp; SONS
LTD Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Staughton and Sir
Michael Kerr): February 13 1992 A PROHIBITION on assignment by an employer
of 'this contract' without the contractor's consent under the JCT form of
building contract invalidates assignment of the benefit of the contract
without consent, but does not prevent assignment of non-personal rights
arising under the contract, including accrued rights to substantial damages
for defective work.
The assignee can therefore claim for causes of action arising before
assignment, including those in respect of which the assignee himself
suffered loss after assignment, irrespective of whether the assignor
transferred his proprietary interest in the premises before assigning his
rights under the contract.
But if the assignment is ineffective in that no assignable rights have
accrued by assignment date, the assignor is entitled to damages as against
the contractor for loss incurred by the need to indemnify the assignee for
expenses paid in respect of the contractor's breach.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing consecutive appeals from decisions
by Judge John Lloyd QC and Judge Bowsher QC respectively, on preliminary
issues in actions by Linden Garden Trust Ltd against building contractors
Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd, Mc Laughlin &amp; Harvey plc and Ashwell
Construction Co Ltd; and by St Martins Property Corporation Ltd against
contractors Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd. An appeal by the second
plaintiffs in the second action, St Martins Property Investments Ltd, was
dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that in both the Linden and the St Martins
cases, building works were carried out under a contract with somebody who
had a proprietary interest in the building when the contract was made.
The original employers transferred their interest in the building to others,
and also purported to assign the building contracts.
The contracts, on standard Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) forms, contained a
term in clause 17 that the employers would not assign 'this contract'
without the contractor's consent. Consent was never obtained.
In the Linden case only Linden as assignees sued. In the St Martins case
both the assignors (Corporation) and the assignees (Investments) were
plaintiffs.
In both cases preliminary issues were tried.
In the Linden case Judge John Lloyd QC held that Linden as assignee was
entitled to recover damages for loss incurred by the assignors prior to
assignment, but not for loss incurred by Linden subsequent to assignment.
In the St Martins case Judge Bowsher QC held there was no valid assignment
of the benefit of the contract; and that neither the assignor nor assignee
had a valid claim for damages, other than nominal damages.
The plaintiffs in both cases appealed.
It was necessary to distinguish between novation, assignment and
sub-contracting. (a) Novation was the process by which a contract between A
and B was transformed into a contract between A and C. It could only be
achieved by agreement between all three. (b) Assignment was the transfer
from B to C of the benefit of obligations A owed to B. (c) Subcontracting
had been called vicarious performance. In clause 17 'assign this contract'
prohibited vicarious performance without consent, but did not prohibit
assignment by the employers of the benefit of the contract, or part of it.
Where a plaintiff's initial loss had subsequently been made good by someone
other than himself, the general rule was that he could recover only nominal
damages.
But there were exceptions.
In the case of damage to a building which was later sold, there was no rule
of law that the damages must necessarily be nominal.
In the Linden case the assignors had an accrued cause of action against
contractors for Pounds 22,205 by assignment date on January 14 1987. That
claim was validly assigned. Further breaches were later discovered, giving
rise to Pounds 236,000 loss. The assignors acquired a cause of action in
respect of those defects dating from 1980 and 1985.
After assignment Linden became entitled to enforce the claim. It was
immaterial that it subsequently incurred the expense of remedial work.
In the St Martins case, on March 25 1976, when Corporation executed an
assignment in favour of Investments, there was no existing cause of action.
Corporation, by the assignment, transferred to Investments the contractual
right to have the building properly constructed. Investments could sue for
breach.
On the hypothesis that Investment's claim failed, it seemed to have been
fairly within the contractors' contemplation that if they failed to
construct the building properly that would cause loss to Corporation. By
that route, substantial damages would be recovered by Corporation.
It made no practical difference which of the two companies succeeded, and
since Lord Justice Nourse and Sir Michael Kerr considered it was
Corporation's appeal which should succeed, his Lordship did not dissent from
an order to that effect.
SIR MICHAEL KERR said to speak of 'assigning a contract' was strictly a
misnomer since contractual obligations could not be assigned in the sense of
parting with the burden of performance, without the other party's consent.
An 'assignment of a contract' could only take place as a novation.
Assignment of a right to call for performance of an obligation was
permissible in relation to a non-personal contract which contained no
prohibition against assignment.
Building contracts might or might not be personal. In the present case the
question was conclusively resolved by express provision precluding
assignment of 'this contract' without consent.
The benefit of the contracts in the sense of right to call for performance
was therefore not assignable. However, on their true construction, the
contracts did not preclude assignment of benefits arising under the
contracts. There was no reason why prohibition against assignment of 'this
contract' should preclude assignment of damages claims.
In the Linden case the breaches took place before assignment. The
prohibition against assignment did not prevent assignment of the accrued
claim for damages. To that extent the assignment was effective. It made no
difference that the assignors had transferred the premises before assigning
their rights under the contract. They retained their rights against the
defendants and could assign them later.
There was no problem about Linden's right to recover Pounds 22,205 spent by
the assignors in remedying the original breach. But Linden were also prima
facie entitled to recover Pounds 236,000 they themselves spent in remedying
other breaches committed prior to assignment.
Linden's appeal should be allowed.
In the St Martins case at time of assignment no breach had accrued and no
cause of action had vested in Corporation. Corporation therefore had nothing
to assign other than the benefit of the contract, ie, the right to have the
contract performed or - loosely speaking - the contract itself.
The express prohibition against assignment precluded such assignment without
consent. The assignment was invalid.
Investment's appeal should be dismissed.
Corporation remained the contracting party vis-a-vis the contractors, with
their rights unimpaired. But, it was said, they could only recover nominal
damages.
That was not correct.
Corporation had suffered loss because they were liable to indemnify
Investments for Pounds 850,000 spent by Investments in remedying the damage
caused by the contractors' breach. If the breach had not occurred no loss
would have been suffered by anyone.
Corporation's appeal was allowed.
LORD JUSTICE NOURSE agreed with Lord Justice Staughton, but on the one point
of difference, relating to validity of the St Martins assignment, he agreed
with Sir Michael Kerr.
For Linden: Anthony Speaight (Jaques &amp; Lewis).
For McLaughlin: Justin Fenwick (Masons).
For Ashwell: Ellis Meyer (Portner and Jaskel).
For Corporation and Investments: Humphrey Lloyd QC and David Westcott
(Stephenson Harwood).

<TEXT>
The Guardian and Manchester Evening News (GMEN) has given Michael Braham,
chief executive of Broadcast Communications, a seat on the board, the first
member with specific broadcasting connections.
GMEN paid over Pounds 12m for Broadcast in 1989 - a price some regarded as a
stiff entry fee into the television world. In the harsh climate for
independent producers that has prevailed since, the budget for its Channel 4
Business Daily contract was first cut back severely, then terminated with
effect from this September.
But Braham insists the company has diversified successfully, and that its
1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 483,000 is respectable given the condition of
the rest of the sector. Last year it secured deals with five winning bidders
in the commercial television licensing round.
Braham, who is 47, and, after nine years as a newspaper reporter still
thinks of himself very much as a journalist, says GMEN is looking for
further acquisitions on the broadcast side, 'though there is no specific pot
of money set aside'. GMEN is a shareholder in Sunrise, the breakfast
television consortium, a door that Braham opened for the newspaper group.
Harry Roche, chairman and chief executive of GMEN, believes Braham and
Broadcast are poised to capitalise on an increasing demand for independent
producers. 'But we will have to wait another couple of years to see if it
was a good investment,' he acknowledges.

LONDON TRANSPORT has found a temporary solution to the problem of the
chairmanship of London Buses by appointing David Thompson, one of its
non-executive board members, to the post part-time.
The London Buses chairmanship falls vacant at the end of March because of
the retirement through ill-health of John Telford Beasley. Thompson,
60-year-old chairman of Rank Xerox (UK), will therefore find himself taking
over just days before the expected date of the general election.
Trouble is, Thompson's new job will cease to exist if the Conservatives
triumph because they have pledged to break up and privatise London Buses. If
Labour wins, the buses will stay as they are and London Transport will
quickly need to find a full-time chairman to look after them. Either way,
Thompson seems unlikely to have the job for long.

The rapid growth of research and development at GLAXO, the leading UK
pharmaceutical group, has led to the creation of new posts in R&amp;D.
Richard Sykes, R&amp;D director, gains a deputy for the first time - Goran Ando,
currently Glaxo's medical director, will take the job, which involves
co-ordinating the company's international pharmaceutical development
programme. Until three years ago, Ando, a 43-year-old Swede, worked for
Astra, his country's leading drug company.
Glaxo has recruited Joseph Feczko, an American who was responsible for
Pfizer's European clinical research, to succeed Ando as medical director.
And James Niedel, currently vice-president for research in the US, becomes
director of the Glaxo Research Institute in North Carolina. Niedel, formerly
a professor in the medical school at Duke University, joined Glaxo in 1988.
*****
Harry Groome has been named chairman of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM consumer brands
as from May 1. Previously president of SmithKline Beecham Clinical
Laboratories, Groome will replace John Hunter, who is retiring.
SmithKline Beecham's worldwide consumer brands business achieved sales in
1990 of Pounds 1.34bn. Groome, an American, has spent 14 years in consumer
brands management; the company says nothing should be read into the fact
that an American is replacing a British executive: 'Candidates are chosen
for ability, not nationality.'
*****
Olivier Doria, Mark Goodman, Gabriel Grippo, Kirby Hoeft, Michael Jensen and
Gail McDonnell have been appointed directors of MERRILL LYNCH in London.
*****
MIDLAND BANK has appointed David Markham and Roger Thompson its
representatives in Moscow and Beijing, respectively.

Yin, Peter Meurer, Peter Norris, Peter Horton, Adrian Phillips, James

FT  19 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures moved forward in thin trading, enlivened only by hopes
of a cut in interest rates, write Christopher Price and Joel Kibazo.
March opened at 2,571 and moved quickly ahead on optimism over a rate
reduction fuelled mainly by sterling's early strength against the D-Mark.
However, the lack of any further positive news caused the market to drift
away in mid-morning trading.
Wall Street failed to impact and it was not until a couple of large buyers
moved into the market in late afternoon that the index resumed its upward
movement, giving further support to the underlying market.
March traded in a range of 2,560-70, eventually closing at 2,578, up 13 on
the previous session and some 12 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 10. Turnover reached 5,221.
In LTOM, Hanson was the busiest stock option accounting for around a quarter
of the day's total turnover of 31,044 contracts. It traded 7,969 lots, with
a majority of the day's business seen in the February 200 calls, which
expire today.
This was followed by Sears, which traded a total of 1,455 contracts, and
British Aerospace, which reports full-year figures today, on 1,106
contracts.

FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as hopes of
interest rate cut recede
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES fell on futures-related selling and liquidation of holdings by
investment trust funds, and the Nikkei average shed Monday's 2.1 per cent
gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 452.95 down at 20,872.03, after a day's high of
21,294.02 and low of 20,807.40. An afternoon fall in futures prices had
prompted arbitrage unwinding.
Volume was flat at 200m shares. Declines led advances by 608 to 328, with
177 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 19.84
at 1,539.99, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index weakened 15.48 to
1,163.89.
Market participants were disappointed that foreign exchanges had ignored
Monday's intervention by the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York to support the yen against the dollar. The US unit rallied against
European currencies, and rose to Y127.17, up from Y126.93, against the yen.
The rise dampened hopes of lower interest rates and prompted profit-taking
in the equity market.
Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and investment trusts, which face
redemptions, were seen liquidating holdings. However, some analysts believe
the Bank of Japan will ease short-term money rates in the event of a sharp
downturn in the Nikkei. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said the
bottom range for the index was around 20,000.
Financial issues were lower on small-lot corporate selling ahead of the
March book closing. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y150 to Y2,680 and Fuji
Bank Y100 to Y2,000.
Steel issues retreated initially on reports of a further decline in crude
steel output for January. Crude steel output fell by a year-on-year 14.8 per
cent last month, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. However, bargain
hunting later supported NKK, which added Y6 at Y331, and Tokyo Steel, which
gained Y20 to Y2,370.
High-priced small-capital issues with low pay-out ratios advanced on hopes
that the companies will raise dividends, or announce stock splits. Keyence,
the measuring equipment maker, climbed Y200 to Y10,700 and Family Mart, the
retailer, put on Y130 to Y8,930.
After the close, Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
(TSE), said the exchange had started an investigation into the recent
trading of shares in Daito Trust Construction. The company, which made a
debut on the TSE's first section on February 5, ran into heavy selling last
week amid rumours that it had guaranteed debt for a bankrupt concern. Daito
ended Y50 off at Y8,550, compared with Y9,780, the closing price on its
first day of trading.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 85.74 to 22,556.78 in volume of 52.1m
shares. Window dressing ahead of the March book closing lifted smaller
companies. High-technology shares weakened on worries over earnings.
Roundup
A LOWER Nikkei depressed sentiment in the Pacific Rim, although most bourses
were affected by local issues. Thailand was closed.
HONG KONG, after starting strongly, lost some ground on afternoon
profit-taking. The Hang Seng index finished a net 27.91 up at 4,747.10 in
turnover of HKDollars 1.7bn.
There were rumours of covered warrant issues from Bank of East Asia and
Hopewell: the bank was unchanged at HKDollars 21.40 while the property group
rose 2.50 cents to HKDollars 4.00. Jardine Matheson put on HKDollars 1.00 to
HKDollars 44.50 as sentiment towards trading companies turned positive.
Citic Pacific, the Chinese-backed investment trust, moved ahead 15 cents or
6.6 per cent to HKDollars 2.40 as the Quok family increased its holding.
SEOUL dipped 1.92 to 638.22, with interest in securities shares preventing
the market from falling further. The Korea Securities Market Stabilisation
Fund said it would pay a 5 per cent dividend to members.
JAKARTA retreated, the index closing 4.16 down at 286.75 in volume of 7.6m
shares.
KUALA LUMPUR firmed on hopes that interest rates might be cut, although Bank
Negara, the central bank, has indicated that a reduction might not occur for
another three months. The composite index rose 9.89 to 607.67 in volume of
65m shares (41m). Telekom gained 20 cents to MDollars 11.10, with 1.8m
shares traded.
SINGAPORE retrieved most of Monday's loss. The Straits Times Industrial
index improved 6.99 to 1,501.80 in volume of 58m shares.
TAIWAN fell further on concern over the central bank's decision to restrict
foreign investment. The weighted index lost 92.57 or 1.9 per cent to
4,766.91.
MANILA eased afresh, partly on reports that a family trust wanted to
liquidate part of its holding in Ayala Corporation. The composite index was
2.53 off at 1,176.57.
AUSTRALIA's early gains were trimmed back by the fall in Tokyo. The All
Ordinaries index closed 12.5 up at 1,626.7. News Corp rose 58 cents to a
record high of ADollars 18.24, while demand for CRA pushed the price up 38
cents to ADollars 13.84.
Commonwealth Bank, which reports its interims today, firmed 3 cents to
ADollars 7.13.
NEW ZEALAND partially recovered after results from Telecom and Fletcher
Challenge. The NZSE-40 index was down a net 4.32 at 1,473.03 in turnover of
some NZDollars 18m.

FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stronger dollar pulls most
bourses higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISING dollar pulled most bourses higher yesterday, writes Our Markets
staff.
PARIS jumped to its highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2,
1990, as foreign institutions went on an afternoon buying spree of cyclical
stocks with exposure to the US. The CAC-40 index pierced the 1,900 level
with relative ease, and closed 30.14 or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,912.21 in
heavy volume of FFr2.8bn. Program buying was noted.
Saint Gobain was the day's biggest gainer, adding FFr30 or 6.1 per cent to
FFr525, and accounting for 10 per cent of the CAC-40's rise. Lafarge rose
FFr19 to FFr333. Both companies have significant dollar earnings.
Car stocks were also in demand, with Peugeot rising FFr13 to FFr718 and
Michelin adding FFr6.10 to FFr164.10.
Credit Local de France made a rare appearance in the top 20 volume list as
it continued to rise, closing FFr1.40 higher at FFr231.10 with 213,850
shares traded.
On the way down was Total, which lost FFr3.60 to FFr256.90 on concerns that
lower oil prices would erode its refining margins. Remy Cointreau fell
FFr9.70 or 5.1 per cent to FFr180.30 with only 4,600 shares traded. Dealers
said the stock had collapsed after the family withdrew its support last
week.
FRANKFURT rose by nearly 1 per cent as the strong dollar helped exporters,
and weaker oil prices industry in general; the DAX index put on 13.92 to
1,694.99 after a 5.49 rise to 691.10 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume
improved to DM6.5bn from DM4.4bn.
Among exporters, Siemens rose DM8 to DM678 and Volkswagen DM4.70 to DM343,
while Metallgesellschaft, DM6.50 higher at DM414, was also rated as a dollar
beneficiary given that its metal sales contracts are expressed in the US
currency.
Technical reasons were also advanced for the gains, including volatility
ahead of Friday's expiration of DTB futures and options contracts, buying in
advance of the Siemens' dividend payment on March 12 and reaction to recent
weakness in Metallgesellschaft, up DM15.20 over two days.
Hochtief led construction stocks higher with a DM37 rise to DM1,199. Mr
Robert Willis of Hoare Govett said that Hochtief's meeting with analysts
last Thursday in London had left some of the latter disappointed, but that
the underlying picture was strong.
AMSTERDAM closed higher, boosted by the dollar. The CBS Tendency Index rose
1.6 to 123.6. Oce, the photocopier and office systems group, which reported
an expected rise in 1991 net profits, gained Fl 3.10, or 4.4 per cent, to Fl
73.50. The market reacted positively to the rise in the 1991 dividend to Fl
2.25 from Fl 2.00.
Elsevier rose Fl 2.10 to Fl 109.50 on news that it was selling its 19 per
cent stake in a commercial television station. Unilever ended at a record
high, lifted by the strong dollar and investor confidence in the food
sector: it gained Fl 2.70 to Fl 189.90.
Begemann, the engineering group, fell as low as Fl 90.00 before closing up
Fl 1.50 at Fl 98.00, following last week's government decision not to grant
it an export licence to build submarines for Taiwan.
MILAN continued to weaken, as sell orders hit an empty market. The Comit
index fell 6.29 or 1.2 per cent to 526.89, perilously close to its chart
support level of 525, in turnover estimated at L85bn after L80.3bn.
However, leading stocks recovered after the fixing, for example Generali's
last trade was L30,300, compared with an official close of L30,160, down
L540.
Pirelli, whose capital increase started on Monday, saw its ordinary shares
fall L47 or 4.3 per cent to L1,069, while the rights lost 40 per cent.
Dealers said the shares came under pressure on signs that Mediobanca's
support operation was too thin and on rumours, described as unlikely, that a
broker connected to Pirelli was in financial trouble.
Some brokers said they were advising clients to look beyond the gloom which
obscured second-line stocks with good prospects. Mr William Cowan at Mito
Intermediazioni said he was keen on Benetton and Edison in the wake of
favourable company meetings. Benetton is likely to repeat 1991's performance
in 1992, with a profit increase of 16-17 per cent, while Edison (formerly
Selm) is expected to get a massive boost to energy capacity, and to profits,
in the next two years.
Both stocks resisted the bourse's weak trend. Benetton slipped L35 to
L12,115 and Edison, which has encountered profit-taking near L4,000, eased
L19 to L3,944.
ZURICH led on medium-capitalisation stocks as the SPI index rose 6.5 to
1,127.5. Surveillance rose SFr160 to SFr7,680, Holderbank by SFr160 to
SFr4,660 and Alusuisse by SFr19 to SFr953.
Mr Nigel Spence of Baring Securities said that Swiss blue chips had been
enjoying a rally for two months now, that people were looking for laggards
and the very brave for cyclical stocks like Holderbank, and Alussuisse in
metals.
MADRID was led higher by the banking sector: the general index rose 2.17 to
261.41. Banco Santander gained Pta130 to Pta4,710 while Tabacalera moved up
Pta110 to Pta6,440, another record high.
COPENHAGEN was not happy with the 51 per cent jump in Unidanmark's group net
loss to DKr1.7bn for 1991, and the bank fell DKr8 to DKr207 in heavy volume
of 170,000 shares. The CSE index fell 0.68 to 351.04.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARABICA COFFEE prices tumbled in New York in early trading yesterday to the
lowest levels for 17 years as traders returned from the Presidents' Day
holiday, writes David Blackwell. At midday the nearby contract was off 2.5
cents at 66.60 cents a lb.
The London robusta market also closed sharply down, with the second position
contract shedding a further Dollars 23 to a new low of Dollars 851 a tonne.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said that
most market watchers were now revising upwards their crop forecasts for this
year. Last week Colombia, the second biggest producer, revised its estimate
for the 1991-92 crop up from 16m bags (60 kg each) to 16.7m bags, another
record.
'The only thing that can push prices up now is a crop disaster or an
International Coffee Organisation accord,' said Mr Eagles.
Stop-loss selling by funds and commission houses are pushing New York into
'a bottomless pit,' one trader said. 'Eventually it will reach such a level
that producers will be forced into action.'
Earlier this month an ICO working party failed to agree on any move towards
re-establishing a coffee pact with economic clauses. The ICO export quota
system collapsed in July 1989.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese win coal price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN COAL exporters have been forced, for the second year in
succession, to accept a price cut for steam coal shipments to Japan. The new
price - for deliveries in the 1992-1993 financial year - is USDollars 38.90
a tonne, fob Australia, 95 cents down from the current year.
Australia is the key supplier of both steam coal, largely used for
electricity generation, as well as coking coal for the Japanese steel mills.
The contract was set up by Chubu Electric Power, the lead negotiator for the
Japanese utilities, with the Queensland coal producer MIM and Ulan and
Drayton of New South Wales. While the Australians may express some
disappointment with the price fall, it could have been much worse. A recent
spot tender from Scottish Power was awarded for Australian coal of this
quality at Dollars 31, fob.
These prices will flow on to some 17m tonnes of Australian coal burned in
Japanese power stations as well as setting the Australian price for Taipower
in Taiwan and South Korea's Kepco.
The one small gain claimed by one of the major steam coal producers last
week was that the price reduction was less - albeit marginally - than the
Dollars 1 cut for semi-soft coking coal. It is from excess coking coal,
however, that the steam coal market is now threatened.
This year's Japanese steel mill settlements saw a 10 per cent cut in tonnage
from Australian and Canada for hard coking coal and much bigger cuts for
soft coking coal. As these coals can readily double up as very high quality
steam coals and as many existing mines are planning extensive expansions in
output (for example, Australia's biggest producer, BHP-Utah, alone is
lifting production by 7m tonned to 38m tonnes over the next few years),
there is a danger that unbought coking coals, combined with expanding steam
coal production, could swamp the market.
UK coal imports in 1991 rose to 19.5m tonnes from 14.7m tonnes in 1990.
Steam coal imports - mainly for power generation - rose by 69 per cent to
9.2m tonnes. Of this 6.3m tonnes went into Liverpool, largely for PowerGen's
Fiddlers Ferry station (1.3m tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes the
previous year) and the Thames power stations of West Thurrock and Tilbury
(both National Power) and Kingsnorth (PowerGen).

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Law changes could dig into US
mine profits - Congressional calls for tougher controls and higher royalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US mining industry is no stranger to trouble. As long ago as December,
1983, Business Week magazine on its front page announced 'the Death of
Mining' in the States. To borrow Mark Twain's phrase, that death report was
'greatly exaggerated'.
The industry emerged leaner and fitter from the horrors of the early 1980s,
when it was decimated by low prices, and the US is still one of the world's
most important mining nations.
However, the US mining industry claims it now faces a new threat to its
future prosperity - from those wishing to change the country's 120-year-old
mining laws.
Critics suggest that these laws have enabled mining companies to make huge
profits at the expense of US taxpayers while destroying vast areas of land
with a blatant disregard for the environment.
Political pressure has built to such an extent that today there are two
bills pending in Congress that aim to change the mining laws, one introduced
by Senator Dale Bumpers and the other by Representative Nick Rahall, both
Democrats.
Mr Milt Ward, chairman of the American Mining Congress, the US industry's
main trade association, suggests that efforts to change the General Mining
Law of the United States have been fuelled by two forces. The first says it
wants the US to be 'mine free in '93' and the other is made up of 'seemingly
budget-minded legislators who think they have found a new source of federal
revenues in the form of new mining fees and royalties'.
Both Bills aim to change completely the present system under which anyone
can explore US federal lands and win ownership of parcels for as little as
Dollars 2.50 an acre after discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.
Critics point out that fossil fuels are treated differently. Coal, oil and
gas are leased to producers in exchange for royalties to the federal
government, which retains ownership of the land.
The Rahall and Bumpers proposals would give the US secretary of the interior
much greater authority over hard rock minerals.
Among other things, companies would have to submit plans for proposed
operations for the secretary's approval and these proposals would have to be
consistent with land use plans for the area. Companies would have to pay
fees to hold mining claims and restore the land when mining was finished.
The Bumpers Bill would require a royalty of at least 5 per cent of gross
revenues; the Rahall Bill would charge rents based on claim acreage.
The AMC says critics are not right to suggest that the law allows the sale
of public lands and minerals for Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 5 an acre. That is
just the administrative fee miners pay. They also pay hundreds of thousands
of dollars to develop each claim.
Neither is it true that the law does not require diligent development and
production of minerals or allows speculation and unauthorised uses of public
lands. The AMC says the law was designed to promote mineral development on
public lands and it prohibits people from using mining claims for any other
purpose.
Mining companies are particularly concerned about keeping their right to go
exploring on public lands. The present mining law gives US citizens the
right 'to enter public lands, explore for minerals and, upon their
discovery, perfect ownership of the mining location'. However, miners
already are barred from two-thirds of the 688m acres of federal government
land.
According to Representative Barbara Vucanovich, a Republican who represents
Nevada, the biggest gold mining state, to change the present law for a
system where the federal government decided on day-to-day development would
'so thoroughly alter the way minerals may be developed in the US that they
introduce considerable uncertainty to the industry'.
In order to gain some perspective the AMC commissioned an independent study
by the Denver branches of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, and
Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs, a law firm. They asked 35 US mining companies about
75 projects to see what the mining industry would look like today if the
Bills had been enacted. The researchers used a computer modelling system
developed by the US Department of Commerce to evaluate economic impact on a
regional basis, based on actual mining industry experience and assuming
present economic conditions.
The AMC has now published the study and it shows:
With the fee and royalty provisions in place, some mines would not have been
developed and other expenditures not made. This would have cost 10,000 to
30,000 jobs in mining and related activities in the west of the US;
With the legislation proposed by Senator Bumpers in place, the federal
government would have suffered a net loss of about Dollars 230m a year,
while legislation proposed by Representative Rahall would have cost the
treasury more than Dollars 125m annually in lost revenue and increased
expenditures.
Economic activity would stall in the 12 western states where most of the
mining on public lands occurs. Under Bumpers, Dollars 3.8bn worth of
economic activity would be lost to these states annually; under Rahall,
Dollars 1.5bn a year.
This loss of economic activity would not be distributed evenly. Most of the
jobs would be lost in Colorado and Nevada, where many of mining's customers,
consultants and suppliers are based.
The AMC's approach is not entirely negative and it seems willing to
compromise. To address perceived abuses of the present law, it has
identified several areas where steps could be taken to respond to public
concerns without gutting the essential components of the present law. It
says these changes would not threaten public land access, result in
unreasonable development costs or increased development litigation.
Among other things the AMC says the mining industry would not object to
paying fair market value for the surface estate of a mining claim, based on
the highest non-mining use of the land.
Neither does it object to holders of mining claims being given the option of
paying an annual holding fee or performing annual assessment work. This
would assure that claims were not held for speculative purposes.
The law reform lobbyists praise the industry for recognising that some
changes are needed but insist that its proposals fall far short of what is
needed. They say the industry's study is unlikely to sway many votes in
Congress in view of 'the clear abuses taking place under the present mining
law, such as the private acquisition of valuable federal lands for very low
patent fees.'
Nevertheless, there was some comfort for the industry when Mr Manuel Lujan,
the interior secretary, appeared at the AMC annual meeting in Washington
last week. He said the industry might well have to face some changes to
mining laws but 'the Department of the Interior will vigorously defend the
basic tenets of the 1872 Mining Law.'
He said: 'Just because a law is 120 years old doesn't mean it is
irrational'. Many laws had stood the test of time. For example, the American
Constitution had lasted even longer than US mining laws.

refineries

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN authorities said yesterday sugar refinery output had reached a
historic low but that relief was on its way in the form of imports from Cuba
and France.
Mr Vasili Severin, head of the sugar production department at the Russian
agriculture ministry, told Itar-Tass that only four of 95 refineries were
functioning because of a shortfall of raw sugar. He said refineries had last
year received only 4m tonnes of the 7.5m tonnes of raw sugar they were
supposed to receive under the state plan.
His deputy, Mr Anatoly Kholudov, said that the 'situation with sugar was
serious' and that supplies would be worse this year than last. But he added
that some more plants would be opened in March to process imported supplies.
Mr Severin said the first shipments would arrive from Cuba and France in
late February.
Prodintorg, a state trading body, said it was talking with more potential
suppliers but declined to give details.
Mr Boris Orlov, head of the government's department for agricultural
products, said that sugar refining was a seasonal process and that only a
few more refineries would be open at this time of year any way. 'The plants
usually function for three to four months starting in September.' He said
Russia required 7m tonnes of raw sugar this year, some of which would
materialise only this autumn.
He said the shortfall was caused by producers' refusal to sell raw sugar to
the state because they were waiting for prices to rise. They had sold their
raw sugar to private markets instead. Mr Alexei Ulyuakev, an adviser to the
Russian government, said earlier this week the government was considering
liberalising from next month the prices of sugar and vegetable oil, two
commodities which are in particularly short supply in the shops.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA IS TO import 500,000 bales of cotton to ease shortage and contain the
runaway rise in local cotton prices. The state-owned Cotton Corporation of
India will immediately import 200,000 bales of yarn to feed 15m hand looms.
This season's cotton crop of 11.6m bales (170 kg each) is down from the
earlier estimate of 12.2m bales at the beginning of the season in October.
Cotton prices were stable at this time last year, although the 1990-91 crop
was only 11.7m bales, because of 3m bales carried forward from the previous
year and low consumption by the textile industry.
But cotton consumption surged by 1m bales to an estimated 13m bales this
year. Prices soared late last year following the 24 per cent rupee
devaluation in July that made textile and yarn exports competitive overseas.
The government is concerned, however, over the sharp increase in yarn
exports, which has created domestic shortage, hurting labour-intensive
handloom sector and threatening politically unacceptable unemployment.
Fresh export commitments for cotton yarn have been banned, sending a signal
to the textile industry of the need to meet the yarn needs of handloom
weavers. The shortage should to ease when corporation begins importing
cotton.
Mr. MB Lal, the corporation's chairman, says, overseas cotton is 20 per cent
cheaper on landed-cost basis.

Nickel prices were in retreat on the LME yesterday in a reaction to Monday's
advance. Producer-based selling put pressure on the market: recent fund
buying was absent. Stocks rose 540 tonnes to 19,284, their highest since
August 1984. Copper edged higher in line with New York, aided by underlying
physical interest. This helped the three-month price to move above
resistance at Dollars 2,230 a tonne. New York sugar prices were well ahead
at midday. Analysts cited commission house and fund short covering ahead of
March's expiration. The majority of speculative players have been short for
the past few weeks. London cocoa prices advanced Pounds 18 a tonne in early
trading on news of rioting in the Ivory Coast capital Abidjan. But prices
eased in the afternoon to close unchanged. On the London bullion market
silver was in retreat following a sharp early fall on Comex. Dealers said
silver could move to 400 cents again if it broached support at 405 cents a
troy ounce. London's freight futures continued to retreat, although closing
off earlier lows. A further sharp fall in the Baltic Freight Index by 17
points to 1,282 reflected the vessel surplus in nearly all cash market
sectors and size classes, dealers said.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines 'opportunity' for
miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINES offered some of the world's best exploration opportunities
because there had been so little mineral exploration in the past decade,
said Mr Tony Robbins, a Western Mining Corporation exploration manager,
yesterday.
Even though the country was very well-endowed with copper, gold and other
minerals, it had been left behind when the rest of the world was
experiencing a gold-driven exploration boom. This presented mining companies
with 'a window of opportunity which no longer exists in many parts of the
world'.
The Philippines had missed out mainly because of the political instability
associated with President Marcos's removal from power.
Mr Robbins said there had been no systematic, grass roots exploration since
the early 1970s since when significant advances had been made in technology.
He was speaking at a seminar in London on to mining opportunities in the
Philippines and organised by the United Nations' Department of Technical
Co-operation for Development, and Mining Journal.
Mr Robbins said that, despite the lack of recent exploration activity, the
country remained among the world's big metals producers, ranking eighth in
gold, tenth in copper and sixth in chromite. The country also had deposits
of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, platinum, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt,
aluminium and mercury.
However, although Western Mining was exploring in the Philippines in
preference to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, there were disadvantages. Most
important was that it was enshrined in the constitution that Filipino
companies had to be 60 per cent domestically-owned. 'The result is that in
the Philippines the foreign investor has to carry all the risk and all the
costs and only receive 40 per cent of the prize if the exploration is
successful,' he said.
However, a strong body of responsible opinion in the country recognised the
detrimental impact of the ownership rule and he hoped the new government
would change it after the May elections.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Blots on the cityscape - A
series on urban air quality by examining the cost and cures of pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmental debate about air pollution focuses increasingly on global
issues, notably the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. But for hundreds
of millions of people living in the world's most densely populated cities,
local air quality is a much more immediate problem.
Although dirty urban air undoubtedly causes widespread ill health - with
lung damage the most important consequence - there is remarkably little
epidemiological evidence to show the medical effects of pollution. Few
episodes are so obviously tragic as the great London fog of December 1952,
which is estimated to have killed 4,000 people through lung and heart
disease. But some experts believe that air pollution is partly responsible
for the rising incidence of asthma in the industrialised world.
North American studies have recently demonstrated a link between less severe
air pollution and respiratory illness, says Stephen Holgate, professor of
immunopharmacology at Southampton University, who is chairing a UK
government committee investigating the medical consequences of air
pollution. There has been almost no research in Britain. From the scanty
evidence, the Holgate committee is trying to disentangle the effect of
different pollutants and then discover how they interact.
Besides causing death and disease, dirty air damages buildings. Acid
pollutants eat away the stonework of historic monuments and soot lays down a
layer of dust and grime. But 'attempts to quantify the economic damage are
extremely difficult,' says Fiona Weir, air pollution specialist with the
environmental group Friends of the Earth.
A 'back of the envelope' calculation by the World Bank put the economic cost
of pollution in Mexico City - widely regarded as the conurbation with the
world's dirtiest air - at Dollars 1.1bn a year.
The nature of urban pollution has changed radically during this century. In
Europe and North America the main source until the 1950s was sulphurous
fumes and soot spewed out by coal burning in homes, factories and power
stations. Then clean air legislation, combined with the movement of
smokestack industries away from big cities, led to a great improvement in
air quality.
Today's pollution is largely a consequence of increasing road traffic.
Vehicle exhausts emit carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and
hydrocarbons. In sunshine the NOx and hydrocarbons are involved in
photochemical reactions which form secondary pollutants, notably ozone.
In its proper place in the stratosphere, 20km above us, ozone is a vital
shield against damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun. But at surface
level ozone is a corrosive and unwanted pollutant, irritating the lungs of
anyone who breathes it.
Wintertime pollution in temperate regions has a different chemical
composition from the dry photochemical smogs of summer. Instead of ozone
there may be an acid fog such as London suffered last December, when
droplets of dilute nitric and sulphuric acid filled the air.
In Third World cities too, the cocktail of pollutants includes a large
contribution from motor vehicles, many with ancient ill-tuned engines which
would be banned in developed countries because of their filthy exhaust. At
the same time urban factories - often with rudimentary emission controls -
pour soot, sulphur dioxide, heavy metals and other substances into the air.
The severity of local pollution depends not only on the dirt discharged into
the atmosphere but also on local geography and climate. Quiet anticyclonic
weather, with little wind to blow in clean air, can cause trouble. The worst
conditions come when there is an atmospheric 'inversion' - a rise in
temperature with altitude instead of the normal fall. This keeps a lid on
ground-level pollution and can allow very high levels of pollutants to build
up.
Any long-term policy to tackle urban pollution has to focus on vehicle
exhaust emissions. Possible measures fall into two categories: making each
vehicle run more cleanly, and reducing the total volume of traffic.
The US has put its faith in the autocatalyst or catalytic converter as the
chief weapon for cleaning up cars. The current generation of 'three-way
cats' can reduce emissions of three important pollutants - NOx, hydrocarbons
and carbon monoxide - by 90 per cent.
The cat is a unit about the size of a small silencer fitted inside the
exhaust system. It includes a honeycomb of ceramic or metal which is coated
with small amounts of the precious metals platinum, palladium and rhodium.
These convert the pollutants into less harmful forms: carbon dioxide,
nitrogen and water. The catalyst is poisoned by lead and therefore can only
be used in cars running on unleaded petrol.
The European Community is introducing emission standards similar to those in
force in the US; they will require all new cars sold in the EC from the end
of 1992 to be fitted with a three-way cat. But already the US is moving to
more stringent controls. California, home of the original Los Angeles smog,
is leading the way with a schedule that calls for a progressive reduction in
emissions over the next decade; and several states in the industrial
north-east expect to follow suit.
Catalyst manufacturers are developing more efficient cats to meet the
forthcoming standards, says Tim Truex, who is in charge of autocatalyst
research at Johnson Matthey Technology Centre in the UK. Two important
developments are in prospect: electrically heated cats that start working as
soon as the engine starts, unlike current models which allow pollutants to
pass through almost unimpeded for half a minute or so after a cold start;
and new catalysts to work with fuel-efficient 'lean burn' engines.
However, critics say US policy is not a good model for other countries,
because it has relied too much on the cat to reduce vehicle pollution and
has done little to discourage driving. They point out that smog remains a
serious problem in Los Angeles and several other American cities, after
almost 20 years of increasingly stringent emission controls.
'The lesson from the US is that you need not only good technical standards
to reduce emissions but also a transport policy to control the number of
cars on the road,' says Fiona Weir of Friends of the Earth. The prospect for
polluted European cities such as London is that air quality will improve
temporarily during the 1990s as catalytic converters are introduced widely -
and will then deteriorate again if the volume of traffic is allowed to go on
increasing.
In the end, therefore, urban air quality may depend most of all on measures
to discourage driving. These could include improved public transport,
financial penalties on cars through road pricing schemes, and bans on
non-essential traffic in city centres.
Everyone has a stake in improving urban air quality, even people in rural
isolation hundreds of miles from the nearest city, because global pollution
is an accumulation of local pollution. The air at the South Pole is never as
polluted as Los Angeles on a clean day, but urban smog is beginning to leave
smudges in the most pristine parts of the world.
The series will continue next week by focusing on the particular problems of
Santiago.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Time is up for plastics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 6m items of large electronic equipment which have reached the end of
their use will be disposed of this year in the UK by dumping them in
landfill sites. They include computers, photocopiers, TVs, video recorders
and microwave cookers.
But most of them contain untapped wealth in the form of metals and plastics
which can be recycled. The material produced in Britain alone is worth about
Pounds 50m a year and if re-used it would save industry Pounds 10m a year.
The problem has been examined by the Centre for Exploitation of Science and
Technology (Cest), an independent organisation funded by 19 companies and
working with government and higher education.
Cest has established a technical advisory group to encourage industry to
develop solutions to recycling these materials. It includes large companies
like Dow and IBM and local authorities and the Departments of the
Environment and Trade and Industry.
The report says there is a market for reclaimed metal but the market for
recycled plastics has only been for inferior applications. This is because
the manufacturers of plastics, electronic equipment and waste processors
have spent little effort to use high-quality plastics that could be
recycled.
Modular construction of equipment makes dismantling much easier. Loewe, the
German TV manufacturer, makes televisions which divide easily into four main
sections.
Various methods to encourage recycling are examined in the report. These
include levies on electronic equipment and plastics to finance recycling.
National governments and the EC should co-operate with industry to implement
a recycling policy, it says. If manufacturers fail to respond to
environmental pressures they will lose out because consumers will buy
products from companies with a better environmental message.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Bridging the lifecycle gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are facing increasing demands to provide comprehensive information
on the environmental impact of their products. But considerable sums could
be wasted because the methods used to measure these impacts are so
inadequate.
The data are generated by a method called lifecycle analysis (LCA), which
involves a laborious collection of information on the environmental impact
of the product - from its manufacture through to its disposal.
The Landbank Consultancy, an environmental advisory group, estimates that a
simple inventory to compare the performance of, say, three types of
packaging, would cost between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 25,000. More complex
analysis could cost Pounds 120,000.
Demands for lifecycle information are coming from two sources. First, the
market for goods with a low environmental impact is growing as consumers,
companies and governments call for 'green' products. Second, new
regulations, such as the imminent Eco labelling scheme, will force companies
to conduct LCAs if they wish to earn labels.
Companies producing certain commodity products, such as glass and cardboard,
could possibly spread the cost of LCAs by pooling their resources and
financing the research through their trade associations.
But this opportunity is only available to a few because lifecycle
information is becoming competitive. This is especially true for
end-products, such as those stocked by retailers, but it affects components
too.
Those companies which have products with low environmental impact and, more
important, the data to back up their claims, are well placed to win market
share.
This is already happening in the chemicals industry because users are
demanding the information to help them redesign their manufacturing
processes.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the household products company, has been one of the early
pioneers of LCAs. It has used the information to reduce the impact of its
products on the environment and to back up claims in its sales literature.
David Hammond, P&amp;G's environment affairs manager, says the real value of the
information lies in the way it is used. 'The competitiveness of LCAs is
related to the subsequent ingenuity in reducing the environmental impact of
the product,' he says.
Martin Houldin of consultants KPMG says a distinction has to be drawn
between the information produced by LCAs and the analysis done on the data.
'There is no reason why a lot of the raw data can't be shared, but the value
of the information produced by LCAs is in the judgments made about impact,'
he says.
It is the need for such judgments - and the lack of standard guidelines on
how to make them - that is causing headaches for those involved. A typical
difficulty is how to weight a product's impact on the ozone layer against
its contribution to global warming. 'There is no whizzo way of looking at
all the impacts and then making a judgment,' says Houldin.
Now two initiatives are under way to try to create consensus on what would
constitute universally acceptable terms of judgment.
The Confederation of British Industry is co-ordinating an effort to bring
environmentalists, academics and business people together to develop
independent evaluation techniques.
Separately, companies such as Shell, Unilever, BASF, P&amp;G and Enichem are
supporting the Society for the Promotion of Lifecycle Development. The
society has been set up by industry to encourage debate on how to improve
LCAs.
Unless these initiatives lead to a way of balancing environmental judgments,
companies will be short changed when paying for LCAs.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkey plans Eurodollar
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY plans to return to the international bond market for the first time
since the Gulf war by launching a Dollars 150m bond issue in the next two to
three weeks.
Mrs Gulnur Ucok, head of capital markets at the central bank, said in London
yesterday that the country faced a 'severe credit crunch' during the Gulf
war, but planned to launch a Dollars 1bn international borrowing programme
this year. The country's last Eurodollar issue was in March 1990, five
months before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Although it has since borrowed in the
German and Japanese domestic bond markets, a Eurodollar deal is seen as
vital to attract a wide range of international investors.
In addition to the planned five-year Eurodollar deal, which will have an
investor put option after three years, Turkey is also planning a yankee bond
issue in the US domestic bond market.
To facilitate US borrowings, a rating is being sought from Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US credit rating agency. A long-term debt rating of around
triple-B, the lowest investment-grade category, is anticipated.
Before the Gulf war, Turkey's new Eurodollar bond issues were trading at
yield spreads as low as 220 basis points over US government bonds. However,
yield spreads for three-year maturities have since widened to around 270
basis points.
Mrs Ucok said the new issue, lead-managed by Bankers Trust International,
would be priced to reflect current secondary market levels rather than the
cost of funds available when Turkey last tapped the market.
Turkey has Dollars 45bn foreign debt outstanding but this is amply covered
by foreign currency earnings. Interest payments and principle repayments
amounted to Dollars 7.5bn last year, against foreign exchange earnings of
Dollars 28.79bn.
This year, debt service payments will peak at Dollars 6.89bn, before
declining to the end of the decade.

CREDIT Suisse First Boston Budapest, the Hungarian subsidiary of the US
investment bank, this week completed a bond issue which highlights the
increasing potential of local capital markets for financing western-led
investment.
CSFB Budapest placed Ft500m (Dollars 6.5m) of bonds on its own account with
Hungarian financial institutions in the second issue of private corporate
debt since the disintegration of communism.
With a four-year maturity and a step-down coupon averaging 27 per cent,
CSFB's issue was similar in structure to the one it lead-managed on behalf
of McDonald's Hungarian subsidiary. The two issues have launched the market,
said Mr Janos Bartha, chief executive of CSFB Budapest. He said CSFB,
confident of the ability to place and the existence of issuers, was working
on further bond issues for clients.
The CSFB Budapest move closely followed the announcement by Samsung
Electronics Hungary, a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate, of plans
for a share flotation on to Budapest's fledgling stock exchange. Analysts
say the cases show the attractions to western companies based in Hungary of
issuing securities over bank borrowing at interest rates of over 30 per
cent.
Meanwhile, preliminary selection of bids for Malev, the Hungarian national
airline which CSFB is mandated to privatise, is gearing up this week.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Spain prepares for largest Euroyen deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN was last night preparing the ground for a Y125bn issue in the
international bond market, with leading underwriting firms competing
fiercely for the mandate.
The proposed 10-year deal, which would be the largest Euroyen bond issue, is
expected to be launched either this morning or tomorrow, if market
conditions are favourable.
The current Euroyen benchmark at the 10-year maturity is the World Bank's
Y50bn issue, which was yesterday trading at a yield of 5.61 per cent.
Belgium, which has a AA-1 credit rating, one notch higher than Spain, also
has a Y50bn deal outstanding, trading at 5.75 per cent. Syndicate officials
said yesterday that bonds issued by Spain should be priced to yield slightly
more than Belgian ones, although the size and liquidity of the proposed
issue could attract investors into the deal.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank launched its anticipated Dollars
500m seven-year bond issue.
The mandate to lead-manage the deal was won by Credit Suisse First Boston
after a competitive bidding process.
The firm agreed to underwrite the deal at a yield spread of 5.2 basis points
more than US Treasury bonds, at the aggressive end of market expectations.
In common with other recent EIB issues, the deal was not syndicated in the
usual way. Just six other firms participated in the transaction at the
invitation of the lead.
The fees paid to underwriters by the EIB remained undisclosed, suggesting
that the borrower had achieved a very low cost of funds by shaving
underwriting costs to a minimum.
Three of the participants were Italian banks, underlining that the bulk of
the paper will be placed in Italy, where bonds issued by the EIB are
exempted from withholding tax.
The non-Italian firms in the deal reported some buying from Far Eastern and
other institutional investors, but conceded that the appetite of Italian
investors was crucial to the success of the deal at such a tight yield
spread.
By the close, the 7 1/8 per cent bonds were trading at 99.70 bid, from a
fixed re-offer price of 99.786, where the yield spread was around 6 basis
points over Treasury bonds.

<TEXT>
GRUPO GERDAU, Brazil's largest privately-owned steel producer and its 13th
largest privately-owned group, has bought a second state-owned steel
company, less than three months after buying the first.
It bought Acos Finos Piratini at a privatisation auction last week for
Dollars 105m, 153 per cent over the minimum asking price.
The sale was the seventh in President Fernando Collor de Mello's
privatisation programme, which began last October. In November, Gerdau
purchased the Cosinor ironworks for Dollars 14.1m.
With the purchase of Acos Finos Piratini, Gerdau gets a foothold in the
specialised steel sector. In 1991, the newly-privatised company sold about
140,000 tons of finished products, about 30 per cent of which was exported.
Gerdau estimates the company's productive capacity at about 200,000 tons a
year.
Gerdau outbid Eletrometal, a Sao Paulo producer of specialised steel, to
take control of 88.9 per cent of Acos Finos Piratini.
The company is located in Rio Grande do Sul, in the same state as the parent
group's headquarters.
Several auctions are scheduled for the coming months. The next is due today
when Goiasfertil, a producer of phosphate, goes on the block. Petrochemical
groups, Petroflex and Copesul, go up for sale on March 18 and May 15
respectively.

move to Porsche

<TEXT>
MR Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's research and development director and widely seen
as potential successor to Mr Eberhard von Kunheim, management board
chairman, yesterday refused to comment on a flurry of press reports that he
was to become management board chairman of Porsche, the troubled German
sports car maker.
He is expected to issue a statement later this week.
A spokesman for Stuttgart-based Porsche last night denied a Stuttgarter
Zeitung report that a decision to appoint Mr Reitzle (pictured right) to
succeed Mr Arno Bohn, whose contract with Porsche has almost a year to run,
would be made at a meeting of Porsche's supervisory board tomorrow. The
spokesman confirmed that the meeting was scheduled.
BMW last night would not confirm nor deny the report. Speculation about both
men's future has been spreading through the German media since the weekend.
However, one of the latest reports, carried by Reuter last night, said Dr
Reitzle had received 'an interesting offer' from Porsche, but had decided to
remain with BMW after a meeting of BMW's management board yesterday.
Speculation about the possible change of management board leadership has
ranged from a power battle over the direction of the company between the
controlling Piech and Porsche families, and the possibility that such a move
by Dr Reitzle could mark a closer long-term relationship between BMW and
Porsche.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: AECI limits fall in earnings to
21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN improved performance in the second half allowed AECI, South Africa's
largest non-fuel chemicals group, to limit the fall in earnings to 21 per
cent in 1991. This followed a disastrous first half when earnings dropped by
56 per cent.
Although trading conditions remained difficult, the group managed to double
the level of trading income achieved in the first half. Mr Mike Sander,
managing director, said higher production rates, tight control of fixed
costs and enhanced productivity had improved margins, while speciality
businesses had performed better.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to R5.28bn (Dollars 1.44bn), but net trading
income was 19 per cent down at R402m. Attributable income was 21.4 per cent
lower at R187m. Earnings per ordinary share dropped by a similar amount to
121 cents, but this was a considerable improvement over the predictions of
some analysts who thought earnings would drop under 100 cents per share. The
total dividend for the year was cut by 33 per cent to 58 cents per share.
Mr Sander said that although the normal seasonal improvement in sales had
been evident in some areas, market demand had declined further in the
automotive and building sectors. He said low world economic growth had
caused prices for products such as PVC and polyethylene to remain weak.
Export volumes had increased significantly with revenues up by 27 per cent
over 1990.
Although AECI appears to have turned the corner, the market is still taking
a cautious view of the company. Its current share price of R9.30 is a long
way off the R22.50 which it scaled in the late 1980s, and its p/e ratio of
8.2 is below the sectoral average.
Mr Sander said prospects for a recovery were dependent largely on the timing
and extent of a recovery in the domestic economy. He said that provided this
was not impeded by factors such as the continuing world recession, adverse
political developments, or the serious drought gripping South Africa, a
moderate improvement in earnings could be expected.

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge, New Zealand's largest industrial company, has announced
a 59.7 per cent fall in net profits, to NZDollars 151.6m (USDollars 82.4m),
for the six months to December.
It said difficult trading conditions had forced it to cut NZDollars 100m
from its forecast profits of NZDollars 400m for the full year.
The company also said it was cutting its dividend from 11.5 cents a share to
7 cents, a move that was foreshadowed at the December annual meeting.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said prices in a number of areas appeared
to have bottomed out.
He said he could more confidently forecast substantial cyclical earnings
recoveries over the next few years.
Pulp and paper operations lost NZDollars 79.4m, compared with a profit of
NZDollars 75.8m for the same period of last year. Earnings from energy and
gas remained strong.
Oil and gas earned NZDollars 149.7m against NZ143.6m, and petrochemicals
rose to NZDollars 46m from Dollars NZ37.4m.
The primary sector earned NZDollars 50.8m compared with NZDollars 36.2m,
including Dollars NZ47.4m from the Rural Bank.
Harsh conditions in the international building sector saw earnings fall to
NZDollars 17m from NZDollars 62.5m.
Mr Fletcher said the company achieved operating records at its plants,
helped by recent upgrades and lower costs due to restructuring.
Extraordinary losses totalled NZDollars 31.8m compared with gains of
NZDollars 51.8m. The group sold NZDollars 500m worth of assets in the period
and is on target to sell NZDollars 750m in the full year. Sales of NZDollars
352m were included in the latest results, including forestry-related assets
in British Colombia and Quebec.
The sale of its Petrochem ammonia urea plant, for NZDollars 45.5m, will be
completed in the second half.
Turnover was NZDollars 6.28bn, down from NZDollars 6.78m. Operating earnings
fell to NZDollars 433.4m from NZDollars 654m and investment earnings
advanced to NZDollars 14.8m from NZDollars 8.9m, while funding costs were
cut to NZDollars 330.8m from NZDollars 335.6m.
Tax took NZDollars 56.2m compared with NZDollars 900,000.
Ordinary shareholders' funds advanced to NZDollars 5.84bn from NZ5bn.
Earnings per share fell to 8.6 cents from 27.9 cents, while net asset per
share rose to NZDollars 3.80 from NZDollars 3.64.

FAY, Richwhite, a New Zealand investment bank, yesterday reported net
profits of NZDollars 7.1m (USDollars 3.8m) for the first six months to
December, compared with NZDollars 6.6m for the nine months ended December
1990, AP-DJ reports from Auckland.
The bank has changed its year end to June 30 from March 31.
Revenue from Fay, Richwhite's banking operations in the first half totalled
NZDollars 40m compared with NZDollars 50m in the earlier nine months.
Profits from those operations came to NZDollars 7.7m against NZDollars 15m.
Fay, Richwhite received a further NZDollars 9.4m in dividends from it 27 per
cent in Bank of New Zealand, a commercial bank. However, the interest costs
associated with holding that stake amounted to NZDollars 13m, and the
investment in BNZ therefore generated a net loss of NZDollars 3.8m.
However, the group's net profits include an equity-accounted gain of
NZDollars 3.1m, representing the company's share of BNZ's profits.
Mr David Richwhite, joint managing director, said the first-half results
were 'pleasing' considering the challenging market conditions.
All the investment bank's divisions contributed to earnings, he said.
The holding costs of the company's stake in BNZ were declining, reflecting
the positive impact of falling domestic interest rates and increasing
dividends from BNZ.
Although the company did not declare a dividend for the first half, Mr
Richwhite said he was confident that profits from investment banking and the
improving results from BNZ would enable it to issue a dividend for the full
fiscal year ending June 30.

COLD Storage, the Singapore supermarket operator and food retailer,
yesterday reported a 27 per cent fall in net profits, to SDollars 8m
(USDollars 4.9m) for the first half to December from SDollars 10.9m a year
earlier. Sales were flat at SDollars 218.6m compared with SDollars 221.7m,
AP-DJ reports from Singapore.
The directors said pre-tax profits fell 37 per cent to SDollars 12.1m from
SDollars 19.3m because the previous period included SDollars 19.6m in profit
from subsidiaries which had since been deconsolidated.
For the ongoing activities, pre-tax profits fell 3.1 per cent to SDollars
12.1m from SDollars 12.5m, and turnover also rose 8.2 per cent to SDollars
218.6m from SDollars 202.1m.
Earnings per share fell 27 per cent to 6.39 cents from 8.78 cent, while the
dividend is being raised to 3.25 cents a share from 3 cents.
The directors said that while performance of the group's retail, wholesale
distribution and trading, and ice and storage businesses was satisfactory,
its beverage operations continued to face difficulties. Beverage
manufacturing was closed down last month, they added.
They are expecting the second half to be better than last year's, although
they are predicting increasingly competitive trading conditions. They are
also expecting interest income to 'be impacted by lower interest rates'.

<TEXT>
LIZ CLAIBORNE, the US fashion designer and clothing manufacturer, yesterday
announced static fourth-quarter profits after taking a Dollars 3.4m charge
relating to R. H. Macy, the New York-based department store chain which
filed for bankruptcy last month.
Liz Claiborne, reckoned to be one of Macy's largest suppliers, on January 30
announced it would take a charge in the fourth quarter.
Macy's problems came to a head after Christmas when it delayed payments to
suppliers. In its January statement, Liz Claiborne said it planned to resume
shipping to Macy's given that interim financing arrangements for the
retailer had been agreed by the bankruptcy courts, and it remained a 'strong
supporter' of Macy's management.
After the charge, the company reported profits for the fourth quarter of
Dollars 56.5m after tax, compared with Dollars 55.7m a year earlier, on
sales of Dollars 530.7m (Dollars 468.2). This translated into earnings per
share of 66 cents (65 cents). The Macy's-related charge lopped off 0.04
cents.
For the year, Claiborne reported a net profit of Dollars 222.7m, compared
with Dollars 205.8m in 1990. Sales were Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.73bn.
The company acknowledged the retail climate had been 'difficult and
unsettled', but said it was pleased with its progress in the light of that.
The Limited, the fashion retailer and once one of the stars of the sector,
reported an extremely modest 1.2 per cent improvement in full-year profits
to February 1, of Dollars 403.3m after tax.
In the previous 12 months, the company - which takes in the Victoria's
Secret brands and Penhaligon's perfumes - made Dollars 398.4m. Sales rose by
17 per cent to Dollars 6.15bn.
In the fourth quarter, net profits advanced from Dollars 172.2m to Dollars
200.3m, on sales of Dollars 2.05bn (Dollars 1.74m).

THE Unidanmark banking group plunged even more heavily into loss last year
after making substantial increases in loss provisions on building and
property in the UK, the US and Denmark.
Net losses increased to DKr1.65bn (Dollars 262m) from DKr1.09bn in 1990
after bad loss provisions increased to DKr5.4bn, against DKr3.5bn, which was
about 3.0 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees.
The group's capital ratio was 10.4 per cent, but it was achieved partly by
slimming the balance sheet by DKr16.4bn to DKr263.1bn. The bank plans to
raise at least DKr1bn in supplementary loan capital through a bond issue
next week.
Despite two years with substantial losses, the bank plans to pay an
unchanged dividend of DKr10 a share.
Mr Steen Rasmussen, chief executive, said the bank had topped up provisions
in the building and property sector, as well as on loans to the former
Soviet Union (which are now fully covered by provisions) in order that the
bank could be certain that provisions will now decline.
He said the bank performed well on its ordinary business, with profit before
expenses rising by DKr1.42bn to DKr11.20bn. Expenses were also under
control, rising by 2.5 per cent to DKr6.58bn.

VNU, the Dutch publishing group, is to double its holding in the
Dutch-language commercial television station RTL4 by acquiring a 19 per cent
stake held by fellow publisher Elsevier for Fl 87m (Dollars 47m).
The deal will give VNU a 38 per cent shareholding and make it the second
largest shareholder in RTL4 after Luxembourg television group CLT, which
owns 40 per cent. Other shareholders include banks, private investors and
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, which holds 2 per cent.
As part of the agreement, Elsevier has said that it will refrain from
commercial broadcasting aimed at the Dutch market for the next three years,
with the exception of regional and local broadcasting.
VNU and Elsevier hold their stakes in RTL4, currently the only Dutch
commercial station, through a joint venture company, European Media
Investors, which will now be owned solely by VNU.
Besides RTL4, which broadcasts to the Netherlands from Luxembourg to get
around Dutch media laws, VNU also has an 11 per cent stake in Belgium's
Flemish-language commercial station VTM.

<TEXT>
DEN norske Bank, the troubled Norwegian bank, yesterday unveiled a
three-fold increase in net losses, before extraordinary items, for 1991.
It also warned that non-performing loans would not show a rapid decline
until the Norwegian economy improves.
Net losses for last year totalled NKr4.32bn (Dollars 679m). DnB said that
operating profit, before tax and credit losses, was halved to NKr1.27bn,
against NKr2.54bn in 1990. Credit losses swelled by NKr1.77bn to NKr5.58bn.
DnB said that the net volume of non-performing loans was NKr8.58bn at the
end of 1991 but that accumulated provisions for estimated losses totalled
about NKr8.9bn.
'The adverse trend in the Norwegian economy in the last part of 1991 made it
necessary to increase loan-loss provisions substantially,' explained Mr Finn
Hvistendahl, DnB president.
Mr Hvistendahl added that income on 'healthy' loans was acceptable.
Nevertheless, net interest income slipped to NKr4.66bn from NKr4.95bn in
1990.
He declined to give a forecast for the development of the bank in 1992.
Local analysts say there is unlikely to be any significant improvement this
year.
One bright note is that DnB managed to reduce costs to NKr4.96bn last year
from NKr5.59bn in 1990.
'Since 1988, costs have been pared by NKr1.09bn, with staff reductions of
2,466 full-time positions. The bank is now considerably more cost
efficient,' Mr Hvistendahl said.
'The accounts show that income on healthy loans is acceptable,' he said. The
bank's income on trading in foreign exchange and treasury products as well
as income generated in some of the bank's domestic subsidiaries is
considered satisfactory as well, the group said.
The recent restructuring of the group's operations into separate divisions
for private customers and medium-sized corporate clients will contribute to
improved profitability, Hvistendahl said.
In a complex deal orchestrated by the state, DnB's biggest shareholder, last
December the bank acquired Realkreditt, a financially-troubled mortgage
group. Realkreditt will be consolidated into the bank's accounts this year.
Realkreditt yesterday announced 1991 net losses, before extraordinary items,
of NKr1.28bn from NKr165.8m in 1990. Realkreditt posted an operating loss,
after credit losses, of NKr762.7m, up from 1990's operating loss of
NKr496.2m. Credit losses rose by NKr45m to NKr624m. Realkreditt explained
that last year's figures were strongly influenced by restructuring costs -
put at NKr163m - and a continued fall in the value of property values which
forced it to write down significantly the value of its property portfolio.

despite reverse

<TEXT>
ABITIBI-PRICE, the newsprint and paper producer controlled by Toronto's
Reichmann family, is continuing to pay a dividend despite posting a
substantial loss for the second year in a row.
The Reichmanns own 82 per cent of Abitibi, which cut its annual dividend
from CDollars 1 to 50 cents a share in 1990.
The decision to pay the 12.5 cents-per-share quarterly dividend is widely
interpreted as evidence of the financial strains being felt by the
Reichmanns' heavy exposure to the depressed real estate market through their
holding company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, whose interests include
London's Canary Wharf project.
Abitibi contributed about CDollars 28.4m (USDollars 24.40m) in common-share
dividends to O&amp;Y last year.
Last year's net loss at Abitibi was CDollars 75.9m, or CDollars 1.12 a
share, compared with a CDollars 50.4m, or 76 cents, loss in 1990. The
figures include charges of CDollars 44.4m last year and CDollars 54.1m in
1990 for restructuring to cope with the severe downturn in the Canadian
forest products industry.
Sales fell to CDollars 2.8bn from CDollars 3.1bn, while fourth-quarter sales
tumbled by 23 per cent to CDollars 652m as the newsprint market continued to
be hit by weak demand and intense price competition. The fourth-quarter net
loss deepened to CDollars 48.1m from CDollars 34.7m last time.
Abitibi said the outlook for newsprint remained poor in 1992 and further
cost-cutting measures would be required. The company is expected to announce
the closure of at least one of its eastern Canadian newsprint machines
within the next few months.
An operating loss at Provincial Papers, Abitibi's coated papers division,
wiped out a small operating profit earned by the rest of the company. The
company said a turnround at Provincial was one of its top priorities.
Abitibi said that its balance sheet remained strong, with a debt-to-capital
ratio of 30 per cent. Cash reserves increased by CDollars 100m last year and
cash-flow had been improved by asset sales and belt-tightening.

FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Svenska Handelsbanken tumbles
39%

SVENSKA Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's leading commercial banks, suffered a
39 per cent drop in profits to SKr2.77bn (Dollars 470m) for 1991, the bank
announced yesterday.
The main cause for the setback has been the increase in credit losses which
climbed to SKr3.188bn, or 1.1 per cent of loan volume, from SKr623m, or 0.3
per cent, in 1990.
The bank said that SKr455m of the losses stemmed from loans to the finance
company Gamlestaden.
Mr Arne Mortensson, chief executive, said he expected credit losses to be
lower this year but he would not make a profit forecast for 1992.
The bank said that before taking account of credit losses there was a 15 per
cent improvement in profits to SKr5.96bn. Total income was SKr11.5bn, a
record figure which after interest was 30 per cent better than in 1990.
Despite reduced earnings, Handelsbanken is lifting its dividend to SKr4.75
per share from SKr4.50 in 1990.
Return on capital after deductions declined to 11.3 per cent from 22.2 per
cent, but the bank pointed out that this was above the average for the
Swedish banks. It added that the profit per share (after extraordinary
items) fell to SKr8.90 from SKr19.22 in the previous year.
Postipankki, Finland's post office bank, suffered a loss of FM135m (Dollars
30.5m) last year compared with a FM35m profit in 1990. The main cause of the
deficit was the FM675m of credit losses, which amounted to 0.72 per cent of
the bank's loan volume.
However, the bank's debt-equity ratio of 10.6 per cent was better than a
year earlier.
The bank said Finland's deep recession would cast a shadow over its
activities during this year. Although there were signs of an improvement,
credit losses would continue to be exceptionally high in 1992, it added.

<TEXT>
OCE-van der Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment group, is to
raise its dividend for the first time in seven years after posting a rise of
nearly 20 per cent in 1991 net profit.
Net profit increased from Fl 85.7m (Dollars 46.3m) in 1990 to Fl 100.9m last
year, in line with the company's provisional January forecast of Fl 101m.
Oce, which described 1991 as an excellent year, said it would raise the
dividend to Fl 2.25 per share from Fl 2.00, the level at which it had been
held since 1985.
The company predicted that profit would show additional growth in 1992,
provided there was no further weakening in the investment climate. Oce's
financial year runs from December to November.
News of the higher dividend and profit forecast pushed Oce's shares up by Fl
3.10, or 4.4 per cent, to close at a 12-month high of Fl 73.50 on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
Group sales rose 11 per cent to Fl 2.58bn, mainly due to the launch of
updated products such as two high-volume copiers. The acquisition in August
of Bruning, a US design engineering company, accounted for around 2
percentage points of the sales rise.
The Bruning acquisition has given Oce around 20 per cent of the design
engineering market in the US. The Dutch company said it expected to reach
the break-even point in the US during 1992.
Overall sales in the office systems sector rose by 15 per cent last year,
outstripping a 6 per cent increase in design engineering. Oce noted that its
design engineering activities faced weak economic conditions on most markets
except Germany. It said its new 'plain paper' copiers had largely
compensated for the market shift away from 'diazo' copiers.

battle over Perrier

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outcome of the first round in the legal battle over the ownership of
Perrier, the mineral water group, hung in the balance last night when a
French judge said he would delay his judgment until later this week.
Mr Gilles Ray, president of the commercial court at Nimes in southern
France, is considering a case lodged by Nestle, the Swiss food group which
is mounting a FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid for the French mineral
water company in conjunction with Banque Indosuez of France.
Nestle has asked the court to freeze the voting rights on the 35 per cent
stake in Perrier controlled by Exor, the French property group for which the
Agnelli family of Italy is in the throes of a FFr5.6bn friendly bid.
Nestle, which last month secured a temporary injunction on the Exor votes,
also wants the freeze to apply to Societe Generale, the French bank allied
to Exor.
Exor, whose chairman, Mr Jacques Vincent, also chairs Perrier, is fighting
against the case which began yesterday in a court room packed with employees
from the mineral water company.
This is the first in a series of cases which could be critical in
determining the final outcome of the battle for Perrier. Next week,the Paris
commercial court will decide whether to invalidate the recent purchase of
13.8 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the French sugar group in which the
Agnellis also hold a stake.
Unless Nestle succeeds in invalidating the voting rights of either Exor or
Saint Louis it has no hope of winning control of Perrier given that together
the two French groups control nearly 49 per cent of its quarry.
French food group BSN is to sell a 67 per cent stake in brewery Henninger
Hellas to Greek wine company Boutari. Under the deal,Boutari will distribute
BSN's beer and mineral water brands in Greece. BSN will keep a 19.5 per cent
stake in Henninger.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: European plumbing awaits Wolseley touch -
The Midlands-based group's expansion plans after the Brossette buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Wolseley, the Midlands-based heating and plumbing distributor, decided
to investigate France, its two-man acquisition team prepared a short list of
possible takeover candidates. Written beside Brossette, France's leading
heating and plumbing supplier, was a single word: Bullseye.
Some 18 months later, and about six months after Brossette was put up for
sale by the Brossette family, Wolseley is paying FFr931m (Pounds 95m) for
the French company. The acquisition, to be paid partly in shares, will push
Wolseley's market capitalisation over Pounds 900m.
It is a tidy deal. Brossette and Wolseley both mainly supply trade customers
in their respective markets. Both rely on service and have started to
introduce branded products. They have also invested heavily in computer
systems to improve distribution.
Analysts are divided as to whether the takeover will accelerate Wolseley's
earnings in the short term. Pre-tax profits are expected to remain static at
Pounds 80m in the year to end-July, but most agree Wolseley now has the
opportunity to extend its leadership of the UK and US markets to France, and
possibly further into Europe.
Expansion, and the new European focus, add extra chips when Wolseley
bargains about costs with its suppliers.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, says: 'We genuinely don't think this will do
much to our earnings stream over the next two or three years. But if we were
talking in ten years time, I can't see how this can fail to add to our
value.'
Mr Lancaster joined Wolseley in 1961, when the company was mainly involved
in manufacturing. As central heating increased in popularity in the 1960s,
Wolseley developed a branch network and became known as a specialist
distributor of central heating supplies.
In the 1970s it moved into plumbing distribution and built up the 211-branch
Plumb Centre network. It has also moved into building distribution, through
its 72-branch Builder Centre chain.
Wolseley then went to the US, acquiring the eighth largest building supplies
distributor, Ferguson Enterprises, which is now number one.
Mr Lancaster, who took over as chairman from his father in 1976, is
dismissive of 1980s short-termism and points to his handwritten profit and
loss accounts which detail the company's progress over the last 30 years.
'If you have ideas above your station you're dead in the water. This is not
a fancy business,' he says.
Wolseley's optimism for Europe is based on two premises; European markets
for plumbing and heating supplies will become more integrated and Wolseley's
takeover strategy, successful in the US, can be repeated in a non-English
speaking environment.
Wolseley launched its European ambitions about three years ago, before
recession hit earnings in the UK and US. During the 1980s it was faced with
a maturing UK market. Yet its US acquisitions, Ferguson and Familian, were
adding branches and increasing turnover by more than 15 per cent annually.
'The UK is too small compared to the US. One of the attractions of Europe is
that we now have the prospect of strongly growing our US side and strongly
growing in Europe too,' Mr Lancaster says.
Wolseley also needed to respond to moves among its suppliers. Companies like
Blue Circle, Pilkington and Steetley were already in continental Europe, or
preparing European strategies. Wolseley wanted to move in tandem with these
suppliers so it could remain on the same footing.
Brossette is a well established company, with 176 branches throughout
France. It is expected to announce pre-tax profits of at least FFr101.4m for
1991, compared with the Pounds 40m operating profits made by Wolseley's UK
distribution business.
The takeover will mirror Wolseley's US acquisitions. A senior manager will
join Brossette as Wolseley's contact man, but the French company will remain
largely independent.
Mr Pierre Brossette is staying on as president, at least for the next few
years. 'We've made it very clear to the French we will never put an English
guy in to run them,' Mr Lancaster says.
There will be some changes as the companies become familiar with each
other's operations. Brossette is weak around Paris and a new Belgian
operation may be developed further.
'They have expanded very rapidly in the last three or four years and they
haven't yet got that sorted out, so I hope we can help them there.'
Europe's markets for heating and plumbing supplies are diverse. Companies
like Wolseley and Brossette have built leading positions in the UK and
France, but the German and Spanish markets are more localised.
Although suppliers are thinking about the unified European market, there is
still little cross-over among suppliers even for France and the UK. And
standards on heating and plumbing equipment are not yet standardised.
As these markets become more integrated during the next 10 years, costs
should come down and companies which depend on efficient distribution and
service will be able to penetrate the more localised markets.
Lower costs will help lift Brossette's margins, which at 4 per cent fall
below the 7 to 10 per cent Wolseley generates in the UK. The main reason for
the difference is France's higher labour costs. Mr Lancaster hopes
Brossette's margins will increase to about 6 per cent. But he admits this
will take several years.
Wolseley's wider European strategy remains undecided. The company will
obviously concentrate on Brossette in the immediate future before looking
further afield. Brossette has already investigated opportunities in Spain.
'Spain is a more fragmented market as more business is done direct with the
manufacturer. But specialisation will come because it is the best way to
manage a market. As places like Spain develop, I think we can be the
pioneers,' Mr Lancaster says.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drugs cleared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETA AGONISTS, a class of asthma drugs attacked last year for possible
deadly side effects, were yesterday given a clean bill of health by the UK
Committee on Safety and Health of Medicines.
The news gave Glaxo a boost ahead of its interim figures tomorrow - the
company dominates UK sales of beta agonists with its products Ventolin and
Serevent. Glaxo's shares rose 8p to 848p.
Other companies selling them include Schering Plough of the US, Ciba-Geigy
of Switzerland and Astra of Sweden.
The CSM report runs counter to evidence revealed in Canadian studies last
year which seemed to link the use of beta agonists with the deaths of some
asthma sufferers.
The controversy is likely to be revived shortly when the latest set of
results from the Canadian studies are published. Doctors expect them to
repeat the findings first publicised last year.
The CSM report says 'the evidence does not suggest that the use of beta
agonists is associated with asthma mortality'. It found that the death rate
per 100,000 people from asthma was the same as 10 years ago, despite a
trebling of the number of prescriptions in that time.
It nevertheless recommends changes in the wording on the data sheets, which
doctors use when prescribing drugs. 'Patients should be warned against
repeatedly increasing the prescribed dose of a beta agonist without medical
advice,' it says.
Allen &amp; Hanburys, a Glaxo subsidiary, said it would examine its data sheets
'to ensure consistency with the CSM's recommendations'.
Dr Michael Rudolph, of Ealing Hospital, London, a member of the
International Asthma Council - a newly-formed group concerned about possible
dangers of the class of drugs - said yesterday: 'Many people feel that beta
agonists have been useful, but patients can over-use their medication'.
In 1989 the National Health Service spent Pounds 217m, or 8 per cent of its
drugs budget, on treatments for the country's 3m asthmatics. The US Food and
Drug Administration is still evaluating the class of drugs in the light of
the Canadian and other studies.

<TEXT>
GPG, the London-based investment company managed by Sir Ron Brierley, the
New Zealand entrepreneur, yesterday said it had acquired just over 16 per
cent of the shares of Australian Consolidated Investments.
The announcement fuelled speculation that GPG would bid for ACI, which owns
50 per cent of National Brewing Holdings, formerly the brewing arm of Mr
Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings.
ACI also owns 96 per cent of Weeks Petroleum, an Australian oil company
which has royalty rights over oil produced by Broken Hill Proprietary from
the Bass Strait, off Australia's south coast.
However, ACI is in the process of selling its share in National Brewing to
Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer which owns the remaining 50 per cent.
Weeks has also announced plans to float its Bass Strait royalty rights to
raise ADollars 220m (Pounds 94.2m).
Analysts said GPG might seek to prevent ACI disposing of its two principal
assets by bidding for the group, which is capitalised at about ADollars
130m. ACI has also attracted interest from Nycal, a US oil company which has
said it expects to make an announcement shortly. Gulf Resources and Chemical
Corporation, a Nycal subsidiary, said recently that it had tried to acquire
an interest in Weeks' Bass Strait royalties.
ACI, formerly Bell Resources, was once a listed vehicle for Mr Robert Holmes
a Court, the entrepreneur who died in 1990.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Head of Amstrad's French connection calls
it a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the UK-based consumer electronics group which slipped into the red
for the first time last year through the recession and the hiatus in the
personal computer market, suffers a fresh blow today with the departure of
Mrs Marion Vannier, head of the group's French company.
Mrs Vannier, now 42 and one of the most trusted associates of Mr Alan Sugar,
Amstrad's chairman, resigned as president-directeur general of the French
subsidiary and from the board of Amstrad late last week.
She had run Amstrad France for 10 years and had been established as one of
France's best known businesswomen. Until recently, Amstrad France was the UK
electronics concern's most important overseas subsidiary.
In the year to June 1991 the French offshoot contributed Pounds 66.3m to
Amstrad's worldwide revenues of Pounds 528m. Germany, buoyed by satellite
dish sales, contributed Pounds 96m and has now overtaken France as the most
significant overseas subsidiary.
In the first six months of the current year, the group as a whole incurred a
loss of Pounds 15.1m on sales of Pounds 196.1m.
Mrs Vannier said yesterday that she had not yet decided her next move but it
was certain that she would remain in business: 'It is what I know how to do
best'.
Her track record is impeccable. After moving in three years from junior
assistant to sales director of a French electrical distributor, she
established Amstrad France in 1982, building the business virtually
singlehanded.
The split with the company seems amicable on the surface with the Amstrad
board playing tribute to her years of loyal service. But it is clear that
the fiercely independent Mrs Vannier misses the freedom and excitement of
the company's early days when she ran the French operation from a tiny
office above a boulangerie on Sevres main road and when Mr Sugar allowed her
laisser faire in almost every aspect of company policy.
She said yesterday: 'I built the company up from nothing and I have given it
my best. Now the rules have changed and the management is different.
Decision making is becoming centralised in the UK.
'Furthermore, many of Amstrad's new products - satellite dishes, for example
 -are not suited to the French market'.
Games computers, an area from which Amstrad is withdrawing, were
particularly strong in the French market.
Divorced with a young family, Mrs Vannier sold her 500,000 Amstrad shares
last year at 40p a share to cover, the company said, personal expenses.
During 1991 Mr Sugar appointed Mr Bernard Steiner, formerly of Sansui
Electronics, to take charge of sales and marketing in mainland Europe and
Australia. Mr Steiner has now formally taken responsibility for managing
Amstrad France.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 3.3m rights and 11% rise at Porvair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORVAIR, the maker of microporous plastics for footwear, textiles and
industrial products, yesterday launched a Pounds 3.3m rights issue alongside
announcements of a profits increase and a move to the main market.
The 1-for-4 issue of 3.1m shares at 115p apiece is the group's first since
it returned to the USM in 1988 after a six-year absence. The share price
yesterday fell 5p to 136p.
Mr John Morgan - chairman and chief executive, who was part of the buy-out
team 10 years ago - said proceeds would be used for joint ventures in the
Far East involving the textile product Porelle. The money would also be used
for acquisitions to expand the industrial products division.
Pre-tax profit increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.51m) on
turnover of Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 15.5m) in the year to November 30.
Protection from the UK recession was derived from the 89 per cent of sales
exported, although sales to engineering companies and equipment makers were
adversely affected.
Earnings per share fell to 10.9p (11.6p) as the tax rate went up from 7 per
cent to 21 per cent. Mr Morgan said it would be nearer 30 per cent this
year. The final dividend is 2.2p for a total of 3.3p (3p).
Gearing rose slightly to about 35 per cent of Pounds 9.9m shareholders'
funds. Cash of nearly Pounds 400,000 was absorbed after Pounds 1.5m of
capital spending.
Of the move to the main market he said: 'We might look like schoolboys
wanting to play in the World Cup, but it's providing a foundation for
growth.' Dealings should start tomorrow.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Royal Insurance to sell Dutch arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Insurance has agreed to sell its Dutch operations for a net Pounds
166m to European Partners for Insurance Co-operation (Epic), a newly formed
three-way joint venture in which Royal has a one-third share. The other two
partners are Aachener und Munchener (AMB) of Germany and Fondiaria of Italy.
The cash raised will improve Royal's solvency margin - a rough measure of an
insurer's financial strength - by 5 percentage points to an estimated 34 per
cent.
It will also cut the group's gearing ratio by 11 percentage points, Royal
said. Analysts had been expecting a gearing ratio of 33 per cent at the
December 1991 year end.
However, Royal is still expected to cut its final dividend when it releases
annual results on Thursday next week, in spite of the benefit to the group's
finances from this deal and the Pounds 250m sale of an 18.8 per cent stake
in AMB last December. Royal's shares rose 2p to 232p yesterday.
Royal has been regarded as the weakest of the large UK composite insurance
groups. It said yesterday that the strategy of pursuing the alliance in
Europe was driven by Mr Richard Gamble, who became group chief executive on
January 1.
The deal recognised that Royal could not make the necessary investment to
take advantage of opportunities in Europe on its own.
Analysts said that even after the Epic deal Royal had to reduce the size of
the group and that further sales of businesses were likely.
Royal and its two partners in Epic have been in talks about the joint
venture since last autumn. Each is investing Pounds 59m in Epic's share
capital, and Epic will also borrow Pounds 34m.
Epic is buying Rodutch, which owns Royal's Dutch business Royal Nederland,
for Pounds 205m and Rodutch is to buy Royal Leven, Royal's Netherlands life
company, for Pounds 20m. At December 31, 1990, Royal Nederland and Royal
Leven had net assets of Pounds 66m giving Royal a Pounds 100m book profit on
the deal. Together the two businesses' net premiums were Pounds 190m in
1990.
The three partners in Epic aim to build it into a European business outside
their home markets which will also be able to attack the east European
market. The plan is to transfer other non-domestic operations to Epic.
Royal will put in its activities in Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Portugal
and Spain, which together have annual premiums of about Pounds 100m. AMB
will contribute businesses in Belgium and France.
If all these businesses were combined today, Epic would have annual premiums
of Pounds 450m.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Midland expected to omit dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND GROUP is unlikely to pay a dividend for the second half of 1991,
making it the first English clearing bank to omit a dividend since the
1930s. A year ago, it became the first bank since the Depression to cut its
dividend.
A formal decision will not be taken by the bank's board until next week,
when Midland is due to disclose its 1991 results. But executive management
is expected to recommend that no dividend be paid, and a payment may be
impossible in any case.
'It is difficult to see how Midland can pay a dividend,' said a financier
with an intimate knowledge of the company. 'It does not have the
distributable reserves.'
Under company law, companies can only pay dividends out of their
distributable reserves. At June 30, Midland's distributable reserves were
just Pounds 53m.
Analysts believe Midland suffered a bad debt charge in 1991 close to Pounds
1bn on its UK loans alone.
Its results are due on February 27 and brokers expect it to report a pre-tax
loss of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 140m for the year.
If the more pessimistic analysts are correct, Midland's distributable
reserves would be wiped out, making it impossible to pay any dividend.
Midland's dividend dilemma is a reflection of the severity of the current
recession, which has placed many borrowers in difficulties and forced banks
to make huge provisions to cover the risk of bad debts.
None the less, Midland's balance sheet remains strong by international
standards. Its Tier 1 or core capital is thought to be equal to more than 5
per cent of its assets, which is well above the minimum level set by the
Bank of England.
Last year, Midland appointed a new chairman, Sir Peter Walters, and a new
chief executive, Mr Brian Pearse.
Unlike most companies, Midland does not divide its annual dividend between
an interim and final payment. Instead it normally pays two interim
dividends, though the second-half interim is the equivalent of most
companies' final payments.
It made a first interim payment, of 1.7p, in respect of the first six months
of the year. So even if it did not make a second payment, it would remain on
the dividend list and its shares could continue to be held by all investment
funds.
Midland's shares closed up 5p yesterday at 232p.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Lilley opens way for Redland's bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, the UK trade and industry secretary, yesterday opened the
way for Redland to pursue its Pounds 629m contested bid for rival UK
building materials group, Steetley.
An opposing plan to merge the British brick, clay roof tile and concrete
product businesses of Tarmac and Steetley was referred for investigation by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Lilley said an investigation into the Redland offer could still go ahead
if the company was unable to provide satisfactory undertakings to dispose of
brick and clay roof tile plants in markets where it would have a dominant
position. Redland has offered to sell its brick works at Cranleigh in Surrey
and Tilmanstone in Kent as well as the Steetley clay tile plants at Keele
and Knutton in Staffordshire should its bid succeed.
It is thought that the undertakings will be enough to persuade Mr Lilley to
allow the offer to proceed. Redland and Steetley together control 46 per
cent of the national clay roof tile market and 23 per cent of brick
production in south east England.
Some stock market analysts were surprised that Mr Lilley treated the two
merger proposals differently, since both would affect the ownership of a
large part of the UK brick and clay roof tile industry.
Mr Andrew Melrose, construction analyst for Nomura, the Japanese securities
house, said: 'This is a late Christmas present for Redland. Its bid will now
be resolved before the MMC can complete its investigation of the
Tarmac/Steetley joint venture.'
Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's chief executive, said Tarmac and Steetley had
discussed the possibility of giving similar undertakings on disposals but
had been unable to reach agreement with the Office of Fair Trading.
Tarmac and Steetley between them have 39 per cent of the clay tile market,
almost 80 per cent of brick production capacity in north east England and
approaching 50 per cent of brick capacity in south west England.
The large combined turnovers of Steetley and Tarmac mean their joint venture
should have been considered by the European Commission. Sir Leon Brittan the
EC's competition commissioner last week, however, agreed to refer the merger
back to British authorities because of the 'significant competition issues'
raised in the UK.
Mr Miles said last night that Steetley would continue to defend itself
strenuously against Redland's offer of 85 Redland shares for every 100
Steetley shares.
Following yesterday's announcements Redland's share price fell 5p to 473p,
valuing Steetley at Pounds 629m or 402p a share. Tarmac's share price fell
2p to 122p. Tarmac said it would consider its position in the light of the
MMC referral.
Redland said it had always expected it might have to give undertakings on
disposals. Sale of the four plants would have a minimal effect on the
benefits it expected to gain from takeover.

<TEXT>
With yesterday's decision to refer the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the options for restructuring Britain's
building materials industry have dramatically narrowed. A Tarmac-Steetley
solution looks dead in the water, perhaps the only outstanding question
being whether Tarmac turns to Ibstock Johnsen for an encore.
On the fairly safe assumption that Redland can now avoid a referral by
submitting undertakings, Steetley is left ever more vulnerable looking down
the barrel of a Pounds 620m bid. Its main defence is anticipated next week,
and will doubtless focus on asset value and Redland's ACT difficulties in an
effort to force up the terms. The market appears to have accepted, though,
that Redland's opening shot was pretty close to the mark. Admittedly there
has been a certain amount of buying interest for the likes of Blue Circle
and RMC since the bid was launched before Christmas - but this has been
highly selective and might well have passed Steetley by. At this stage the
main reason for Redland to sweeten its offer would be to win the
recommendation of the Steetley board.

FT  19 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's statement from Royal, AMB and Fondiaria was typically
continental in flavour, liberally spiced with co-operative sentiments and
infused with the spirit of the single market. But even in Europe idealism is
laced with self interest. In AMB's case the joint venture will be a useful
way of fending off the unwanted attentions of French insurer AGF; in Royal's
case the fact that its Dutch insurance operations are the only ones for the
moment to be injected into the joint holding company means it becomes the
grateful recipient of badly needed cash.
The noble sentiments expressed by the Epic partners would have sounded more
convincing if AMB and Fondiaria had given clearer commitments as to which
assets they plan to bring to the party. Nor is the three way boardroom split
a feature calculated to bolster market confidence. Rotating presidencies may
be acceptable practice for political organisations in Brussels; they are not
well known recipes for the success of companies based in Luxembourg.
This said, the real pressures on Royal are short term, not long term, and
the company badly needs the boost to its solvency ratio, which remains
unacceptably low at 34 per cent. The market is well aware that another means
of repairing the damage is to pass or cut the final dividend. A more
intriguing question, though, is whether a partner will now be found for
Royal Life. After yesterday pride will no longer be a problem; and the boost
to Royal's balance sheet could be rather greater than from the European
deal.

FT  19 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: UK PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's public sector borrowing requirement also suggests Mr Lamont's
room for budgetary manoeuvre has grown. After December's awful figures, it
looked as if recession was hitting receipts so badly that it would undermine
the gilts market and limit the government's scope for an election-winning
fiscal package.
In the event, January's Pounds 3.6bn surplus shows the notoriously volatile
corporation tax receipts holding up well at Pounds 5.6bn. Income tax
receipts showed some signs of falling off through the effects of lower wage
settlements and rising unemployment, but that trend will only be clearly
visible in the next financial year. This year's PSBR should now come in at
around Pounds 12bn, a figure discounted by the market at the time of the
Autumn statement. Meanwhile, helped by sterling's strength, it has absorbed
a fairly heavy funding programme.
If Mr Lamont is preparing for tax cuts, there is not much to stop him being
hung for a sheep as a lamb and opting for an easing of Pounds 3bn or more.
The market should have no difficulty with a projected PSBR for 1992-93 of up
to Pounds 25bn provided it does not think the government risks
over-stimulating the economy in the short term. The danger is that it might
thereby limit the fall in inflation further out, a factor the gilts market
appears to have overlooked. With perhaps Pounds 2.5bn gross monthly issuance
expected next year whichever political party is in power, gilt traders will
have a wary eye on inflation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,555.9 (+14.9)
At least one thing is going Mr Norman Lamont's way. For the first time since
last November sterling yesterday closed just within its theoretical narrow
band against the D-Mark. That is bound to fuel hopes of an interest rate cut
before the election, possibly even before the budget. Yet sterling is still
vulnerable in spite of its new-found strength, and not just because its
present level appears based in part on assumptions of a Tory victory.
The UK currency has also risen on the back of a remarkable upsurge in the
dollar. That reflects the belief that US recovery will set in sooner than
previously expected, while the German economy is heading for a harder
landing. Yesterday the dollar broke through the technical barrier of
DM1.6350, which might suggest further upward scope. But the move was
prompted by a sharp burst of speculative Middle Eastern buying. Interest
differentials between Germany and the US are unlikely to narrow much, if at
all, in coming months. As long as the US recovery is not firmly established,
disenchantment with the D-Mark could prove premature. A recovery would force
sterling back down.
Admittedly, the market is in a mood to accommodate a pre-election UK rate
cut on the grounds it could make a Tory victory more likely. The mistake
would be to assume that sterling's present level leaves room for systematic
rate cuts after the election. A victorious Mr Neil Kinnock would have to
prove himself to the exchange market. A victorious Mr John Major would
presumably want to put the economy back in tandem with the political cycle.
That would call for the discipline of narrow ERM bands to take priority over
interest cuts. Doing neither, however, would allow sterling to rise above
its narrow band range. That could be the best course for a government bent
on offsetting today's fiscal laxity with monetary tightness later on, when
other European countries are cutting rates.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Palestinians will attend peace talks: Israel trades heavy
artillery fire with Hizbollah militia in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palestinians announced last night that they would attend next week's
negotiations in Washington despite anger over the arrest of two members of
their delegation.
Syria, Lebanon and Israel have already announced their acceptance of the US
invitation to the third round of negotiations opening on February 24.
Israel and Lebanon's Hizbollah militia traded heavy artillery fire yesterday
but the continuing violence failed to derail the Middle East peace process.
Gunners from Hizbollah, the Shia Moslem fundamentalist organisation, fired
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel yesterday in retaliation for Israel's
assassination of their leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi in south Lebanon on
Sunday. The rockets caused little damage but forced local people to take
refuge in bomb shelters.
Israel and its local militia allies responded with heavy shellfire from the
slice of southern Lebanon they occupy. Israel also launched another attack
by helicopters, this time on the home of a Hizbollah official. Local reports
said a five-year-old child was killed and at least six people were wounded.
Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, warned Israelis to expect more
Hizbollah attacks. Lt Gen Ehud Barak, the Israeli Chief of Staff, called on
the Lebanese government to bring Hizbollah under control. 'If there is not
quiet, those who disturb the quiet will have to pay a very high price,' he
said.
But Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, elected to succeed Sheikh Abbas Musawi as
Hizbollah secretary general, told mourners at the dead leader's funeral in
the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbeck: 'Israel is digging its own grave. We
will continue the march even if we are killed and our homes destroyed. We
will not abandon resistance.'
Palestinian delegates to the Middle East peace talks had earlier raised
doubts about their participation because of the arrest by Israeli security
forces of two of their negotiating team. Mr Mohammed Hourani and Mr Jamal
Shobaki, both academics from the occupied West Bank, have been accused of
organising unspecified 'terrorist actions'. They were arrested under
six-month detention without trial orders.
The action was attacked by the Palestinians as unwarranted harassment
designed to undermine negotiations.
However, Mr Yasser Abed Rabbou, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation's executive committee, later said after talks with Mr Farouk
al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, that Palestinians would join other
Arab parties in Washington next week.
With internal leadership elections in Israel's ruling Likud party due
tomorrow night, the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir has shown no inclination
to help in lowering the regional temperature.
He yesterday visited Ma'ale Adumim, the largest Jewish settlement in the
West Bank, to celebrate its elevation to city status. The prime minister
again defied US and Arab demands that Israel should freeze settlement
expansion.
He said. 'There is no doubt that following this city, other cities will
come.'

FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: A certain truth about business leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T J EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Akio Morita's DTI innovation lecture, and the surprise he expressed
that many UK high technology companies find themselves being led by
chartered accountants, has produced the expected response from the Institute
of Chartered Accountants (Letters February 15). Mr Davis seeks to explain
the difference in the normal pedigree of business leaders in the two
countries as being largely cultural.
What is undeniable is that in the post-Second World War period Japanese
industry has been more successful than British industry and, although the
causal link between accountants and relative lack of success in the UK is no
more proven than a similar link between engineers and the successes of
Japanese industry, it does give food for thought.
Consistently one of the most successful sectors of UK manufacturing has been
the chemical industry and here data from the last Chemical Industries
Association graduate recruitment survey may be of interest. In 1991, CIA
member companies recruited in excess of 500 engineers and scientists and but
four accountants (and not a single lawyer).
Equally, however, before one gets too anecdotal, there are certainly
examples where engineering enthusiasm appears to have bankrupted companies.
Hence the need for an appreciation of both fields by business leaders.
What, however, I believe to be a certain truth, is that it is far easier to
teach accountancy to engineers than to attempt the reverse.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mrs Johnson (Letters February 13) laments that it is difficult for
women over the age of 40 to find jobs in the UK and that this group could be
targeted to fill the supposed shortfall in the workforce arising from
demographic changes.
As a working woman with a vested interest (I am in my 30s), I wholeheartedly
agree - if, indeed, this is the sorry state of affairs.
However, I am also a mother of a 21-month-old daughter with another baby
expected soon. I, too, have made my own child care arrangements by employing
a young woman at a good wage for this full-time care. I am certainly
fortunate in receiving a salary which enables me to do this. But I do ask
that the government recognises the fact that I, like many other parents,
have contributed to the well-being of this country by creating a new job as
well as continuing in my own, which, after many years of investment in my
education and training, I am well qualified to do.
This point should not go unnoticed at a time when unemployment is increasing
all too rapidly and investment in new resources is restrained. Most
importantly, parents should be encouraged to continue on this path by being
granted relief on the cost of child-care. I do not call this 'wet-nursing'.
Rather, it is sound economic sense.

I was quite surprised to find, in a country with a well developed National

imagine who would make a rule which would discourage the delegation of tasks

Remove that little glitch and it looks to me like a workable arrangement.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Personal View: Three ways to free housing from the public
spending trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party's decision to consider redefining the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) to exclude funds raised for investment in
transport and housing highlights the dilemma facing those advocating more
public spending.
A sound economic and social case can be made for extra spending on housing
and transport. But scope for additional expenditure by any public sector
body is constrained by limits on the PSBR.
The dilemma is faced most starkly in housing, where repossessions,
homelessness and waiting lists for council housing are all increasing. These
are the symptoms of a crisis which has arisen because more than 1.5m rented
council homes have been sold over the past decade and not been replaced.
Most national housing organisations agree that an annual programme to build
100,000 affordable homes to rent is needed - more than twice the present
output. One way to finance that increase would be to use the capital
receipts from council house sales. A little less than Pounds 8bn is
available but under Treasury rules it is frozen in short-term investments.
The central problem is that, under present Treasury rules, spending the
receipts counts as public expenditure and increases the PSBR. This is
because the income from sales has been treated exactly like privatisation
proceeds and recorded as negative expenditure.
There are three possible routes out of the PSBR trap.
The first is to stop treating the receipts as if they were privatisation
proceeds. Council house sales are not the same as other privatisations: it
is not necessary to 'replace' BT but it is necessary to restore the supply
of rented housing. A decision could be made to start adding receipts
directly to each year's spending programme. This could be applied
retrospectively to use past receipts where they would not involve new
borrowing - the main part of the Pounds 8bn kept in short-term investments.
Second, a long-term strategy is needed which develops the capacity of
housing associations and local authorities to build more homes.
Housing associations have been in a relatively privileged position since the
1988 Housing Act which put them into the private sector for spending
purposes. Only the public subsidy received from the Housing Corporation, the
quango which distributes state grants to housing associations, counts
towards the PSBR: housing associations' private borrowing does not count
because it is not guaranteed by the Treasury.
It would not be hard to put the local authorities in a similar position to
the housing associations. This could be by using the 'ring-fencing' which
was introduced in 1989 to keep the authorities' housing accounts separate
from other council spending so that they cannot be subsidised from the poll
tax.
There is no macroeconomic reason why 'ring-fenced' housing revenue accounts
should be controlled by central government. If local authorities want to
increase spending or borrowing on housing, they should be free to do so - so
long as it is covered by revenue from housing.
The central government subsidy which backs local authority investment in
housing would continue to count as public expenditure, and contribute to the
PSBR. But investment decided locally should not, because it will be serviced
by raising rents or selling assets - or even borrowing against the actual
housing stock.
The purist will object to these two options because they involve changing
accounting conventions.
The third option would avoid this by creating independent agencies to own
and invest in local authority housing which would be technically outside the
public sector.
Councils would transfer stock to such an agency at the value of outstanding
loan debt. They could retain a strong influence over the agency through
membership of the board, combined with a 'golden share' to prevent the
agency selling off the stock. Tenants could be given all or a share of the
remaining positions.
The agency would be free to borrow, or invest from rents or asset sales.
Government control would be limited to the subsidy the agency receives which
would come via the local authority and, as with housing associations, would
still be regarded as public spending.
Agencies of this kind are responsible for a big proportion of social housing
investment in other European countries, where they are not classified as
part of the public sector - even where the local authority has a controlling
share.
Even in Britain, the present regime is not as tight as first appears. Local
authorities already have freedom to raise rents to invest from revenue (and
indeed about 10 per cent of capital spending is from revenue this year). In
Scotland, local authorities have the power directly to reinvest capital
receipts.
Now is a propitious time to relax controls, not just because investment is
urgently needed, but because the building industry is in recession and local
authorities are more debt-free than for many years. Council debt has fallen
by 50 per cent since 1975 and the net value of local authority housing stock
has been put as high as Pounds 130bn.
The arguments that investment controls are needed for macroeconomic reasons
or to temper demands on the building industry - always a thin case - have
even less validity at present. And these options are no more radical than
the government's plans to transfer hundreds of thousands of council homes to
new housing associations.
Whichever party wins the general election, one of the three options outlined
may be an attractive route to securing much-needed investment in affordable
housing.
John Perry is head of policy at the Institute of Housing.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: Rushdie, no happy ending - The wound opened
by the publication of The Satanic Verses has not yet healed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I have lost my freedom - my home, my family, my daily life. I want it
back.'
I suppose some Moslems, reading those words uttered by Mr Salman Rushdie,
the novelist, last week in his speech on the third anniversary of Ayatollah
Khomeini's fatwa condemning him to death, will have felt a grim
satisfaction. The rest of us, however, including many Moslems, must surely
be moved by the pathos of Mr Rushdie's situation, and the words which he
finds to express it.
His situation is a terrible one: physically, much preferable to that endured
until recently by Mr Terry Waite and other hostages, and no doubt also
psychologically better - Mr Rushdie after all can move about, even across
the Atlantic and back, and has access to a wide range of distractions - but
terrible all the same.
Nothing could be more understandable than his desire to see it ended, and he
is entitled to expect the British government to do what it can to reduce the
threat to him. Unhappily, though, there seems little prospect of its being
reduced to a point where it will be possible for him to lead a completely
open and normal life.
The argument about The Satanic Verses is one in which there is not much
pleasure for either side. If one takes Mr Rushdie's side, one can easily
slide into polemics against Islam or Moslems as such, increasing the sense
of grievance and humiliation that many Moslems undoubtedly feel about the
attitude of the western establishment towards them, especially in Britain.
And yet for anyone who takes liberalism seriously, defending Mr Rushdie is
an inescapable task.
In the first place he has to be defended against Khomeini's fatwa and its
consequences. Whatever the right thing to do about The Satanic Verses may
be, no liberal can entertain the idea that the death penalty should be
imposed on its author or publishers or translators; still less that murder
can acquire any kind of legitimacy in Britain by virtue of a death sentence
passed in absentia by a legal authority in Iran.
But for a liberal, saying that Mr Rushdie should not be killed is not
enough. The question is whether there is any principle justifying the
abridgement of his freedom of expression. Here the British establishment is
clearly wrong-footed by the existence of the law of blasphemy, which the
courts have ruled does not extend to offences against Islam. It is
impossible for Moslems not to see that ruling as discriminatory.
Historically, blasphemy was an offence against God, which a Christian
society had to suppress in order to avoid being collectively guilty of it.
The question that arises now is not that at all, but whether freedom of
expression on religious matters should be limited in the interests of
peaceful coexistence between different religious communities. Do we need an
offence of 'incitement to religious hatred', comparable to that of
'incitement to racial hatred'? Perhaps we do, but even under that heading a
case against The Satanic Verses would be difficult to sustain.
In any event, it is much easier to respect the feelings of Moslems who are
offended by the book than it is to accept the denigration of Mr Rushdie by
non-Moslems. They often seem to be venting a rightwing, philistine grudge,
with a hint of racial prejudice thrown in, against a successful left-wing
writer of Indian origin. He has failed, they seem to feel, to show
sufficient gratitude for his good fortune in being raised as a member of the
British establishment, and is now driven to accept protection from the state
he so intemperately criticised. One does not have to agree with all Mr
Rushdie's political judgments (many of which were neither consistent nor
profound) to find this line of argument contemptible.
Whoever declares The Satanic Verses 'unreadable' is making a comment not on
the book but on his or her own literacy. It is, admittedly, a book in which
few if any readers can hope to catch all the allusions without some help.
But it is, as Mr Rushdie himself has said, 'a serious novel' and also a
funny one. It is clever but, with hindsight, also very silly, for the author
chose to treat playfully, even scatologically, a subject which, as he well
knew, is for millions of people deadly serious.
Would he have written differently if he had known what would happen? Two
years ago he asked himself that question and replied: 'Truthfully I don't
know. Would I change any of the text now? I would not. It's too late.' True
enough. The novel exists now as a historical, and indeed a historic,
document. To alter its text would amount to tampering with the record, and
would also make the whole controversy unintelligible.
So what can be done? Can the fatwa be 'cancelled', as Mr Rushdie suggests?
Technically not. In legal terms a fatwa is simply an opinion or ruling given
by a learned authority. Only that authority could rescind it, and Khomeini
is now dead. But different authorities can give different rulings and,
especially in Shia Islam, it is admitted that the law needs constant
reinterpretation to suit changing circumstances. Indeed, the Shia student is
obliged to follow a living marja, or source of imitation. The trouble is
that politically no living scholar's pronouncements are likely to carry
anything like the same weight as Khomeini's.
The Iranian government takes the line that this is a religious matter in
which it cannot interfere. (That may be a less preposterous statement than
it sounds: in a theocracy, government is subject to divine law. The reverse
is not supposed to be true.) But Iran has exchanged pledges with the UK that
neither will seek to interfere with each other's laws. On that basis Britain
agreed to restore diplomatic relations in the autumn of 1990, but has yet to
raise them to ambassadorial level.
Both the British and Iranian governments say they would like to proceed to
this step, but the UK has so far held back, mainly because it suspects that
Iran has not fully abandoned its sponsorship of terrorism and assassination.
Iran has denied involvement in the murder of the Japanese translator and
attempted murder of the Italian translator of The Satanic Verses last July;
but French and Swiss police found evidence that Iranian diplomats were
involved in aiding and abetting the murder of Mr Shahpur Bakhtiar, a former
Iranian prime minister, in France last August.
Whether these actions were ordered personally by President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani may be doubted. All the evidence suggests that he is genuinely
anxious to improve relations with the west, or at least with Europe and
Japan.
But the record also shows that he was able to obtain the release of western
hostages in Lebanon by Iranian-supported groups, once he was convinced that
this was essential to the success of his policies. He should therefore be
able also to impose the closing down of the Iranian death squads, especially
if his supporters strengthen their position, as expected, in elections to
the Iranian Majlis (parliament) in two months. Foreign governments - not
only Britain - must keep telling him that this is essential if Iran is to be
fully accepted as a member of the international community.
Last Sunday's killing by the Israelis of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, one of Iran's
more co-operative proteges in Lebanon, will hardly have made it easier to
get that message across.

<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader of February 7 on Maxwell's pensions you say that 'the
pensions lobby' would argue against the principle of pension rights ranking
as secured creditors when the sponsoring business fails, because it does not
regard final salary pensions as deferred pay.
This assertion confuses two issues. Few people would argue with the
principle that the value of accrued pension rights - the members' stake in
the fund as you put it - could be described as deferred remuneration, but
that does not in itself resolve the complex question of the ownership of
surplus assets in balance of cost schemes.
As far as the ranking of pension rights in a liquidation or receivership is
concerned, even fewer would argue against the case for further enhancing the
overall security of members' retirement provision in occupational pension
schemes. In fact it is to be hoped that such a change in legislation may be
one positive development which may emerge from the disastrous consequences
of the Maxwell case.

Sir, Mr H R Wynne-Griffith (Letters, February 15) refers, in respect of the
Maxwell pension funds, to the situation in which banks appear to have title
to collateral received by them as security for loans where such collateral
was not in the ownership of the borrowers.
In these circumstances, why should not those banks and their employees
responsible for these transactions be charged with receiving or handling
stolen property?
